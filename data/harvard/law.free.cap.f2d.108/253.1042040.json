J. Sachs, sales manager of the appellant company, and Exhibits Nos. 1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-30\">Appellee offered no evidence and relied upon the filing date (November 22, 1935) of its application for the registration of its trade-mark to establish priority of use.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-31\">Appellant\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 is an invoice of Anthony J. Fries, \u201cGeneral Engraver and Stamp Cutter,\u201d of Cincinnati, Ohio, dated October 28, 1935, addressed to the appellant company, for \u201c1 Bottom Stamp\u201d and \u201c1 Insole Stamp\u201d of appellant\u2019s trademark \u201cPleasure Tred.\u201d Exhibit No. 2 is an order, dated January 8, 1936, for appellant\u2019s \u201cPleasure Tred\u201d shoes given by the Midwest Shoe Company of Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is indicated thereon that the shoes were to be shipped by the appellant company on February 15, 1936. Each of those exhibits was identified by the witness Longini.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-32\">The witness Longini testified that, as early as June 1935, Raymond R. Ratcliff, appellee, was aware that appellant had adopted and intended to use its trade-mark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>\u201cPleasure Tred.\u201d on its shoes. Relative to Exhibits Nos. 1 and 2, and appellant\u2019s first sales of shoes under its trade-mark, the witness testified on direct examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">\u201cQ. 6. How long have you been manufacturing Pleasure Tred? A. \u2022 Definitely, since October 28, 1935.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">\u201cQ. 7. By \u2018since October 28, 1935\u2019 what do you mean, that the shoe was completed at that time or that it was ready for production? A. Well, we decided on the name around May of 1935, and it takes a period of months to produce a line under a certain trade name. There is a lot of work to be done, lines to be developed, features to be incorporated in the line, and during that time we made various trips to see the trade, advising them of the new line which we were putting out under Pleasure Tred, and samples were completed and branded Pleasure Tred by October 28, 1935, and at that time the samples were shown under the brand Pleasure Tred, and our first sales began at that time definitely from samples.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">\u201cQ. 18. When were these shoes ready for sale? A. In working out the details for the line, we naturally had to work out our sole stamp and sock lining stamp, and through the artists of the Anthony J. Fries Company, maker of steel dies, we had the complete sock lining and sole stamp dies completed by October 28, 1935, at which time we naturally had our sock lining ready, and as soon as the stamp came in, we finished our samples.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">\u201cQ. 19. Mr. Longini, I hand you a piece of paper and ask you what it is? A. Well, this is an invoice of the Anthony J. Fries Company, General Engraver and Stamp Cutter, for our bottom stamp and insole lining stamp for our Pleasure Tred dies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">\u201cQ. 20. And that was delivered to you on October 28, 1935? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-11\">\u201cQ. 21. After the lining was completed, were the stamps immediately applied? A. Immediately, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-12\">\u201cQ. 22. After the stamp was applied, when did you start to sell those shoes? A. Well, the line was completed for sale of Spring shoes, but before going out with the line, it usually costs anywhere from $3000 to $4000 to develop a new line, and especially a new line as this was to be. There are many details to be worked out. We had been traveling on the Pleasure Tred proposition since the early part of May, in lining up our accounts, telling them about the new line and getting their reaction on the Pleasure Tred name, and then as the samples were completed, we made our second trip with the samples and started selling the shoes, and they were sold firstly from samples beginning around November 1, 1935.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-14\">\u201cQ. 23. You recall the name of the people you sold these shoes to? A. Well, the first bill of any consequence was sold to the Midwest Shoe Company of Minneapolis, Minnesota.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-15\">\u201cQ. 24. Do you recall the date of that? A. First sale was made January 8, 1936.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-16\">\u201cQ. 25. Mr. Longini, what is this ? A. This is an order blank for an order taken by me on January 8, 1936, in Chicago, at the National Shoe Show, sold to the Midwest Shoe Company of Minneapolis, Minnesota, of our Pleasure Tred line, giving them the privilege to sell our Pleasure Tred shoes in Minneapolis, manufactured and made by us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-17\">jjt \u00edj\u00ed 2{\u00ed i|&lt; \u00edfc Sjt</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-18\">\u201cQ. 29. Will you state whether or not you have continued to manufacture and sell the line of shoes termed Pleasure Tred? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-19\">\u201cQ. 30. Are you still manufacturing and selling that shoe? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-20\">\u201cQ. 31. Have you attempted to have this trade mark registered? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-21\">\u201cQ. 32. Have you been successful? A. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-22\">Relative to Exhibit No. 2, the witness testified on cross-examination that, although the order for \u201cPleasure Tred\u201d shoes was taken January 8, 1936, the shoes were not then ready for delivery. He then testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-23\">\u201cXQ. 36. Then at that time you had no shoes bearing the name Pleasure Tred manufactured? A. Yes, we had made some shoes\u2019 previous to that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-24\">\u201cXQ. 37. Were there any sold? A. Yes. To the Spiegel, May, Stern Company, of Chicago, Illinois.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-25\">\u201cXQ. 38. Have you any record showing that to be the fact? A. Well, these were samples ordered in August and shipped the end of October, 1935.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-26\">\u201cXQ. 39. You, however, have nothing to show that these shoes bear the mark <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Pleasure Tred? A. Yes, I can get the details at the office. I have the letter written to Spiegel, May, Stern Company, stating that we were shipping them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\">\u201cXQ. 40. You previously stated that the order to the Midwest Shoe Company was the first, did you not? A. I stated it was the first sale of any size.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">\u201cXQ. 41. Then you were in error that this was the first sale, were you not? A. No, I stated that the first bill of any size was sold to the Midwest Shoe Company of Minneapolis, Minnesota, but you asked me whether we had made any Pleasure Tred shoes before that time. We had made samples, which are shoes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\u201cXQ. 42. They were usually not sold? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">\u201cXQ. 43. Please state when these samples were sold. A. In Chicago, approximately in July or August.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">\u201cXQ. 44. In July or August of what year ? A. 1935.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">\u201cXQ. 45. How were these shoes stamped? A. Pleasure Tred. Unquestionably there is a misunderstanding.\u2014 When I say a bill is sold and when the shoes are shipped. When a bill is sold, it does not mean that the shoes are to be shipped on that very day. We manufacture numerous shoes according to order, and sometimes it may be six or eight weeks before delivery is made. Now when these samples were sold by me to Spiegel, May-Stern Company, they were not shipped until October, until these dies were completed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Appellant\u2019s witness Sachs did not testify relative to the date of first use by appellant of its trade-mark \u201cPleasure Tred\u201d on its shoes. The purport of his testimony is that Mr. Raymond R. Ratcliff, appellee, had knowledge of appellant\u2019s \u201cPleasure Tred\u201d line of shoes in the early part of November 1935; that the only comment made by Mr. Ratcliff at that time was: \u201cI think you have something there\u2019,\u2019; and that no mention was made by Mr. Ratcliff that he had adopted or intended to use\" a trade-mark similar to appellant\u2019s \u201cPleasure Tred\u201d mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">The Examiner of Trade-mark Interferences was of opinion that the testimony of the witness Longini was sufficient to establish that appellant had used its trademark on its goods as early as October 28, 1935, and, accordingly, sustained appellant\u2019s petition for the cancellation of the registration of appellee\u2019s trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">In reversing the decision of the Examiner of Trade-mark Interferences, the Commissioner of Patents stated in his decision that a trade-mark registration \u201cshould not be lightly cancelled\u201d; that the burden was upon appellant to establish that it had used its trade-mark on its goods prior to the filing date (November 22, 1935) of appellee\u2019s application for the registration of its mark; that \u201cwhere cancellation must rest upon the testimony of a single witness such testimony should at least be clear, consistent and free from uncertainty\u201d; and that the testimony of Mr. Longini was not clear, consistent, and free from uncertainty. The commissioner then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-14\">\u201cKnowing respondent\u2019s filing date, it is almost inconceivable that petitioner\u2019s counsel, if he thought it possible to prove a sale in October, 1935, would not have attempted to do so. Not only did counsel make no such attempt on his direct examination of Mr. Longini, but even after the witness had stated on cross-examination that such a sale had occurred no effort was made on re-direct to explain counsel\u2019s oversight or to supply details of the purported sale. Besides contradicting his previous testimony that petitioner\u2019s first sale took place in January, 1936, Longini\u2019s assertion that a sale was made in October, 1935, is inconsistent with his statement on direct examination that the dies with which the trade-mark was stamped on petitioner\u2019s shoes were not received until October 28. That left petitioner just three days in which to complete, pack, and ship the order before \u2018the end of October.\u2019 and while the exercise of such haste was, of course, possible, it seems sufficiently improbable to require explanation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-15\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s case was simple to prove, and doubts created by its own record, or by the absence therefrom of material evidence that was within its control, must be resolved against petitioner. Applying that rule, I do not think the proofs submitted entitle petitioner to the relief here sought.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-16\">It was alleged by appellant in its petition for cancellation that appellee was not entitled to use the trade-mark \u201cPla-Zure\u201d on</p>\n<p id=\"b315-17\">Tred</p>\n<p id=\"b315-18\">shoes on the date it filed its application for registration (November 22, 1935) for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>reason that appellant, as early as October 1935, had adopted and used its trade-mark \u201cPleasure Tred\u201d on shoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">In view of the state of the record, the precise question presented for our determination is whether the evidence submitted by appellant is sufficient to establish that it had adopted and used its trade-mark on its goods prior to appellee\u2019s filing date\u2014 November 22, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">It will be observed, from the quoted testimony that the witness Longini stated that appellant had been manufacturing \u201cPleasure Tred\u201d shoes \u201cDefinitely, since October 28, 1935.\u201d When asked on direct examination to explain what he meant by such statement, he said that \u201csamples were completed and branded Pleasure Tred by October 28, 1935, and at that time the samples were shown under the brand Pleasure Tred, and our first sales began at that time definitely <em>from samples\u201d </em>(italics ours); that the stamps for affixing its trade-mark to its shoes were delivered to appellant on October 28, 1935; and that the \u201cstamps\u201d were immediately applied to samples. In reply to the question: \u201cAfter the stamp was applied, when did you start to sell those shoes?\u201d the witness stated \u201cthey were sold firstly <em>from samples </em>beginning around November 1, 1935.\u201d (Italics ours.) When asked if he recalled the name of anyone to whom such shoes were sold, he replied: \u201cWell, the first bill of any consequence was sold to the Midwest Shoe Company of Minneapolis, Minnesota.\u201d He then stated that such sale was made on January 8, 1936. It will be recalled that appellant received an order (Exhibit No. 2), dated January 8, 1936, from the Midwest Shoe Company for \u201cPleasure Tred\u201d shoes, the shoes to be shipped February 15, 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">It is apparent that on direct examination the witness was testifying with regard to sales made as a result of displaying sample shoes. He did not testify on direct examination that appellant had, at any time, sold any sample shoes bearing its trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">On cross-examination, however, the witness stated that samples of appellant\u2019s \u201cPleasure Tred\u201d shoes were sold to the Spiegel, May, Stern Company of Chicago, Illinois, in July or August 1935, and that such samples bearing the trade-mark \u201cPleasure Tred\u201d were shipped to that company \u201cthe end of October, 1935.\u201d When asked if he had anything \u201cto show\u201d that those samples bore the trade-mark \u201cPleasure Tred,\u201d the witness replied: \u201cYes, I can get the details at the office. I have the letter written to Spiegel, May, Stem Company stating that we were shipping them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-11\">Neither the letter referred to by the witness nor any other documentary evidence relative to the sale and shipment of the sample shoes bearing the \u201cPleasure Tred\u201d trade-mark to the Spiegel, May, Stern Company was introduced by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">Counsel for appellant argues that \u201cgreat probative force\u201d should be given the testimony of the witness Longini as to the sale and shipment of the sample shoes to the Spiegel, May, Stern Company, because it was adduced on cross-examination, and that, because counsel for appellee did not request the witness to produce the letter referred to in the testimony, the testimony of the witness \u201cmust be accepted as conclusive\u201d; whereas, counsel for appellee argues that, due to the failure of appellant to produce the letter referred to by the witness, the fair presumption is that had it been produced it would have been detrimental to appellant\u2019s case. In support of his contention, counsel for appellee calls attention to the following from Jones on Evidence, Fourth Edition, vol. 1, \u00a7 19, page 49: \u201c\u00a7 19. Withholding evidence. \u2014 There is a recognized legal presumption that a party will produce evidence which is favorable to him if such evidence exists and is available. And the mere withholding or failing to produce material evidence which is available and would, in the circumstances of the case, be- expected to be produced, gives rise to a natural inference \u2014 less forceful than that arising from the destruction, fabrication or suppression of evidence in which other parties have a legal interest but constantly acted upon by the courts \u2014 that such evidence is held back because it would be unfavorable or adverse to the party withholding it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-13\">The rule relative to the \u201cFailure to Produce Most Satisfactory Evidence\u201d is stated in 22 C.J. \u00a7 55, page 115, as follows: \u201cWhere it is apparent that a party has the power to produce evidence of a more explicit, direct, and satisfactory character than that which he does introduce and relies on, it may be presumed that if the more satisfactory evidence had been given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>it would have been detrimental to him and would have laid open deficiencies in, and objections to, his case which the more obscure and uncertain evidence did not disclose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">See Clifton v. United States, 4 How. 242, 45 U.S. 242, 11 L.Ed. 957; Backus v. Owe Sam Goon, 9 Cir., 235 F. 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Testimony adduced on proper cross-examination is to be regarded as though it were adduced on direct examination. . However, if the cross-examination is extended beyond its proper scope, the cross-examiner makes the witness his own and is bound by undisputed testimony thus adduced. 70 C.J. \u00a7 790, page 618, and cases cited in footnotes thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In the instant case it is clear that the cross-examination of - the witness Longini was not extended beyond its proper scope. Accordingly, the testimony of the witness that sample shoes bearing the trade-mark \u201cPleasure Tred\u201d were shipped the \u201cend of October, 1935,\u201d should be considered as though adduced on direct examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the rule hereinbefore stated, relative to the failure to produce the most satisfactory evidence, is here applicable, and that had the documentary evidence to which reference was made on cross-examination by the witness Longini been produced it would have been detrimental to appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">In conclusion, we think it proper to observe that counsel for appellant must have known that, at the conclusion of the direct examination of appellant\u2019s witnesses, appellant had failed to make a case. It is a fair assumption then, we think, that, had appellant made a sale of sample shoes to the Spiegel, May, Stern Company of Chicago, Illinois, and shipped sample shoes bearing the trade-mark \u201cPleasure Tred\u201d to that company the \u201cend of October, 1935,\u201d such fact would have been brought out on the direct examination of the witness Longini had counsel for appellant been informed of such sale and shipment.' Due to its importance in this case, it is inconceivable that, had such shipment been made, counsel for appellant would not have been informed of that fact prior to the direct examination of appellant\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">We are of opinion that the Commissioner of Patents reached the right conclusion, and his decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
