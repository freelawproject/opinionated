See Crews v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., 89 F.2d 412. They were reversed and remanded to the Board for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-25\">In the original proceeding before the Board the parties stipulated that the cost of drilling, equipping, and operating the wells, and certain miscellaneous expenses incident to the production of oil and gas amounted to $849,544.37. At the hearing before the Board after the remand the parties stipulated that such sum was composed of the following items:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-8\">Operating Expense:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\">Production Expense....... $272,042.56</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-10\">General Overhead Expense 31,107.34</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AId\">Depreciation on Equipment 110,888.17</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-11\">Total Operating Expense .............. <em>$414,038.07</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjJ\">Development Expense (drilling costs) ..............'.. $387,982.80</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-13\">Equipment ...... $158,411.67</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-14\">Less: Depreciation sustained 110,888.17 47,523.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-26\">Total ................ $849,544.37</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-27\">The taxpayers deducted the development expenses and related depreciation in computing their taxable net income from the property for the year 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-28\">The Board of Tax Appeals held that in computing the net income of the taxpayers from the property for the purpose of applying the 50 per cent limitation contained in Section 114(b) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 114 note, the development expenses and related depreciation should not be deducted from the gross income from the property. This resulted in a depletion allowance of $333,700.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-29\">The Commissioner contends that in computing the depletion allowance the development expenses and related depreciation should be deducted in arriving at the net income from the property, and that the proper computation is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-30\">Gross Income from the property ................ $1,213,456.09</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-31\">, Less: Operating and Development Expense..... 849,544.37</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-32\">Net Income from the property ............ $ <em>363,911.72</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-34\">50 per cent of the net income from the property equals........... $ 181,955.86</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-35\">27% per cent of the gross income from the property equals .............. 333,700.42</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-36\">The conflict of authority with respect to the meaning of the phrase \u201cnet income of the taxpayer (computed without allowance for depletion) from the property\u201d in Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>tion 114(b) (3) of the Revenue Act of 1928<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has been set at rest by the decisions of the Supreme Court in Helvering, Commissioner v. Wilshire Oil Company, 60 S. Ct. 18, 84 L.Ed.-, and F. H. E. Oil Company v. Commissioner, 60 S.Ct. 26, 84 L.Ed. -, which 'sustain the contentions of the Commissioner in the instant cases. Hence, the proper depletion allowance is $181,955.-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">The decisions are reversed and the causes are remanded, with instructions to redetermine the tax in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-22\"> See Ambassador Petroleum Co. v.
