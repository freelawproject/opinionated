His further extension to August 25th was invalid since it was not granted within thirty days after the taking of the appeal. Long v. United States, 9 Cir., 90 F.2d 482, certiorari denied 302 U.S. 730, 58 S.Ct. 55, 82 L.Ed. 564. We have nevertheless examined the bill of exceptions in the light of appellant\u2019s argument, but find no error therein which affected his substantial rights. See Gleckman v. United States, 8 Cir., 80 F.2d 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-22\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
