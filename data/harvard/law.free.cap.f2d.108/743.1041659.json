Riggs Nat. Bank and Wehner v. Riggs Nat. Bank,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the lower court, on July 7, 1937, adjudged that Riggs National Bank was liable in the sum of $178,045.49 with interest; appointed trustees to receive that sum for the plaintiffs and interveners in the two cases above-named, and for \u201call other Shoreham Building noteholders in like situation with said plaintiffs and interveners entitled to share therein * * Thereafter both cases were referred to the auditor of the court to determine, among other things, the rights of all persons to participate in the fund. Appellant, Washington Loan and Trust Company, .trustee under the will of Clarence B. Rheem, petitioned-'for the allowance of a claim to participate in the fund, as the holder of 127- notes, aggregating the principal sum of $126,500. The auditor recommended that the. claim be.disallowed for the reason that appellant had accepted notes secured by a trust deed upon the Shoreham Hotel, in substitution for the Shoreham Office Building notes; had cancelled the latter and extinguished them; consequently that they could not be made the basis of a valid claim. The lower court entered its order overruling appellant\u2019s exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report and recommendations; and decreed that the report be confirmed. This appeal is from that order and decree.</p>\n<p id=\"ADx\">It is well established in the District pf- Columbia that the findings of an auditor, concurred in by the court below, are presumptively correct and will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is clearly shown that there was obvious error in the application of the law therein, or a conclusion of fact unwarranted by the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">.The question to be determined is whether appellant is a \u201cShoreham Building note-holder in like situation\u201d with the plaintiffs and interveners in the Colby and Wehner cases entitled to share in the fund established in accordance with the decision in those cases. An examination of the fact shows that appellant is not in like situation. Appellant is, and for some time prior to January 7, 1931, had been, the trustee of the estate of Clarence B. Rheem, deceased. Eulalie Rheem Rowe, his widow, and Edmund D. Rheem, his son, are the sole beneficiaries under the trust; the former as life beneficiary and the latter as remainder-man. The trust <em>res </em>consisted in part of 127 notes, aggregating the principal sum of $126,500, secured by a deed of trust to Luther A. Swartzell and Edmund D. Rheem, upon the Shoreham Office Building in the City of Washington, D. C. Swartzell and Rheem were members of the firm of Swartzell, Rheem &amp; Hensey Company, which firm, under the terms of the trust, had power to collect interest and principal on the notes and to discharge the trust, when full payment had been made. On January 7, 1931, appellant discovered that this deed of trust had been released, although payment of the notes which it held had not been made. Thereupon, Alfred H. Lawson, Vice President of appellant, telephoned to Edmund D. Rheem \u2014 who was not only one of the two beneficiaries of the Rheem trust, but also Executive Vice President of the Swartzell Company \u2014 and told him that if the trusts had been released and paid, \u201cWe have got to have the money for them.\u201d To this Rheem replied \u201cI have not the money, but I <em>reinvested the proceeds of these notes in other notes.\u201d </em>and said he would send those other notes to Lawson. Thereafter, on January 12, 1931, one Brewer, an employee of the Swartzell Company, informed Lawson that Rheem was sick but that he, Brewer, had been instructed to deliver to Lawson the reinvestments of the notes that had been paid; and on January 13, 1931, Brewer delivered to Lawson notes of the Shoreham Hotel Corporation aggregating the sum of $215,000, of which $162,150 purported to be reinvestments of the proceeds of the Shoreham Office' Building notes. In fact, however, these notes, so delivered by Brew-er, were not reinvestments. Instead, they were in the custodial care of the Swartzell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Company; they were wrongfully and fraudulently abstracted by that Company from envelopes in which they were enclosed; and the taking and delivery to appellant were without the consent or knowledge of the true owners. Up to this point, perhaps, except for the dual capacity of Edmund D. Rheem \u2014 as beneficiary and as the Executive Vice President of the Swartzell Company \u2014appellant may have been in substantially \u201clike situation\u201d as the other noteholders. From this point on its situation varied materially, as will be seen from the following summary of evidence. Following the delivery of the notes to appellant by Brewer, Eulalie Rheem Rowe and Edmund D. Rheem, on January 15, 1931, sent to appellant a letter, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aval\">\u201cThe Washington Loan and Trust Company</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al9B\">\u201cTrustee of the Estate of Clarence B. Rheem</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">\u201cWashington, D.

C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-12\">\u201cWe are fully acquainted with the terms of the deed of trust securing said loan on the Shoreham Hotel, including the provisions thereof, authorizing the trustees to release the same upon the payment of the debts of Swartzell, Rheem and Hensey. <em>We have satisfied ourselves as to the security for these notes, and we relieve you of all responsibility for making this investment. </em>[Italics supplied]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-13\">\u201cVery truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-14\">\u201cEulalie Rheem Rowe \u201cEdmund D. Rheem.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-15\">Upon receipt of this letter of instruction, appellant accepted the notes of the Shoreham Hotel Corporation as a substitution in full for the Shoreham Office Building notes and as an investment for the estate of Clarence B. Rheem; and on January 16, 1931, cancelled and discharged the Shoreham Office Building notes;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but kept them in its own office instead of returning them to the Swartzell Company. On January 26, 1931, the last-named company filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy and was adjudged bankrupt. Thereafter, on or about March 30, 1931, appellant received from Eulalie Rheem Rowe and Edmund D. Rheem a letter, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-16\">\u201cThe Washington Loan and Trust Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af-\">\u201cTrustee Estate Clarence B. Rheem</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaT\">\u201cWashington, D.

Rheem, approved your acceptance of certain notes of the Shoreham Hotel Corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>tion, aggregating $162,150.00, purporting to be secured by first trust on part of Lot 6 in Square 2138 which were sent to you on or about January 13, 1931, by the office of Swartzell, Rheem &amp; Hensey Co. as an investment for said Estate of Clarence B. Rheem, deceased.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-4\">\u201cSince the delivery to you of these notes certain complications have arisen and we would request that you return the notes to the Trustees of the Estate of the Swartzell, Rheem &amp; Hensey Co., Bankrupt, in order that they may be distributed in accordance with the Court\u2019s instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-5\">\u201cYours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-6\">\u201c (s) Eulalie Rheem Rowe</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFy\">\u201c (s) Edmund D. Rheem.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1T\">And on April 13, 1931, appellant voluntarily surrendered the Shoreham Hotel Corporation notes to the trustees in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">\u2022 [4-6] It is well settled law that a sole beneficiary, or several or successive beneficiaries \u2014 all of whom consent and none of whom suffer from disability \u2014 may direct that the performance of the trust be arrested, modified, or even extinguished.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The applicable rule has been well stated by the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia as <em>follows:</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201cWhere the persons entitled to the whole beneficial interest are. in esse and sui juris, it is one of the first duties of a trustee to execute such conveyances of the legal estate as the cestuis que trustent shall direct.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is equally well settled that the beneficiaries of a trust who suffer from no disability and who have full knowledge of the facts and of their legal rights, may direct the trustees in the investment of trust funds and if losses are sustained they cannot be heard to complain.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There is even less reason for permitting a trustee, under the circumstances of the present case, to recoup losses, suffered as a result of the poor judgment or unlawful conduct of such beneficiaries, from funds set apart for the benefit of persons who were in no way responsible for such losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-16\">Appellant, in its brief, concedes that \u201cIf Edmund D. Rheem were attempting to assert herein a claim to participate pro rata with the other creditors * * * his conduct and actions would bar his right because \u2018he who comes in equity must come with clean hands.\u2019 \u201d It seeks to distinguish the other beneficiary, in this respect, but it is not necessary for us to determine-whether she was in <em>pari delicto </em>with Edmund D. Rheem. It is enough that she joined in the letter of instruction, which, as we have held, was sufficient \u2014 together with the acts of the trustee \u2014 to extinguish the debt arising from the Office Building notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-17\">Moreover, the facts of this case do not provide a proper basis upon which to ask the aid of equity to reestablish a trust <em>res </em>for the sole purpose of permitting appellant to receive compensation for its services as a trustee.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When appellant discovered that the trust deed which secured the Office Building notes had been released with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>out notice to it \u2014 one of the principal note-holders \u2014 it was put on inquiry as to the possibility of fraudulent action by the Swartzell Company. It demanded, as it should have done, that if the notes had been paid, \u201cWe have got to have the money for them.\u201d It received the reply that the money had been reinvested. But it was the duty of appellant itself to make reinvestments for the Rheem trust; not the Swartzell Company, or Edmund D. Rheem. A trustee cannot properly employ an agent to select investments for the trust, much less permit a third person to deal with trust funds and select investments without its knowledge.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If a trustee does entrust such funds to another for reinvestment and, through dishonesty or negligence of the other, the funds are lost, the trustee is personally liable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under such circumstances it forfeits any right it may have to compensation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, in the present case, whether appellant accepted the Hotel Corporation notes from the Swartzell Company, on the assumption that they represented reinvestments of trust funds already selected, or whether, on the other hand, it acted upon the instructions of the beneficiaries, and itself selected the Hotel Corporation notes in substitution for the Office Building notes, thus making itself privy with the beneficiaries, it is barred, in either event, from asking the aid of equity for the purpose of protecting its right to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Our conclusion, therefore, is that appellant does not come within the specification of our earlier decision as a \u201cnoteholder in <em>like situation </em>with other plaintiffs and interveners\u201d and that it has failed to show any equitable reason for setting aside the decree of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aq4\"> 67 App.D.C. 259, 92 F.2d 183, 114 A.L.R. 1065.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A5Y6\"> Hutchins v.

Cornell, 130 U.S. 655, 658, 9 S.Ct. 694, 32 L.Ed. 1041, the Supreme Court held that \u201cIt is immaterial whether the cancellation is by destroying the instrument, or by writing or stamping words or lines in ink upon its face, provided the instrument, in the condition in which he puts it, unequivocally shows that it has been cancelled.\u201d Although the Cornell case was decided under the law merchant, the principle there announced is applicable here. D.C.Code (1929) tit. 22, \u00a7 1, provides that \u201cIn any ease not provided for in this chapter the rules of the law merchant shall govern.\u201d Sections 181, 182 and 185 speak of cancellation but at no place in the statute is there a definition of the term. Hence, resort must be had to the rules of the law merchant for proper application of the term and, therefore, the Cornell case becomes authority. It follows that marking a note \u201ccancelled\u201d, as was done in the instant case, is sufiicient to discharge the note.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b806-8\"> See Helvering v.
