Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 2811 it was provided: \u201cThat every person disposing of any substance of the character used in the manufacture of distilled spirits shall, when required by the Commissioner, render a correct return in such form and manner- as the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, may by rules and regulations prescribe, showing- the names and addresses of the persons t.o whom such disposition was. made, with such, details as to the quantity so disposed of or other information which the Commissioner may require as to each such disposition, as will enable the Commissioner to determine whether all taxes due with respect to any distilled spirits manufac-. tured from such substances have been paid.

The first count was predicated upon Article II of the Regulations and charged that the defendant having been served with written notice by the Commissioner did wilfully fail and neglect to render to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue a return reflecting the disposition of yeast. The second count was predicated upon Article III of the Regulations and charged that the defendant did wilfully fail to keep at his place of business books, records and documents relating to and connected with the disposition of such yeast. The defendant was convicted upon both counts. The court sentenced him to pay a fine of $500 upon each count and serve a term of imprisonment of one year upon each count, the terms of imprisonment to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"AqqD\">Before the jury was sworn the defendant moved to quash the second count of the indictment for failure to charge an offense against the United States on the ground that the article of the Regulations requiring the keeping of books and records was not within the scope of the authority to prescribe regulations conferred by the Joint Resolution upon the Commissioner. The court denied the motion. The defendant does not question the power of Congress to delegate to a selected instrumentality the making of rules for the enforcement of the express legislative intent nor the constitutionality of the Joint Resolution herein involved.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *3His contention is limited to the question whether Congress had expressed in the Joint Resolution the intent to make the failure to keep books and records a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">In United States v. Resnick, 299 U.S. 207, 209, 57 S.Ct. 126, 127, 81 L.Ed. 127, the Supreme Court reiterated the rule of construction that \u201cStatutes creating crimes are to be strictly construed in favor of the accused; they may not be held to extend to cases not covered by the words used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-13\">In United States v. Eaton, 144 U.S. 677, 12 S.Ct. 764, 36 L.Ed. 591, the court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>that a statute which imposed the duty upon manufacturers of oleomargarine to keep books and make monthly returns did not sustain a regulation which imposed the same duty upon wholesale dealers. The court said (144 U.S. page 688, 12 S.Ct. page 767, 36 L.Ed. 591) : \u201cIt is necessary that a sufficient statutory authority should exist for declaring any act or omission a criminal offense; and we do not think that the statutory authority in the present case is sufficient. If congress intended to make it an offense for wholesale dealers in oleomargarine to omit to keep books and render returns as required by regulations to be made by the commissioner of internal revenue, it would have done so distinctly, in connection with an enactment such as that above recited, made in section 41 of the act of October 1, 1890.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">In United States v. George, 228 U.S. 14, 33 S.Ct. 412, 57 L.Ed. 712 the defendant was charged with committing perjury in connection with a homestead claim. The statute provided that one was entitled to a patent if he proved by two credible witnesses that he had resided upon the land for five years and made affidavit that no part of such land had been alienated. A regulation was promulgated which added the requirement that the claimant take an affidavit with respect to residence. The court held that the regulation was not justified by the statute and said (228 U.S. page 21, 33 S.Ct. page 414, 57 L.Ed. 712): \u201cTo so construe the latter section is to make it confer unbounded legislative powers. What, indeed, is its limitation? If the Secretary of the Interior may add by regulation one condition, may he not add another? If he may require a witness or witnesses in addition to what \u00a7 2291 requires, why not other conditions, and the disposition of the public lands thus be taken from the legislative branch of the government and given to the discretion of the Land Department? It is not an adequate answer to say that the regulation must be reasonable. The power to make it is expressed in general terms. If given at all it is as broad as its subject, and may vary with the occupant of the office. This is to make conditions of title, not to regulate those constituted by the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-25\">In the case before us the Government urges that power to require the keeping of books and records may be implied from the statutory authority to prescribe by regulation \u201cthe manner\u201d of rendering a \u201creturn.\u201d It is also suggested that the keeping of records is implied in the requirement of a \u201ccorrect return.\u201d We do not think, however, that such implications are justified. An examination of other provisions of the internal revenue laws discloses that when Congress thought it necessary to do so it referred to the keeping of books and records in express terms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>Had Congress intended to require that persons who dispose of substances used in the manufacture of distilled spirits keep books and records as well as make returns it could have said so as it did in other provisions of the internal revenue laws regulating the duties of rectifiers, distillers and persons liable to tax. For example, in Sec. 1305 of the Revenue Act of 1918, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345, which act in Title VI imposed taxes upon distilled spirits, wines and other beverages, Congress provided that: \u201cevery person liable to any tax imposed by this Act, or for the collection thereof, <em>shall keep such records </em>and render, under oath, such statements and returns, and shall comply with such regulations as the Commissioner, with the approval of the Secretary, may from time to time prescribe.\u201d (Italics ours).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">We conclude that Article III of Regulations 17 (amended) upon which count 2 was based, is not within the authority conferred upon the Commissioner by the Joint Resolution and is, therefore, invalid. It follows that the court erred in refusing to quash count 2 of the indictment. Insofar as our decision in Da\u00f1o v. United States, 3 Cir., 91 F.2d 1012, is inconsistent with this conclusion we overrule it, although it is fair to point out that the present question was not raised in that case. At first blush it might appear that the cases of United States v. Goldsmith, 2 Cir., 91 F.2d 983; DiSanto v. United States, 6 Cir., 93 F.2d 948, and United States v. Tishman, 7 Cir., 99 F.2d 951, are contrary to this conclusion. None' of those cases, however, involved a count under Article III for failure to keep books and records. The indictment in the Goldsmith case was for conspiracy and in the DiSanto and Tishman cases for failure to make returns. It will thus be seen that the validity of Article III was not actually involved nor decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">The defendant also urges that the court erred in its charge to the jury by not charging that the failure to render the reports must be wilful, and that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. There is no merit in the first contention. The defendant, although he submitted 18 requests for charge, did not think the point sufficiently important to call it to the attention of the trial judge. We see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>no prejudicial error in the charge. As to the second contention it is sufficient to point out that there was substantial evidence to support the verdict. It was the province of the jury to determine its weight. Upon appeal that question is concluded by the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed as to count 1 of the indictment and reversed as to count 2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1031-14\"> As to these questions see United States v.
