The petition states \u201cof approximately 150 telephone conversations introduced in evidence, only four or five were interstate calls, the rest all being intrastate calls,\u201d and that the order made by which the cases were reversed is silent as to the effect of the Communications Act of 1934 upon intrastate calls. The declared purpose of the Communications Act was to regulate interstate and foreign commerce in communications by wire or radio. Section 605 thereof, 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 605, contains the provision, \u201cAnd no person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">With reference to this provision the Supreme Court in Nardone v. United States, 302 U.S. 379, 58 S.Ct. 275, 276, 82 L.Ed. 314, December 20, 1937, said: \u201cTaken at its face value the phrase \u2018no person\u2019 comprehends federal agents, and the ban on communication to \u2018any person\u2019 bars testimony to the content of an intercepted message.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-11\">It further said: \u201cWe nevertheless face the fact that the plain words of section 605 [47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 605] forbid anyone, unless authorized by the sender, to intercept a telephone message, and direct in equally clear language that <em>\u2018no person\u2019 </em>shall divulge or publish the message or its substance to <em>\u2018any person.\u2019 </em>To recite the contents of the message in testimony before a court is to divulge the message. The conclusion that the act forbids such testimony seems to us unshaken by the government\u2019s arguments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b920-12\">It seems to us that the privacy to be achieved by the mandate of the statute is the privacy of a conduit or instrumentality of interstate communication, though the same physical equipment may likewise be the means by which intrastate communications are made. The broad scope and constitutional validity of statutes have been sustained where instrumentalities serve both interstate and foreign commerce, even when applied in specific instances to transactions which are not interstate commerce. So the Federal Safety Appliance Act, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1 et seq., as an exercise of Federal power under the commerce clause has been held to extend to all vehicles used upon a highway of interstate commerce whether the vehicles themselves are so engaged or not, for the safety to be.secured by the Act is the safety of the \u00a1persons transported in interstate commerce, no matter what may be the source of the dangers which threaten it. Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, 222 U. S. 20, 25, 26, 32 S.Ct. 2, 56 L.Ed. 72; Texas &amp; Pacific Ry. Co. v. Rigsby, 241 U.S. 33, 41, 36 S.Ct. 482, 60 L.Ed. 874.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-14\"> It seems clear enough that the statute prohibits the interception by \u201cwire tapping\u201d of all telephone communications and the subsequent disclosure thereof by all persons except those authorized by the sender. Neither federal agents nor intrastate communications are excluded. If a federal agent is permitted to listen in on a telephone conversation, he of course hears all that is said regardless of whether the communication is interstate or intrastate in its nature. He is given an opportunity to hear and disclose that which he is forbidden to hear and disclose and to that extent the privacy which the 'Communications Act manifestly intends to secure for both interstate and foreign communications by telephone is destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-15\">The petition to rehear is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
