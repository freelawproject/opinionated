No reason of appeal relates to the denial of the petition for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">The attorney for the Commissioner of Patents in his brief has pointed out the fact that February 3, 1939, the date upon which the said notice of appeal was filed, is more than 40 days from the date of the decision of the commissioner denying registration, although it is within the 40 day period from the date of the decision of the commissioner denying the petition for reconsideration, and calls attention to this court\u2019s decision in Re Horton, 58 P.2d 682, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1151.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">In the above-cited case, facts substantially identical with those at bar were disclosed by the record. In the opinion of the court by the late Presiding Judge Graham it was pointed out that rule 149 of the Patent Office, promulgated under the authority of section 4912, Revised Statutes, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 60 (which rule is now in full force and effect), provides that 40 days, exclusive of Sundays and holidays but including Saturday half holidays, is the period within which an appeal to this court must be taken, and that there was no statutory authority or rule of the Patent Office which operated to extend that period by the filing of a petition for rehearing unless said rehearing was granted. Upon the facts in that case, the court held that it was without jurisdiction to review the proceeding and dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-9\">For the reasons assigned there we must hold here that we are without jurisdiction in the matter, and the appeal of appellant is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-10\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
