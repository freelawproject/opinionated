No applicable tariff of rates was posted in plaintiff\u2019s station in Francesville. Upon delivery of the livestock, defendant in each instance requested plaintiff\u2019s agent in Francesville to ascertain from plaintiff\u2019s home office in Chicago, Illinois the correct charges due on the shipment. The agent did as requested, and defendant thereupon paid the charges stated to be due. Defendant then sold the- livestock on a cost-plus basis, the cost including freight charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-29\">The defendant, however, was misinformed as to the proper rates, which exceeded the rates paid. Upon discovering the mistake, the plaintiff brought an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>against the defendant to recover the undercharges in the amount of $588.85. In his so-called fifth defense to the action, the defendant pleaded as a counterclaim that he had been damaged by the failure of the plaintiff to post the proper rates in its office in Francesville and by the negligence of plaintiff\u2019s agents in furnishing the incorrect rates to the defendant. Defendant prayed for damages in the amount of $510.52 find for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a directed verdict; made at the close of all the evidence, was denied; and judgment was entered on the verdict in favor of plaintiff on his complaint and in favor of defendant on his counterclaim. The denial of plaintiff\u2019s motion for a directed verdict is relied on as error. Other errors relied on need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\"> It is clear that the defendant, having sold the livestock on a cost-plus basis, has suffered a loss, but -the decisions are definite to the effect that under the present state of facts the railroad is not liable for this loss. To allow the defendant to recover would, in substance, allow the railroad to grant a rebate. 49 U.S.C.A. Sec. 6(7) ; Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Henderson, 226 U.S. 441, 446, 447, 33 S.Ct. 176, 57 L. Ed. 290; Texas &amp; Pacific R. Co. v. Mugg &amp; Dryden, 202 U.S. 242, 26 S.Ct. 628, 50 L.Ed. 1011; Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Co. v. Maxwell, 237 U.S. 94, 97, 98, 35 S.Ct. 494, 59 L.Ed. 853, L.R.A.1915E, 665. The failure of the railroad to post tariffs in its station does not alter the rule. Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Henderson, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">Section 8 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 8, cannot aid the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Atlantic Coast Line Ry. Co. v. Bristol Steel &amp; Iron Works, D.C., 30 F. Supp. 726, 728. The defendant is conclusively presumed to know the proper rates. Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Co. v. Maxwell, supra; Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Carl, 227 U.S. 639, 653, 33 S.Ct. 391, 57 L.Ed. 683; Chicago &amp; Alton R. R. v. Kirby, 225 U.S. 155, 166, 32 S.Ct. 648, 56 L.Ed. 1033, Ann.Cas.1914A, 501. Therefore, the defendant had no right to rely on the railroad\u2019s quotation of rates, and no failure of duty on the part of the railroad renders it liable for defendant\u2019s loss. Although the defendant\u2019s counterclaim relied upon the rates quoted by the railroad company, which were incorrect, he must not only pay the correct rates to the railroad company, but he is without remedy against the railroad company for the damage he may have suffered in reliance upon the incorrect rates quoted. He is bound to pay the correct rates, and what the correct rates are he is bound to know.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-9\">For the reasons hereinabove given, plaintiff\u2019s motion for a directed verdict should have been granted. The case will be remanded with instructions to the District Court to grant plaintiff\u2019s motion for a directed verdict and to enter judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1030-6\"> <em>\u201c\u00a7 </em>8.
