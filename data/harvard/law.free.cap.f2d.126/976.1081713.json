The complainant alleged that the debtor had \u201cconcealed or removed property with intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors during the year 1939 by turning over\u201d to two of its officers certain sums of money. The debtor moved to dismiss \u2022 the petition on the ground that the alleged act of bankruptcy had been committed more than four months prior to the filing. From the District Court\u2019s denial of the motion, the debtor has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>Appellant argues that Section 3, sub. b\u2019 of the Bankruptcy Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides a blanket limitation of four months following an act of bankruptcy within which time a petition may be filed. As authority it cites a single case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That case is one which involves an alleged transfer of assets. We are here concerned not with a transfer, but with a concealment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It has long been settled that the four month limitation begins to run upon continuing concealments only from the time of discovery.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The recent modernizations of the Bankruptcy Act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> have not affected this precedent. A leading treatise speaking of the present provision says:</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">\u201cAlthough \u00a73b appears to cover the entire first act of bankruptcy, it deals expressly with transfers and assignments, not mentioning concealments and removals. Consequently, as to the latter, the four-month period does not expire until four months after the concealment or removal is discovered by creditors.\u201d 1 Collier on Bankruptcy, 14th Ed., Para. 3.702.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-15\">Thus, the bankruptcy rule that, the four month period shall not begin to run on the concealment of assets until discovery is quite similar to the doctrine prevailing in England<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the majority of the United States<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the statute of limitations is tolled where there has been a fraudulent concealment of a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-16\">The order of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1037-6\"> \u201cA petition may be filed against a person within four months after the commission of an act of bankruptcy. Such time with respect to the first, (the act alleged in the? amended petition) second, or fourth act of bankruptcy shall not expire until four months after the date when the transfer or assignment became so far perfected that no bona-fide purchaser from the debtor and no creditor could thereafter have acquired any rights in the property so transferred or assigned superior to the rights of the transferee or assignee therein.\u201d 11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 21, sub. b (parenthetical matter added)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1037-8\"> In re D.W.F., Inc., D.C., 35 F.Supp. 125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1037-10\"> \u201cTo conceal is to hide or withdraw from observation; to cover or keep from sight, to prevent discovery or to withhold knowledge. In re Perlmutter [D.C.] 256 F. 862. Thus, a bankrupt conceals assets where he evinces an indisposition to disclose his real financial condition, as well as where he keeps his assets beyond the reach of his creditors.
