Hall, hereinafter referred to as applicant, filed an application in the United States Patent Office for the registration of a trade-mark \u201cPennpayz\u201d for lubricating oils and greases, alleging use since July 22, 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-22\">The Pennzoil Company, a corporation of California, and the Pennzoil Company, a corporation of Pennsylvania, hereinafter referred to as opposers, filed opposition to the registration of said mark, and in their joint notice of opposition alleged a prior use of the marks \u201cPennzoil\u201d and \u201cZoil\u201d on lubricants and lubricating oils and greases respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-23\">Applicant has conceded that the marks of the respective parties are used on goods of the same descriptive properties, and it is also conceded that the opposers are the prior users. The only question raised by the notice of opposition that needs to be considered by us is whether the marks of the respective parties are confusingly similar. Argument of both parties relating to this question will be set out as briefly as seems proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-24\">The Examiner of Interferences sustained the notice of opposition, holding that the marks of the respective parties were confusingly similar. Upon appeal, the Commissioner of Patents held that the mark \u201cPennzoil\u201d was confusingly similar to \u201cPennpayz\u201d and accordingly affirmed the decision of the Examiner of Interferences sustaining the opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-25\">In support of the commissioner\u2019s decision denying registration, opposers stressed the contention, in substance, that when a purchaser desires oil he may call for \u201cPenn-payz Oil\u201d and that the word \u201cOil\u201d when preceded with the letter \u201cZ\u201d will lead to confusion with opposers\u2019 mark \u201cZoil.\u201d It further argues that if the word \u201cOil\u201d is added by the purchaser to the mark \u201cPenn-payz\u201d the combination of the two words will form the word \u201cPennpayzoil,\u201d and that, in this way, all letters in the \u201cPennzoil\u201d mark, including both syllables \u201cPenn\u201d and \u201cZoil,\u201d would be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-26\">Opposers, according to the stipulation, also use their mark \u201cZoildeez\u201d on oil for Diesel engines. The mark \u201cZoildeez\u201d was not pleaded in the notice of opposition, but opposers urge this consideration on the ground that they have produced evidence of the likelihood of confusion owing to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>fact that its \u201cZoildeez\u201d mark contains the syllable \u201cZoil\u201d as well as a final letter \u201cZ.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The record shows that when the mark \u201cPennzoil\u201d was adopted, the letter \u201cS\u201d instead of its phonetic equivalent \u201cZ\u201d was used. Later, the letter \u201cZ\u201d was substituted for the letter \u201cS.\u201d Some years ago op-posers began to intensively advertise the importance of the letter \u201cZ,\u201d referring to such advertising as \u201cthe special \u2018Z theme\u2019.\u201d Such advertising in part consisted of enlarging the \u201cZ\u201d in the term \u201cPennzoil\u201d and setting it aside for the purpose of emphasis, thus separating the syllables \u201cPenn\u201d and \u201cOil.\u201d Just why this was done is not clear, and we regard it as a matter of little importance in determining the issue presented in this case. It seems to us that opposers\u2019 contentions concerning this phase of the evidence cut both ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">It is generally recognized that a very fine grade of lubricating oils and greases is made from \u201cPennsylvania crude.\u201d That it has special qualities of excellence by reason of certain components is unquestioned. The reason for so many dealers in lubricants applying the geographical abbreviation \u201cPenn\u201d to their product is readily understandable and the record makes it clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Opposers, in their opposition to the use by others of the term \u201cPenn\u201d in combination with other matter, have never, as far as we know, contended that they have a monopoly on the term \u201cPenn.\u201d We must assume, for the purpose of this decision, that \u201cPennzoil\u201d is a valid trademark, and we do not wish to intimate that it is not. Furthermore, it would seem clear that opposers are fully justified in complaining of the probability of injury resulting from the use by others of any mark which, as a whole, is so similar to op-posers\u2019 mark as to be liable to lead to confusion as to the origin of the goods sold under the respective marks. Skelly Oil Co. v. Powerine Co., 24 C.C.P.A., Patents, 790, 86 F.2d 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">The Examiner of Interferences was impressed with the fact that prospective purchasers might call for \u201cPennpayz Oil,\u201d and, evidently on the theory that the term \u201cOil\u201d and the preceding letter \u201cZ\u201d would be confusing with the trade-mark \u201cZoil,\u201d held that there would be a likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The commissioner, with respect to use of the term \u201cPennpayz Oil,\u201d disagreed with the examiner, and stated that he did not think that the term \u201cOil\u201d under such circumstances would be regarded by the customer as a part of the trade-mark. He stated that the mark \u201cZoil\u201d is very different from \u201cPennpayz,\u201d that there would be no likelihood of confusion between the two marks, and confined his decision to the likelihood of confusion resulting from the concurrent use upon goods of the same descriptive properties of the terms \u201cPennpayz\u201d and \u201cPennzoil.\u201d We are of the opinion that the commissioner correctly confined the determinative question of the likelihood of confusion to the two marks \u201cPennzoil\u201d and \u201cPennpayz.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">The record is replete with a showing of various marks which were used by dealers in goods like that of the parties hereto, some of which marks were sought to be registered, others of which were registered, and which have been objected to by the opposers. Where opposers were successful in some instances in stopping the use of certain alleged objectionable marks, it was upon an agreed judgment or on decision from the Patent Office tribunals from which there was no appeal taken. These matters are not very helpful in the decision of the instant issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">When we look at the two terms \u201cPenn-payz,\u201d which applicant contends suggests \u201cpays to use Pennsylvania oil,\u201d and the term \u201cPennzoil,\u201d we see little resemblance either in meaning or sound except in the syllable \u201cPenn\u201d and the fact that the last syllable of each mark contains the letter \u201cZ.\u201d But the syllables \u201cPayz\u201d and \u201cZoil\u201d are so different in appearance and meaning that we think, as applied to oils and greases, purchasers would not likely be deceived in the origin of the goods merely because of the similarity above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">Owing to the difference in appearance and sound of the words \u201cPayz\u201d and \u201cZoil,\u201d there is no indication that applicant in combining the syllable \u201cPenn\u201d and the syllable \u201cPayz\u201d intended to profit as a result of confusion. In other words, it seems apparent that while applicant desired to exercise its right to use the term \u201cPenn\u201d it purposely adopted the syllable \u201cPayz\u201d for the reason that no confusion would be likely to result because of its great dissimilarity with the syllable \u201cZoil.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>For reasons hereinbefore stated, we conclude that the commissioner erred in affirming the decision of the examiner denying applicant the right to register its trademark \u201cPennpayz,\u201d and the commissioner\u2019s decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
