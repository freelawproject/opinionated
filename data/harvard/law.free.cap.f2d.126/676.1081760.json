These measures however proved inadequate for the task of rescuing the farmer from his financial plight. The cumbersome machinery of Section 75 was rarely resorted to because of two outstanding defects in its procedure.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since the mortgage debt of most farmers represented a majority of their indebtedness, the requirement that a composition or extension. be agreed to by a majority in number and amount of all creditors often tended to grant to a single mortgage a veto power pver composition and extension proposals. A mere composition or extension without any reduction in the amount of the lien was not a sufficiently effective remedy, particularly in view of the fact that in the absence of consent by at least a majority of the secured creditors, there was nothing to prevent foreclosure and dispossession of the farmer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">So finally a complete departure from the concept that bankruptcy legislation should preserve and distribute the debtors\u2019 assets for the creditors\u2019 -benefit was resorted- to. The Frazier-Lemke Act was designed solely to keep the farmer-debtor in possession of his farm perhaps for the general benefit of the state, but at any rate at the expense of his creditors.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After an unsuccessful attempt,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> a constitutional act was passed as an amendment (subsection s) to Section <em>75 </em>of the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Section 75 was originally to run only until March 4, 1938, but was extended to petitions filed prior: to March 4, 1940<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and re-extended to March 4, 1944.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The debtor now before us filed \u00e1 petition under Subsection s of Section 75 and on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>July 21, 1937 was adjudicated a bankrupt.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Some time after the close of the three year moratorium period (April 12, 1941), a mortgage-creditor presented a petition for the appointment of a trustee. Testimony on this petition was taken before a Conciliation Commissioner. The latter found that the debtor was not a farmer<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> when he instituted the proceedings and accordingly recommended that the proceeding should be dismissed. To this report the debtor excepted and demanded a re\u00e1p-praisal of his property. Upon the confirmation of the Commissioner\u2019s report<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> by the District Judge, a dismissal of the proceedings followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\"> If the detailed background of the passage of the Frazier-Lemke Act proves any one point, it demonstrates 'that the Act was intended for the relief of farmers only and only those who come within the statutory definition of farmer may participate in its benefits. The necessity that a debtor be a farmer, therefore, is jurisdictional.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Like all matters going to the jurisdiction over the subject matter, it may be raised at any point in the proceedings and by either the parties themselves or the court, sua sponte.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> With but a dictum contra,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the cases are unanimous in holding that even though the court approves a petition as validly filed, it may later and of its own motion dismiss when the debtor! is found not to be a farmer.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">It is essential, however, that jurisdictional issues under Section 75, sub. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>s may not be disposed of until a hearing thereupon has been held after due notice to the debtor.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> To make the notice due it should have included within its terms the question of farmer vel non. This it did not do but rather postulated the question of whether a trustee should be appointed. This defect was .cured by the proceedings in the District Court. In those hearings the debtor expressly excepted<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> to a finding of fact<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> by the Conciliation Commissioner which was . worded as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">\u201cThe Commissioner makes the following Finding of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">\u201c1. That the debtor was not a bona fide farmer when he instituted these proceedings, in that he did not derive his principal source of income from farming, nor was he primarily engaged in farming.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Appendix p. 31. The learned District Judge at the hearing before <em>him </em>made an independent finding saying: \u201cIn our opinion, McGrew was not a farmer, as defined by Section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Appendix, p. 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">We must therefore affirm his dismissal of the proceedings. Since the court had no jurisdiction of the debtor, it may not order a reappraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">The order of the District Court confirming the Conciliation Commissioner\u2019s report is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">JONES, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-10\"> 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 22 sud. b.

The later collapse of this foreign market caused in part by bur having become a high tariff creditor nation and in part by the introduction of products from Canada, Argentine, Australia, and South Africa left our farmers with a problem of overproduction. The American farmer did \u2022 not share in the high prosperity of the post-war years. His standard of living was only sustained through an expansion of his mortgage indebtedness, Annual Report of Secretary of Agriculture (1931) 24.' As his debt structure continued to pile up, the farmer found it increasingly difficult to liquidate, for farming had become a losing business. The gap between farm prices and the general price level continued to widen. Yearbook of Agriculture (1932) 895. In the three years following 1929 farm income declined some 60 per cent.
