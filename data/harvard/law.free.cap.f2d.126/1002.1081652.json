This abolished appeals in habeas corpus proceedings brought \u201cto test the validity of a warrant of removal issued pursuant to the provisions of section 591 of Title 18 or the detention pending removal proceedings.\" The appellant replies that the Canal Zone Code provides for extradition, not removal, to and from the Canal Zone, that section 591 of Title 18, U.S.C.A., is not applicable to the case at bar, and therefore the right to appeal from dismissal of the writ is unaffected by the Act of June 29, 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">The petition for the writ of habeas corpus alleged that the persons of whose detention the relator complained were arrested by the United States Marshal for the Eastern District of New York by virtue of a warrant issued by a United States Commissioner based upon an information filed against them in the United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone and bench warrants issued out of said court and returned \u201cnot found\u201d by the marshal for the District of the Canal Zone. It was further alleged that the information did not state a crime against the United States; that the District Court for the District of the Canal Zone was without jurisdiction to find such information, and that there was no probable cause to believe the persons detained to be guilty of the crime charged against them. In the hearings before the commissioner and the court below no one suggested that the proceedings were not \u201cremoval proceedings\u201d under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 591. There can be no doubt that in fact the persons detained were taken into custody under color of the authority granted by the removal statute and that the writ sought to test the validity of their \u201cdetention pending removal.\u201d This being so, the United States attorney makes a persuasive argument that whether or not section 591 actually authorizes removal to the Canal Zone, the relator\u2019s attack upon the proceedings by writ of habeas corpus comes expressly within the proviso of 28 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 463(a), and the appeal must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">We do not however find it necessary to determine this question, for in our opinion the removal statute is applicable to the case at bar. The crime with which the persons detained are charged \u2014 that of Injuring a vessel of foreign registry while within the jurisdiction of the United States \u2014is a crime against the United States which by express definition includes the Canal Zone. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 502, 40 Stat. 221, 231. The court in which the information was filed is the United States District Court for the District of the Canal Zone and it has jurisdiction of the offense. Canal Zone Code, Tit. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 23, 26; 18 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 574. The offenders have been committed in a district other than that where the offense is to be tried. The case therefore falls squarely within the provisions of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 591. It is true, the information, though expressly based on 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 502, is filed in the name of \u201cThe Government of the Canal Zone.\u201d This is pursuant to sections 5 and 6, Title 6 of the Canal Zone Code. Whether the crime is an offense against the United States or is merely a local offense turns not on the procedural entitlement of the case but on the nature of the crime. If it were only a local offense then it seems that extradition would be required, as has been held with respect to Alaska, Ex parte Krause, D.C.W.D. Wash., 228 F. 547, but the situation is otherwise as to a charge of a federal crime. United States v. Haskins, D.C.Cal., Fed. Cas.No.15322.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-9\">It therefore follows that it is immaterial whether or not section 591 is reprinted in the Canal Zone Code, and that this code does provide for extradition in Title 6, \u00a7\u00a7 861 \u2014 871. That code was established by the Act of Congress of June 19, 1934, 48 Stat. 1122, which provided that the titles therein set forth shall \u201cbe deemed to embrace, all the permanent laws relating to or applying in the Canal Zone in force on the date of the enactment of this Act, except such general laws of the United States as relate to or apply in the Canal Zone.\u201d True, an Appendix to the Code reprints the general laws supposed to be applicable, as a preface points out, and section 591 is not there contained, though it does appear in \u201cSupplement No. 1 to Canal Zone Code and Appendix\u201d at page 20. But there is nothing official about this compiler\u2019s Appendix and certainly nothing to prevent the application of a federal statute to a removal of one accused on federal charges from one United States court to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">The constitutional issues which the appellant attempts to raise are not before us. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 463(a) the appeal must be dismissed. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
