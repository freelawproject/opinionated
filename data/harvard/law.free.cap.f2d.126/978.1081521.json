Appellant\u2019s answer in effect denied that anyone authorized to act for it had so agreed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a trial, the district court made the following</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">\u201cFindings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">\u201c1. Libellant, Kulukundis Shipping Co. S/A, employed Blidberg Rothchild Co. Inc. as a broker and the respondent, Amtorg Trading Corporation employed Potter &amp; Gordon, Inc. as its broker in the negotiations for the chartering of the ship \u2018Mount Helmos\u2019 for a trip to Japan. On March 15, 1940, Rothchild, of the firm of Blidberg Rothchild Co. Inc., and Gordon, acting on behalf of Potter &amp; Gordon, Inc., agreed upon a charter and closed by Gordon executing and delivering to Roth-child a fixture slip which is the usual trade practice, indicating the conclusion of charter negotiations in the trade of ship brokerage. All the material terms of the bargain are set forth in the fixture slip excepting demurrage, dispatch, and the date of the commencement of the charter term which all had been agreed on but were omitted by an oversight. A number of the terms, including the War Risks Clause of 1937, were fixed by the incorporation of a reference to an earlier charter of the steamer \u2018Norbryn.\u2019 Gordon acted with authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">\u201c2. Thereafter, respondent refused to sign the charter but instead repudiated it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">\u201cConclusions of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-8\">\u201c1. Respondent has breached a valid contract and is liable in damages to the libellant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-9\">Pursuant to the foregoing, the court entered an order that appellee recover from appellant the damages sustained, and referred to a named commissioner the ascertainment of the damages, to be reported to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-10\"> 1. The errors assigned on this appeal by appellant (with an exception we shall discuss later) relate to the admissibility of certain letters, the weight and sufficiency of the evidence, and the credibility of witnesses. The letters, for reasons adequately stated in the district court\u2019s opinion, were properly admitted in evidence. There is no need in this opinion to discuss the other errors. We do not sit as triers of the facts. In the light of Admiralty Rule 46%, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723, it is for the trial judge, not for us, after hearing the witnesses, to pass on the weight of the evidence, consider questions of credibility and make findings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this case, as the findings are not clearly erroneous, we cannot disturb them. The Aakre, 2 Cir., 1941, 122 F.2d 469, 474 certiorari denied, Waterman v. The Aakre, December 8, 1941, 62 S.Ct. 360, 86 L.Ed. _; Johnson v. Andrus, 2 Cir., 1941, 119 F.2d 287.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-14\">2. But there is an error assigned which is of a different character. The appellant, in its answer originally filed, pleaded that no contract had been made. No steps of any importance having meanwhile occurred in the suit, some nine months later and two months before the trial, it sought to amend its answer by including, as a separate defense, the fact that the alleged charter party upon which appellee was suing contained an arbitration clause, that appellee had not at any time asked appellant to proceed to arbitration, and that therefore the suit had been prematurely brought. This motion to amend was denied. If the amendment should have been allowed, the additional defense can now be urged. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-15\">The arbitration clause reads as follows: \u201c24. Demurrage or despatch is to be settled at loading and discharging ports separately, except as per Clause 9. Owners and Charterers agree, in case of any dispute or claim, to settle same by arbitration in New York. Also, in case of a dispute of any nature whatsoever, same is to be settled by arbitration in New York. In both cases arbitrators are to be commercial men.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-16\">In 1925 Congress enacted the Arbitration Act, U.S.C.A., Title 9. Pertinent sections of that statute read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-17\">\u201c\u00a7 2. Validity, irrevocability, and enforcement of agreements to arbitrate. A written provision in any maritime transaction or a contract evidencing a - transaction involving commerce to settle . by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1041-5\">\u201c\u00a7 3. Stay of proceedings where issue therein referable to arbitration. If any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aci-dedup-0\">\u201c\u00a7 4. Failure, etc., to arbitrate under agreement; petition to United States court having jurisdiction for order to compel arbitration; notice and service thereof; hearing and determination. A party aggrieved by the alleged failure, neglect, or refusal of another to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration may petition any court of the United States which, save for such agreement, would have jurisdiction under the judicial code at law, in equity, or in admiralty of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties, for an order directing that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such' agreement. Five days' notice in writing of such application shall be served upon the party in default. Service thereof shall be made in the manner provided by law for the service of summons in the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is brought. The court shall hear the parties, and upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply therewith is not in issue, the court shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The hearing and proceedings, under such agreement, shall be within the district in which the petition for an order directing such arbitration is filed. If the making of the arbitration agreement or the failure, neglect, or refusal to perform the same be in issue, the court shall proceed summarily to the trial thereof. If no jury trial be demanded by the party alleged to be in default, or if the matter in dispute is within admiralty jurisdiction, the court shall hear and determine such issue. Where such an issue is raised, the party alleged to be in default may, except in cases of admiralty, on or before the return day of the notice of application, demand a jury trial of such issue, and upon such demand the court shall make an order referring the issue or issues to a jury in the manner provided by law for referring to a jury issue in an equity action, or may specially call a jury for that purpose. If the jury find that no agreement in writing for arbitration was made or that there is no default in proceeding thereunder, the proceeding shall be dismissed. If the jury find that an agreement for arbitration was made in writing and that there is a default in proceeding thereunder, the court shall make an order summarily directing the parties to proceed with the arbitration in accordance with the terms thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1041-7\">Appellant admits \u2014 as it must \u2014 that the district court had jurisdiction to determine whether the parties had made an agreement to arbitrate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant contends, however, that, once the court determined in this suit that there was such an arbitration agreement, the court lost all power over the suit beyond that of staying further proceedings until there had been an arbitration as agreed to;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in that arbitration, argues appellant, the arbitrators will have jurisdiction to determine all issues except the existence of the arbitration clause. This jurisdiction, it is urged, is broad enough to permit an independent determination, by the arbitrator, that the contract itself is not valid or binding. Appellee asserts that the defendant had repudiated the charter-party, and that, therefore, the arbitration clause must be wholly disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1042-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>In considering these contentions in the light of the precedents, it is necessary to take into account the history of the judicial attitude towards arbitration: The English courts, while giving full effect to agreements to submit controversies to arbitration after they had ripened into arbitrators\u2019 awards, would \u2014 over a long period beginning at the end of the 17th century \u2014 do little or nothing to prevent or make irksome the breach of such agreements when they were still executory.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Prior to 1687, such a breach could be made costly: a penal bond given to abide the result of an arbitration had a real bite, since a breach of the bond\u2019s condition led to a judgment for the amount of the penalty. It was so held in 1609 in Vynior\u2019s Case, 8 Coke Rep. 81b. To be sure, Coke there, in a dictum, citing precedents, dilated on the inherent revocability of the authority given to an arbitrator;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> such a revocation was not too important, however, if it resulted in a stiff judgment on a penal bond. But the Statute of Fines and Penalties (8 &amp; 9 Wm. III c. 11, s. 8), enacted in 1687, provided that, in an action on any bond given for performance of agreements, while judgment would be entered for the penalty, execution should issue only for the damages actually sustained.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Coke\u2019s dictum as to revocability, uttered seventy-eight years earlier, now took on a new significance, as it was now held that for breach of an undertaking to arbitrate the damages were only nominal.<footnotemark>7a</footnotemark> Recognizing the effect of the impact of this statute on executory arbitration agreements, Parliament, eleven years later, enacted a statute, 9 Wm. III c. 15 (1698), designed to remedy the situation by providing that, if an agreement to arbitrate so provided, it could be made a \u201crule of court\u201d (i. e., a court order), in which event it became irrevocable, and one who revoked it would be subject to punishment for contempt of court; but the submission was revocable until such a rule of court had been obtained. This statute, limited in scope, was narrowly construed and was of little help.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The ordinary execu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>tory arbitration agreement .thus lost all real efficacy since it was not specifically enforceable in equity, and was held not to constitute the basis of a plea in bar in, or a stay of, a suit on the original cause of action.<footnotemark>8a</footnotemark> In admiralty, the rulings were much the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">It has been well said that \u201cthe legal mind must assign some reason in order to decide anything with spiritual quiet.\u201d<footnotemark>8b</footnotemark> And so, by way of rationalization, it became fashionable in the middle of the 18th century to say that such agreements were against public policy because they \u201coust the jurisdiction\u201d of the courts.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But that was a quaint explanation, inasmuch as an award, under an arbitration agreement, enforced both at law and in equity, was no less an ouster; and the same was true of releases and covenants not to sue, which were given full effect. Moreover, the agreement to arbitrate was not illegal, since suit could be maintained for its breach. Here was a clear instance of what Holmes called a \u201cright\u201d to break a contract and to substitute payment of damages for non-performance;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as, in this type of case, the damages were only nominal, that \u201cright\u201d was indeed meaningful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-14\">An effort has been made to justify this judicial hostility to the executory arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitrations, if unsupervised by the courts, are undesirable, and that legislation was needed to make possible such supervision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But if that was the reason for unfriendliness to such executory agreements, then the courts should also have refused to aid arbitrations when they ripened into awards. And what the English courts, especially the equity courts, did in other contexts, shows that, if they had had the will, they could have devised means of protecting parties to arbitrations. Instead, they restrictively interpreted successive statutes intended to give effect to executory arbitrations.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> No similar hostility was displayed by the Scotch courts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Lord Campbell explained the English attitude as due to the desire of the judges, at a time when their salaries came largely from fees, to avoid loss of income.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indignation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>has been voiced at this suggestion;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> perhaps it is unjustified.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Perhaps the true explanation is the hypnotic power of the phrase, \u201coust the jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Give a bad dogma a good name and its bite may become as bad as its bark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-4\">In 1855, in Scott v. Avery, 5 H.C.L. 811, the tide seemed to have turned. There it was held that if a policy made an award of damages by arbitrators a condition precedent to a suit on the policy, a failure to submit to arbitration would preclude such a suit, even if the policy left to the arbitrators the consideration of all the elements of liability. But, despite later legislation, the hostility of the English courts to executory arbitrations resumed somewhat after Scott v. Avery, and seems never to have been entirely dissipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-5\">That English attitude was largely taken over in the 19th century by most courts in this country. Indeed, in general, they would not go as far as Scott v. Avery, supra,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and continued to use the \u201couster of jurisdiction\u201d concept :<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> An executory agreement to arbitrate would not be given specific perform-anee or furnish, the basis of a stay of proceedings on the original cause of action. Nor would it be given effect as a plea in bar, except in limited instances, i. e., in the case of an agreement expressly or impliedly making it a condition precedent to litigation that there be an award determining some preliminary question of subsidiary fact upon which any liability was to be contingent. Hamilton v. Liverpool, 1890, etc., Ins. Co., 136 U.S. 242, 255, 10 S.Ct. 945, 34 L.Ed. 419. In the case of broader executory agreements, no more than nominal damages would be given for a breach.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1044-14\">Generally speaking, then, the courts of this country were unfriendly to executory arbitration' agreements. The lower federal courts, feeling bound to comply with the precedents, nevertheless became critical of this judicial hostility.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> There were intimations in the Supreme Court that perhaps the old view might be abandoned, but in the cases hinting at that newer attitude the issue was not raised.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Effective state arbitration statutes were enacted beginning with the New York Statute of 1920.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>The United States Arbitration Act of 1925 was sustained as constitutional, in its application to cases arising in admiralty. Marine Transit Corp. v. Dreyfus, 1932, 284 U.S. 263, 52 S.Ct. 166, 76 L.Ed. 516. The purpose of that Act was deliberately to alter the judicial atmosphere previously existing. The report of the House Committee<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> stated, in part: \u201cArbitration agreements are purely matters of contract, and the effect of the bill is simply to make the contracting party live up to his agreement. He can no longer refuse to perform his contract when it becomes disadvantageous to him. An arbitration agreement is placed upon the same footing as other contracts, where it belongs. * * * The need for the law arises from an anachronism of our American law. Some centuries ago, because of the jealousy of the English courts for their own jurisdiction, they refused to enforce specific agreements to arbitrate upon the ground \u00bfhat the courts were thereby ousted from their jurisdiction. This jealousy survived for so long a period that the principle became firmly embedded in the English common law and was adopted with it by the American courts. The courts have felt that the precedent was too strongly fixed to be overturned without legislative enactment, although they have frequently criticized the rule and recognized its illogical nature and the injustice which results from it. The bill declares simply that such agreements for arbitration shall be enforced, and provides a procedure in the Federal courts for their enforcement. * * * It is particularly appropriate that the action should be taken at this time when there is so much agitation against the costliness and delays of litigation. These matters can be largely eliminated by agreements for arbitration, if arbitration agreements are made valid and enforceable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">In the light of the clear intention of Congress,<footnotemark>24a</footnotemark> it is our obligation to shake off the old judicial hostility to arbitration. Accordingly, in a case like this, involving the federal Act, we should not follow English or other decisions which have narrowly construed the terms of arbitration agreements or arbitration statutes. With this new orientation, we approach the problems here presented. They are twofold: (a) Does the arbitration provision here have the sweeping effect ascribed to it by appellant ? (b) Is it, as appellee contends, wholly without efficacy because appellant asserted that there never was an agreement for a charter party? We shall consider these questions in turn:</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">To the appellant\u2019s sweeping contention there are several answers:</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">(a) Appellant, as we saw, concedes that, in such a case as this, before sending any issue to arbitrators, the court must determine whether an arbitration provision exists.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As the arbitration clause here is an integral part of the charter party, the court, in determining that the parties agreed to that clause, must necessarily first have found that the charter party exists.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> If the court here, having so found, were now to direct the arbitrators to consider that same issue, they would be traversing ground already covered in the court trial. There would thus result precisely that needless expenditure of time and money (the \u201ccostliness and delays of litigation\u201d) which 'Congress sought to avoid in enacting the Arbitration Act. In the light of that fact, a reasonable interpretation of the Act compels a repudiation of appellant\u2019s sweeping contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>(b) If the issue of the existence of the charter party were left to the arbitrators and they found that it was never made, they would, unavoidably (unless they were insane), be obliged to conclude that the arbitration agreement had never been made. Such a conclusion would (1) negate the court\u2019s prior contrary decision on a subject which, admittedly, the Act commits to the court, and (2) would destroy the arbitrators\u2019 authority to decide anything and thus make their decision a nullity. Cf. Phillips, The Paradox in Arbitration Law, 46 Harv. L.Rev. (1933) 1258, 1270-1272; Phillips, A Lawyer\u2019s Approach to Commercial Arbitration, 41 Yale L.J. (1934) 31; 6 Williston, Contracts (Rev.ed.1938), Section 1920 (pp. 5369-5379).</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">(c) The Arbitration Act does not cover an arbitration agreement sufficiently broad to include a controversy as to the existence of the very contract which embodies the arbitration agreement. Section 2 of the Act describes only three types of agreement covered by the Act: One type is \u201can agreement * * * to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of * * * a contract, transaction,\u201d etc.; thus the parties here, after a dispute had arisen as to the existence of the charter party, might have made an agreement to submit to arbitration that \u201cexisting\u201d controversy. But that is not this case. Section 2 also includes a \u201cprovision in * * * a contract evidencing a transaction * * * to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction * * Plainly such a provision does not include a provision in a contract to arbitrate the issue whether the minds of the parties ever met so as to bring about the very contract of which that arbitration clause is a part; a controversy relating to the denial that the parties ever made a contract is not a controversy arising out of that contract. Nor is it a controversy \u201carising out of a transaction evidenced by a contract,\u201d for if no contract existed then there was no such transaction evidenced by a contract and, therefore, no controversy arising out of that transaction. The third type of arbitration agreement described in Section 2 of the Act is a provision in a contract to settle by arbitration \u201ca controversy thereafter arising out of * * * the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof.\u201d This is familiar language; it refers to a controversy, which parties to a contract may easily contemplate, arising when a party to the contract, without denying that he made it, refuses performance; it does not mean a controversy arising out of the denial by one of the parties that he ever made any contract whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-9\">It is clear then that, even assuming, arguendo, that a contract could be drawn containing an arbitration clause sufficiently broad to include a controversy as to whether the minds of the parties had ever met concerning the making of the very contract which embodies the arbitration clause,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> such a clause would not be within the Arbitration Act. Accordingly, it' perhaps would not be immunized from the prestatutory rules inimical to arbitration, i.e., would not serve as the basis of a stay of the suit on the contract, leaving the parties to the arbitration called for by their agreement. Were the arbitration clause here sufficiently broad to call for arbitration of the dispute as to the existence of the charter party, it would, therefore, perhaps be arguable that it was entirely outside of the Act and, accordingly, irrelevant in the case before us;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> we need not consider that question, as we hold that the breadth of the arbitration clause is not so great and it is within the terms of Section 2 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-10\">We conclude that it would be improper to submit to the arbitrators the issue of the making of the charter party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-11\">But it does not follow that appellant was not entitled to a stay of the suit, under Section 3, until arbitration has been had as to the amount of the damages.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Here it is important to differentiate between Sections 3 and 4 of the Act. Under Section 4, the proceeding \u2014 as the Supreme Court observed in Marine Transit Corp. v. Dreyfus, 284 U.S. 263, 278, 52 S.Ct. 166, 76 L.Ed. 516\u2014is one for specific performance: One of the parties seeks \u201can order directing that * * * arbitration proceed in the manner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>provided for\u201d in the arbitration clause or agreement. It may well be that in a proceeding under Section 4, there are open many of the usual defenses available in a suit for specific performance.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It would seem that a court, when exercising equity powers, should do so on the basis of a fully informed judgment as to all the circumstances. We recognize that some authorities have held to the contrary under similarly worded state arbitration statutes, interpreting them to require the courts automatically to decree specific performance without regard to the usual equitable considerations.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It is difficult for us to believe that Congress intended us so to construe Section 4, although we do not here decide that question.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> However that may be, the same equitable considerations should surely not be applicable when a defendant asks a stay pursuant to Section 3. For he is not then seeking specific performance (i.e., an order requiring that the parties proceed to arbitration) but merely a stay order of a kind long familiar in common law, equity and admiralty actions. His position is that when the court (to quote Section 3) is \u201csatisfied that the issue involved in such suit * * * is referable to arbitration,\u201d the court must \u201cstay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\u201d There is a well recognized distinction between such a stay and specific performance: The first merely arrests further action by the court itself in the suit until something outside the suit has occurred; but the court does not order that it shall be done. The second, through the exercise of discretionary equity powers, affirmatively orders that someone do (or refrain from doing) some act outside the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">The Supreme Court has made just this distinction between Sections 3 and 4. In Shanferoke Corp. v. Westchester Corp., 1935, 293 U.S. 449, 452, 453, 55 S.Ct. 313, 315, 79 L.Ed. 583, in which it sustained this court in granting a stay when the arbitration clause provided for specific performance by the New York courts of the agreement to arbitrate, the Supreme Court said: \u201cWhether it [the contract] should be construed so as to exclude the bringing of a suit in the federal court to compel specific performance of the agreement to arbitrate, we have no occasion to decide. For the District Court was not asked, in the proceedings now under review, to compel specific performance. The motion was to stay the action until arbitration shall have been had; and the direction of the Court of Appeals was limited to granting a stay. Section 3 of the United States Arbitration Act * * * provides broadly that the court may \u2018stay the trial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"988\">*988</page-number>action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\u2019 We think the Court of Appeals was clearly right in concluding that there is no reason to imply that the power to grant a stay is conditioned upon the existence of power to compel arbitration in accordance with section 4 of the act. * * * There is * * * strong reason for construing the clause as permitting the federal court to order a stay even when it cannot compel the arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-4\">In the case at bar, so far as the arbitration was concerned, it was the first duty of the court, under Section 3, to determine whether there was an agreement to arbitrate and whether any of the issues raised in the suit were within the reach of that agreement. The appellant contested the existence of the charter party which contained that agreement, but also alternatively<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> pleaded that, if it existed, then there should be a stay pending arbitration of the appropriate issues. We see no reason why a respondent should be precluded from thus pleading in the alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">It is suggested, however, that there is a difference in the position of (1) a defendant who, even if he has no excuse to offer, refuses wholly to perform a contract containing an arbitration clause which he sets up as a condition precedent and (2) one who, like appellant, defends on the ground that no contract was ever made and, alternatively, similarly sets up an arbitration clause. The latter, it is urged, is somehow guilty of a greater moral wrong and, therefore, entitled to less relief. We cannot agree. For we have already shown that equitable factors have slighter bearing where defendant asks a stay under Section 3 and not specific performance under Section 4. But even if such factors were fully pertinent under Section 3, it would not be true that there is more equity in the position of a person who, admitting that he has made a contract, wilfully refuses all performance without excuse than in that of one who, in good faith, raises a question of fact as to whether a contract was-ever made.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> As Williston remarks:<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> \u201cA person who repudiates a contract wrongfully cannot sue upon it himself, but if he is sued upon it, he can be held liable only according to the terms of the contract. If, therefore, an arbitration clause amounts to a condition precedent to the defendant\u2019s promise to pay any insurance money, and such conditions are lawful, the defendant can be held liable only if that condition is performed, prevented or waived.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">Arbitration under the charter party here was a condition precedent. At common law, or in admiralty, failure of a plaintiff to perform an ordinary condition precedent (unless excused) is the basis of a plea in bar. As we observed, wide executory arbitration clauses, owing to judicial opposition to arbitrations, were not dealt with in similar manner, although more limited executory arbitration provisions were. Cf. Hamilton v. Liverpool, etc., Ins. Co., supra. The Arbitration Act has eliminated the hostility to an executory arbitration agreement coming within Section 2 and, while not making it a basis for a plea in bar, now permits it -to be made the basis of a stay order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">The arbitration clause here was clearly broad enough to cover the issue of damages; \u201ca clause of general arbitration does not cease to be within the statute when the dispute narrows down to damages alone.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It has been suggested that the arbitration clause calls for arbitrators who are \u201ccommercial men,\u201d that they are not appropriate persons to compute damages in this case where appellant has not merely breached but denied the existence of the charter party, and that, therefore, it must follow that the parties did not contemplate arbitration of such damages. But that argument is untenable, since it rests-upon an unsound assumption, i.e., that damages are to be differently computed in those two kinds of situations. In truth, it is precisely this sort of case where arbitration of damages by \u201ccommercial men\u201d may be peculiar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"989\">*989</page-number>ly useful, as they are likely to be more familiar than the average lawyer who serves as special master with the relevant background of international shipping in the state of world affairs as of the period covered by the charter party.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">There remains to be considered the language of Section 3 of the Act that, \u201con application,\u201d such a stay shall be granted \u201cproviding the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.\u201d We take that proviso to refer to a party who, when requested, has refused to go to arbitration or who has refused to proceed with the hearing before the arbitrators once it has commenced. The appellant was never asked by appellee to proceed with the arbitration; indeed, it is the appellee who has objected to it. In Shanferoke Coal &amp; Supply Corp. v. Westchester S. Corp., 2 Cir., 1934, <em>70 </em>F.2d 297, plaintiff alleged that defendant, after part performance, materially breached the contract. The defendant in its answer denied the allegations and, as a special defense, set up an arbitration clause in the contract, alleged that it was willing to arbitrate, and moved for a stay under Section 3 of the Arbitration Act. Answering plaintiff\u2019s contention that defendant was \u201cin default in proceeding with such arbitration,\u201d we held that the fact that defendant may have breached the contract was not a \u201cdefault\u201d within that statutory provision; we said that the initiative as to proceeding with the arbitration rested upon plaintiff, adding: \u201cIf it did not but sued instead, it was itself the party who fell \u2018in default in proceeding with such arbitration,\u2019 not the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Our decision was affirmed in Shanferoke Co. v. Westchester Co., 1935, 293 U.S. 449, 55 S.Ct. 313, 79 L.Ed. 583.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant here was not in default within the meaning of the proviso in Section 3. It follows that the district court should have stayed the suit, pending arbitration to determine the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">A plaintiff who brought suit on a contract, without seeking to avail himself of its arbitration clause, has been held to have waived his rights thereunder, so that he could not subsequently, after a long delay, ask the court, under Section 3, to stay the action pending arbitration.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Within limits, much might perhaps be said for such a holding, on the ground that a party should not thus first set in motion judicial proceedings and then arrest them.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> But the situation is, ordinarily, different in the case of a defendant who amends his answer to set up the arbitration so as to ask a stay, especially where, as here, no important intervening steps had been taken in the suit and no one had been affected by the delay. In Radiator Specialty Co. v. Cannon Mills, Inc., 4 Cir., 97 F.2d 318, 117 A.L.R. 299, the defendant, when sued in the amount of $4,340 on a contract containing an arbitration clause, filed an answer and also set up a counterclaim of $58,812.60. The case was set for trial, but, after three months, the trial was, on defendant\u2019s motion, adjourned on the condition, imposed by the trial court, that the case would be tried on the adj ourned date several months later. When the case was then called, both sides having prepared for trial, the defendant, for the first time, moved for a stay, under Section 3 of the Arbitration Act, of the action both on the claim and on its own counterclaim. It was held that the trial court had discretion to deny the stay because there had been a \u201cwaiver\u201d by defendant and he was in \u201cdefault.\u201d There the defendant, because of his counterclaim, was in the position of a plaintiff who began suit without seeking arbitration until after a long interval; and the other facts are obviously different from those here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">Our conclusion is not inconsistent with our decision in The Wilja, 2 Cir., 1940, 113 F.2d 646, properly interpreted. There is a dictum in that opinion intimating that there was a \u201crepudiation of the contract\u201d which nullified the arbitration clause, because the respondent shipowner had com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>pletely refused performance, so that it could not ask for a stay based on that clause. But the facts of that case were that, due to war conditions, it had become impossible to carry out the arbitration, which, by its terms, was to take place in London. Moreover, there the libellant, under what came close to being coercion on the part of respondent,<footnotemark>40a</footnotemark> had agreed to an amendment of the original contract increasing the freight rates to twice the amount originally agreed upon; and respondent had then flagrantly breached even this amended contract. There was thus the impossibility of complying with the arbitration clause coupled with impressive unfairness by respondent. It is true that some conditions precedent will not be excused merely because of the impossibility of complying with them; but, in a variety of circumstances, the courts have held that impossibility will obviate non-compliance. The rulings in those cases turn largely on the particular facts involved.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In some of those cases, it has been said that the parties did not contemplate the contingency which subsequently frustrated compliance with the condition, and, therefore, could not have intended to insist on the condition in such unforeseen circumstances. The use of such an explanation arose in a period when the courts were over-emphasizing the consensual element in all phases of life and unwilling to admit that a contract may create a status to which the courts will attach obligations, never in the minds of the parties, but based upon a policy which involves fair dealing.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Williston and others have sensibly urged a more candid avowal that it is such a policy, judicially imposed, and not at all what the parties intended which, in some situations, excuses non-compliance with a condition precedent when it becomes impossible.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>Lord Sumner, in speaking of a related doctrine, said: \u201cIt is irrespective of the individuals concerned, their temperaments and failings, their interest and circumstances. It is really a device, by which the rules as to absolute contracts are reconciled with a special exception which justice demands.\u201d Hirji Mulji v. Cheong Yue S. Co., [1926] A.C. 495, 510. Williston suggests that, in speaking of the doctrine of dependent promises, courts, when imputing an intention to the parties where none exists, are employing \u201can obvious fiction\u201d and it is \u201cbetter to drop any talk about intention of the parties where they express none and rest\u201d such doctrines \u201csolely on their fairness \u2014 a quite sufficient basis.\u201d Cf. Parev Products Co. Inc., v. I. Rokeach &amp; Sons, Inc., 2 Cir., December 24, 1941, 124 F.2d 147; United States v. Forness, 2 Cir., January 20, 1942, 125 F.2d 928, note 25; Hume v. Moore-McCormack Lines, 2 Cir., 1941, 121 F.2d 336, 342, 343 and notes 18-22. We do not say that impossibility will always excuse non-compliance with an arbitration clause, but merely that it did in The Wilja, on the facts there present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">The use of the phrase \u201crepudiation of the contract\u201d in connection with the application of arbitration clauses came into vogue beginning with Jureidini v. National British &amp; Irish Millers, Ins. Co., Ltd., [1915] A.C. 499. There a policy provided (1) that if the claim were fraudulent or the loss were caused by the wilful act of the insured, all benefit under the policy should be forfeited; (2) that if any difference arose as to the amounts of any loss, such difference should, independently of all other questions, be referred to arbitration, and that it should be a condition precedent to any right of action upon the policy that the award of the arbitrator of the amount of the loss, if disputed, should first be obtained. A loss occurred, but the defendant insurance company notified the plaintiff that it would not admit the claim on account of fraud and arson. When sued, the defendant pleaded (1) that the claim was fraudulent and (2) that there had been no compliance with the arbitration clause.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> At the trial, the jury found that there was no fraud or arson, and the court assessed the damages and entered judgment against the defendant. The House of Lords, on appeal, sustained the judgment, Lo-rd Haldane saying that the arbitration clause was inapplicable, as the defendant had \u201crepudiated the claim altogether.\u201d Lord Dunedin, however, remarked (p. 507), \u201cPersonally I should rather like to reserve my opinion as to what would have been the effect if the respondents, instead of pleading as they did, had pled in this way: \u2018We will allow this question to be disposed of at law by a jury as to whether there was fraud or arson or not,\u2019 and had gone on to say, \u2018but in the event of that being negatived, we wish this ascertainment of actual damage to be ascertained by arbitration.\u2019 I should like to reserve my opinion on whether they might have said so with effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-11\">The Jureidini case has been criticized by Williston.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In a subsequent case, in 1922, Lord Dunedin endeavored to explain it on the ground that there the particular arbitration clause was not sufficiently broad to cover the controversy. See Sanderson &amp; Son v. Armour &amp; Co., (1922) S.C. (H.L.) 117.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The latter case, however, involving Scotch law \u2014 never hostile to executory arbitrations \u2014 serves to show that the true explanation of the Jureidini case is the continuance in the English courts of their old unfriendliness; see the differentiation, on that ground, in the Sanderson &amp; Son case, of an earlier decision, Municipal Council of Johannesburg v. D. Stewart &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>Co., (1909) S.C. (H.L.) 53. Our Arbitration Act should, we think, be regarded as a direction to us to forget the English attitude; we may, therefore, be guided by the spirit of the Scotch rather than by that of the English decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">The phrase \u201crepudiation of the contract,\u201d as used by Lord Haldane in the Jureidini case, was incidentally referred to in The Atlanten, 1920, 252 U.S. 313, 40 S.Ct. 332, 64 L.Ed. 586, which arose before the enactment of the Arbitration Act of 1925. That was a suit against a Swedish corporation, owner of a steamship, for a breach of a charter party made in Denmark. Before any voyage was made, the owner refused to perform, and, when sued, set up the arbitration clause of the agreement which read: \u201cIf any dispute arises the same to be settled by two referees, one to be appointed by the Captain and one by charterers or their agents, and if necessary, the arbitrators to appoint an Umpire.\u201d It was alleged that by the laws of Denmark and Sweden such a provision was binding as an effective condition precedent.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The court said that the refusal to perform \u201cwas not a \u2018dispute\u2019 of the kind referred to in the arbitration clause\u201d because \u201cthe withdrawal was before the voyage began and it is absurd to suppose that the captain, who might be anywhere in the world, was to be looked up and to pick an arbitrator in such a case.\u201d Due to that fact \u2014 the provision for selection of an arbitrator by the captain \u2014 the court said, \u201cThe clause obviously referred to disputes that might arise while the parties were trying to go on with the execution of the contract,\u201d and added, \u201cnot to a repudiation of the substance of the contract, as it is put by Lord Haldane in Jureidini v. National British &amp; Irish Millers Co., Ltd., [1915] A.C. 499, 505.\u201d That reference to the Jureidini case was thus made merely in passing, and was not at all necessary to the court\u2019s reasoning or decision. The Atlanten, then, turned on the construction of the particular arbitration clause involved in that case which was markedly different from that we have before us in the case at bar. In Shanferoke Coal &amp; Supply Corp. v. Westchester S. Corp., 2 Cir., 1934, 70 F.2d 297, 299 affirmed 293 U.S. 449, 55 S.Ct. 313, 79 L.Ed. 583, in which we discussed and applied the Arbitration Act of 1925,<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> we expressly said that we were leaving open the question whether the \u201crepudiation\u201d idea expressed in the Jureidini case was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">The order of the district court is reversed and the cause is remanded with directions to proceed in accordance with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1040-18\"> Appellant\u2019s motion to amend its answer we shall discuss later. -</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"azp-dedup-1\"> Matton Oil Transfer Corp. v.

Report No. 96.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24a\">\n<p id=\"b1045-10\"> The United States Arbitration Act of 1925 was not the first evidence that Congress was not in sympathy with judicial hostility to arbitration. In I860, foreign service officers were assigned the duty of encouraging the settlement of disputes by arbitration. These officers were, and still are, authorized to prepare submissions, accept acknowledgments, and indorse such awards. See 22 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 161. The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 authorized the submission to arbitration of disputes arising in the settlement of estates. The provision is \u00a7 26 of the present Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 49. There is an arbitration provision in the Suits in Admiralty Act of 1920, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 786. Since 1809 it has been a criminal offense for an arbitrator acting under a federal act to accept a bribe. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 239. This trend toward encouraging arbitration has not waned. An arbitration provision was included in the Federal Prison Industries Act of 1930, 18 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 744g, and the Norris-La Guardia Act bars injunctive relief to a complainant who has failed to make a reasonable effort to settle a labor dispute by arbitration. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 108. There are also elaborate provisions for arbitration in the Railway Labor Act of 1926, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 157-159.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1045-13\"> See Section 3 of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b1045-14\"> The situation would be different if a separate arbitration agreement had been made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b1046-7\"> Conceivably parties might execute a writing which would include a clause to the effect that the writing should not be binding unless John Jones should decide that it contained necessary legal formalities. But we find it difficult to conceive of a case of an agreement containing an effective clause that a third person should determine whether the parties had ever talked about the agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1046-14\"> But cf. McCullough v. Clinch-Mitchell Const. Co., 8 Cir., 71 F.2d 17, 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1046-15\"> While it is not literally so worded, we treat, as an application for a stay, the new matter in the amended answer which appellant asked leave to file.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1047-9\"> Note the statement in the Congressional Committee\u2019s report: \u201cAn arbitration agreement is placed upon the same footing as other contracts, where it belongs.\u201d But no other contracts will be ordered to be specifically enforced where the customary equitable factors are absent. Other portions of that report, previously quoted, state that the purpose of the Act was to get rid of the effects of the earlier judicial hostility to arbitration contracts. To interpret the Act as precluding equitable considerations when a court is asked to order specific performance is to do far more than that.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1047-10\"> Some courts which have interpreted such statutory provisions as requiring an automatic granting of specific performance, have used indirect methods of importing equitable considerations; they have, in order to circumvent that interpretation, resorted to artificial interpretations of the terms of particular arbitration provisions, or narrow constructions of the statutory procedural requirements, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-11\">See Phillips, A Lawyer\u2019s Approach to Commercial Arbitration, 44 Yale L.J.

For where their position has been accepted, litigation \u2014 which the arbitration statutes are designed to reduce \u2014 is augmented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-15\">The more enthusiastic of those sponsors have thought of arbitration as a universal panacea. We doubt whether it will cure corns or bring general beatitude. New panaceas work as well as advertised. Almost always those who propose one think solely of the disadvantages of an older method which they criticize, forget its advantages, and disregard evils which may attend the reform.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1048-6\"> That is, it tried so to plead in its amended answer.

They are disregarding the condition altogether, in spite of the fact that as a matter of English its meaning is perfectly plain, because the particular contingency which has arisen, though the language of the contract is wide enough to include it, was presumably not intended by the parties to be covered. This inference is often drawn where the only reason the court has for supposing that the parties did not have in mind the contingency is that the terms of the contract if literally applied produce a harsh and unreasonable result * * * Very likely this is true, but the reason which leads the court to believe it is true is not anything in the language of the condition\u2014 the meaning of the words is perfectly plain. What influences the court is the fact that it is so unfair and harsh to make the condition applicable in view of the situation which has arisen, that the belief is reasonable. Where language is of doubtful meaning, unquestionably a fair meaning rather than a harsh one is properly chosen on ordinary principles of interpretation. It is reasonable to suppose in such a case that the parties meant what was fair rather than what was not. Where, however, the language of the contract is not ambiguous, and the court refuses to apply it in a particular instance because it works hardship, the court under the disguise of interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>is in fact giving relief from the terms of the contract on principles analogous to those which have influenced courts of equity in relieving from forfeiture *\u2022 * *\u201d Cf.
