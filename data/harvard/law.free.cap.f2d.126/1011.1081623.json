T.A. 1123) redetermining the income taxes of the respondent for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-25\">The case involves the right of the owner of a leasehold interest in a tract of coal land to aggregate the income from its own operations on a part of the land with the income received from a sublessee for operations on another part of the land for percentage depletion purposes under \u00a7 114(b) (4) of the Revenue Act of 1934, 26 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 701, and article 23 (m)-l(b) and (j) of Regulations 86 promulgated thereunder. The pertinent parts of the statute and of the regulations are copied in the footnote.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">The facts were stipulated. The respondent, Jewel Mining Company, was, during the fiscal year, a Delaware corporation. On July 1, 1930, it acquired a leasehold interest in a mineral property comprising 800 acres; more or less, of coal land in the state of Arkansas. It continued to hold the leasehold interest during the year. Prior to and during the year respondent operated a mine on a portion of the acreage. From these operations it reported a net income from the sale of coal in the amount of $732.36. Its gross income for the same period, exclusive of royalties to its lessor, was in the sum of $201,469.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">Prior to the beginning of the fiscal year respondent subleased another part of the acreage to Blue Ribbon Mining Company, a corporation, and on account of coal mining operations on the portion subleased the Blue Ribbon Mining Company paid respondent gross royalties in the sum of $4,-889.26, of which sum respondent paid to its lessor $2,194.41, leaving a net income to the respondent for the operations of the sublessee (without allowing depletion) of $2,694.85.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-17\">In its income tax return for the taxable year the respondent claimed a percentage depletion in the amount of $2,191.56 computed on the basis of the combined net income from its own operations and the royalties received from the sublessee. The Commissioner in calculating a deficiency computed percentage depletion separately on the income from respondent\u2019s own operations, limiting it to 50% of the net income from that source, or $366.18, and on the royalties received from the sublessee in the sum of $134.74, making a total depletion allowance of $500.92. The difference in the two methods of figuring results in an allowable deduction for depletion of $1,-690.64 ($2,191.56 less $500.92) less than claimed by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-18\">The controversy turns on the proper construction to be placed upon \u00a7 114(b) (4) of the Revenue Act of 1934 and article 23 (m)-l(b) and (j) of Regulations 86, supra. The respondent contends (1) that the word \u201cproperty\u201d in the statute includes the entire 800 acre tract and covers the mining plants and operations carried on by respondent on a portion thereof and the plant and operations of the sublessee on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>another portion; and (2) that, assuming that the sublease separated the 800 acres into two mineral properties, both are \u201cincluded in a single tract or parcel of land\u201d within the meaning of article 23(m)-l(j) of Regulations 86, and therefore must be considered to be a single property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">In its decision the Board assumed, without deciding, that the mineral interest covered by the sublease is a separate property from that in the acreage retained and operated by the taxpayer. A similar question had been before the Board in cases involving oil leases, and the Board had held in those cases that when a taxpayer had granted leases to different oil companies under separate leases the taxpayer had as many separate properties for purposes of computing depletion as he had given leases. J. T. Sneed, Jr., v. Commissioner, 40 B.T.A. 1136, affirmed in Sneed v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 119 F.2d 767; Allie M. Turbeville v. Commissioner, 31 B.T.A. 283, affirmed in Turbeville v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 84 F.2d 307; Vinton Petroleum Co. of Texas v. Commissioner, 28 B.T.A. 549, affirmed in Vinton Petroleum Co. of Texas v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 71 F.2d 420. These cases were not considered by the Board to be controlling of the question in the present case. We accordingly look to the law and the regulations themselves to determine whether the mineral property included in the sublease and operated by the sublessee and the mineral property retained and operated by the taxpayer constitute separate properties or a single property within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">Construing the statute and the regulations together it is clear that \u201cin the case of coal mines\u201d the term \u201cthe property\u2019! means \u201cthe interest owned by the taxpayer, freehold or leasehold, in any mineral property\u201d, that is in \u201cthe mineral deposit, the development and plant necessary for its extraction, and so much of the surface of the land only as is necessary for purposes of mineral .extraction.\u201d All the terms of the definition are in the singular number and seem to imply and to have reference to a single coal mine operated by its owner and including the coal deposit to be extracted, the plant used in the operation of the mine, and that part of the surface necessary for the purpose of extraction of the coal. Each separate coal mine independently operated by its owner constitutes a separate \u201cproperty\u201d for'all practical purposes in computing depletion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">The Board sustained the respondent s second contention, holding (1) that the two properties are \u201cincluded in a single tract or parcel of land\u201d within the meaning of the regulation and that for the purpose of computing depletion they must be considered a single property, and (2) that since the respondent was engaged in mining operations similar to those of its sublessee, the mining of the sublease was an integral part of respondent\u2019s own business enterprise, thus giving the taxpayer the right to lump together with its own revenue the income produced from the sublease for the purpose of computing depletion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">The important problem to be determined, therefore, on this review is whether \u201cthe taxpayer\u2019s interest\u201d in the two properties \u201cmay be considered to be a single \u2018property\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of article 23 (m)-1(b) and (j) of Regulations 86. The test prescribed is that</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">1. The income from both properties must be consistently treated by the taxpayer as arising from a single property in computing depletion allowance;</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">2. There must be an \u201cinterest\u201d \u201cowned by the taxpayer\u201d in both properties; and</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-11\">3. The two properties must be \u201cincluded in a single tract or parcel of land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-12\">Unless all of these conditions coexist the income from the two properties may not be combined for the purpose of computing depletion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-13\">The first requirement is not in dispute. The Board found the fact to be that the respondent had \u201cconsistently treated the income from its own operations and those of its sublessee as arising from a single property in computing depletion allowance.\u201d Although we find no testimony in the record, and nothing in the stipulation of facts, to support such finding, the Commissioner made no complaint with reference to it. We accept the finding as satisfying the first element of the required test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-14\">The second element of the test is that the taxpayer must own an \u201cinterest\u201d in both \u201cmineral properties\u201d in order to consider them to be a single \u201cproperty\u201d for the purpose of computing depletion. In considering the application of this test two questions arise in respect of the meaning of the word \u201cinterest\u201d as used in the regulation. They are:' (1) What is the nature of the \u201cinterest\u201d which the taxpayer must own in the properties ? And (2) must the interest of the taxpayer in the two properties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>be identical? The answer to both these questions should be found in article 23 (m)l(j) of Regulations 86. The word \u201cinterest\u201d is used three times in subsection (j) and is apparently used in the same sense in each instance. There is nothing to indicate that it has a different signification in any case. First, the text reads, \u201cThe property\u201d, as used in the statute, \u201cmeans the <em>interest </em>owned by the taxpayer, <em>freehold or leasehold, </em>in any mineral property\u201d; second, \u201cThe taxpayer\u2019s <em>interest </em>in each separate mineral property is a separate \u2018property\u2019 \u201d; and, third, \u201cwhere two or more mineral properties are included in a single tract or parcel of land, the taxpayer\u2019s <em>interest </em>in such mineral properties may be considered to' be a single \u2018property.\u2019 \u201d (Italics supplied.) We think the inference is inescapable that the word \u201cinterest\u201d is used throughout the regulation to mean a freehold or a leasehold estate in a mineral property. Nothing seems plainer. No amplification of words could make the meaning clearer. It is equally clear that the \u201cinterest\u201d of the taxpayer in the properties, the income from which is sought to be combined or lumped together for computing depletion, must be either a freehold or a leasehold. The words \u201cfreehold\u201d and \u201cleasehold\u201d appear to be used in an exclusive sense. The taxpayer must own the mineral property either as a freehold, that is absolutely, or as a leasehold, that is, as lessee. No other combination of interest is provided for.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">Before applying the conclusion thus drawn from the context of subsection (j), a further inquiry is necessary. It is: What is included in the property in which the taxpayer is required to own a freehold or a leasehold estate? As observed in the preceding paragraph, subsection (j) reads: \u201cThe property\u201d, as used in the statute, \u201cmeans the interest owned by the taxpayer, freehold or leasehold, in any mineral property.\u201d Subsection (b) provides: \u201cA \u2018mineral property\u2019 is [1] the mineral deposit, [2] the development and plant necessary for its extraction, and [3] so much of the surface of the land only as is necessary for purposes of mineral extraction.\u201d The \u201cinterest\u201d of the taxpayer, therefore, in the mineral properties, the income from which is sought to be combined as derived from a single property, must include these three factors, (1) the mineral deposit, (2) the plant for its extraction, and (3) the necessary surface of the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">It scarcely requires further analysis \u201e to disclose that the taxpayer in the present case is not entitled to combine the income from its own operations with the royalties received from its sublessee for the purpose of computing depletion. At the mine operated by the taxpayer it has. a leasehold estate in the mineral deposit and in the necessary surface of the land, and it owns outright the plant, furnishes the capital and manages and controls the business operations connected with extracting and marketing the coal. At the other mine the taxpayer owns a covering leasehold, but it does not own the plant nor furnish the capital to operate it;' and it has no control over the management. Its \u201cinterest\u201d in the \u201cmineral property\u201d and the mining operations is neither freehold nor leasehold. In granting a sublease to the Blue Ribbon Mining Company, the taxpayer, in so far as it. could legally do so, divested itself of its rights in that part of the 800 acre tract included in the sublease, retaining only the right to receive and distribute the royalties provided for in the sublease and the obligation to account according to the provisions of its own lease with its lessor. The situation does not come within the provisions of subsection- (j) of the regulation authorizing the taxpayer\u2019s interest in two or more mineral properties to be considered a single property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">In its opinion in this case the Board observes that \u201cthere must be some practical reason for the treatment of the two properties as one and that such a course of action arises not alone from the mere fact of common ownership. In the instant case, the petitioner [respondent] was engaged in mining operations similar to those of its sublessee, the mining of the sublease was an integral part of its own business enterprise.\u201d It was held that this was \u201cgood cause\u201d for the taxpayer \u201cto treat the proceeds from both sources as arising from its own business operations.\u201d This seems to us to be based upon a ground outside the regulations and upon facts not found to exist. Ownership by the taxpayer of an \u201cinterest\u201d in both mineral properties, inclusion of both properties in a \u201csingle tract or parcel of land\u201d, and consistent treatment in the method of computing depletion are the only requirements of the regulation to justify the aggregation of the incomes from two- or more properties for allowance of percentage depletion. To add similarity of operations is to amend the regulations. Further, there are no facts to support the con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>elusion that the mining of the sublease was an integral part of the taxpayer\u2019s own business operations. The facts found by the Board are inconsistent with such a conclusion. Inherent in the concept of a business enterprise is the idea of an investment of capital, labor, and management in an undertaking for profit. One of the recognized attributes of a \u201cbusiness enterprise\u201d is centralized management and control. This fact has been frequently referred to and often emphasized in tax cases. Morrissey v. Commissioner, 296 U.S. 344, 359, 56 S.Ct. 289, 80 L.Ed. 263; Zonne v. Minneapolis Syndicate, 220 U.S. 187, 191, 31 S.Ct. 361, 55 L.Ed. 428; Von Baumbach, Collector, v.

Town of Oak Creek, 161 Wis. 211, 153 N.W. 241, 243, Ann.Cas.1918A, 421; United States v. Emery, Bird, Thayer Realty Company, 237 U.S. 28, 35 S.Ct. 499, 59 L.Ed. 825; McCoach v. Minehill &amp; Schuylkill Haven Railroad Co., 228 U.S. 295, 33 S.Ct. 419, 57 L. Ed. 842. The taxpayer and its sublessee in this case were both coal mining corporations. There is no finding that the taxpayer either owned an interest in or participated in the management and control of the business enterprise of its sublessee. The mining operations of the two corporations were distinct and separate. In the Zonne case, supra, the Supreme Court held that a corporation owning and leasing land for business purposes, but not participating in the \u201ccontrol and management of the property\u201d [220 U.S. 187, 31 S.Ct. 362, 55 L.Ed. 428], was not \u201cdoing business\u201d within the meaning of the Corporation Tax Law, 36 Stat. 112, although the lessor collected the rentals and distributed them according to the provisions of its charter. To the same effect was the decision in United States v. Emery, Bird, Thayer Realty Company, supra. In McCoach v. Minehill &amp; Schuylkill Haven Railroad Co., supra, it was held that a railroad company which leases its lines to another railroad company without retaining any part in the control and management of its operations is not engaged in business. These cases hold that it is what a corporation does, not what it has power to do, which determines the question; doing business means to control and manage those activities which are pursued for \u201cprofit and gain ; and merely collecting and distributing rents and royalties as lessor is not such a business activity. In the present case the business enterprises of the taxpayer and of its sub-lessee are entirely distinct and separate. Neither was an integral part of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">We hold that the unity of \u201cinterest\u201d required by the regulation in the two \u201cmineral properties\u201d involved is wanting, and that therefore the taxpayer was not warranted in combining the income from both properties for the purpose of computing depletion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">The result reached in the preceding paragraph makes it unnecessary to determine whether the two properties involved in this case are \u201cincluded in a single tract or parcel of land.\u201d Whether they are so included or not is immaterial in view of the taxpayer\u2019s limited interest in the \u201cmineral property\u201d included in the sublease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">The decision of the Board is reversed and. the determination of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1072-6\"> Revenue Act of 1934, c. 277, 48 Stat. 680, 26 U.S.C.A.
