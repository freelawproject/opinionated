HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b820-12\">This case arises upon an appeal, taken by leave of this court, from an order of the bankruptcy court which affirmed the order of a referee. The appellant is the trustee in bankruptcy, and moved before the referee to expunge a claim for $309.34 filed by the appellee, a creditor of the debt- or, insofar as it asserted priority over the debts existing at petition filed. The referee denied the motion and granted the priority, and the trustee appealed to the district court. The motion before the referee was apparently directed only against the priority of the claim, though the record is not altogether clear; in any event since we hold that it has priority, a for-tiori we hold that it is provable.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">The facts were as follows. The debtor was a corporation doing business in New York, against which an involuntary petition for adjudication was filed on March 25, 1939, and which on March 30th filed a petition for an \u201carrangement\u201d under Chapter XI, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 701 et seq. The court from time to time authorized the continuation of the business until June 15th, on which day it confirmed an amended \u201carrangement\u201d by which the debtor promised to pay all administration expenses and priority claims and thirty per cent of the claims of creditors in installments within eighteen months. In the event of default upon any installment a creditors\u2019 committee, named in the plan, might apply \u201cfor immediate liquidation.\u201d The debtor was to deliver all its shares endorsed in blank to this committee, who should hold them till the last installment was paid, and who were to be elected and to serve as directors in place of the former directors then in office. The only officer was to be a president; he was to have no authority to dispose of the assets in bulk without consent of the committee, and any money borrowed was to be \u201cSubordinate to the rights of present creditors.\u201d The court was to retain jurisdiction over the debtor and its assets until payment of the last installment. All this was carried out; the committee, appointed by the vote of the creditors, took charge of the business and continued it in the debtor\u2019s name; and while doing so, bought necessary supplies in the debtor\u2019s name from the creditor at bar. The debtor failed to meet the installments, the committee demanded liquidation, an adjudication was entered on January 10, 1940, and a trustee appointed, who made this motion. The question is whether the debt so incurred has any priority over the unpaid balance of the old debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-15\">Section 377(1) provides, in a case where the \u201carrangement\u201d supervenes upon a pending bankruptcy proceeding, and the court has retained jurisdiction over the proceeding after confirmation \u2014 as it may if the plan so provides (\u00a7 368) \u2014 -that upon the debtor\u2019s default in carrying out its terms the court \u201cshall * * * enter an order dismissing the proceeding under this chapter and adjudging the debtor a bankrupt * * * and directing that the bankruptcy be proceeded with pursuant to the provisions of this act.\u201d That was done here; the proceeding was dismissed and the debtor was adjudicated. Section 64, sub. b provides that debts contracted after a discharge or the confirmation of an \u201carrangement\u201d shall have priority in the ensuing bankruptcy proceeding over the old debts \u201cin the event of a revocation of the discharge or setting aside of the confirmation.\u201d This section \u2014 although then somewhat obscurely worded and numbered \u00a7 64, sub. c \u2014 was in the original act of 1898 and remained unchanged until the Chandler Act was passed in 1938. Until then there was no ground for reopening a composition except fraud (In re Isidor Klein, Inc., 2 Cir., 22 F.2d. 906); nor did the bankrupt\u2019s default in meeting his engagements made in the composition revive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>the old debts. In re Mirkus, 2 Cir., 289 F. 732, 31 A.L.R. 435; In re Kornbluth, 2 Cir., 65 F.2d 400; Jacobs v. Fensterstock, 236 N.Y. 39, 139 N.E. 772. The common law treated the composition merely as an accord and satisfaction (In re Nachman Co., 2 Cir., 6 F.2d 427), and it remained doubtful what the law was upon the point under the Act of 1867 as amended in 1874. Ransom v. Geer, C.C., 12 F. 607; Deford v. Hewlett, 49 Md. 51. When \u00a7 386 took the place of \u00a7 13, nothing of substance was changed except that the court was given an option as to its course after the confirmation was set aside. Without more the confirmation would have remained a discharge in all cases (\u00a7 371) although the debtor defaulted upon his promises, just as it had before 1938. And that is still true in cases where the court does not \u201cretain jurisdiction\u201d over the proceeding by virtue of a provision in the plan (\u00a7 368). But, as we have seen, it is no longer true if the court does \u201cretain jurisdiction,\u201d for then the \u201carrangement proceeding\u201d must be \u201cdismissed\u201d and that of course revives the old debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">Thus, the question before us is whether when an \u201carrangement proceeding\u201d is \u201cdismissed\u201d under \u00a7 377 (1) because of the bankrupt\u2019s default, \u00a7 64, sub. b, applies, as it concededly does when only the order of confirmation is \u201cset aside\u201d for fraud under \u00a7 386. Except for the change in language \u2014 the substitution of \u201cdismissing the proceeding\u201d in \u00a7 377(1), for \u201c[setting] aside the confirmation\u201d in \u00a7 386\u2014 there could be no doubt. The reasons which could move Congress to provide an ad interim protection for new debts incurred during the period of trying out the bankrupt\u2019s power to survive, apply equally whether he defaults or whether he has been fraudulent in the composition proceeding. True, it may be argued that the new creditors have less reason to anticipate his fraud than his default, but there are weighty enough equities in their favor in the second case also; for the underlying theory must be that he shall have a chance to establish himself again, and that he cannot have unless he can do business upon equal terms with his competitors; it is idle to ask him to fight his way with one arm tied. Yet if any new creditors who sell to him must accept the possibility that if he fails to perform the \u201carrangement\u201d they must share with the old creditors (not to the extent of the payments fixed in the composition which presumably have been so far scaled down as to be supportable, but to that of the whole sum of the old debts), they are extremely likely not to deal with him at all. Unless he can assure them as to the amount of his actual liabilities without a contingent addition of the old debts, he will start with a handicap in a race which he has already once lost. As for the words, \u201cdismissing the proceeding,\u201d they are apt enough. The order of confirmation is the consummation of the \u201carrangement proceeding\u201d which cannot be \u201cdismissed\u201d unless that order is \u201cset aside\u201d along with everything else.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">From the foregoing discussion it appears that the omission from the \u201carrangement\u201d of the provision authorized by subdivision 6 of \u00a7 357 was immaterial; it does not touch any priorities between the old debts and new ones incurred after confirmation. On the contrary, it is meant merely to authorize granting priority to debts incurred after petition filed and before the order of confirmation, and presumably it falls if the whole proceeding is \u201cdismissed\u201d under \u00a7 377. (In that event we may assume, arguendo, though we do not decide, that the word, \u201cadjudication,\u201d in \u00a7 63, sub. b is not then to be construed as \u00a7 352 requires; at least that would to some extent make allowable debts incurred after petition filed, and before the confirmation of an \u201carrangement.\u201d) This interpretation of the words, \u201cpendency of the arrangement,\u201d in subdivision 6 of \u00a7 357 does indeed confine them to the period ending with the order of confirmation, but that is indicated elsewhere in the chapter. Thus, \u00a7 344 expressly distinguishes between the \u201cpendency of a proceeding for an arrangement\u201d and the period \u201cafter the confirmation * * * where the court has retained \u00abjurisdiction\u201d; and while \u00a7 391 is not so plain, yet if the words \u201cwhile a proceeding * * ' * is pending\u201d had been thought to include the period after confirmation in cases where the court retains jurisdiction, the concluding phrase, \u201cand until it is finally dismissed,\u201d was redundant.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-9\">We need scarcely add that we cannot agree with the creditor\u2019s position that its debt, or any like it, is an \u201cexpense of administration\u201d; the period of \u201cadministration\u201d certainly ends no later than the entry of the order of confirmation. On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>other hand, it is clear that the trustee cannot avail himself of the provision in the \u201carrangement\u201d against borrowing. In the first place, borrowing money is altogether different from buying on credit; consent to the usual terms of doing business was implied in the consent to do business at all. But even more conclusive is the circumstance that, as the business was conducted by the creditors, it was they who gave the credits, and they certainly may not now assert against those of whom they bought that the promises they made were invalid because of a provision in the \u201carrangement\u201d obviously designed only for their own protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
