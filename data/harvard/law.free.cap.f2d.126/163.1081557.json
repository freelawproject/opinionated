As income from these transactions, petitioner reported $7,-575.88.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-23\">The Commissioner determined, and the Board agreed, that the 8,000 shares had, when issued to petitioner, a fair market value of $3.38 a share \u2014 a total of $27,040. Accordingly the Board held that the 6,790 shares remaining to petitioner after transferring 1,210 shares to the other promoters had, when issued to petitioner, a fair market value of $22,950.20. Deducting therefrom the amount ($9,594.53) of petitioner\u2019s advances, the Board held that the balance ($13,355.67) was income to petitioner. The Board further held that the 5,044 shares which petitioner transferred to its creditors had, in petitioner\u2019s hands, a cost basis of $3.38 a share \u2014 a total of $17,048.72 \u2014and that petitioner, therefore, in obtaining satisfaction of debts aggregating $21,-198.38 in exchange for said shares, realized a net gain of $4,149.66. Thus the Board held that, instead of $7,575.88, petitioner should have reported as income $17,505.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Petitioner contends that the 8,000 shares issued to it were void under the provisions of the California Corporate Securities Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, being void, had no value. The record discloses no basis for this contention. The shares were issued by a Nevada corporation, not by a California corporation. They were issued in Nevada,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> not in California. In its petition for review petitioner states that the shares were delivered to it in California. The statement has no support in the record. The record does not show where the shares were delivered. Whether or not a California permit was secured does not appear, nor is it material, the record disclosing no necessity for such a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The Commissioner\u2019s determination that the 8,000 shares had, when issued to petitioner, a fair market value of $3.38 a share was presumptively correct. Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 115, 54 S.Ct. 8, 78 L.Ed. 212; Old Mission Portland Cement Co. v. Helvering, 293 U.S. 289, 294, 55 S.Ct. 158, 79 L.Ed. 367; Theatre Investment Co. v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 119 F.2d 477, 479. The burden of proving it incorrect rested on petitioner. Lucas v. Kansas City Structural Steel Co., 281 U.S. 264, 271, 50 S.Ct. 263, 74 L.Ed. 848; Welch v. Helvering, supra; Helvering v. Taylor, 293 U.S. 507, 512-516, 55 S.Ct. 287, 79 L.Ed. 623; Theatre Investment Co. v. Commissioner, supra. The burden was not sustained. No proof was offered as to the value of the shares. Lacking such proof, the Board accepted, as we do, the Commissioner\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Petitioner\u2019s return for 1933 was admittedly not filed within the time prescribed by law or by the Commissioner in pursuance of law.' It was not shown that the failure to file it was due to reasonable cause and not due to wilful neglect. Petitioner, therefore, was properly held subject to the penalty (25% of the tax) prescribed in \u00a7 291 of the Revenue Act of 1932.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-24\"> 43 B.T.A. 520.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b223-25\"> Revenue Act 1932, \u00a7 291, 26 U.S.C.A.
