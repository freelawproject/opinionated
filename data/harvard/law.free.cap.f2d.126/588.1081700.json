The taxpayer had at all times, until it came before us, taken an all- or-nothing attitude toward the allowance of the claimed deduction. At no time did it suggest to the Commissioner that if 100% of the debt was not deductible, some smaller portion should be allowed as a deduction. Nor did it request the Board to determine whether there was partial worthlessness. We think that it is now too late to ask for such a determination. For the Commissioner, by yirtue of the statutory provision<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that he \u201cmay\u201d allow a partial deduction, has some measure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of discretion in passing on a claim of partial worthlessness; an exercise of that discretion is a prerequisite to any review of his action by the Board. The taxpayer\u2019s position would require, in effect, that, if the debt was not wholly valueless in 1936, not only should we remand to the Board, but also that the Board should postpone decision until the Commissioner has decided whether he will allow a partial deduction of the debt. The litigation is too far advanced for such a disposition of the case. The only issue we can consider, therefore, is whether the debt was deductible in toto.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>2. In holding that it was not, the Board said, at the conclusion of its opinion: \u201cIn sum, the record does not present a picture of such hopelessness or worthlessness as, in our judgment, to warrant a reasonable man in concluding that the account was worthless.\u201d The taxpayer asserts that this \u201cobjective\u201d standard is not legally pertinent, but that the Board should have applied a \u201csubjective test,\u201d i. e., it should have determined whether this particular taxpayer, in good faith, believed in 1936 that the debt was worthless. That argument is founded on a surprising misinterpretation of some of our decisions. We have held that, if a debt actually becomes worthless in a given year, the taxpayer, notwithstanding that a reasonably prudent person would in that year so have believed, may deduct the debt in a later year, provided that, in good faith and without \u201cshutting his eyes,\u201d he then first ascertained the fact as to its worthlessness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But there is no room for any element of subjectivity with reference to the issue whether, in fact, the debt lacked value. That a taxpayer, whatever may be his good faith, believes a debt to be valueless does not make it so. Only debts which have no value (in whole or in part) are deductible. The statute speaks of \u201cdebts ascertained to be worthless,\u201d and (no matter what some persons may assert in the realm of metaphysics) for tax purposes one cannot be said to ascertain what in truth does not exist.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The personal illusions of the individual taxpayer as to that fact cannot reduce his taxes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While, then, we have held that a taxpayer\u2019s innocent failure to discover a debtor\u2019s insolvency may, in some circumstances, justify postponement of the date of deduction of a bad debt, we did not say or imply that an innocent but erroneous belief in such insolvency warranted an acceleration of that date. \u201cThe failure to \u2018ascertain\u2019 that a debt has become \u2018bad\u2019 in the year that it becomes so has nothing in common with mistakenly \u2018ascertaining\u2019 that it has become bad when it has not.\u201d [124 F.2d 476.]<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As to that fact, the \u201csubjective test\u201d is irrelevant. And the views of the lawyers\u2019 jack-of-all trades, \u201cthe reasonable man,\u201d constitute objectivity for legal purposes. Consequently, the Board correctly used as a yardstick what a reasonable man would have concluded as to the worthlessness of the debt in question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">3. It is plain that there was substantial evidence to sustain the Board\u2019s findings that the debt was not wholly worthless. $6,380.80 of that debt was secured by a conditional sale title to certain tanks. Even if we regarded nothing except the testimony on which the taxpayer relies, that secured portion of the debt was not devoid of all value. For taxpayer\u2019s President testified that the tanks had \u201ca marketable value\u201d of not less than 10% of their sale price of $7,230.80. The secured part of the debt, then, was worth at least $723.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Assuming, arguendo, that the unsecured portion of the debt constituted a separate claim, there is ample evidence to sustain the Board\u2019s finding that it, too, was not without some value. The debtor, before and in 1936, and down to the date of the hearing before the Board in October, 1940, was in reorganization proceedings under Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act. It is the duty of the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss such a proceeding when there is <em>no </em>longer a likelihood of consummating a reorganization plan. See 3 Gerdes, Corporate Reorganizations (1936) pp. 1837-1840 and cases cited. Moreover, there is no evidence that the taxpayer or any other creditor ever suggested such a dismissal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> These facts raise a strong presumption that reorganization was by no means hopeless, even if a particular plan, at one time pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>posed by the debtor, was not feasible. That presumption is not overcome by the testimony of taxpayer\u2019s President, Mayer, that one of the debtor\u2019s trustees in bankruptcy stated, late in 1936, that the estate could then pay nothing in cash to taxpayer, and that, if the creditors forced liquidation, they would receive nothing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Indeed, the continuance of the Section 77B proceeding might well be sufficient to sustain a finding that the debt was not even partially worthless; for it serves to show that reorganization is still to be regarded as likely; and there is no way of ascertaining what will be the value of the securities, in a reorganized going concern, which the taxpayer will receive. \u201cWhat has concluded that we should conclude about it?\u201d However, as shown above, that question of partial worthlessness is not before us.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The presumption is not overcome by the testimony of taxpayer\u2019s secretary, Mehler, that he came to the conclusion, after examining the debtor\u2019s plant, that it \u201cwould not bring\u201d more than $150,000. That was an estimate of liquidation, not going concern, value. Moreover, he was not qualified as an expert; on objection, it was explained by taxpayer\u2019s counsel that he was merely expressing \u201can opinion as * * * officer\u201d of the taxpayer. That explanation, coupled with another made in connection with the admission of an exhibit, discloses that this testimony was designed to prove the taxpayer\u2019s \u201csubjective\u201d attitude towards the worthlessness of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The exhibit just referred to was a report by the creditor\u2019s committee made in August, 1935. Considering the limited purpose for which it was offered in evidence, the Board was surely not in error in giving little weight to its statement of facts concerning the \u201cobjective\u201d financial condition of the debtor. We cannot say that the Board, which heard the witnesses, was not justified in giving less weight to that exhibit and to \u25a0Mehler\u2019s \u201cvaluation\u201d testimony than to debtor\u2019s book figures which showed a net worth \u2014 after deducting all preferred claims and a reasonable estimate of administration expenses \u2014 in excess of the unsecured claims.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And even if the \u201cvaluation\u201d figures of taxpayer\u2019s officers were considered conclusive, there would be something for the unsecured creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">The order of the Board of Tax Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\"> Revenue Act of 1936, e. 690, 49 Stat. 1648:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">\u201c\u00a7 23.

As of January 31, 1935, sales were roughly $475,000, gross profit on sales $134,000, net loss $81,000. As of January 31, 1936, sales rose to $634,-000, gross profit to $319,000, with a negligible net loss of $169.95. As of January 31, 1937, which includes most of the taxable year, sales rose further to $978,000, gross profit to $457,000, with a net loss of but $6,634.13. Though the book entries of value of assets are not conclusive, they are not to be ignored where the record contains no adequate proof showing substantially less values than those carried. In the face of the book records such as are here present, we can give little weight to the testimony of petitioner\u2019s secretary that the Burton plant would not bring more than $150,000. Further, it is noted that Burton had a surplus of $574,000, plus the surplus of the trustee of $73,000.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
