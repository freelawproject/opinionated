Robbery is defined by the statute to be <em>\u201c </em>the felonious and violent taking of money, goods, or other valuable thing from <em>the person </em>of another by force or intimidation.\u201d The indictment does not allege the taking in the present case from the person of another, but only from another person, which is quite a different thing. The demurrer should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
