He soon after surrendered the leased lot, with the building which was on it, and continued the business, under the same name, entirely in the building which he had erected on the lot he had purchased. Two months afterwards, the defendants, having purchased the first mentioned lot and building, opened there a hotel, under the name of \u201c The Original What Cheer House \u201d\u2014the word \u201c original \u201d being painted on the sign in small letters, and in a manner calculated to deceive the public into the supposition that it was the same name. In an action by W. against defendants, to restrain them from using the name of \u201cWhat Cheer House\u201d for their hotel: <em>Held, </em>that plaintiff was entitled to the relief sought, and that defendants should be enjoined from the use of the name.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b448-9\">Appeal from the Fourth Judicial District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-4\"><em>Delos Lake, </em>for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s right to relief is claimed on the general principles that recognize the right of property in a trade mark, and the question is whether it can fairly be brought within those \u00a1minciples. We say it cannot. The legal right and adjudged cases proceed solely on the ground of a valuable interest acquired in the good will of the trade or business, and that having appropriated a particular label, or sign, or trade mark, indicating that the article is of a certain person\u2019s manufacture, or sold by him, or by his authority, he is entitled to protection against any other person Avho attempts, by fraudulent and false imitations, to pirate upon the good will of the friends, or customers, or patrons, of the person Avhose business or goods have become knoAvn by his trade mark. (Willard\u2019s Equity, 206.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-6\">Judge Story states the rule thus: <em>\u201c </em>An injunction will be granted to prevent the use of names, marks, letters, or other <em>indicia </em>of a tradesman, by which to pass off goods to purchasers as the manufacture of that tradesman, Avhen they are not so.\u201d (Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. sec. 951.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-7\">At the foundation of the AA\u2019hole principle is the idea of falsehood. If a person appropriate certain signs, symbols, and marks, so that they become well knoAvn to the public, to all who see these exhibitions they are a declaration to the effect that the articles to Avhich such marks are in any Avay attached are the property, manufacture, or business of such person. Eor any other person to use or appropriate them in like business Avould be to declare, as plainly as direct words could declare, that the property or business was the property or business of the person whose symbols or marks were used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-8\">Noav how can this principle be applied to a name by Avhich a building has been long known and used as a hotel ? The name belongs to the building, and not especially to the business. In the very nature of the case it is not transferable. The public know the place by the name. To name a hotel the \u201c What Cheer House,\u201d \u201c Washington,\u201d \u201cJackson,\u201d \u201cAstor,\u201d or \u201cIrving House,\u201d is only to declare, after the name shall become known, the locality of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>house, and not who is the proprietor; and, therefore, it is no falsehood or deception for a tenant or owner who succeeds to the occupancy to retain the name by which the building is already known, because he does not thereby affirm that the former tenant carries on the business. That there is an advantage in succeeding a tenant who has established for the house a business character may be true, and doubtless is so, in many instances; but that is an accidental benefit, which no Court can prevent. It is, however, precisely what the Court in this case.is asked to prevent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-4\"><em>S. </em>Heydenfeldt, for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-5\">Courts of Equity will protect a party in the use of a trade mark, label, or sign, and where they are simulated, so as to deceive customers, the piracy will be checked by injunction. <em>(Patridge </em>v. Menck, 2 Barb. Ch. 101; <em>Knott </em>v. Morgan, 2 Kien, [E. C. R.] 219; <em>Taylor </em>v. Carpenter, 11 Paige, 292; <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Landjroye, </em>17 Barb. 608, and cases there cited; <em>Coats </em>v. <em>Holbrook, 2 </em>Sandf. Ch. 586, and cases there cited.) A similar case to the one at bar is <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Henriques </em>(3 Sand. S. C. 725). (See, also, <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Langdon, </em>7 Sim. 421; <em>Hogg </em>v. <em>Kirby, 2 </em>Ves. 226.) Even partial and colorable differences will not protect the piracy. ( <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>25 Barb. 76; <em>Brooklyn, White &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Masury, </em>Id. 406.) The principle is stated with distinctness by Judge Story. (2 Story\u2019s Eq. Jur. 951.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b450-6\">Norton, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"AWq\">Cope, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">This is an appeal from an order granting and an order refusing to dissolve an injunction by which the defendants are restrained from using the name of \u201c What Cheer House \u201d as the title or name of a hotel in the city of San Francisco.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Woodward, being the lessee of a lot of land, erected upon it a building, which he occupied as a hotel, and to which he gave the name of the \u201c What Cheer House.\u201d Before the expiration of his lease, he purchased an adjoining lot, upon which he erected a larger building, and for a time occupied both buildings as the \u201c What Cheer House,\u201d the principal sign being removed from the first and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>placed upon the second building. In November, 1860, he surrendered the leased premises, with the building he had erected on them, to the owners of the land, but continued to carry on the business of the \u201c What Cheer House \u201d in the building he had erected on the lot he had purchased. In January, 1861, the defendants purchased from the owners of the first mentioned lot and building, and opened there a hotel, under the name of the \u201cOriginal What Cheer House\u201d\u2014the word \u201coriginal\u201d being painted on the sign in smaller letters than the residue of the title, and disposed in such manner that it was calculated to deceive the public into the supposition that it was the same name.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">It has been decided, and with good reason, that the name established for a hotel is a trade mark, in which the proprietor has a valuable interest, which a Court of Chancery will protect against infringement. <em>(Howard </em>v. Henriques, 3 Sand. S. C. 725.) The point of dispute in the case is as to whom the name \u201c What Cheer House,\u201d as a business sign, belongs. The plaintiff claims that it belongs to him, as the keeper of the hotel, which he continued to conduct under that name after he surrendered the leased premises; while the defendants claim that it is the designation of the building in which the business under that name was first conducted, and became their\u2019s- when they became the owners of that building.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The character of the business which the name designates seems to determine that the name pertains to a building, or at least to a business conducted in a particular building, rather than to the calling of the person conducting the business. If a hotel-keeper creates a reputation for his business, it is as the keeper of some particular house at a known location. The \u201c What Cheer House \u201d cannot well be the business designation of a man separate from a house, though the converse may very well be. But conceding that the name of a hotel must pertain to some particular house, or be the trade mark of the person as the keeper of a particular house, it does not follow that the name becomes inseparably connected with the building to which it was first applied. The name is not a \u201c fixture.\u201d A person may have a right, interest, or property, in a particular name, which he has given to a particular house, and for which house, under the name given to it, a reputation and good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>will may have been acquired; but a tenant, by giving a particular name to a building which he applies to some particular use, as a sign of the business done at that place, does not thereby make the name a fixture to the building, and transfer it irrevocably to the landlord. In this case, it does not appear that the lessee was under obligation to establish any particular business on the demised premises. Doubtless, he might at any time have discontinued the business of a hotel-keeper, and established in its stead the business of a merchant, and for this purpose have discarded the business name he had used for Ms hotel. And if he could do that, it seems to follow that he might remove from the demised premises, and establish a hotel at another place, and give to it the name he had used at the first locality. This, in effect, is what the plaintiff did. Before surrendering the demised premises, he transferred Ms business, and the name under which it was conducted, to another building, and then surrendered the demised premises and the building, with no special name, to his landlords. He had conducted the business under the name of the \u201c What Cheer House,\u201d at his new locality, at least from November until January, while the old building remained unoccupied, and before it was opened as a hotel. He had in this time, if he had no other claim, established an exclusive right to the name as the trade mark for his new house. Although, therefore, his claim to protection, so far as Ms right results from -the good will acquired for the name while it was applied exclusively to the demised premises may not be sustainable, he is entitled to protection in the exclusive use of the name as proprietor of the new house.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
