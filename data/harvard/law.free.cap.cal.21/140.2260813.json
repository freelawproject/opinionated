The plaintiff declining to amend the complaint, final judgment was entered for the defendant. The premises are situated in Contra Costa County; and the description given is as follows: \u201c Commencing at a point in the Walnut Creek three hundred yards north of the Mt. Diablo base line; thence running due east two miles; thence due south to a point; thence due west to the source of said Walnut Creek; and thence down said creek to the place of beginning.\u201d The alleged insufficiency consists in the designation of the south-west corner as \u201c the <em>source of said Walnut Creek.\" </em>The description, it is contended, is indefinite and uncertain\u2014as there may in fact be several sources of the creek. It is true there may be several sources\u2014so there may be several channels; but if such be the case, the uncertainty of the description can only arise upon the proofs. In the absence of proof, we cannot presume such is the fact. The term <em>\u201c </em>source \u201d is defined by Webster as \u201c Properly, the spring or fountain from which a stream of water proceeds, or any collection of water within the earth or upon its surface in which a stream originates.\u201d The complaint designates it as a certain and definite place, and for the purposes of the demurrer the designation must be taken as true. There may not be in truth any Walnut Creek in the county, and the description given may in consequence be an impossible one; but if such be the case, the fact cannot be taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>advantage of by demurrer. It can only be matter for proof on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded, with leave to the defendant to answer upon payment of costs upon the demurrer and of the appeal in this Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
