The indictment was indorsed as follows: \u201c In Court of Sessions, Calaveras County, January Term, A. D. 1862. <em>The People </em>v. <em>William Lawrence </em>and <em>John P. Orims. </em>Indictment for murder. Filed January 10th, 1862. G. F. Wesson, Clerk of Court of Sessions, by A. W. Genung, Deputy. Witnesses, W. A. Kelly, Emeline Lawrence. W. J. Gatewood, District Attorney.\u201d After a jury had been empanneled and sworn upon a plea of \u201c not</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>guilty,\u201d defendant moved to be discharged, on the ground that the indictment was insufficient to support a conviction by reason of its not being indorsed \u201c a true bill \u201d by the foreman of the grand jury. The Court denied the motion and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-4\">On the trial the prosecution introduced a written statement, purporting to contain the dying declarations of the deceased as to the circumstances of the killing as taken down by his attending physician shortly before his death and some eight days after the shooting; and also, under defendant\u2019s objection, proved by a witness, who was present when the writing was made, other declarations of the deceased made at the time in addition to and explanatory of the written statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-5\">After the evidence for the prosecution had closed the defendant offered to prove that the deceased, after the shooting and at the primary examination of defendant before the committing magistrate, swore to facts directly contradicting his dying declarations. The Court refused to admit the evidence, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b369-6\">The defendant then offered to prove that the deceased had at different times, after the shooting and injury, made declarations contradicting his dying declarations put in evidence.

The objection to the indictment is, that it is not indorsed \u201c a true bill.\u201d This indorsement is the vitality of the bill; without it there can be no indictment. Article five of the Amendments to the Constitution of the United States provides, that <em>\u201c </em>no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, etc.\u201d Article one, section eight, of the Constitution of this State, embodies the same provision in the same terms. This right of the citizen has never been questioned and will not be now.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b369-9\">What, then, constitutes \u201c an indictment\u201d by the grand jury. It is a formal charge made by them in their capacity as grand jurors and entered of record, charging the commission of a crime, describing it, upon some person. The grand jury are required to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>due inquiry into ad offenses committed or triable within their county and to find their verdict thereon. The result of that verdict is either \u201c a true bill,\u201d or \u201c not a true bill,\u201d or \u201c not found; \u201d in either event this indorsement must be made by them and signed by the foreman of the grand jury. This is the evidence of their action, and it is the only evidence authorized by the statute upon any particular case. The argument, then, that the objection should have been taken by motion to set aside the indictment for one of the causes mentioned in section two hundred and seventy-eight, is without force here, for this indictment does not appear to be found at all. A charge appears to have been preferred by the District Attorney, but the action of the grand jury thereon nowhere appears. It will not do, in a case of this magnitude especially, to presume they did a certain thing, for the l$w says that must be evidenced in a certain way. As well might a judgment of death be sought to be sustained when there is no record of the verdict of a petit jury as an indictment with no record of the verdict of a grand jury. That this is the correct view of the indictment in this case\u2014that in fact there is no indictment found by the grand jury, we refer to <em>Commmonwealth </em>v. <em>Sergeant </em>(Thacher's Crim. Cas. 116); <em>Gardiner </em>v. <em>The People </em>(3 Scam. 85); Webster's <em>case </em>(5 Greenleaf, 432); 1 Arch. Crim. Prac. &amp; Plead. (Waterman's notes) 98.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-4\">EL The Court erred in refusing to permit proof of statements of deceased contradicting his dying declarations. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Glenn </em>(10 Cal. 32) this Court considered at some length the admissibility of dying declarations, holding therein, that while the sense of impending dissolution may compensate for the want of an oath, it can never make up for the want of a cross-examination, and placing the admissibility of the declaration on the sole ground of necessity, at the same time admitting its dangerous and unsatisfactory nature. In the same case, also, after the introduction of the written statements of the deceased, his oral statements made at a different time were admitted. \u201c The necessity of the case \u201d is held to overrule the right of the defendant to confront his accusers and their witnesses. The necessity of the case admits the dying declarations of the deceased, though made, perchance, by an ignorant, bigoted, prejudiced man.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>This rule, which is invoked successfully to admit the declarations of deceased, may surely, with equal force and effect, be invoked by the defendant to shield him from the effect of declarations made by a party deceased, which declarations have at other times and in an equally solemn manner been contradicted by the same person. There having been no cross-examination afforded the defendant on the declarations offered by the prosecution, because the necessities of the case did not allow it, the same necessity will dispense with any cross-examination as a foundation for the introduction of contradictory statements.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-4\"><em>Attorney-General, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b371-5\">Field, C. J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"AE1\">Cope, J. and Norton, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The dying declarations of the deceased were admitted in evidence against the defendant without objection. These declarations relate to the cause of the homicide, and the circumstances attending it. After the prosecution had closed the defendant offered to prove that on his examination before the committing magistrate the deceased had testified to facts directly contradicting his dying declarations; and, also, that he had made other and contradictory declarations. But the Court refused to allow the proof, and its ruling in this respect constitutes one of the errors assigned for a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">It does not appear from the record on what ground the Court based its ruling, and we are unable to perceive any which is at all tenable. The rule is general that the credit of a witness may be impeached by proof that he has made statements contrary to what he has testified. There is, it is true, a condition to the application of the rule with reference to verbal statements: that the attention of the witness must be previously called to the particular occasion and circumstances under which the supposed contradictory statements were made, in order to give him an opportunity of making any explanation of the matter which he may have. (1 Greenleaf's Ev. sec. 462.) But this preliminary condition, it is clear, cannot be complied with where dying declarations are offered in evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>except in very rare cases. Such declarations are generally made to the physician or friends of the deceased, in the absence of the party against whom they are offered, who, of course, has no opportunity of cross-examination, or of directing the attention of the deceased to any alleged contradictory statements made by him. Declarations of this character are received with the greatest caution. They are admissible on the ground of necessity; but, as very justly observed in <em>People </em>v. Glenn, (10 Cal. 36) though the condition of the person making the declarations in the last hours of life, under a sense of impending dissolution, may compensate for the want of an oath, it can never make up for the want of a cross-examination. There would be no justice, therefore, in any rule which would deprive the accused, under such circumstances, of the right to impeach the credit of the deceased by proof of his having made contradictory statements as to the homicide and its cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The conclusion we have thus reached disposes of the appeal, and necessitates a reversal of the judgment. There is, however, another error assigned, which it is proper to dispose of, inasmuch as the refusal to discharge the prisoner for the alleged illegality and insufficiency of the indictment will otherwise be again presented in the Court below, and, perhaps, upon a second appeal. The indictment was returned to the Court signed by the foreman of the grand jury, but without being indorsed \u201c a true bill,\u201d and the absence of this indorsement was urged as a fatal defect to the indictment. The statute requires the indictment to be indorsed \u201c a true bill,\u201d and the indorsement to be signed by the foreman, (Crim. Prac. Act, sec. 229) and provides that the indictment shall be set aside, upon motion of defendant, when not thus indorsed, provided the motion be made before a demurrer or plea is interposed (Secs. 277, 278) ; but if not thus made, that the defendant shall be precluded from afterward taking the objection. (Sec. 280.) In the present case the defendant pleaded to the indictment, and did not raise the objection until after the jury were impanneled and sworn. It was too late then, under the statute, to urge the objection. The indorsement is not essential to the legality and sufficiency of the indictment, as contended. It is only evidence of the finding of the indictment, and the object of the statute in requiring it is simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>to secure the authenticity and genuineness of the instrument. This end is equally attained when the indictment is presented by the grand jury in open Court, and is filed by the Clerk with other records. If in the present case no indictment had in fact been found, the Court would, undoubtedly, upon a proper application, have allowed the plea to be withdrawn and the motion made. But the truth being that it had been found and presented in open Court, no objection could be urged to it except a technical one.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">We are aware that the decisions in England are different; that there the want of the indorsement is fatal to the indictment. The reason is obvious. There the indictment is drawn and presented to the grand jury before any investigation is had upon the accusation. When the investigation is closed, the jury return the result of their deliberations by the indorsement on the indictment: \u201cA true bill,\u201d or \u201c Not a true bill,\u201d or \u201c Not found.\u201d In this State the investigation is had in the first instance upon the complaint, made either by the public prosecutor, or by private persons, or upon the declaration of one of the grand jurors, (Crina. Prac. Act, see. 213) and it is only after the jury have come to a conclusion against the party accused that the preparation of an indictment is required from the District Attorney. The conclusion of the jury is evidenced by the presentation to the Court of an indictment, or by a return of the papers from the, committing magistrate, if any have been delivered to them, with an indorsement that the charge is dismissed. (Id. sec. 230.) If no papers from the committing magistrate have been in their hands, them judgment upon the complaint is indicated by the fact that no indictment is returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In some of our sister States, also, the indorsement \u201c a true bill \u201d is held essential to the validity of the indictment, but the decisions in this respect have arisen from an adherence to the English rule, even after the English practice had gone out of use. <em>(The State </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>13 N. H. 488; <em>The State </em>v. <em>Mertens, </em>14 Mo. 94.)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
