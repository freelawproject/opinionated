H. Hartley, one of the sureties upon the official bond of W. H. Brooks, the former Treasurer of said county. The complaint sets forth the bond, and charges that Brooks, as Treasurer, was a defaulter in the sum of $7,000, for which defendant is liable as surety. The complaint also suggests several \u201c defects \u201d in the bond, and among them the failure of Brooks to sign it, with a view to obviate them effect under the provisions of section eleven of the act entitled \u201cAn Act concerning Official Bonds,\u201d approved February 9th, 1850.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-10\">The following is a copy of the bond:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b585-11\">\u201c Know all men by these presents that we, William H.

Whenever any such official bond shaH not contain the substantial matter, or condition or conditions required by law, or there shall be any defects in the approval or filing thereof, such bond shall not be void so as to discharge such officer and his sureties, but they shall be equitably bound to the State or party interested, and the State or such party may, by action instituted as other suits on official bonds, in any Court of competent jurisdiction, suggest the defect of such bond or such approval or filing, and recover his proper and equitable demand or damages from such officer and the person or persons who intended to become and were included as sureties in such bond.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>The defendant demurred to the complaint, and the demurrer was overruled, and no answer being made, plaintiff had judgment for the amount claimed, from which defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b587-4\"><em>H. O. Beatty </em>and <em>J. B. Harmon, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-5\">The bond sued on is joint, so far as regards the principal and each of the sureties. In our view it is equivalent to seven distinct undertakings, all in one instrument. Brooks and Hartley undertake for $10,000; Brooks and Green for $5,000; Brooks and Chapman for $3,000, and so on. The obligation of Brooks with each of the sureties was joint only, and not joint and several. It is evident Brooks intended to bind himself with each of the sureties separately. It is equally evident that each surety intended to bind himself for a specific amount, without any connection with his co-sureties as to that particular amount, except so far as he might claim or be liable for contribution in case of loss. Every contract signed by two or more promising to pay the same sum of money is joint, unless there be special words making it several, or joint and several. \u201cWe promise to pay \u201d is just as much a joint promise as \u201c we jointly promise to pay.\u201d This was the obligation of Brooks, as principal, and Hartley, as surety, to pay $10,000 in certain contingencies. There are no words of severalty applied to their promise. The words of severalty used are in regard to the distinct sums for which the sureties bind themselves.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-6\">This Court in the case of the <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards </em>(9 Cal. 286) construe a similar instrument as we do this. If the obligation is joint, it is admitted to be within the decision in <em>Sacramento </em>v. <em>Bun-lap, </em>(14 Cal. 423) and therefore void. But if it be construed as a joint and several bond, we contend that it is still within the decision in that case. And whether announced in that case or not, the law undoubtedly is that the failure of the principal to sign a joint and several bond makes it invalid as to the surety who does sign. <em>(Bean </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>17 Mass.; <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>United States, </em>4 Watt. 21; 21 Pick. 24; 16 Maine, 140.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b587-7\">The eleventh section of the Act concerning Official Bonds has reference only to defects in form, and not to a defect like this which makes the bond a nullity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>E. B. Crocker, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-4\">The bond in the case of <em>Sacramento </em>v. Dunlap, as the Court there say, was \u201c in form a joint bond only, and not joint and several,\u201d and the case was decided solely upon this distinction, the Court clearly holding that if the bond had been joint and several or several, the rule would have been different.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-5\">The simple question then to determine, is, whether this is a several or joint and several bond, for if it is either, then the defendant is bound, whether the principal signed it or not. Our position is, that it is a several bond by its terms. It commences by saying we are held and firmly bound in the \u201c several sums as hereinafter specified and affixed to our names.\u201d Here is a clear expression of an intention not to be jointly but only severally bound.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-6\">It further states, \u201c for the which payment, well and truly to be made, we severally bind ourselves, our heirs,\u201d etc. This is the portion of the bond in which the extent of liability, whether joint or joint and several, is usually expressed; and here the parties are careful to express them intention to be only severally bound. The word joint is not used in the whole instrument, but in all cases where the extent and nature of the liability is stated, the word several alone is used.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-7\">It will not do to say that it is a joint bond as between the principal and each of the sureties, and several as between the sureties, for the word \u201c several \u201d in both instances qualifies the liability of each and all of the parties named in the instrument; whenever used it applies as clearly to Brooks as to any of the others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b588-8\">That in a several or joint and several bond, the parties executing it are bound, though all the persons named in the bond do not execute it, see <em>Sacramento </em>v. <em>Dunlap </em>(14 Cal. 421); <em>Cutter </em>v. <em>Whittemore </em>(10 Mass. 444); <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(2 Hill, 586); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Bean (12 </em>Mass. 139); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bowman </em>(10 Ohio, 445).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b588-9\">Field, C. J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"Al1\">Cope, J. and Norton, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">The bond executed by Hartley and others embraces several distinct obligations. The principal and each of the sureties bind themselves in certain sums designated; and as we read the instru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ment, not jointly and severally, but only jointly. The term \u201c severally,\u201d as used in the instrument, applies only to the different sums which the parties respectively specify as the limit of the liability they assume. Being a joint bond, the signature of the principal was essential to its validity and binding force upon the sureties. As we said of the bond in the case of the <em>City of Sacramento </em>v. Dunlap, (14 Cal. 423) so .we may say of this: \u201c The liability of the sureties is conditional to that of the principal. They are bound if he is bound, and not otherwise. The very nature of the contract implies this. The fact that then signatures were placed to the instrument can make no difference in its effect. * * Some one must have written his signature first; but it is to be presumed upon the understanding that the others named as obligors would add theirs. Not having done so, it was incomplete and without binding obligation upon either.\u201d (See <em>Bean </em>v. <em>Parker et </em>al., 17 Mass. 591; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Washburn, </em>2 Pick. 24; <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>United States, </em>4 Watts, 21; <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>11 Vt. 447; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Erskine, </em>9 Texas, 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">The defects in official bonds, which may be cured upon their suggestion in a complaint, do not embrace the absence of the signature of the principal obligor. Without his signature the instrument is not his deed. There is no bond of his in which defects can be suggested and cured.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">These considerations dispose of the case, and render it unnecessary to notice any of the other points discussed by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The judgment must be reversed and the Court below directed to enter judgment for the defendant upon the demurrer to the complaint ; and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
