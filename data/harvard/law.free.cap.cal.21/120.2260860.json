Before the time at which, by the effect of the notice, the tenancy would have terminated, B., through a third person, proposed to H. to continue his occupancy at a rent of three hundred dollars, with which proposal H. expressed himself satisfied, but did not in terms notify B. of his acceptance of it. B. continued to occupy the premises : <em>Held, </em>in an action by H. for rent at the rate of three hundred dollars per month, that it must be inferred that the subsequent occupation of ' B. was with the consent of H., on the basis of the proposal rather than as a trespasser, and that plaintiff was entitled to recover.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b120-7\">Appeal from the Fourth Judicial District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-8\">The facts are sufficiently stated in the opinion.

Plaintiff\u2019s assent to it without notifying Baum that he accepted it, does not show that the understanding was simultaneous, reciprocal, mutual, or concurrent. Hence it is no contract.

Action in the nature of trespass for mesne profits is the only remedy.

J. and Norton, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">This is an action to recover the sum of $1,200 for the use and occupation of certain premises in the city of San Francisco. The complaint sets up an agreement to pay a monthly rent of three hundred dollars for the. use of the premises, and the question is whether this agreement has been proved. It appears that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>defendant had been occupying the premises at a monthly rent of two hundred and fifty dollars, and that the plaintiff served upon him a notice to quit. The effect of this notice was to terminate the tenancy on the twenty-fifth of August, 1861, previous to which time the defendant proposed to the plaintiff, through the. agency of a third person, to continue his occupancy at a rent of three hundred, dollars. This proposal was communicated to the plaintiff, who expressed himself as satisfied with it, but there is no positive evidence that he notified the defendant of his acceptance. The defendant remained in possession, however, and the inference is that he did so with the consent of the plaintiff, and that the proposal was accepted. We must infer this, or infer that he kept possession against the plaintiff\u2019s will and as a trespasser, and of the two inferences we adopt the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
