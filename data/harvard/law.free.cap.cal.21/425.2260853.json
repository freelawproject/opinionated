On the 24th of April a like service was made on Hopkins, and Brannan was served with copy of summons and copy of complaint, all in San Joaquin County.

When the judgment was entered there was a demurrer on file which had not been disposed of. Two of the defendants demurred separately, and the record shows that but one of the demurrers was acted upon. The other was filed after a default had been taken, but the attorneys for the plaintiffs accepted service of it, thereby waiving the default.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
