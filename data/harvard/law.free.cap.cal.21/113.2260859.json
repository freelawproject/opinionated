The demurrer was sustained, and judgment given for defendant, from which plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-4\"><em>C. E. DeLong, </em>for Appellant, made the following points:</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3P\">I. Counties and like public corporations are subject to legislative control, and by statute may be made liable to the performance of duties such as one imposed by the laws concerning county hospitals. <em>(Coles </em>v. <em>The County of </em>Madison, Bre. 120.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-6\">II. Counties may be sued <em>in tort </em>as well as in contract. <em>(McCann </em>v. <em>Sierra </em>County, 7 Cal. 124.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-7\">III. The County of Yuba was bound by law to maintain its indigent sick and provide for them proper sustenance and skillful medical treatment. (Stat. of 1854, 131; Id. 1855, 67; Id. 1856, 69; Id. 1860, 191.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-9\">IV. A municipal corporation, failing in the discharge of a duty imposed upon it by law, is liable in damages to one sustaining injury thereby. (4 Hill, 531; Just. 703; Cowp. 79; <em>Milede </em>v. <em>New </em>Orleans, 12 La. An. 15; <em>Rochester White Lead Co. </em>v. <em>The City of </em>Rochester, 3 Comst. 463.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b114-10\"><em>F. L. </em>Hatch, <em>District </em>Attorney, for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b114-11\">Norton, J. delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"AT_\">Field, C. J. and Cope, J. concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-12\">The plaintiff in this action seeks to recover compensation from the county of Yuba for the damage which he sustained by reason . of the unskillful treatment he received from the Resident Physician, and the insufficient and unwholesome food and other necessaries sup- 6 plied him while in the County Hospital as an indigent sick person.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-13\">A demurrer to the complaint was sustained by the Court below, and from the judgment the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-14\">The plaintiff insists that the county is required by law to provide for its indigent sick in a suitable manner, and is liable to an action for the misfeasance of its employ\u00e9s. No case has been cited to us in which such an action has been sustained; nor do we think this action can be sustained upon principle. Private corporations and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>municipal corporations may be liable for the acts of their employes, of whom they have the appointment and supervision, and when the duty to be performed is for the benefit of the corporation. But a <em>quasi </em>corporation, like a county, is not liable for the acts of officers or employ\u00e9s which it appoints in the exercise of a portion of the sovereign power of the State, by the requirements of a public law, and simply for the public benefit, and for a purpose from which the county, as a corporation, derives no benefit. <em>(Fowle </em>v. <em>The Common Council of </em>Alexandria, 3 Pet. 398; <em>The </em>Mayor, <em>etc., of N. Y. </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>3 Hill, 531, and cases cited by Senator Hand at pp. 447, 448.)</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
