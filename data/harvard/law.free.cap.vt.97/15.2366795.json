L. 6737, to recover damages paid by the plaintiff to one Barney for sheep killed and injured by dogs, which it is claimed were owned by the defendants. The case is here on plaintiff\u2019s exceptions. The questions for review relate to the admission of evidence, and to the charge of the court, on the issue of whether defendants\u2019 dogs did the damage complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">In order to determine the admissibility of the evidence excepted to, it is necessary to have in mind the status of plaintiff\u2019s evidence at the time the challenged evidence was received.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence, in opening, tended to show that in the summer of 1921, Barney\u2019s sheep were kept in the Paine pasture, so-called, on what was known as Leland hill in the plaintiff town; that, during the latter part of June and early part of July, dogs killed several of said sheep, and so injured others that they died or had to be killed, and injured still others by chasing and worrying them; that on June 24, defendants\u2019 dogs were seen chasing some of Barney\u2019s sheep in his pasture, and that they chased those sheep out of that pasture and followed them until driven away by men working in an adjoining pasture; that three days later the same dogs were seen chasing some of Barney\u2019s sheep outside of his pasture; that a week or ten days later, the same dogs were again seen chasing some of Barney\u2019s sheep in, or near, his pasture; that those dogs were seen in Barney\u2019s pasture, and in that immediate vicinity, on several different occasions between June 24 and the middle of July following; that during that time, hounds (such were defendants\u2019 dogs) were frequently heard in the Barney pasture, and that during that time no dogs other than hounds were heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>in that pasture; that about July 20, defendants took measures to keep their dogs away from the Barney pasture; that Barney had no trouble with dogs, and did not hear dogs in his pasture, after that; that Barney found four dead sheep in his pasture, June 28, and found several others, dead, in his pasture during the next two or three weeks; that the owner of an adjoining pasture found the carcasses of three sheep in his pasture the spring following; that these, together with other sheep that died or had to be. killed because of their injuries, made up the number for which the plaintiff paid Barney; that plaintiff also paid Barney for injuries to his sheep which defendants\u2019 dogs chased and worried; that in the spring of 1922, defendants\u2019 dogs killed two lambs that belonged to Barney, near his buildings. It also appeared, in rebuttal, and after the evidence excepted to had been admitted, that some of the sheep chased by defendants\u2019 dogs on June 27 were so badly bitten, or \u201cchewed up\u201d as one witness testified, that they later died or had to be killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">It thus appeared, when the evidence complained of was admitted, that there was no direct or positive evidence in the ease that defendants\u2019 dogs killed any of Barney\u2019s sheep, or that they injured any of them except by chasing or worrying them. The only evidence tending to connect defendants \u2019 dogs with the killing of the sheep found dead in Barney\u2019s pasture, and in the adjoining pasture, was purely circumstantial, \u2014 it showed nothing beyond propensity and opportunity. With plaintiff\u2019s evidence in this posture, defendants were permitted to show by several witnesses, subject to plaintiff\u2019s objection and exception that the evidence was immaterial and incompetent, that the Paine pasture, and the whole of Leland hill, was a common hunting ground where hounds and other dogs hunted foxes and rabbits, for the purpose of showing why defendants\u2019 dogs were there.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\"> This evidence, it will be observed, was not .offered, or received, for the purpose of showing that other dogs had an opportunity to commit the injury complained of, but rather, to show that defendants\u2019 dogs were in the Paine pasture, and that vicinity, for a legitimate purpose, and not for the purpose of killing or worrying Barney\u2019s sheep. In other words, the jury was asked to infer that because dogs were accustomed to go to the Paine pasture to hunt foxes and rabbits, the defendants\u2019 dogs were there for that purpose on the occasions described by plaintiff\u2019s witnesses. We think that this was traveling too far <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>into the realm of conjecture and speculation, especially in view of the positive evidence that defendants \u2019 dogs chased the Barney sheep on different occasions. Nor was this evidence admissible for the purpose of showing that other dogs had an opportunity to commit the injury complained of, in the absence of any- showing that they were prone to kill or worry sheep, or other animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">The defendants claimed that their dogs were not chasing Barney\u2019s sheep on the occasions testified to by plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, but that they \u201cwere on the track of something,\u201d and for the purpose of showing that such was the case on June 24, they were permitted to show, subject to plaintiff\u2019s exception, that their dogs run and \u201cgive tongue\u201d in the Paine pasture in the spring of 1921, previous to June 24, when they were not chasing sheep. This evidence was too speculative to be admissible. The fact that a dog chased a fox or rabbit in April has no tendency to show that he didn\u2019t chase, or kill, sheep the following June.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The defendants were allowed to show, subject to plaintiff\u2019s exception, that a dog belonging to one Stewart attacked a sheep half or three-quarters of a mile from the Paine pasture, the latter part of June, 1921, and that said dog was not killed until after the injury complained of was committed; that dogs other than defendants \u2019 dogs chased sheep in the Newton pasture, which was a mile or a mile and a half from the Paine pasture, in June, 1921, and again the following August or September; that two dogs, other than defendants\u2019 dogs, were seen chasing one of Barney\u2019s sheep in September, 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Since the only evidence in the case tending to show that defendants\u2019 dogs killed the sheep that were found dead at different times was the fact that they were prone to chase sheep, especially Barney\u2019s sheep, and were in the vicinity where the sheep were found at, or about, the time the sheep were killed, we think that it was competent for the defendants to rebut, or weaken, any presumption that might be drawn from those circumstances by showing that other dogs with like propensities were in the vicinity, and had like opportunity to do the mischief. It is not apparent why the defendants\u2019 dogs should be singled out for the application of this presumption, to the exclusion of other dogs to which it might be applied with equal force. We think the correct rule is stated in <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>48 Vt. 578, although this question was not there involved. It is there said: <em>\"</em>If the evidence relied upon by the plaintiff had been altogether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>circumstantial, and the fact that the defendant\u2019s dog was prone to do such mischief, and was at that time at large and in the vicinity, was relied upon to prove the fact that the mischief was done by defendant\u2019s dog, then, to modify and rebut such presumption, the proof that other dogs with like propensity were in the vicinity, and had like opportunity to do the mischief, would, we think, be admissible.\u201d See also, <em>Ballou </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>8 Kan. 219. Nor is what is said in <em>Dover </em>v. <em>Winchester, 70 </em>Vt. 418, 41 Atl. 445, in conflict with the views here expressed. In that case it appeared that the sheep for which recovery was sought were killed by being bitten in the neck and hindquarters. Evidence was admitted that dogs killed other sheep about the same time, a mile distant, by biting them in the same way. There it was the manner of killing, \u2014 the similarity of attack, that was relied upon and not the circumstance of propensity and opportunity, as is manifest from what the Court said: \u201cIt was legitimate for the defendants to show that dogs of other parties, acting independently of their dogs, killed the sheep in question; but that other dogs killed other sheep \u2018in the same way that the sheep were that they have described as being killed by these dogs, \u2019 which was the offer, was not relevant to the issue whether the defendants\u2019 dogs killed the sheep for which suit was brought. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The remoteness of the time and place of the incidents testified to, was largely within the discretion of the trial court, and nothing appears to indicate that its discretion was improperly exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The evidence of the witness Newton, that he saw two hounds, which he thought were the defendants\u2019 hounds, go through his pasture sometime in the fall of 1921, and that they did not molest his sheep, should have been excluded, in view of the fact that plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show, and the defendants did not claim the contrary, that defendants \u2019 dogs were not at large, in that vicinity, at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The court charged the jury, in substance, that the evidence that defendants \u2019 dogs killed a lamb, or lambs, that belonged to Barney, in the spring of 1922, \u201cwas received for the purpose only of showing propensity of the dogs in respect of worrying or killing sheep and lambs, * * * it is no evidence that the hounds did the damage complained of in this case.\u201d This was excepted to by plaintiff on the ground that the evidence referred to by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the court tended to show propensity, and that propensity was one of the elements of the claimed killing. We think the exception well taken. The language used, which was in no way changed or modified elsewhere in the charge, did not correctly apprise the jury of the full force and significance of the evidence referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">While, of course, that evidence was not direct evidence that defendants\u2019 dogs killed Barney\u2019s sheep, it was a circumstance tending to show that fact in that it tended to show propensity,^ one of the elements of the killing, and the jury should have been so instructed.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Note: \u2014 Miles, J., having retired from the Bench took no part in the disposition of this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
