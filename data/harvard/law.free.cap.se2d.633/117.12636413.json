At the time of the relevant proceedings in this action, plaintiff was a medical doctor trained in obstetrics and gynecology. Defendant did not complete her undergraduate education, and had not worked outside of the marital home since approximately 1986, after the birth of the parties' first child. Plaintiff filed a complaint 8 May 2003 seeking child custody, equitable distribution, and injunctive relief. Defendant filed an answer 5 August 2003 and asserted counterclaims for child custody, child support, postseparation support, alimony, and equitable distribution. The relevant facts and procedural history of the matter are set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The trial court conducted an equitable distribution pretrial conference 22 March 2004. By the resulting pretrial order filed 8 April 2004, the parties were ordered to participate in a mediated settlement conference. The parties complied with the court-ordered settlement conference, but were unable to resolve any pending issues. A trial on the remaining issues was scheduled for 1 June 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By motion dated 30 April 2004, defendant requested a continuance of the trial from the 1 June 2004 calendar. Defendant's motion was based upon her belief that additional appraisals were necessary, as well as her need to evaluate additional discovery. Defendant's motion was denied by order filed 10 May 2004. In the same order, defendant was awarded postseparation support and temporary child support. Through no action of the parties, the case was calendared for 7 June 2004. Defendant filed a second motion to continue. Defendant's second motion to continue was based on allegations that plaintiff had failed to comply with discovery. Plaintiff conceded this failure in his response. Defendant's second motion to continue was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to the scheduled 7 June 2004 court date, plaintiff's counsel met with defendant's attorney of record, Robert P. Hanner, II, (Hanner) and attempted to negotiate a settlement\n   on the remaining issues. Plaintiff's counsel drafted proposed settlement documents, which defendant refused to execute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant filed a third motion to continue on 8 June 2004, on the ground that her treating physician did not believe she was mentally stable enough to proceed with a trial. The trial court did not rule upon defendant's third motion because it did not reach the case during its 7 June 2004 term of court. The case was then scheduled for trial on 7 September 2004. On that date, the trial court heard two matters: (1) defendant's fourth motion to continue, dated 16 August 2004, and (2) Hanner's motion to withdraw as defendant's counsel. In support of her motion to continue, defendant presented testimony from her psychiatrist, who opined that defendant's \"situational depression and anxiety\" made it difficult for defendant to be prepared for trial on that date. In support of his motion to withdraw, Hanner stated he could no longer properly represent defendant because of a \"very difficult time communicating\" and \"a lack of understanding.\" Hanner stated defendant was not able to comprehend his explanations of \"relatively basic principles\" and opined that defendant had \"lost confidence in [his] ability to represent her.\" By order filed 22 September 2004, the trial court granted Hanner's motion to withdraw and, \"in the interest of justice,\" allowed defendant's motion to continue, and set the trial for all issues for 8 November 2004. The trial court ordered that defendant was not entitled to any additional continuances or postponements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court also ordered the parties and their counsel to appear in court on 4 October 2004 to enter into a final pretrial equitable distribution order (ED pretrial order). Defendant appeared in court on 4 October 2004 but was unprepared to sign the ED pretrial order. The trial court allowed defendant additional time to review and sign the ED pretrial order. After substantial revisions, defendant executed the ED pretrial order on 8 October 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the commencement of the trial on 8 November 2004, defendant appeared\n   <em>\n    pro se.\n   </em>\n   Attorney Peter K. Thompson (Thompson) observed the first two days of the trial. On the third day, he made a formal appearance as defendant's counsel and represented defendant throughout the remainder of the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court entered an order 3 March 2005 that,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   distributed the parties' marital and divisible assets, sanctioned defendant for willful obstruction and unreasonable delay of the equitable distribution proceeding, and denied and dismissed with prejudice defendant's claim for alimony. In the 3 March 2005 order, the trial court concluded the appropriate sanction was for defendant to pay the amount of plaintiff's attorney's fees that were caused by defendant's willful delay and obstruction of the equitable distribution case. The trial court found that amount to be $27,946.99. The trial court concluded the appropriate method of payment was for plaintiff to receive a credit against the distributive award payment that plaintiff was required to pay to defendant. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The record contains eighteen assignments of error, which collectively challenge twenty-three findings of fact and eleven conclusions of law. Defendant brings forward portions or all of thirteen assignments of error, which we will address as three issues. To the extent they are not argued in defendant's brief, defendant's remaining assignments of error are deemed abandoned. N.C.R.App. P. 28(b)(6). The issues on appeal are whether: (I) the trial court's imposition of sanctions under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 50-21(e) violated defendant's right to due process; (II) the trial court erred in sanctioning defendant under N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-21(e); and (III) the trial court erred in denying defendant's request for alimony. For the reasons below, we affirm the trial court's order in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   I. Due Process\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant first argues the trial court violated her constitutionally protected right to due process by imposing sanctions without adequate notice and opportunity to be heard on the issue.

The statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (e) Upon motion of either party or upon the court's own initiative, the court shall\n   impose an appropriate sanction on a party when the court finds that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (1) the party has willfully obstructed or unreasonably delayed, or has attempted to obstruct or unreasonably delay, discovery proceedings, including failure to make discovery pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 37, or has willfully obstructed or unreasonably delayed or attempted to obstruct or unreasonably delay any pending equitable distribution proceeding, and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (2) the willful obstruction or unreasonable delay of the proceedings is or would be prejudicial to the interests of the opposing party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-21(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"Notice and opportunity to be heard prior to depriving a person of his property are essential elements of due process of law which is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution[.]\"\n   <em>\n    McDonald's Corp. v.

In the present case, plaintiff filed no written motion seeking sanctions. The trial court did not hold a separate hearing on the issue of sanctions, but rather addressed sanctions as part of the larger equitable distribution trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff contends the issue of defendant's obstruction was addressed in the ED pretrial order, and that the language of the ED pretrial order \"recite[d] the operative language of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-21(e)[.]\" However, a review of the record shows that the language cited by plaintiff appears in the ED pretrial order as a distributional factor, and not as a grounds for sanctions. As the ED pretrial order does not specify sanctions or cite the sanctions statute, we do not find the ED pretrial order sufficiently notified defendant that she might face sanctions. Therefore we agree with defendant that plaintiff did not make a written request for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We further agree with defendant that she was not otherwise notified in advance of trial\n   that she might face sanctions. Plaintiff contends defendant received notice of sanctions at the 7 September 2004 hearing on Hanner's motion to withdraw and defendant's motion to continue. However, a review of the transcript shows that, while plaintiff's counsel did state at the hearing that defendant's conduct \"amount[ed] to an effort to postpone\" the trial further, he did not mention sanctions, the statute, or any of the operative language of the statute. We find this insufficient to constitute notice of the fact that sanctions might be imposed.\n   <em>\n    See Zaliagiris,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8899548\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/164/602/#p609\">\n    164 N.C.App. at 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=596%20S.E.2d%20285\">\n    596 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   290 (citing\n   <em>\n    Griffin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1659757\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/348/278/#p280\">\n    348 N.C. at 279-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=500%20S.E.2d%20437\">\n    500 S.E.2d at 438-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant concedes that plaintiff's counsel orally addressed the issue of sanctions during his opening statement at trial.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7] 50-21(e)[.]\" As noted above, there was no separate hearing on the issue of sanctions. The trial court heard evidence on sanctions as part of the larger equitable distribution trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant and Thompson took part in the trial, objecting to plaintiff's evidence on the issue of sanctions and presenting evidence to rebut plaintiff's assertion of willful obstruction and unreasonable delay.

Defendant acknowledges this well-established rule, but asks our Court to revisit our interpretation of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-16.3A(b)(2) requiring that bad faith be demonstrated before considering earning capacity. Defendant argues our case law conflicts with the public policy of the State and the language of N.C.G.S. \u00a7 50-16.3A.

Defendant concedes this finding is supported by the evidence presented. However, defendant argues the trial court erred by \"ignoring\" plaintiff's testimony that his bedside manner was affected by the stress of the divorce proceedings, a fact defendant contends weighs against the trial court's ultimate finding of no bad faith.

In the present case, the trial court found plaintiff's reasonable needs and expenses amounted to $7,108.94 per month. This is the same amount plaintiff reported as his anticipated expenses in an amended financial affidavit submitted to the trial court. Given this evidence before the trial court, we perceive no abuse of the trial court's discretion in determining plaintiff's reasonable needs and expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant argues an abuse of discretion is evident because of an inconsistency between the trial court's order of postseparation support and the alimony order. Defendant's argument on this issue is without merit. Our Court has held that a trial court's rulings regarding postseparation support are neither conclusive nor binding in the alimony context.\n   <em>\n    See Wells v.
