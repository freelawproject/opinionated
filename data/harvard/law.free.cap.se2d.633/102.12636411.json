Defendant additionally appeals from his plea of guilty of attaining habitual felon status. We find no error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Kinston Police Department (\"Kinston P.D.\") became involved with defendant when it served a search warrant at 309 Stoughs Alley Lane, Kinston, North Carolina. At the time officers served the warrant, four men, including defendant, were present inside the premises. The search warrant named only defendant and Dontrieves Hooker (\"Hooker\"), and Kinston P.D. permitted the two remaining men to leave after no drugs were found on them. Officer Ken Barnes (\"Barnes\") testified that upon entering the premises he observed: 1) the first room officers entered from the front door was empty; 2) the second room contained a couch, dresser, and a television; 3) the third room contained a couch, a desk, and a potbelly stove; and 4) a hallway contained stacked wood. Barnes further testified that the windows were covered with clear plastic and the premises contained no beds, no refrigerator, no store bought food other than some leftovers found in the trash, and no toiletries except deodorant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A search of the apartment revealed crack cocaine, marijuana, scales, razor blades, aluminum foil, small red baggies, and a razor blade with cardboard around the base of it, which Barnes characterized as a crack pipe. Kinston P.D. also searched both defendant and Hooker. Defendant had no drugs on his person; however, police officers found $2,609.00 in currency on him. Hooker had $200.00 in currency on him. During the investigation, Barnes also recovered January 2003 utility bills, and in a dresser drawer, he found a rent receipt for the residence addressed to defendant. Barnes also recovered rent receipts from February and March 2003, which were addressed to Hooker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The State subsequently indicted defendant on possession with intent to sell and deliver a controlled substance, keeping or maintaining a dwelling for the use of controlled substances, and possession of a controlled substance. The State also indicted defendant on attaining habitual felon status. The Lenoir County Superior Court heard this matter on 11 May 2005, and a jury found defendant guilty of all three offenses. Defendant then pled guilty to attaining the status of a habitual felon, and the trial court sentenced him to a minimum of 151 months and a maximum of 191 months in the custody of the North Carolina Department of Correction. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant initially argues, \"[t]he trial court erred in overruling defendant's objection to the officer's testimony regarding 'constructive possession,' as such testimony constituted an opinion as to an ultimate issue for the jury and a legal conclusion, violated the N.C. Rules of Evidence, and denied defendant due process and a fair trial.\" Specifically, defendant contends that the trial court erred in allowing the following exchange to occur regarding constructive possession:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Q: Mr. Rogerson asked you if each one of these items was in the defendant's possession, do you recall that question?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A: I do recall that question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Q: He didn't differentiate between actual possession, like in the pocket or constructive possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Rogerson: Objection, goes to legal argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Muskus: Your Honor, it was brought up by the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court: Go ahead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Q. It doesn't go to constructive possession like being next to it?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A. He was next to it, yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing this testimony because it was inadmissible since Barnes \"testified as to a legal term of art, 'constructive possession[.]'\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under the North Carolina Rules of Evidence, \"[t]estimony in the form of an opinion or inference is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\" N.C.

An abuse of discretion occurs when a ruling of the trial court \"is manifestly unsupported by reason or is so arbitrary that it could not have been the result of a reasoned decision.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Hennis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2562603\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/323/279/#p285\">\n    323 N.C. 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 285,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=372%20S.E.2d%20523\">\n    372 S.E.2d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 527 (1988) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice,\n   </em>\n   during cross-examination of Barnes, defendant's attorney showed Barnes various pieces of evidence and repeatedly asked him the question \"[Defendant] wasn't in possession of this; was he?\" Barnes responded \"no\" each time he answered the question. On redirect, the Assistant District Attorney attempted to establish the possession element of the State's case by having Barnes clarify defendant's location in relation to the evidence for purposes of establishing constructive possession. Barnes then testified that defendant \"was next to\" the evidence collected. Although the State's question linked the term \"constructive possession\" with being in close proximity to the goods, Barnes never testified that defendant was in \"constructive possession\" of the evidence; rather, he testified to the underlying facts of defendant's location in proximity to the drugs. Indeed, when the Assistant District Attorney asked Barnes more directly if defendant was in constructive possession of the evidence collected, the trial court ruled the question was inadmissible because constructive possession is a legal issue for the jury to resolve. Even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the trial court erred in allowing the witness's testimony after the State's question, which linked constructive possession with being \"next to\" the drugs, defendant has failed to show \"a reasonable possibility that, had the error in question not been committed, a different result would have been reached at the trial[.]\" N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1443(a) (2005). For the foregoing reasons, we hold this argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant additionally argues, \"If this court were to find that the testimony was admissible as it did not embrace a legal term of art, the testimony was still inadmissible as to the police officer's opinion that defendant was guilty.\" Defendant's pertinent assignment of error states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial court erred in overruling defendant's objection as to the officer's testimony regarding \"constructive possession,\" as such testimony constituted an opinion as to an ultimate issue for the jury and a legal conclusion, violated the N.C. Rules of Evidence, and denied defendant due process, a fair trial, and his legal and constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This assignment of error states nothing about the challenged testimony being impermissible as testimony regarding defendant's guilt. Accordingly, the underlying assignment of error does not identify the issue briefed on appeal and is in violation of N.C. R.App. P. 10(c)(1) (2006).\n   <em>\n    See May v. Down East Homes of Beulaville, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C.App. ___, ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12634612\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/623/345/#p346\">\n    623 S.E.2d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346 (2006) (holding broad, vague, and unspecific assignments of error do not comport with the North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure). Because the assignment of error is a violation of Rule 10, this argument is beyond the scope of\n   appellate review, and we do not address it. N.C. R.App. P. 10(a) (\"[T]he scope of review on appeal is confined to a consideration of those assignments of error set out in the record on appeal in accordance with this Rule 10 . . .\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant next argues, \"The trial court erred in overruling defendant's objection as to the officer's testimony that certain evidence constituted a \"crack pipe,\" as such testimony violated the N.C. Rules of Evidence and denied defendant due process and a fair trial.\" Defendant's underlying assignment of error states,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The trial court erred in overruling defendant's objection as to the officer's testimony that certain evidence constituted a \"crack pipe,\" as such testimony constituted an opinion as to an ultimate issue for the jury and a legal conclusion, otherwise violated the N.C. Rules of Evidence, and denied defendant due process, a fair trial and his legal and constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant's argument on appeal is that testimony characterizing the evidence as a crack pipe was inadmissible under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 8C-1, Rule 701 (2005) because Barnes's opinion was not \"rationally based on the perception of the witness.\" Nowhere in defendant's assignment of error does he assign error on this specific basis; rather, he states generally that the challenged testimony \"otherwise violated the N.C. Rules of Evidence.\" Accordingly, this assignment of error is broad, vague, and unspecific, and it fails to identify the issues on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. R.App. P. 10(c)(1);\n   <em>\n    May,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12634612\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/623/345/#p346\">\n     supra.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, we do not address this argument because it is beyond the scope of appellate review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. R.App. P. 10(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The dissent argues our holding that the aforementioned assignment of error fails to comply with N.C. R.App. P. 10(c)(1) \"would require appellants to include every detail of their planned argument in the assignment of error for fear of dismissal.\" To the contrary, appellants need only comply with the Rule as written. Appellants must \"state\n   <em>\n    plainly, concisely[,] and without argumentation\n   </em>\n   the legal basis upon which error is assigned.\" N.C. R.App. P. 10(c)(1) (emphasis added). The purpose of assignments of error is to limit the scope of the appeal, N.C. R.App. P. 10(a), and to put the other party on notice of the issues to be presented.\n   <em>\n    Broderick v. Broderick,\n   </em>\n   ___ N.C.App. ___, ___,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12634749\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/se2d/623/806/#p807\">\n    623 S.E.2d 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 807 (2006). Defendant's assignment of error asserting that the police officer's testimony \"otherwise violated the N.C. Rules of Evidence\" would allow defense counsel to argue on appeal any and every violation of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence. Thus, the assignment of error neither limits the scope of appeal nor adequately puts the other party on notice of the issues presented. Accordingly, rather than being readily distinguishable as the dissent asserts,\n   <em>\n    Beulaville\n   </em>\n   is directly on point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The dissent further asserts that we should exercise discretion under N.C. R.App. P. 2 (2006) to address defendant's assignment of error, provided that we do not \"create an appeal for an appellant.\" The dissent also asserts that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   dismissal of defendant's argument for such technical rules violations, when defendant's assignment of error and brief are sufficient to direct the attention of this Court and the State to the issue on appeal, would require mandatory dismissal of all cases where a minor violation of our appellate rules have occurred, even those which neither impede the work of the Court nor disadvantage the appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Our Supreme Court has repeatedly held, \"The North Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure are mandatory and failure to follow these rules will subject an appeal to dismissal.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Viar v.

Although defendant did not have exclusive possession of the premises, as shown in that the State also found receipts in the name of Hooker, other incriminating circumstances existed such as defendant's presence on the premises, the fact that the receipts existed and were found in a dresser drawer at the time of the search of the premises, the miscellaneous drug paraphernalia on the premises, and the fact that defendant had $2,609.00 in cash on him in denominations of fives, tens, and twenties at the time of the search.

Defendant then argues in his brief that the testimony by the officer characterizing the evidence as a \"crack pipe\" was inadmissible opinion testimony pursuant to Rule 701 of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence. The majority concludes, however, that defendant's assignment of error is so broad as to evade appellate review.

Rather, dismissal of defendant's argument for such technical rules violations, when defendant's assignment of error and brief are sufficient to direct the attention of this Court and the State to the issue on appeal, would require mandatory dismissal of all cases where a minor violation of our appellate rules has occurred, even those which neither impede the work of the Court nor disadvantage the appellant. To require the automatic dismissal of all cases for hyper-technicalities was surely not the intention of our Supreme Court in its decision in\n   <em>\n    Viar,\n   </em>\n   for to read the holding otherwise would eviscerate this Court's ability to use Rule 2 to \"prevent manifest injustice to a party, or to expedite decision in the public interest[.]\" N.C.R.App. P. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Defendant's present assignment of error adequately preserves his argument on appeal. Any deficiency in the assignment of error does not impede appellate review or deprive the opposing party of notice. The State has fully responded to the merits of defendant's argument in its brief on appeal. Notably, the State never argued that defendant failed to preserve this issue for appellate review. This Court could moreover exercise its discretion under Rule 2 and address defendant's argument on its merits. I would hold that defendant's argument relating to the admission of testimony by the officer regarding the \"crack pipe\" was properly preserved, and I would address the argument on its merits. Alternatively, I would exercise this Court's discretion pursuant to Rule 2 and elect to entertain defendant's argument.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
