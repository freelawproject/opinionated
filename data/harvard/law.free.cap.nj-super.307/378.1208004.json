On that date, another Department of Labor employee, Alvin Walker, drove a State vehicle from the parking lot of the Division of Vocational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Rehabilitation in Camden to the front of that office building intending to meet petitioner. Walker stopped the car at the curb, opened the passenger door, and petitioner, who uses a cane to ambulate, entered into the front-passenger seat. As Walker was pulling away from the curb at a normal rate of speed, estimated between five and ten miles per hour, the seat in which petitioner was sitting suddenly slid all the way to the rear of its range adjustment, where it stopped abruptly at the end of the track, causing petitioner to strike her head against the seat back and the headrest. Petitioner\u2019s sudden movement startled Walker, who rapidly applied his brakes causing the front passenger seat to lurch forward. Petitioner\u2019s body along with the seat moved with uncontrolled force in a forward direction. Apparently the rachet mechanism on the front seat track had faded. Petitioner\u2019s cane, which she was holding in her right hand, struck the front firewall of the car. As a result of this incident, petitioner sustained injuries to her back and right hand which permanently and totally disabled her from performing her regular and assigned duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Although petitioner\u2019s injuries were deemed permanent and totally disabling, her application for an accidental disability retirement pension was denied by the Board of Trustees of the PERS (the Board) on the ground that the accident did not constitute a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d within the ambit of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-43, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">A member who has not attained age 65 shall, upon the application of the head of the department in which he is employed or upon his own application or the application of one acting in his behalf, be retired by the board of trustees, if said employee is permanently and totally disabled as a result of a <em>traumatic event </em>occurring during and as a result of the performance of his regular or assigned duties, on an accidental disability allowance____(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Petitioner requested an administrative hearing. An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found, based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, that the incident resulting in petitioner\u2019s injuries constituted a traumatic event.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Deputy Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>General representing the Board filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s recommended decision and petitioner\u2019s counsel filed cross-exceptions. The Board rejected the ALJ\u2019s recommended decision and incorporated by reference the \u201cthe factual and legal discussion of the Deputy Attorney Generali\u2019s] ... exception letter,\u201d reaffirming its decision denying petitioner\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">As we noted in <em>Flores v. Board of Trustees of the Pub. Employees Retirement Sys., </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 670 A.2d 1113 (App.Div. 1996),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">The phrase \u201ctraumatic event,\u201d as used in statutes defining a public employee\u2019s eligibility for retirement on an accidental disability pension, refers to \u201ca mishap or accident involving the application of some kind of external force to the body or the violent exposure of the body to some external force.\u201d For an accident to constitute a traumatic event,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">a worker must demonstrate (1) that his injuries were not induced by the stress or strain of the normal work effort; (2) that he met involuntarily with the object or matter that was the source of the harm; and (3) that the source of the injury itself was a great rush of force or uncontrollable power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\"><em>[Kane v. Board of Trustees, Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement Sys., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>651, 663, 498 A.2d 1252 (1985).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 277-78, 670 A.2d 1113 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">As part of her findings of fact, the AL J stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-12\">Mr. Walker described appellant\u2019s instantaneous rearward and then forward motion as resembling that of a \u201ccrash test dummy,\u201d the unexpected motion of the seat flying backwards on its adjustment track shocked both Mr. Walker and appellant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">We are satisfied that petitioner\u2019s accident constituted a traumatic event under the tests set forth in <em>Kane. </em>The force or power that caused petitioner\u2019s injury was completely external to petitioner. She neither caused the malfunction of the seat mechanism nor knew of the defect before entering the automobile. Nor did she cause her co-employee to suddenly react and apply his brakes in a manner so as to cause her to be flung forward striking the interior front firewall of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The Board\u2019s reliance on <em>Mazza v. Board of Trustees, Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirement Sys., </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>22, 667 A.2d 1052 (1995), is not persuasive. As we noted in <em>Flores, </em>\u201cthe accident in <em>Mazza </em>did not involve a completely external force but rather the interaction between a mounted policeman and his horse.\u201d <em>Flores, supra, </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 279, 670 A.2d 1113. Here, the forces which propelled petitioner both backward and forward were totally external and independent of any act on petitioner\u2019s part. Additionally, as noted by the ALJ, unlike in <em>Mazza, </em>where there was no impact, but merely a twisting of the officer\u2019s back as his horse reared up, here petitioner\u2019s body, and particularly her right hand which held the cane, actually impacted with the firewall and interior of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">We fully realize, as we did in <em>Flores, </em>that the phrase \u201ctraumatic event\u201d has been interpreted differently in a line of cases dealing with slip and fall-type accidents. <em>Id. </em>at 278, 670 A.2d 1113. However, petitioner\u2019s injury clearly was not sustained in a slip and fall incident, and we are not bound to an analysis of \u201ctraumatic event\u201d applicable to such occurrences.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">We also are not persuaded by the Board\u2019s contention that there was no traumatic event because petitioner\u2019s body only moved a short distance within the interior of the automobile. Just as in <em>Flores, </em>we perceive of no reason why a short moving distance before impact is dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 280, 670 A.2d 1113. Here, both petitioner and Walker described the movement of plaintiff as sudden and unexpected and, as noted, the cause of her body\u2019s movement was external.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">The Board\u2019s final decision denying petitioner\u2019s application for an accidental disability pension is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\"> The ALJ's recommended decision was issued prior to our decision in <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of the Pub. Employees Retirement Sys., </em>287 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>670 A.2d 1113 (App.Div.1996). After <em>Flores </em>was published, and prior to the Board\u2019s final decision, the ALJ supplemented her decision citing <em>Flores.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
