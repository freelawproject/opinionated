The indictment was dismissed after the trial judge declared a mistrial, at defendant\u2019s request, because of the State\u2019s violation of a sequestration order. The judge concluded that the mistrial occurred as a result of the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cinexcusable neglect,\u201d and that the concept of double jeopardy barred a retrial. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-12\">For present purposes, we adopt the defendant\u2019s version of the facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-13\">Prior to trial, [the judge] issued a sequestration order to be applicable to all the State and defense witnesses. On the first day of trial, the State called Sergeant Neil Minovich of the Newark Police Department who testified as to the events surrounding the arrest of the defendant. [We have not been supplied with this portion of the transcript.] On the second day of trial, the State called Police Officer W. Mehalaris to the stand. This officer also testified to the events leading up to the arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-14\">During cross-examination, defense counsel began questioning the witness as to certain statements that appeared to resemble too closely the prior testimony of Sergeant Minovich. In particular, defense counsel asked the speed the officer was traveling when he first passed the Eespondent. Officer Mehalaris testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>they were driving around twenty-five to thirty miles per hour which was the exact response given by Sergeant Minovich when he testified a day earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">The following questions were next asked by defense counsel:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">Q. When was the last time you discussed this case with any of your colleagues? A. Probably yesterday with the prosecutor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">Q. When yesterday with the prosecutor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">A. Yesterday afternoon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">Q. Yesterday afternoon? You mean Wednesday afternoon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">Q. Were your colleagues present when you discussed it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-12\">A. Officers Cannon and Minovich were present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-13\">Q. What time in the afternoon were you discussing it with the other officers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-14\">A. Approximately 4 o\u2019clock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-15\">Q. Four o\u2019clock in the afternoon you were with other officers discussing this case with the prosecutor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-16\">A. That\u2019s correct, in his office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-17\">Q. Were you aware of the sequestration order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-18\">A. I was talking to the prosecutor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-19\">Q. ... My question to you is, you told this Court that at 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, you were discussing this case with your colleagues, with the prosecutor. Isn\u2019t that what you told us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-20\">A. We were in the office talking to the Prosecutor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-21\">Q. And your colleagues were there; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-22\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-23\">Q. Were you aware of a sequestration order issued by this Court yesterday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-24\">A. I assume there was a sequestration order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-25\">Q. ... Well, let me just establish that at 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, you were with your colleagues discussing this case with the prosecutor; correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-26\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-27\">The officer was excused, and a discussion then ensued outside the presence of the jury as to what the appropriate remedy should be for the violation of the sequestration order. The Court next asked the officer to come back in the courtroom and questioned him as to what transpired in the prosecutor\u2019s office. The officer admitted that he did have a conversation with the prosecutor and Officers Cannon and Minovich and that some questions were asked of him regarding this incident. Officer Cannon was another officer that was to testify who was also present in the prosecutor\u2019s office with Sergeant Minovich who had already testified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-28\">A motion was then heard as to whether the court should declare a mistrial. The officer was called back to the stand. Officer Mehalaris again conceded that the prosecutor asked him \u201cone or two questions about the case\u201d and that he specifically remembered that one of the questions was whether he had spoken with any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>witnesses who were sitting on the porch in front of where the Respondent was arrested. The prosecutor asked the witness whether he spoke with Sergeant Minovich while in the office, and the officer said he had not. Under further questioning, Officer Mehalaris revealed that he had left the prosecutor\u2019s office with Sergeant Minovich and rode down in the elevator with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">After discussing the matter in chambers and hearing oral argument from both sides in open court, [the trial judge] found that a violation of the sequestration order had occurred. The Court then declared a mistrial, and the jury panel was dismissed. A motion was subsequently filed by defense counsel on the issue of double jeopardy and the barring of a retrial____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">The motion was heard on November 1, 1996. [The judge] explained that he had declared a mistrial and had given both sides the opportunity to brief the issue of double jeopardy on the matter. [The judge] questioned the prosecutor as to the purpose of a sequestration order and instructed that it was to prevent the parroting of testimony by a witness who has not testified but has met with someone who has already testified. The prosecutor claimed he did not know Sergeant Minovich was in the room. Defense counsel argued that the room is very small and that visitors are not given entry into a prosecutor\u2019s office unless buzzed in by the prosecutor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">[The judge] found that as the room was small and because the prosecutor was aware that a sequestration order was in effect, his conduct amounted to \u201cinexcusable neglect\u201d as defined in <em>State v. Nappo, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>600, 603 [450 A.2d 604] (Law Div.1982), and that the form of the prosecutorial misconduct barred retrial of the charges because of double jeopardy considerations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">(Transcript references and footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Despite defendant\u2019s suggestion to the contrary, the judge did not cite <em>State v. Nappo, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>600, 450 A.2d 604 (Law Div.1982), in his opinion dismissing the indictment. However, he did refer to it during argument on the motion. The judge\u2019s opinion dismissing the indictment merely disagreed with the prosecutor\u2019s statement that, given the size of the room in his office and the number of people therein, he \u201ccould not have known\u201d he was discussing the case with an officer who had not yet testified while one who had already testified was also present.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Based on his disagreement, the judge concluded that such conduct amounted to \u201c[injexcusable neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number><em>State v. Nappo </em>involved the dismissal of a municipal court case at defendant\u2019s request when the prosecuting attorney failed to appear on the date to which cross-examination of a State\u2019s witness was to be carried. 185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>600, 450 A.2d 604. Another municipal judge declined to dismiss a complaint which was subsequently filed charging the same offense, together with a second complaint alleging a similar charge known to the State at the time of original filing. <em>Id. </em>at 602, 450 A.2d 604. On appeal, the Law Division reversed and dismissed the new complaints. <em>Id. </em>at 607, 450 A.2d 604. Citing <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>600, 611, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1075, 1081, 47 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>267, 276 (1976), the Law Division noted that retrials are precluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2YH\">after a mistrial granted at defendant\u2019s request, [when the mistrial is based on] \u201cgovernmental actions intended to provoke mistrial requests\u201d or \u201cbad-faith conduct by [the] prosecutor [which] threatens the \u2018harassment of an accused by successive prosecutions or declaration of a mistrial so as to afford the prosecution a more favorable opportunity to convict\u2019 the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\"><em>[Nappo, supra, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 603, 450 A.2d 604.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">The Law Division further noted that Justice Rehnquist\u2019s treatment of <em>Dinitz </em>in the majority opinion in <em>United States v. Scott, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>82, 94, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2187, 2195, 57 L.Ed.2d 65, 76 (1978) \u201cas accepting the prohibition [to retrial] only when the prosecutor specifically intended to provoke a mistrial,\u201d was not the law as enunciated in subsequent federal or New Jersey cases. <em>Nappo, supra, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 604, 450 A.2d 604. The Law Division in <em>Nappo </em>found the non-appearance of the prosecutor was either \u201cintended' to provoke the motion\u201d to dismiss the case or, when combined with the new filings, was \u201cmotivated by bad faith or undertaken to harass the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 605, 450 A.2d 604. Hence, the Law Division dismissed the new complaints and held that defendant was to be deemed acquitted. <em>Id. </em>at 607, 450 A.2d 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Following the <em>Nappo </em>decision, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>667, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>2083, 72 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 416 (1982), in which Justice Rehnquist\u2019s majority opinion revisited <em>Dinitz </em>and the impact of a defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial as a waiver of the double jeopardy preclusion. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>four members of the Court, speaking through Justice Stevens, urged that \u201can exception for overreaching or harassment should remain available for the rare case in which it may be needed,\u201d 456 <em>U.S. </em>at 691, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2097, 72 L.Ed.2d at 435, Justice Rehnquist recognized \u201cthat language taken from our earlier opinions may well suggest a broader rule,\u201d and he narrowed the exception to the general rule that a defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial constitutes a waiver of his or her double jeopardy rights, 456 <em>U.S. </em>at 677-78, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2090, 72 L.Ed.2d at 426.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">In <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>the Supreme Court held that a mistrial, even though on defendant\u2019s motion, can preclude retrial when \u201cthe conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\u201d 456 <em>U.S. </em>at 679, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2091, 72 L.Ed.2d at 427. Justice Rehnquist explained that a broader exception was inappropriate because a reversal following a guilty verdict does not preclude retrial, and judges \u201cmight well be more loathe to grant a defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial\u201d if the rule were different. 456 <em>U.S. </em>at 676, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2090, 72 L.Ed.2d at 425. Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">Prosecutorial conduct that might be viewed as harassment or overreaching, even if sufficient to justify a mistrial on defendant\u2019s motion ... does not bar retrial absent intent on the part of the prosecutor to subvert the protections afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause. A defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial constitutes \u201ca deliberate election on his part to forgo his valued right to have his guilt or innocence determined before the first trier of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>[437 <em>U.S. </em>82, 93, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2187, 2195, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>65 (1978).] Where prosecutorial error even of a degree sufficient to warrant a mistrial has occurred, \u201c[t]he important consideration, for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed in the event of such error.\u201d <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>[424 <em>U.S. </em>at 609, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1080, 47 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 274-75.] Only where the governmental conduct in question is intended to \u201cgoad\u201d the defendant into moving for a mistrial may a defendant raise the bar of double jeopardy to a second trial after having succeeded in aborting the first on his own motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\"><em>[Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>at 675-76, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2089, 72 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 424-25.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2C\">Our state constitutional double jeopardy protection is coextensive. <em>See, e.g., State v. D\u2019Amato, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>595, 602 n. 1, 528 A.2d 928 (App.Div.1987), <em>certif. denied, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>170, 540 A.2d 169 (1988); <em>State v. DeMarco, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>421, 423-25, 511 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>A.2d 1251 (App.Div.1986). Thus, our Supreme Court has stated that retrial is not barred when a case is mistried pursuant to a defendant\u2019s motion absent a \u201cshowing of bad faith on the part of the prosecutor,\u201d <em>State v. Gallegan, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>345, 357, 567 A.2d 204 (1989),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">\u201c[o]nly where the government conduct in question is intended to \u2018goad\u2019 the defendant into moving for a mistrial may a defendant raise the bar of double jeopardy to a second trial after having succeeded in aborting the first on his own motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">[117 <em>N.J. </em>at 358, 567 A.2d 204 (quoting <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, supra, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>at 676, <em>102 S.Ct </em>at 2089, 72 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 425).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-7\"><em>Accord DeMarco, supra, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 423-25, 511 A.2d 1251; <em>State v. Andrial, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 8, 495 A.2d 878 (App.Div.1985); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-9d(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">We need not decide if the mistrial was properly granted. We are in any event satisfied that, even assuming the prosecutor acted improperly or inexcusably, he did not endeavor to \u201cgoad\u201d the defendant into moving for a mistrial. Defendant could have sought to cross-examine the State\u2019s witnesses and sum up by reference to the impact of their communications during trial in violation of the sequestration order. <em>See State v. Tillman, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>137, 143-44, 299 A.2d 419 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>428, 302 A.2d 132 (1973). Having elected to move for a mistrial,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> defendant also elected not to take his chances with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>jury and seek reversal for violation of the sequestration order in which event he could be retried with impunity. <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, supra, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>at 672-74, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2087-89, 72 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 422-23; <em>State v. Tillman, supra </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 143-44, 299 A.2d 419. As a result, his decision to move for a mistrial similarly poses no bar to retrial. <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, supra, </em>456 <em>U.S. </em>at 672-74, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2087-89, 72 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 422-23; <em>State v. Gallegan, supra, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 357-58, 567 A.2d 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The trial judge erroneously relied on the \u201cinexcusable neglect\u201d standard. To the extent he relied on <em>State v. Nappo, </em>that opinion must be deemed overruled by the subsequent decision in <em>Oregon v. Kennedy </em>and our state\u2019s eo-extensive treatment of the federal double jeopardy rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded for trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-11\"> We have not been presented with the sequestration order or told what is provided. It is appropriate to make clear precisely what is being ordered when a sequestration order is entered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-9\"> In <em>Gallegan, </em>the Law Division on defendant\u2019s interlocutory appeal dismissed municipal complaints because the trial prosecutor did not appear on the continued trial date and the municipal judge carried the matter. 117 <em>N.J. </em>at 350-51, 567 A.2d 204. We affirmed, and the Supreme Court reversed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b232-10\"> Significantly, we see this case as involving a defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial. Defendant's reliance on <em>Nappo </em>and other cases dealing with the exception to the waiver rule based on prosecutorial misconduct supports this view. Although not citing <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>the State argues \"[t]his mistrial occurred with defendant\u2019s consent.\u201d When the issue was initially raised during trial, defendant sought to have the testimony of witnesses Mahalaris and Cannon, who had not completed their testimony, be stricken, and the State argued they could be cross-examined on the violation and that defendant could sum up on the issue. When the judge asked defense counsel what the remedy should be if he did not strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the testimony, defendant requested a \"mistrial.\u201d The judge stated that he was \u201cnot willing to strike [the] testimony\" and declared a mistrial. The judge then adjourned the matter for briefing as to whether retrial was barred as a matter of double jeopardy. If the judge improperly denied the relief defendant sought, we might not view this case as involving a mistrial with defendant's consent. However, as the judge was correct in denying defendant\u2019s initial request to strike the testimony, we must view this case as involving defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial. We also note that \"[m]istrials declared with the defendant\u2019s consent do not bar later prosecution.\u201d <em>Love v. Morton, </em>112 F.3d 131 (3d Cir.1997), citing <em>United States v. Dinitz, supra, </em>424 <em>U.S. </em>at 607, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1079-80. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1 \u2014 9(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
