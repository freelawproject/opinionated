Their property settlement agreement, incorporated into their divorce judgment, required Mr. Konzelman to pay permanent alimony of $700 a week until his or his former wife\u2019s death, his wife\u2019s remarriage, or his wife\u2019s \u201c[ejohabitation ... with an unrelated adult male for a period of four continuous months.\u201d Contending that the latter contingency had occurred, Mr. Konzelman stopped making alimony payments. Ms. Konzelman denied cohabitation and moved for the resumption of alimony. Because their children are emancipated adults, there is no issue of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-14\">After extensive discovery and a bench trial that was conducted on thirteen separate dates between April 11 and July 13,1994, the judge found that Ms. Konzelman and an \u201cunrelated adult male,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Mr. Robert Liput, were continuously cohabiting within the meaning of the Konzelmans\u2019 property settlement agreement. The court ruled, however, that the provision of the Konzelmans\u2019 agreement which provided for termination of alimony in the event of cohabitation violated public policy and was therefore unenforceable under <em>Melletz v. Melletz, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>359, 638 A.2d 898 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>307, 645 A.2d 136 (1994). After further discovery and another three-day bench trial in September 1995, the court found that Mr. Liput was contributing at least $170 a week to Ms. Konzelman\u2019s financial support and, pursuant to <em>Gayet v. Gayet, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>149, 456 A.2d 102 (1983), the court reduced Mr. Konzelman\u2019s alimony obligation by that amount. The trial judge denied the award of an attorney\u2019s fee to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Mr. Konzelman has appealed and Ms. Konzelman has cross-appealed. He argues that the anti-cohabitation clause of their agreement is valid and should have been enforced as written. Alternatively, he contends that all alimony should have been discontinued because Ms. Konzelman failed to prove that neither she nor Mr. Liput contributed to the other\u2019s financial support. Ms. Konzelman argues that the court erred in finding that she and Mr. Liput were cohabiting and therefore her alimony should not have been reduced. Each of the parties complains about the court\u2019s denial of his or her application for an attorney\u2019s fee, and each asks this court to enter a favorable judgment without remanding the case to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">At the initial trial, Mr. Konzelman presented a private investigator who testified that he had conducted a surveillance of Ms. Konzelman\u2019s residence seven days a week for 127 continuous days. According to the investigator, on weekdays Mr. Liput would usually pick up the newspaper from the end of Ms. Konzelman\u2019s driveway at 7 a.m., get into his car, drive to work, return to the house in the late afternoon or evening, and remain in the house overnight. There were, however, obvious errors in the investigator\u2019s testimony and discrepancies between his field notes and his final report.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Nonetheless, Mr. Liput and Ms. Konzelman conceded that they had a close, exclusive, \u201cromantic relationship,\u201d at least since approximately April or May 1990. Ms. Konzelman testified that during 1991, 1992, and 1993, she and Mr. Liput spent at least 30 weekends a year and some weekday nights together, either at her three-bedroom, ranch-style home in Wayne, New Jersey, or on vacation trips elsewhere. In 1993, they went on an eight-day ski vacation to Switzerland in February; from March 26 to the end of April, they skied together in Vail, Colorado; from May 25 to June 1, they traveled together in Germany; and they rented a condominium together at the Jersey shore from July 17 to July 24. In February 1994, they went skiing together in Italy. Ms. Konzelman testified she won the 1993 trip to Germany as a cash register prize at a supermarket; Mr. Liput paid for all of the expenses of their other vacations except some unidentified airplane tickets which were purchased with frequent flyer miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Mr. Liput and Ms. Konzelman customarily spent holidays and other occasions in each other\u2019s company, together with other members of their families. In 1993, Mr. Liput and Ms. Konzelman had Easter dinner at Mr. Liput\u2019s cousin\u2019s house. They celebrated July 4th at a barbecue for twenty guests at Ms. Konzelman\u2019s home; Ms. Konzelman\u2019s mother, Mr. Liput\u2019s sister, and his sister\u2019s boyfriend were among the guests. They spent Christmas Eve at Mr. Liput\u2019s sister\u2019s house with other members of his family; they had Christmas dinner at Ms. Konzelman\u2019s home with her brother and his family, Ms. Konzelman\u2019s mother, and a few friends. They spent New Year\u2019s Eve and New Year\u2019s Day together. During 1993, there were a dozen visits of one or more of Mr. Liput\u2019s children to Ms. Konzelman\u2019s home. Mr. Liput\u2019s 19-year old son went skiing with them in Okemo, Vermont in January 1994. On Mother\u2019s Day 1994, Mr. Liput\u2019s mother was at Ms. Konzelman\u2019s house, and then she, Mr. Liput, and Ms. Konzelman went somewhere else for dinner. Ms. Konzelman accompanied Mr. Liput when he went to visit his son at a drug rehabilitation center in Pennsylvania, and she has been a spectator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>at some of the softball games in which Mr. Liput\u2019s team, the Ageless Wonders, was playing.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Ms. Konzelman\u2019s garage door can be opened by a remote door-opener. Mr. Liput keeps a door-opener for her garage in his car. Her home is protected by an alarm system which is armed or disarmed by entering codes from keypads in the house. He has the code for disarming the system. He keeps tools, his bicycle, and, some of the time, his skis in her garage, and some clothes and toilet articles in her house. Mr. Liput cuts the lawn at Ms. Konzelman\u2019s residence and does other gardening there. He also cleans the gutters and the above-ground swimming pool. He bought and paid for the pool. In the records of Mr. Liput\u2019s softball team, the telephone number for contacting him is Ms. Konzelman\u2019s number.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Throughout the trial on \u201ccohabitation,\u201d Ms. Konzelman denied that she had a joint bank account with Mr. Liput. During the subsequent trial on their financial interdependence, they were shown to have a joint savings account. Ms. Konzelman claimed that the account was solely for the benefit of her mother, and that she and her brother, who lives in California, deposited money into the account for her mother\u2019s use. There was no evidence, however, that Ms. Konzelman\u2019s brother had ever deposited money into the account. The proofs showed that no money from the account had ever been used for the benefit of Ms. Konzelman\u2019s mother. But funds had been deposited and withdrawn by both Ms. Konzelman and Mr. Liput. One deposit slip written by Ms. Konzelman listed the depositor\u2019s address as her own and showed Mr. Liput as the depositor.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">There was substantial evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s finding that Mr. Liput was contributing at least $170 a week toward Ms. Konzelman\u2019s financial support. Mr. Konzelman introduced evidence of the rental value of Ms. Konzelman\u2019s home, arguing that, because Mr. Liput paid no rent, she was supporting him to the extent of his share of its rental value, but the court found that the evidence of rental value was inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>Mr. Liput denied that he was residing with Ms. Konzelman. He testified that his residence was a one-bedroom condominium in Kearny which he shared with his ill, elderly mother. He claimed that he slept in a pull-out sofa-bed in the living room of the apartment where, according to his testimony, he kept his clothing in two armoires and a bureau. His mother uses the living room closet to store her clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The evidence shows that Mr. Liput did not contribute to the purchase of the condominium and that he was not contributing significantly to the expense of maintaining it. He knew only two of the residents of neighboring apartments and, when his pretrial deposition was taken, he did not know the number of his parking space. Ms. Konzelman testified that during the course of four years she had visited the Kearny apartment no more than four or five times. She did not know the number of the telephone in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Mr. Liput\u2019s testimony that his real place of abode was his sick, elderly mother\u2019s one-bedroom condominium in Kearny tended to confirm rather than to refute the evidence that he was living with Ms. Konzelman in her home in Wayne. The trial court disbelieved his testimony. After acknowledging the flaws in the testimony of Mr. Konzelman\u2019s investigator and summarizing the other evidence, the court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">[T]he other evidence which was adduced ... indicates to me that the true nature of the relationship was one in which Lipit [sic] was at the Konzelman residence on a regular basis, that he resided there, that he left for work at that residence, that he engaged in extensive familial contact with Mrs. Konzelman involving her family and his family, that he had undertaken the assumption of duties and obligations usually manifested by married people, although there was no direct testimony that they had ever held themselves out to be man and wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">____ Clearly, the parties understood that were they to openly engage in a relationship in which Mr. Lipit [sic], without hesitation, acknowledged his residence at the Konzelman residence, that ... Mr. Konzelman would invoke the provisions of the clause and attempt to terminate alimony____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">____ I find that [Mr. Konzelman] has established that ... Mrs. Konzelman and Mr. Liput were residing together and as 1 said, were cohabiting____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">The evidence is more than sufficient to justify these findings. There is also adequate evidence to sustain the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>finding that Mr. Liput contributed to Ms. Konzehnan\u2019s financial support at least to the extent of approximately $170 a week. We therefore reject Ms. Konzelman\u2019s challenges to the trial court\u2019s factual determinations. <em>Cf. Rova Farms Resort v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The Konzelmans\u2019 property settlement agreement does not define \u201ccohabitation.\u201d The term, however, has a recognized meaning in the context in which it was used. As Ms. Konzelman\u2019s attorney told the trial judge during the argument of a motion, \u201cwhat that means to me legally is that two people resided together \u2014 for an old fashioned expression, as man and wife, and shared those type[s] of obligations.... physical, non-physical, economic and non-economic.\u201d The first definition of \u201ccohabit\u201d in the <em>American Heritage Dictionary </em>369 (1992 ed.) is \u201cTo live together as spouses.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged </em>440 (1986) defines \u201ccohabit\u201d as \u201cto live together as or as if husband and wife us[ually] without a legal marriage having been performed\u201d; it defines \u201ccohabitation\u201d as \u201cthe act or state of cohabiting especially] as or as if husband and wife.\u201d A legal dictionary defines cohabitation as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">To live together as husband and wife. The mutual assumption of those marital rights, duties and obligations which are usually manifested by married people, including but not necessarily dependent on sexual relations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\"><em>[.Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>236 (5th ed.1979).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">This court quoted the latter definition of \u201ccohabitation\u201d with approval in <em>Crowe v. De Gioia, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 33, 495 A.2d 889 (App.Div.1985), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>50, 505 A.2d 591 (1986). Reported cases from other jurisdictions have defined \u201ccohabitation\u201d in a similar fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">\u201c[Clohabitation\u201d ... refers to a domestic arrangement between a man and woman who are not married to each other, but who live as husband and wife, in that, for more than a brief period of time, they share a common domicile and living expenses and are sexually intimate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\"><em>[Edwards v. Edwards, </em>73 <em>Or.App. </em>272, 698 P.2d 542, 547 (1985).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">[T]he term \u201ccohabitation\u201d implies more than merely a common residence or a sexual relationship. We believe the ordinary definition of \u201ccohabitation,\u201d describing a relationship of living together \u201cas man and wife,\u201d connotes mutual assumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>of the duties and obligations associated with marriage____ In interpreting \u201ccohabitation,\u201d courts may consider indicia such as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">1. establishment of a common residence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">2. long-term intimate or romantic involvement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">3. shared assets or common bank accounts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-9\">4. joint contribution to household expenses; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-10\">5. recognition of the relationship by the community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\"><em>[Gordon v. Gordon, </em>342 <em>Md. </em>294, 675 A.2d 540, 547-48 (1996) (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">As the trial court implicitly ruled in the present case, there is no reason to doubt that the Konzelmans\u2019 agreement uses \u201ccohabitation\u201d in the sense ascribed to it by these authorities. Thus defined, the term accurately describes the relationship between Mr. Liput and Ms. Konzelman. Consequently, as the trial court also implicitly recognized, Mr. Konzelman proved the condition which the parties\u2019 agreement establishes as the predicate for terminating his obligation to pay alimony. The court refused to order termination of alimony, however, only because it concluded that that result was foreclosed by New Jersey public policy as defined in <em>Gayet, supra, </em>and <em>Melletz, supra. </em>For the following reasons, we disagree with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">In <em>Gayet, </em>our Supreme Court held that a dependent former spouse\u2019s cohabitation with a person of the opposite sex would not necessarily terminate the supporting spouse\u2019s obligation to pay alimony. The Court described as follows two conflicting policies which affected its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-15\">Two policies of the law intersect in the resolution of this issue. First, the Legislature has directed that alimony shall terminate upon remarriage. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-25; <em>see Sharpe v. Sharpe, </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>410 [263 A.2d 490] (Ch.Div.1970), <em>mod, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>468 [273 A.2d 572] (1971). This signals a policy to end alimony when the supported spouse forms a new bond that eliminates the prior dependency as a matter of law. That policy, however, can conflict with another state policy that guarantees individual privacy, autonomy, and the right to develop personal relationships free from governmental sanctions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-16\"><em>[Gayet, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 151, 456 A.2d 102.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-17\">The <em>Gayet </em>Court recognized \u201cthe sense of injustice that will be engendered in the supporting spouse,\u201d but it concluded that to accommodate these conflicting policies, \u201c[t]he extent of actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>economic dependency, not one\u2019s conduct as a cohabitant, must determine the duration of support as well as its amount.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154, 456 A.2d 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Significantly, however, in <em>Gayet, supra, </em>the divorcing spouses had not agreed that cohabitation would be a ground for terminating alimony. Judicial modification of the alimony provision of the judgment of divorce would have been necessary to authorize the termination. In the present case, the parties agreed that \u201ccohabitation ... with an unrelated adult male for a period of four continuous months\u201d would be a reason to terminate alimony. Ms. Konzelman testified that she intended to abide by that agreement and she has not contended that her consent to it was coerced.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Consequently, in the present case, when we decide how to balance the \u201cpolicy to end alimony when the supported spouse forms a new bond\u201d against the competing claims of the \u201cstate policy that guarantees individual privacy, autonomy, and the right to develop personal relationships free from governmental sanctions,\u201d the balance is significantly affected by the divorcing spouses\u2019 voluntary agreement that alimony would terminate upon cohabitation. As our Supreme Court wrote,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">We have recognized and emphasized repeatedly that matrimonial agreements between spouses relating to alimony and support, which are fair and just, fall within the category of contracts enforceable in equity. Such agreements are essentially consensual and voluntary in character and therefore entitled to considerable weight with respect to their validity and enforceability notwithstanding the fact that such an agreement has been incorporated in a judgment of divorce.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adu\"><em>[Petersen v. Petersen, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>638, 642, 428 A.2d 1301 (1981) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">The Court went on to emphasize, however, that such agreements relating to alimony and support are enforceable only when they are equitable and just, but that \u201cit should be the burden of the party challenging the validity and enforceability of such an agreement to show that its terms, in light of changed circumstances, are unfair and unjust.\u201d <em>Petersen, supra, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>at 644, 428 A.2d 1301; <em>cf. Massar v. Massar, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>89, 93, 652 A.2d 219 (App.Div.1995) (\u201cMarital agreements____ are approached with a predisposition in favor of their validity and enforceability.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>In <em>Melletz, supra, </em>we held that the clause of a property settlement agreement which suspended alimony during the wife\u2019s cohabitation with an unrelated male was unenforceable because, as interpreted by the trial court and as applied to the facts of the case, the clause was clearly unfair and unjust. According to the trial judge, from August 30,1991 through November 1991,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">the defendant-wife maintained a social or dating relationship with an individual identified as [Mr. CJ. At all times material, the defendant-wife and [the friend] maintained separate residences but socialized and dated by engaging in such activities as shopping, going out to restaurants, eating meals at the residence of the other and remaining over night with each other. The defendant-wife, during her testimony recalled at least ten overnight stays by [the friend] at the [defendant\u2019s] new condominium in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. Both the defendant-wife and [the friend], during their testimony, described their relationship as \u201cjust dating\u201d and as \u201ca warm friendship.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\"><em>[Melletz, supra, 271 N.J.Super. </em>at 363, 638 A.2d 898.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">If the provision of the Melletzs\u2019 agreement for the suspension of alimony during cohabitation was applicable to those facts, it was clearly arbitrary, unreasonable, unjust and therefore unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Numerous cases throughout the country have enforced voluntary agreements for the suspension or termination of alimony in the event of the dependent former spouse\u2019s \u201ccohabitation\u201d with a person of the opposite sex in a relationship tantamount to marriage. <em>See, e.g., D\u2019Ascanio v.

When the issue of public policy has been raised, courts have expressly held that there is no public policy against the enforcement of such an agreement. </em>See, e.g., Alford v.

To the extent that language in the </em>Melletz <em>opinion can be read </em>as <em>declaring that it would never be just and equitable to enforce the terms of a voluntary property settlement agreement which provide for the suspension or termination of alimony when the dependent spouse has formed a new, apparently permanent, marriage-like relationship with another person of the opposite sex, we respectfully disagree.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Remarriage of a dependent spouse terminates the obligation of the supporting spouse to pay permanent alimony. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-25; <em>Lepis v. Lepis, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>139, 151 n. 4, 416 A.2d 45 (1980); <em>Flaxman v. Flaxman, 57 N.J. </em>458, 462, 273 A.2d 567 (1971). After a divorce, one divorced spouse has no right to attempt to control the other\u2019s personal behavior. <em>See Gayet, supra, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>at 151, 456 A.2d 102. But there are no considerations of public policy which should prevent competent parties to a divorce from freely agreeing that if the dependent spouse enters into a new relationship which, but for the license, is tantamount to a marriage, the economic consequences of the new relationship will be the same as those of a remarriage. We therefore hold that a provision of a property settlement agreement, freely entered into, which causes permanent alimony to terminate if the dependent spouse enters into a new relationship which has all the indicia of marriage except a license is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Ms. Konzelman\u2019s cohabitation with Mr. Liput has been of long duration and was still continuing at the time of trial. Consequently, the facts of this case do not require us to decide whether the contractual provision for termination of Ms. Konzelman\u2019s alimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>would have been enforceable if her cohabitation with Mr. Liput had lasted only for four months or for some other brief period. We are also not required to decide whether Mr. Konzelman\u2019s obligation to pay alimony will be revived if Ms. Konzelman\u2019s cohabitation terminates. We have therefore refrained from attempting to determine either of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Mr. Konzelman\u2019s obligation to support his former wife terminated as of the date of his filing his cross-motion to be relieved of his permanent alimony obligation. Except for the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees, this conclusion moots any of the other issues not discussed in our opinion which either of the parties has raised on appeal. Our disagreement with the trial court about Mr. Konzelman\u2019s obligation to continue to pay alimony does not necessarily imply that the court\u2019s determination on the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees should have been different. Nonetheless, the trial court should have the opportunity to reconsider the issue of attorneys\u2019 fees in the light of our holding on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The judgment appealed from is therefore reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
