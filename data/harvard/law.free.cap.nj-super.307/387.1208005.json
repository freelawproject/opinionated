As a third-time offender, defendant was sentenced to serve 180 days in the county jail and his driving privileges were revoked for ten years, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50(a)(3). Defendant\u2019s jail sentence was stayed pending his appeal to the Law Division; the issue on appeal being the propriety of the 180-day jail term imposed on him. On the trial <em>de novo, </em>Judge Hanifan, relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>State v. Laurick, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>1, 575 A.2d 1340 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>967, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>429, 112 L.Ed.2d 413 (1990), reduced the custodial aspect of defendant\u2019s sentence to ninety days, to conform to the custodial penalty legislatively authorized for a second-time offender. The State appeals. <em>See State v. Faunce, </em>244 <em>N.J.Super. </em>499, 501, 582 A.2d 1268 (App.Div.1990) (holding that the State has the common-law right to appeal where constitutionally permissible). The custodial aspect of defendant\u2019s sentence has once again been stayed pending this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">It appears without dispute that defendant\u2019s first DWI conviction was in 1988 in the Township of Mt. Olive and his second was in 1991 in the Borough of Ft. Lee. At the time of the Mt. Olive offense, defendant was indigent, and he was not represented by counsel. After reviewing the records of the Mt. Olive conviction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Judge Hanifan found that defendant was not advised of either his right to counsel or, in view of his indigency, his right to have counsel appointed to represent him. In point of fact, the 1988 Mt. Olive DWI conviction was an \u201cuncounseled conviction.\u201d Consequently, Judge Hanifan read <em>Launch </em>to require that the Mt. Olive conviction not be counted in applying the progressively-enhanced penalties that second and third offenders receive under <em>N.J.SA </em>39:4-50(a)(2) and (3). As the Court said in <em>Laurich: </em>\u201ca third offender with one prior uncounseled conviction could not be sentenced to more than ninety day\u2019s imprisonment.\u201d <em>Laurick, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 16, 575 A.2d 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">On appeal, the State focuses upon the fact that, in deciding <em>Laurich, </em>the Court relied upon language in <em>Baldasar v. Illinois, </em>446 <em>U.S. </em>222, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>1585, 64 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>169 (1980), to the effect that uncounseled convictions cannot be used to enhance punishment for subsequent offenses. However, the State points out that <em>Baldasar </em>was expressly overruled in <em>Nichols v. United States, </em>511 <em>U.S. </em>738, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>1921, 128 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>745 (1994). The State now urges that, given the opportunity, our Supreme Court would follow <em>Nichols </em>and modify its <em>Laurich </em>decision, so we should reject the reduction of defendant\u2019s sentence and require that he be sentenced as a third-time DWI offender, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">This court may not speculate on whether our Supreme Court would rethink its holding in <em>Laurich </em>because a subsequent United States Supreme Court decision overruled one of the cases upon which <em>Laurich </em>relied. A close reading of <em>Laurich </em>indicates much authority and reasoning apart from <em>Baldasar </em>to support the decision. As to <em>Baldasar, </em>the Court pointedly said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">We are satisfied that there is a core value to <em>Baldasar </em>that we should follow: that an uneounseled conviction without waiver of the right to counsel is invalid for the purpose of increasing a defendant\u2019s loss of liberty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\"><em>[Laurick, supra, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>at 16, 575 A.2d 1340.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">For present purposes, we are bound to adhere to <em>Laurich, </em>and to the \u201ccore value\u201d expressed, which we find to be applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The State further contends that it was improper for the Law Division to consider that a portion of defendant\u2019s custodial sentence could be substituted for service in the Sheriffs Labor Assistance Program. This issue was not raised below and we see no just reason to address it on appeal. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In accordance with the foregoing discussion and substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Hanifan in his oral opinions of December 20, 1996, and March 21, 1997, the final judgment entered April 4,1997, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
