We note, however, and accept, plaintiffs unrebutted correction, supported by her certification, which shows that the Social Security payment made to the parties\u2019 child arises by reason of plaintiffs status as a recipient of Social Security <em>disability </em>payments, and not by reason of SSI (Supplemental Security Income) payments. In consequence, we differ with the judge\u2019s resolution of the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Appendix IX-A, and the Sole-Parenting Worksheet contained in Appendix IX-C, convince us that the judge erred in failing to give consideration to the payments received from Social Security for the benefit of the child. These payments are not, as stated in the <em>R. </em>2:5-l(b) opinion, the result of plaintiffs entitlement to SSI, but arise by reason of her entitlement to non-means-tested Social Security disability payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">We attach hereto as Exhibit A, a copy of revised paragraph lO.b to Appendix IX-A, and a copy of the new instructions respecting Line 12 of the Sole-Parenting Worksheet contained in Appendix IX-B.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">We read these portions of Appendices IX-A and IX-B unambiguously to require deduction from the basic support computation those non-means-tested benefits paid to or for the dependent child that arise by reason of either parent\u2019s disability and which have not resulted in any diminution of Social Security payments to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">As explained in Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>5:6A (1998), the guidelines prescribed by Appendix IX-A to IX-H were recently extensively revised, subsequent to entry of the order and opinion in this case. Given the significance of these revisions in clarifying the rationale appropriate to formulating an equitable approach to calculation and apportionment of child support, our decision should be consistent with the current Appendices. We think it likely that, in promulgating the comprehensive guidelines, the Supreme Court intended that they be deemed applicable to pending cases such as this. At the very least, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>promulgation of the new Appendices must inform the judicial response as to an equitable method of calculating the total amount needed for support of the child. <em>De La Ossa v. De La Ossa, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>557, 677 A.2d 1157 (App.Div.1996), which treated with earlier versions of the guidelines, is of limited utility in current interpretation. Its facts, in any event, are not congruent with those here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Consistent with the policy clarifications enunciated in the new Appendices, we remand for reconsideration by the Family Part the issue of the effect of Social Security benefits received by the child of the marriage attributable to plaintiffs Social Security disability status. The total child support amount shall be recalculated under Appendices IX-A and IX-B (see instructions for Lines 12 and 13 in Appendix IX-B). To the extent of the percentage of support assigned to defendant under the guidelines, an appropriate change in the amount to be paid by defendant for child support (Line 26) shall be made. We leave to the equitable discretion of the Family Part the effective date of the modification so calculated. It shall, however, be not later than the September 1, 1997 effective date of the revised Appendices.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Reversed and remanded in part; affirmed in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\n<em>EXHIBIT A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">Appendix IX-A, paragraph lO.b provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Government Benefits Paid to or for Children \u2014 In some cases, government benefits may be received by or for a child based on a parent\u2019s earnings record, disability, or retirement (e.g., Black Lung, Veterans Disability, Social Security). Such payments are meant to replace the lost earnings of the parent and are paid <em>in addition </em>to the worker\u2019s or member\u2019s benefits (i.e., payments to family members do not reduce the member\u2019s benefits). A parent may also receive other non-means-tested government benefits that are meant to reduce the cost of the child such as adoption subsidies <em>(N.J.A.C. </em>10:121-2). Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and welfare payments received for or on behalf of a child are <em>not included </em>in this category since they supplement parental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>income based on financial need. <em>If non-means tested benefits are paid to or for a dependent child for whom support is being determined, the benefits must be deducted from the basic support obligation </em>(see <em>Potter v. Potter, </em>169 <em>N.J.Super. </em>140 [404 A.2d 352] (App.Div.1979) and <em>De La Ossa v. Be La Ossa, </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>557 [677 A.2d 1157] (App.Div.l996))(Emphasis added). The deduction is provided because the receipt of such benefits reduces the parents\u2019 contributions toward the child\u2019s living expenses (i.e., the marginal cost of the child). If the benefits received by the child are greater than the total support obligation (i.e., the amount of the obligation after deducting the benefits is zero), no support award should be ordered while the child is receiving the benefits. The benefits will continue to be paid by the government agency to the custodial parent in lieu of child support. If the total obligation is greater than the benefits received by the child, the noncustodial parent\u2019s income share of the residual amount (after deducting the benefits) is the support award to be paid to the custodial parent. Government benefits paid to or for a child <em>that reduce benefits paid to a non-custodial parent </em>(an apportionment) <em>should not be deducted from the basic child support award, </em>but should be used to offset the parent\u2019s child support order (i.e., the apportionment represents a payment toward the support order similar to a garnishment). (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Appendix IX-B, Sole Parenting Worksheet</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Line 12 \u2014 Deducting Government Benefits Paid to or for the Child</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Enter government benefits received by the child on behalf of either parent on Line 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">If a child is receiving government benefits based on either parent\u2019s earning record, disability, or retirement, the amount of those benefits must be deducted from the total support award (regardless of the effect of the child\u2019s benefit payments on benefits paid to the parent). Such benefits include, but are not limited to: Social Security Retirement or Disability, Black Lung, and Veteran\u2019s Administration benefits. Also included are non-means-tested government benefits meant to offset the cost of the child such as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>adoption subsidies <em>(N.J.AC. </em>10:121-2). SSI, public assistance (TANF), and other means-tested benefits are <em>not </em>government benefits based on a parent\u2019s earnings record, disability or retirement and should not be included on Line 12. If the government benefit received by the child is greater than the total support award (i.e., the amount of the total support award after deducting the government benefit is zero or less), the amount of the government benefit that is being paid to or for the child represents the support award. In such cases, the support award should be made payable directly to the obligee (i.e., from the government agency to the obligee; not through Probation). If the government benefit is less than the total support obligation, it shall continue to be paid directly to the obligee and the residual amount shall be paid through Probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Note that these benefits are <em>not </em>included in the gross income of the recipient parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Line 13 \u2014 Calculating the Total Child Support Amount</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Add the basic child support amount, net child-care cost, health insurance cost for the child, predictable and recurring unreimbursed health-care costs above $250 per child per year, and court-approved predictable and recurring extraordinary expenses. Then, Subtract any government benefits received by the child. The result is the Total Child Support Amount. [Math: ((Line 7 + Line 8 + Line 9 + Line 10 + Line 11) \u2014 Line 12) ]. Enter the total support amount on Line 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">IF THE TOTAL CHILD SUPPORT AMOUNT IS ZERO, (THE GOVERNMENT BENEFIT EXCEEDS THE TOTAL CHILD SUPPORT AMOUNT), STOP! GOVERNMENT BENEFITS PAID DIRECTLY TO CHILD\u2019S CUSTODIAN WILL SUBSTITUTE FOR THE CHILD SUPPORT ORDER. OTHERWISE, CONTINUE TO LINE 14.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-14\"><em> Lepis v.
