The motion judge granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, holding that while plaintiff had alleged a vertical restraint of trade, it had failed to prove by the \u201crule of reason\u201d test or by the \u201cper se\u201d violation test, that defendants\u2019 conduct constituted a vertical price-fixing agreement. Further, the judge held that while plaintiff could prove some of the elements of tortious interference, it had not produced evidence that defendants had employed \u201cunlawful means,\u201d such .as fraud, intimidation, misrepresentation or other violations of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">At oral argument, plaintiff limited its argument on the antitrust claim to contending that it had presented sufficient evidence to prove a per se violation, thus abandoning any claim based on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>rule of reason. Additionally, plaintiff continued to urge that defendants\u2019 conduct constituted tortious interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">We reject plaintiffs contentions. A vertical restraint is not illegal per se unless it includes some agreement on price or price levels. <em>See Business Electronics v. Sharp Electronics, </em>485 <em>U.S. </em>717, 735-36, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>1515, 1525-26, 99 L.Ed.2d 808, 823-25, cert. <em>denied, </em>486 <em>U.S. </em>1005, 108 <em>S.Ct. </em>1727, 100 L.Ed.2d 192 (1988). Evidence of price-fixing is lacking here. Further, plaintiff failed to meet all of the requirements to prove a claim for tortious interference. <em>See Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Electronics., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 563 A.2d 31 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The judgment of the Chancery Division is affirmed substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Boyle in his opinion reported at 307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>546, 704 A.2d 1364 (Ch. Div.1996).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
