On counts two and four, each defendant was found not guilty of possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose to use it unlawfully against the property of the alleged victims but found guilty of possession of a weapon with a purpose to use it unlawfully against the person of each victim.

The arguments raised in Points II, III, IV, V, VI, and VII are without merit. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(2). As to those points, we add additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>comment. The balance of this opinion focuses on Point I of defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">On November 15, 1994, at approximately midnight, Victor Diaz and Jose Rodriguez were installing a car radio into a Volkswagen at 18th Street in Paterson when a yellow Cadillac stopped in the street and two men with black handguns in their hands exited the vehicle. One man fired approximately four shots toward the Volkswagen. The other man held his gun in the air and shouted, \u201cThat\u2019s not them.\u201d The men reentered the Cadillac and were driven away by a third individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">On November 16, 1994, Diaz gave a statement at the detective bureau. He stated, \u201cI saw two guys jump out of the yellow car. The driver stayed in the car. As we were looking I saw the guy I know as Marijuana with a gun and it was pointed at us----\u201d Diaz identified a picture of defendant Jose Paduani as \u201cMarijuana.\u201d When questioned as to the identity of the other gunman, he stated, \u201cI know him as Trouble. He is Marijuana\u2019s brother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">On that same date, Rodriguez gave a statement in which he identified the gunmen as \u201cMarijuana\u201d and \u201cTrouble,\u201d the names by which he knew defendant and co-defendant, Richard Paduani. Rodriguez also identified photographs of both assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">Subsequent to November 16, 1994, each victim recanted his prior statement and attempted to withdraw all criminal complaints lodged against each defendant. At trial, each victim testified as to the underlying incident, but each victim persisted in recanting the identification of each defendant as contained in their statements at the detective bureau on the morning of December 16, 1994. Additionally, Rodriguez disavowed giving any statement to detectives. The only other witnesses for the State were detectives who had interviewed either Diaz or Rodriguez. The trial judge conducted two <em>Rule </em>104 evidentiary hearings and admitted the statements of both Rodriguez and Diaz as prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>It is abundantly clear that the primary issue at trial was the credibility of Rodriguez and Diaz, comparing their statements allegedly given on November 16, 1994, their recantations at trial as to the identification of each defendant, and the testimony of detectives who took the statements allegedly given by each victim on November 16th. The jury obviously rejected each victim\u2019s recantation as to their identification of the perpetrators as Richard and Jose Paduani.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Defendant contends that by conducting twenty-nine sidebar conferences off the record, the trial judge committed plain error requiring reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction and a new trial. In analyzing the efficacy of this contention, we are guided by our decision in <em>State v. Green, </em>129 <em>N.J.Super. </em>157, 322 A.2d 495 (App.Div.1974). In <em>Green, </em>we considered, among other issues, whether the denial of a motion for sequestration was error. We noted the absence of a record as to the motion and under those circumstances were constrained to reverse. In reaching that conclusion we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-7\">This points up a potential hazard in conducting side bar discussions off the record. The transcript of this trial contains a record of 18 such conferences of unknown length. While we recognize the absolute necessity for side bar conferences if trials are to proceed without undue delay and to avoid the needless shuttling of juries between the courtroom and the jury room, great care must be exercised by the trial judge to assure preservation of a verbatim recording of the proceedings required by <em>R. </em>1:2-2 and <em>R. </em>2:5-3(a). The complete transcript is of crucial importance for a meaningful review to both the appellate court and to new counsel on appeal. All side bar conferences which pertain in any way to the trial or the conduct thereof must be \u201con the record\u201d and a verbatim recording made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 166, 322 A.2d 495 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">Despite our admonition in <em>Green, </em>we did not conclude that every failure to comply with the cited rules constitutes a <em>per se </em>basis for reversal. <em>See R. </em>2:10-2 (\u201cAny error or omission shall be disregarded by the appellate court unless it is of such a nature as to have been clearly capable of producing an unjust result, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>appellate court may, in the interests of justice, notice plain error not brought to the attention of the trial or appellate court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">By analogy, our Supreme Court concluded in <em>State v. Perry, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>128, 590 A.2d 624 (1991), that a \u201cgap\u201d in a trial record neither automatically results in a defective trial record nor automatically prejudices a defendant\u2019s chance for appellate review. The Court noted: \u201cThe three \u2018gaps,\u2019 when read in the context of the entire transcript and of those discussions immediately preceding each gap, all involved inconsequential administrative matters or were related simply to waiting for the jury to re-enter the courtroom and settle into the jury box.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170, 590 A.2d 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The Supreme Court of Hawaii recently decided in <em>State v. Bates, </em>84 <em>Hawai\u2018i </em>211, 933 P.2d 48 (1997),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with an exhaustive review of federal and state precedent, including that of Hawaii, <em>id. </em>933 P.2d at 55, that: \u201c[Wjhere the transcripts of a defendant\u2019s trial are incomplete because they omit portions of the trial proceedings, such omissions do not mandate reversal unless the defendant can demonstrate specific prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>933 P.2d at 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\"><em>Bates </em>also added the following caveat: \u201c[A] defendant has a duty to reconstruct, modify, or supplement the missing portions of the record, and a failure to make a reasonable attempt to do so precludes him or her from alleging reversible error.\u201d <em>Ibid.See also R. </em>1:2-2, Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 3 (Reconstruction of record); <em>see also, R. </em>2:5-5(a) (Motion to Settle the Record).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">We note that in <em>United States v. Sierra, </em>981 <em>F.2d </em>123 (3rd Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>508 <em>U.S. </em>967, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2949, 124 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>696 (1993), the Third Circuit concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">Our view that the failure to comply with the Court Reporter Act does not warrant reversal without a specific showing of prejudice is generally shared by other circuits____ [Ijnasmuch as many of the trial rulings made at sidebar are reflected in the recorded transcript of the trial proceedings, the mere absence of the sidebar transcript does not signify prejudice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number><em>[Id, </em>at 125,127.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We recognize that where a defendant contends that error was made in an unrecorded sidebar conference, prejudice may result from our inability to review the alleged error. <em>Calhoun v. United States, </em>384 F.2d 180, 184 (5th Cir.1967). However, that is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">It is undisputed that the record on appeal inexcusably contains twenty-nine unrecorded sidebar conferences. Six of those conferences pertained to administrative matters; twelve conferences were specifically explained to the jury with judicial clarification; eleven conferences were unexplained. In those instances where there was a sidebar pertaining to administrative matters or clarification by the judge following the sidebar, we are satisfied that the absence of a recorded sidebar does not interfere with our appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Defendant contends that in specific instances where a sidebar was unrecorded and there was no post-sidebar conference clarification, the trial judge made prejudicial rulings which cannot be properly reviewed by this court in the absence of a verbatim record of the sidebar colloquy. Yet, our independent review of the record discloses the opposite. In each of defendant\u2019s specific claims, we have reviewed the transcript, both immediately preceding and following the sidebar. We are readily able to discern each issue discussed and, from counsel\u2019s conduct following the sidebar, the purpose of the sidebar and the judicial ruling which prompted counsel\u2019s subsequent conduct or question. We need not review each of defendant\u2019s specific objections. Two objections are illustrative and explain our methodology in reviewing defendant\u2019s claim of plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The Passaic County Indictment referred to defendant as \u201cJose Paduani A/K/A Marijuana.\u201d It is clear from the record that \u201cMarijuana\u201d was <em>not </em>an alias but simply a street name or nick<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>name by which defendant was known in his neighborhood. At a pre-trial conference, the judge directed that defendant\u2019s nickname not be used by the prosecutor in his opening statement or in any reference to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">As noted in Part I, each victim gave a statement to the investigating detectives on November 16,1994, indicating that the assailant who exited the yellow Cadillac holding a gun was a person known to each of them as \u201cMarijuana.\u201d Each victim identified defendant from police photographs as the person he knew as \u201cMarijuana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">One sidebar conference to which defendant assigned prejudice is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-7\">The Prosecutor: And you saw how many individuals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">Mr. Diaz: Two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">Q: Two. Okay. Did you recognize them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-10\">A: Well, we went to the, I saw like another person, like, it was like, couldn\u2019t even see the other person wasn\u2019t on a light, that\u2019s when I said, I recognized like the face looked familiar and that\u2019s when I seen Marijuana, Marijuana is his name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-11\">Q: Jose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-12\">A: Jose, I did not know their names.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-13\">Defense Counsel: Judge, may we approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-14\">(Off the record discussion at side bar)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-15\">Q: So these two individuals that were outside the car, what did you notice about them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-16\">A: Stocky build and like I think I said hair, hair was waving up and the gun\u2014 Q: Gun, who had a gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-17\">A: I believe it was Marijuana, Jose Paduani.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-18\">Q: Jose Paduani had a gun?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-19\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-20\">It is clear from this illustration that the purpose of the sidebar requested by defense counsel was to seek a clarification of the use of the name \u201cMarijuana\u201d by the witness, Diaz, or by the prosecutor, to identify defendant. We are able to conclude that although the judge prohibited the use of the name \u201cMarijuana\u201d in the State\u2019s opening statement, he ruled at sidebar that the name \u201cMarijuana\u201d could thereafter be used during the trial. While the reasons for the judge\u2019s decision would be helpful for appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>review, we can discern no prejudice to defendant by its omission from the record. We also note that defense counsel did not object to the non-recordation of the sidebar conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The second objection references the State\u2019s direct examination of investigating police officer A1 Camacho. Camacho had been asked to describe the victims during his initial contact with them at the crime scene shortly after midnight on the morning of November 16,1994.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-8\">Q. And could you describe their \u2014 the way they acted and describe \u2014 what I mean by that is their demeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">A. Both of the complainants were shaken as though they had went through some type of traumatic incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">Q. So they were \u2014 there was some type of emotional experience that you feel they had experienced, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-11\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-12\">Q. Some type of trauma. And being in the business that you\u2019re in, you see quite a number of individuals\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-13\">Defense Counsel: Objection to what he normally sees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-14\">Prosecutor: Judge, it\u2019s by way of foundation. It may be in reverse, but it\u2019s by way of foundation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-15\">The Court: I\u2019ll allow it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-16\">Q. And in your type of work, sir, you see people who have been traumatized, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-17\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-18\">Defense Counsel: Judge, are we going to qualify this witness as an expert? Prosecutor: That\u2019s not necessary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-19\">The Court: Just a general background, Mr. Baldi (defense counsel).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-20\">Prosecutor: Judge, can I approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-21\">(Sidebar discussion held off the record)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-22\">Q. Did you speak to both of these individuals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-23\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-24\">Q. And did you ask them what happened?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-25\">It is obvious that at sidebar the court ruled favorably for defendant, as the prosecutor immediately shifted his emphasis from the victims\u2019 demeanor to questions relative to the alleged criminal episode. Clearly, the defense was not prejudiced by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>unrecorded sidebar conference which itself was prompted by defendant\u2019s prior objection to the State\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Upon our review of the entire record, we are able to conclude, as did the Delaware Supreme Court in <em>Jensen v. State, </em>482 A.2d 105 (Del.1984), regarding the unclarified sidebar conferences here, either \u201c(a) that no change occurred in the line of questioning following the sidebar; (b) that the record is sufficient to indicate the substance of the sidebar, or (c) that the record discloses no showing of prejudice sufficient to require reversal as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">We also note that in one of defendant\u2019s examples of error, the unrecorded sidebar conference arose in the context of the State\u2019s use of a prior inconsistent statement of one victim. Although the judge\u2019s ruling at sidebar is omitted from the record, the exact ruling is readily available for review in the transcript of the <em>Rule </em>104 evidentiary hearing, in which the trial judge fully explained his ruling, correctly relying upon <em>State v. Gross, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>98, 523 A.2d 215 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>194, 528 A.2d 19 (1987), <em>and aff'd, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>1, 577 A.2d 806 (1990), admitting the prior inconsistent statement. <em>See N.J.R.E. </em>803(a)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, we are able to conclude that the unrecorded ruling at sidebar was consistent with the judge\u2019s prior recorded rulings on the same issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">In Point II, defendant contends that the use of his street name \u201cMarijuana\u201d during trial was improper. The use of defendant\u2019s street nickname during trial cannot serve as a <em>per se </em>predicate for reversal. The State argues that the admission of defendant\u2019s nickname was proper because it was relevant to the State\u2019s case, and that the court\u2019s limiting instruction to the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>regarding the use of such testimony prevented any prejudice to the defendant. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">As we have noted, this ease did not involve the use of an alias as in <em>State v. Salaam, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 541 A.2d 1075 (App.Div.1988), where the trial judge twice referred to the defendant as \u201cAbdul Haqq Salaam, also known as Willie Favors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 72, 541 A.2d 1075. In <em>Salaam, </em>the defendant specifically raised as a point of error that \u201c[he] was denied a fair trial by the use of an alias in the indictment and by the trial court\u2019s repeated reference to defendant\u2019s alias when addressing the jury.\u201d Unlike <em>Salaam, </em>defendant here did not have an alias; he simply had a nickname by which he was known to the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Still, although a nickname is not an alias, we think that the principle enunciated in <em>Salaam </em>that \u201cthe fact of alias names should be kept from the jury unless relevant for some purpose,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 72, 541 A.2d 1075 (citations omitted), is persuasive in instances where a defendant has a pejorative nickname, such as \u201cMarijuana\u201d or \u201cTrouble.\u201d As noted in <em>Salaam: </em>\u201cThe principle [sic] objection to the use of an alias in a criminal proceeding is that an alias implies that the defendant belongs to the criminal class and thereby prejudices the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73, 541 A2.d 1075 (citations omitted). \u201cHowever, the majority of decisions involving this issue hold that the admission of irrelevant aliases into evidence will not afford a basis for reversal unless some tangible form of prejudice is demonstrated, <em>i.e., </em>where such names have been intentionally offered as indicia of guilt.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted). That was not the case here. The testimony was clearly relevant because each defendant was identified to the police by use of a nickname. In fact, defense counsel during trial referenced defendant by use of his nickname. Moreover, defendant has pointed to no tangible form of prejudice attributable to the use of his nickname during trial and our independent review of the record reveals none.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Defendant contends that the trial judge erred in imposing a manifestly excessive sentence and that he failed to articulate why the aggravating factors presented resulted in a sentence in excess of the presumptive term and in the imposition of the maximum period of parole ineligibility. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Appellate review of a sentence is restricted to whether the determination of the sentencing factors was appropriate, whether the determination was supported by competent evidence in the record, and whether the sentence is so unreasonable that it shocks the judicial conscience. <em>State v. O\u2019Donnell, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>210, 215-16, 564 A.2d 1202 (1989); <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 364-65, 471 A.2d 370 (1984); <em>State v. Bull, </em>268 <em>N.J.Super. </em>504, 508-09, 634 A.2d 101 (App.Div.1993), <em>certif. denied, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>304, 639 A.2d 303 (1994). \u201cAn appellate court is bound to affirm a sentence, even if it would have arrived at a different result, as long as the trial court properly identifies and balances aggravating and mitigating factors that are supported by competent credible evidence in the record.\u201d <em>O\u2019Donnell, supra, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>at 215, 564 A.2d 1202; <em>State v. Jarbath, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>394, 400-01, 555 A.2d 559 (1989); <em>Roth, supra, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>at 364-65, 471 A.2d 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In sentencing the defendant, the trial court listed as aggravating factors the risk that defendant will commit another offense, defendant\u2019s prior criminal record, and the need to deter defendant and others from violating the law. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-1a(3); <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-1a(6); <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-1a(9). The court found as a mitigating factor that the imprisonment of defendant would entail excessive hardship to himself or his dependents. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1b(11). The Court\u2019s comments with regards to these findings are presented below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">The Court finds as aggravating factors number three, the risk that this defendant will commit another offense, as evidenced by his six prior convictions, this conviction which' \u2014 I mean, this offense which occurred notwithstanding gainful employment that he was engaged in, his prior record as it relates to resisting arrest which sort of demonstrates a disregard of authority, prior weapons charge</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>which again is similar in nature to what occurred here, the possession of a handgun for an unlawful purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">So I feel that there is a risk that this defendant will commit another offense. I also find number six, the extent of his prior record and the seriousness of the offenses for which he\u2019s been convicted as previously noted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">Number nine, the need to deter this defendant and others from violating the law. So I find as aggravating factors number three, six, and nine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">I do find as number \u2014 as mitigating factor number 11, that the imprisonment of the defendant would entail a hardship on his dependents. He has two dependents. There is a court order for support. He has complied with the support order and as a matter of fact is paid in advance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">However, in weighing the mitigating and the aggravating factors, I find that the aggravating factors dearly and substantially outweigh the mitigating factor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">The court made some additional comments regarding the need to deter and the seriousness of the crime.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">Mr. Paduani, I had begun to make some comments last week regarding the imposition of sentence here, particularly in light of the nature of the offenses for which you\u2019re \u2014 you were convicted here involved a shooting on the public streets of Paterson, a residential neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-12\">I indicated to you how that kind of conduct certainly impacts on the entire community. It affects business attitudes, perhaps whether or not they want to come into a community and establish a business, where whether other individuals want to live in that community because of the safety factors or the criminality, level of criminality that\u2019s impacted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-13\">So that this act had an impact over and above what it may have had on the victims of this particular incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-14\">I do recall that one of the victims, Mr. Rodriguez, came in and still was trying to make an effort to sort of absolve you of any responsibility, apparently did not consider this a very big deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-15\">But the Court does, the State does consider it a big deal because any innocent person sitting in the living room watching T.V. could have been a victim of this bullet that you fired or these bullets that you fired in a random and just indiscriminate manner without any consideration for anybody that may have been on the street or anyone else who was out on the street at that particular time. So it\u2019s not something that\u2019s just between you and Mr. Rodriguez and the other victim of this alleged incident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-16\">As for the minimum term without parole, the Court articulated the reasoning behind the term imposed in the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-17\">The Court in such a hearing as this is allowed to consider the testimony that was introduced at trial, anything that may appear in the presentence investigation, and any other information that might be relevant on that particular issue. While the Court will not address the question of operability in this issue \u2014 in this instance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Mr. Chidiac<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because 1 think the, as the Court recalls the testimony and what was produced here, I think it\u2019s clear that this particular weapon was operable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">There was testimony from the both or one or both of the recanting witnesses that they observed what to be appeared to be a handgun in the hand of Jose Paduani that it was pointed in their direction. That they heard gunshots or that immediately they dug down and felt and heard something striking the car. And I believe the testimony said there were three items that struck the car. The Court can infer from the immediacy of the objects striking the car from the time that they first observed this defendant and the other co-defendant pointing the gun in their direction that these were bullets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">Now while you may be correct that the police testimony or procedure in not producing pictures of the bullet holes should there have been any, may not have been sufficient, nevertheless, I\u2019m only required by a preponderance of the evidence to find that there was a firearm, and based on the credible testimony of the witnesses at the trial, I find that there was a firearm involved and that your client is subject to the Graves Act provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Based upon our standard of review, we can find no error in the judge\u2019s decision to impose a sentence exceeding the presumptive term, or in his decision to impose the maximum period of parole ineligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b167-13\"> Co-defendant Richard Paduani filed a separate appeal, A-5320-95T4.
