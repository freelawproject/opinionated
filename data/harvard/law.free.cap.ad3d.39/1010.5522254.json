Subsequently, a de novo parole hearing was conducted in August 2006, which again resulted in the denial of petitioner\u2019s request for parole release. As a result, Supreme Court granted respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition which challenges only the 2005 denial decision. This appeal ensued.</p><p id=\"b1014-7\">Petitioner\u2019s challenge to the Board\u2019s September 21, 2005 decision is rendered moot by the August 2006 de novo parole hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>ing, which is not before us (see <em>Matter of Rivera v New York State Div. of Parole, </em>23 AD3d 863, 864 [2005], <em>lv denied </em>6 NY3d 709 [2006]; <em>see also Matter of Gaito v New York State Bd. of Parole, </em>238 AD2d 634, 634 [1997]). Given that the exception to the mootness doctrine is not applicable to the circumstances at hand (see <em>Matter of Hearst Corp. v Clyne, </em>50 NY2d 707, 714-715 [1980]), Supreme Court properly dismissed the petition.</p><p id=\"b1015-4\">Mercure, J.P., Spain, Carpinello, Mugglin and Kane, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, without costs.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
