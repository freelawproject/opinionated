LAURIA, Appellee.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"citation\" id=\"b368-12\">[Cite as <em>Vescuso v.

Lauria, after an automobile in which the appellant was a passenger was struck by an automobile operated by the appellee. Appellant\u2019s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (and/or a new trial) were denied. Appellant appealed the verdict (not the rulings on the motions).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Appellant raised three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">\u201cA trial court errors <em>\\sic\\ </em>in accepting a defense verdict in an admitted liability [sic] motor vehicle accident where there is no dispute that the plaintiff was injured in some degree as a direct and proximate result of the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Appellant contended that the court should have granted the motion for judgment n.o.v. Appellant did not appeal from the denial of the post-verdict motions. Assignment of Error No. I is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-12\"><em>\u201cA </em>trial court errors [sic ] in accepting a defense verdict when the manifest weight of the evidence clearly demonstrates that the plaintiff was injured directly from the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-13\">The appellant testified that she developed a headache and sustained injury to her neck, right shoulder, and right arm and required emergency medical treatment, continued to experience pain in her neck, shoulder, and hand and sought treatment, the headaches, shoulder pain, neck pain, and arm pain have subsided while the pain in her wrist continues, and she continues to suffer numbness and tingling in her right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-14\">The appellant\u2019s physician testified that he initially saw the appellant for complaints of pain in her neck, arm, and shoulder, the appellant was subjected to various medical examinations and procedures which included an E.E.G., an E.M.G., X-rays, and a brain-stimulus-evoked response, and the pain suffered by the appellant was caused by the automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The appellee\u2019s medical expert testified that when he examined her the appellant\u2019s prior complaints of injury to her neck and shoulder were gone, but she continued to experience pain in her right hand and wrist. He concluded that the appellant suffers from carpal tunnel syndrome in both her left and right hands and arms, but the bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome was not caused by the automobile accident, and the appellant had suffered no injury to her arm, hand, or wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">He testified that appellant had no history of other injuries to her upper body. When asked for his opinion, he concluded that \u201c[t]he accident certainly caused a cervical muscle strain * * *.\u201d Therefore, the wrist, arm and shoulder injuries were unproven but the <em>neck </em>injury was established by appellee\u2019s own expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Appellee\u2019s expert testified that he examined appellant two and one-half years after the collision, but also reviewed the records from the emergency room and the treating physician. Appellant had no prior injury to the neck. An X-ray of the cervical spine was taken at the emergency room and the record of the emergency room showed a neck strain (appellee\u2019s Exhibit A admitted by stipulation).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">While being cross-examined about the alleged carpal tunnel syndrome in her arm and wrist, appellee\u2019s expert was asked whether or not in <em>his </em>opinion the accident injured her upper right extremity. He replied, \u201cIt appeared that <em>the accident certainly caused a cervical muscle strain </em>that was documented and she was having, I think from Doctor Brickel\u2019s notes, some discomfort and pain into her arm, but I don\u2019t believe that the accident caused her carpal tunnel syndrome.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">Later, on redirect appellee\u2019s counsel and he had the following exchange: \u201c[Y]ou indicated that the accident probably caused some strain in [appellant\u2019s] body?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cDid you say strain before?\u201d \u201cYes, specifically I think neck strain, neck spasm was detected in the emergency room.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Appellant and appellant\u2019s doctor testified that she suffered a neck injury as a direct and proximate result of the accident and incurred doctor\u2019s bills, painful tests and lost work time. Appellee\u2019s doctor testified that she had no history of injuries to her upper body and that \u201c[t]he accident certainly <em>caused a cervical muscle strain </em>* * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The parties stipulated to the bills for the treatment appellant\u2019s doctor said was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">This court upon appeal cannot disturb a jury\u2019s verdict unless the verdict is not supported by competent, credible evidence or the verdict was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>result of passion or prejudice. Herein, the appellee\u2019s medical expert presented testimony that the appellant had not suffered any injuries to her arm and hand nor had she developed carpal tunnel syndrome as a result of the automobile accident. However, he did testify to a <em>neck </em>injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Thus, a review of the testimony and exhibits adduced at trial shows that there was competent and credible evidence to show that the negligence of the appellant had proximately caused some injury to the appellant. <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 411-412, 461 N.E.2d 1273, 1276; <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Assignment of Error No. II is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Ill</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">\u201cA trial court errors <em>[sic </em>] for not declaring a mistrial when the defendant\u2019s attorney makes an unnecessary, frivolous and damaging comment during the cross-examination of plaintiff\u2019s treating physician.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">During cross-examination of the appellant\u2019s expert witness by appellee\u2019s counsel, the following statements were made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-9\">\u201cQ. Well, the fact of the matter is you examined people who are involved in litigation, or making claims on behalf of lawyers; do you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">\u201cQ. And, as Mr. Meyerson is with Mr. Shane\u2019s offices. So you examined Mr. Shane\u2019s clients from time to time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I probably have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-13\">\u201cQ. He is the man you see on the TV ads now sitting on the desk?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-14\">\u201cMR. MEYERSON: Objection, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sustained. Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-16\">\u201cQ. In addition to seeing clients of Mr. Shane, you testify on their behalf; do you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-17\">\u201cA. On occasion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-18\">A reversal of a judgment based upon the misconduct of counsel can only occur when it appears that the misconduct prevented a fair trial. <em>Ohio &amp; Western Pennsylvania Dock Co. v. Trapnell </em>(1913), 88 Ohio St. 516, 103 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>N.E.2d 761; <em>Volsky v. Davis </em>(June 26, 1975), Cuyahoga App. No. 33942, unreported. Herein, we find that although the comment of the appellee\u2019s counsel was improper, the comment was not so egregious as to prejudice the jury and prevent a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Assignment of Error No. Ill is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a trial on the amount to be awarded for the neck injury alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b373-8\">Nahra, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b373-9\">Matia, P.J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b373-10\">Matia, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ARQ\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">Although I concur with the majority\u2019s disposition of the appellant\u2019s first and third assignments of error which dealt with a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and alleged attorney misconduct, I must respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision in ordering a new trial for appellant\u2019s claim of damages vis-a-vis neck injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">An admission of liability does not in itself mandate an award of damages. Cf. <em>Johnson v. Knebusch </em>(June 7, 1984), Cuyahoga App. No. 47543, unreported, 1984 WL 5040. Clearly, the jury in the case <em>subjudice </em>did not believe that the appellant had suffered any injury to her neck. Absent passion or prejudice, the jury\u2019s verdict should not be disturbed upon appeal. <em>Baum v. Augenstein </em>(1983), 10 Ohio App.3d 106, 10 OBR 129, 460 N.E.2d 701. I would therefore affirm the verdict of the jury and the trial court\u2019s judgment <em>in toto.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
