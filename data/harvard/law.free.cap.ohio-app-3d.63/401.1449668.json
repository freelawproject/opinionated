We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">Assignment of Error</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-16\">\u201cIn granting a default judgment against the plaintiff-appellant (\u2018Baskin\u2019), and in denying Baskin\u2019s motion to vacate the judgment and leaving it intact thereafter, the municipal court erroneously validated the purported service of process by regular mail under Rule 4.6(C), O.R.C.P., after a prior attempt to serve process by certified mail under Rule 4.1(1), O.R.C.P., had been unsuc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>cessful because of the clerk\u2019s failure to \u2018affix adequate postage\u2019 as required by Rule 4.1(1).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In addressing Baskin\u2019s motion to vacate the default judgment, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\u201cThis case is before the Court on plaintiff Bruce Baskin\u2019s (\u2018B. Baskin\u2019) motion to vacate judgment filed July 1, 1988. The key argument of B. Baskin is that the judgment was entered without the Court having personal jurisdiction over B. Baskin because of defective service of process on him. If the judgment was entered without personal jurisdiction having been obtained over B. Baskin, it is not voidable under Civ.R. 60(B), but is rather void <em>ab initio </em>and could be attacked, even collaterally, at any time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">\u201cB. Baskin was joined as party plaintiff on April 4, 1988. Defendant\u2019s first attempted service on B. Baskin [was] by certified mail under Civ.R. 4.3(B)(1). The certified mail envelope had $2.20 of postage affixed to it. The required postage was $2.50. The certified mail envelope was marked \u2018Postage Due 30.\u2019 So in order to receive the letter B. Baskin would have had to pay the 30$ postage due. B. Baskin refused the delivery of the certified mail envelope on April 6, 1988, clearly indicating \u2018Refused because of Postage Due.\u2019 Defendant\u2019s next attempted ordinary mail service was on April 15, 1988, as provided in Civ.R. 4.6(C) when service of process by certified mail is refused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">\u201cB. Baskin contends that the ordinary mail service was defective for the following reason:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">\u201c \u2018The moving party was not properly served with a summons and Counterclaim herein, in that the certified mail service was refused for insufficient postage, and the subsequent service by regular mail was defective by reason of the defective mail service on which it was based.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">\u201cThus, B. Baskin contends that certified mail service referred to in Civ.R. 4.6(C) means proper certified mail service and proper certified mail service cannot be made using a certified mail envelope without adequate postage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">\u201cThis Court has found no Ohio cases directly in point on this issue. However, legal scholars have addressed the precise question in the recently published Klein, Browne &amp; Murtaugh, 1 <em>Ohio Civil Practice, </em>Section 3.24(3)(c) (1988), as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-12\">\u201c \u2018(c) <em>Postage, </em>Rule 4.1(1) requires the clerk to \u201caffix adequate postage\u201d to the certified mail envelope. If this is not done, the service is insufficient if (1) the postal service fails to deliver it and returns it to the clerk\u2019s office with a notation \u201cReturn to sender, postage due\u201d or a similar notation; or (2) the postal service attempts to deliver it and collect the postage due from the addressee, the addressee refuses to pay the amount of postage due, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>postal service then returns it to the clerk\u2019s office with the appropriate \u201cpostage due\u201d notation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u201c \u2018If the addressee refuses to accept the certified mail because he is unwilling, to pay the amount of postage due, is this a \u201crefusal\u201d of service warranting the use of ordinary mail under Rule 4.6(C)? According to section 159.112 of the Postal Service Manual, \u201crefused\u201d is defined as \u201cAddressee has refused to accept mail <em>or pay postage charges thereon.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Since Rule 4.6(C) appears to have been written with the Postal Service Manual definitions in mind, and since this appears to be a \u201crefusal\u201d as defined by the Postal Service Manual, the answer to the question is yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">\u201c \u2018All postage shall be charged to costs in the action. If the parties to be served by certified mail are numerous and the clerk determines there is insufficient security for costs, he may require the party requesting service to advance an amount estimated by the clerk to be sufficient to pay the postage.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">\u201cThe court finds the above reasoning to be persuasive, although obviously it is not bound to follow it. The Court adopts the above as its holding on the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">\u201cWith regard to the contention of B. Baskin at the hearing that he is not a proper party to this case, this might be an issue to be raised as a defense. It is not relevant to the motion to vacate except as it applies to the first prong of the <em>\u2018GTE </em>test\u2019 mentioned hereafter. The Court also notes that this issue raises factual issues and if B. Baskin wanted the Court to consider them, they should have been included in an affidavit filed with the motion before the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">\u201cThere is a Civ.R. 60(B) ground alleged for vacation of the judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">\u201cIn <em>GTE Automatic Electric v. ARC Industries </em>(1976), 47 Ohio St.2d 146, 1 Ohio Op.3d 86 [351 N.E.2d 113], the Ohio Supreme Court established the following guidelines for obtaining relief from judgment under Civ.R. 60(B):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">\u201c \u2018To prevail on a motion under Civ.R. 60(B), the movant must demonstrate that: (1) the party has a meritorious defense or claim to present if relief is granted; (2) the party is entitled to relief under one of the grounds stated in Civ.R. 60(B)(1) through (5); and (3) the motion is made within a reasonable time, and, where the grounds of relief are Civ.R. 60(B)(1), (2) or (3), not more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or taken.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-12\">\u201cB. Baskin has satisfied the first and third prong of the <em>\u2018GTE </em>Test.\u2019 As to the second prong, both attorneys agree that on the answer day for the counterclaim, defendant\u2019s attorney gave B. Baskin\u2019s attorney an oral leave to plead of unspecified, but brief, duration. The default judgment was filed on the 10th day after the answer date. Without doubt this course of action, if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>21-day leave had been agreed to, might well satisfy one or more of the following: Civ.R. 60(B)(1), Civ.R. 60(B)(3) or Civ.R. 60(B)(5).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">\u201cBut, the Court notes that defendant\u2019s attorney only gave oral consent to a brief leave to plead and a 21-day period is certainly not brief for these purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">\u201cB. Baskin\u2019s motion for relief from judgment filed July 1, 1988, is DENIED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">\u201cIT IS SO ORDERED.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Upon a review of the record, we find the trial court\u2019s reasoning persuasive and adopt it. Accordingly, we overrule Baskin\u2019s assignment of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b437-10\">Baird and Reece, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
