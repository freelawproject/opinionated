The victim alleged that Donald Butler had caused her physical harm. Without an arrest warrant, two police officers went to Butler\u2019s home. Butler confronted the officers. At some point in the dispute, Butler stepped outside the door of his home. The officers frisked Butler and placed him under arrest. The arrest report indicates Butler was charged with assault and disorderly conduct while intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">Butler tried his case to the court. Prior to commencing the case, the trial court dismissed the assault charge without prejudice. The prosecution called one witness concerning the disorderly charge, the arresting police officer. Butler testified in his own behalf. The trial court stated that the officer\u2019s testimony was consistent with the charges filed and found Butler guilty on the disorderly conduct charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">Butler appeals from the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">\u201cThe State of Ohio failed to introduce evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to convict the appellant of disorderly conduct under R.C. 2917.11(B)(1). Thus, appellant was denied due process of law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Art. I, \u00a7 10 of the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">Butler contends that the evidence which was presented through one police officer\u2019s testimony was insufficient to establish all the elements of disorderly conduct under R.C. 2917.11(B)(1). Butler also argues that circumstantial evidence must be irreconcilable with any reasonable theory of innocence in order to support a guilty finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>\u201cAs to the claim of insufficient evidence, the test is whether after viewing the probative evidence and inferences reasonably drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found all the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The claim of insufficient evidence invokes an inquiry about due process. It raises a question of law, the resolution of which does not allow the court to weigh the evidence. * * *\u201d <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 218-219, 485 N.E.2d 717, 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">A brief portion of the record contains the essence of the police officer\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">\u201cQ. Okay. When did you first observe Mr. Butler?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">\u201cA. We went to his residence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">\u201cQ. Which is where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">\u201cA. I believe Ruth or Fern Avenue. One of those streets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">\u201cQ. Is that in City of Akron, County of Summit and State of Ohio?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-11\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-12\">\u201cQ. What did you observe at his residence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-13\">\u201cA. Went to the door, knocked on the door. His relative of his, I believe his father came to the door. Initially he told us Mr. Butler was not there. Then as we were prepared to leave Mr. Butler then came forward and began berating us and asking us what we were doing there; we could clearly smell alcohol on his person from where we were standing outside the door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-14\">\u201cAnd Mr. Butler\u2019s actions were very antagonistic towards the officers. He used profanity towards the officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-15\">\u201cQ. Was he offensive to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-16\">\u201cA. Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-17\">\u201cMR. KODISH: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-18\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-19\">\u201cQ. Did he cause inconvenience, annoyance or alarm to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-20\">\u201cMR. KODISH: Objection. It\u2019s leading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-21\">\u201cTHE COURT: He may answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-22\">\u201cA. Between himself and the door was his father and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-23\">\u201cMR. KODISH: Objection. Not responsive to the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Manes will you ask him what happened? What was said? What was done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">\u201cBY MR. MANES:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">\u201cQ. What did the Defendant say to you that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">\u201cA. We had told him we had a signed complaint against him for assault and then he began to state that no, this won\u2019t happen. I\u2019m not going to be arrested. You\u2019re not coming in here to take me. Then he stepped outside the door and at that time Mr. Butler was frisked and placed under arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">\u201cQ. Did he refuse to come outside?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">\u201cA. Initially.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">\u201cQ. And what was your response and what was his response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\">\u201cA. Well we informed him why we were there. We had a signed complaint on him. And the witnesses had stated that he had committed an assault. He was verbally very antagonistic. Telling us no, we weren\u2019t going to do this. We weren\u2019t going to take him out of his residence and we had no business being there and so on and so forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-12\">\u201cQ. Did he inpede [sic] your efforts at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-13\">\u201cA. Not physically but verbally by engaging us in needless debate and telling us what our job was and what our job wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-14\">\u201cQ. How did he tell you what his job was or wasn\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-15\">\u201cA. We were wrong to be coming there to his place of residence at that hour bothering him with a bunch of BS. And that he used\u2014he characterized the victim I guess as a bitch and had no business saying this about him and so on\u2014it was just alot of rhetoric going back and forth, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-16\"><em>\u201c </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-17\">\u201cQ. Did you observe anything about his physical appearance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-18\">\u201cA. Yeah, when he talked he used alot of slurring of his speech. Talked very loud. We had to tell him several times, you know, there\u2019s other people in the neighborhood that would like to sleep at this hour. You know, and he told us I don\u2019t give a damn. You know, your\u2019re disturbing me and\u2014rhetoric of that nature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-19\">The trial court found that the probative evidence and the reasonable inferences established that Butler violated R.C. 2917.11(B)(1) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-20\">\u201c(B) No person, while voluntarily intoxicated shall do either of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\u201c(1) In a public place or in the presence of two or more persons, engage in conduct likely to be offensive or to cause inconvenience, annoyance, or alarm to persons of ordinary sensibilities, which conduct the offender, if he were not intoxicated, should know is likely to have such effect on others[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">We disagree with Butler\u2019s contention that the trial court found the element of \u201cvoluntarily intoxicated\u201d based upon circumstantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The police officer testified that he smelled the odor of alcohol on Butler\u2019s person; Butler was loud; and Butler \u201cused alot of slurring of his speech.\u201d This is not circumstantial evidence but direct evidence from which one could reasonably infer that Butler was intoxicated. Viewing those facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the trial court did not err in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Butler was voluntarily intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">The evidence before the trial court was sufficient to establish that Butler violated R.C. 2917.11(B)(1). The police officer testified that Butler was loud, very antagonistic, used profanity, and was offensive. When viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the trial court did not err in finding that Butler was in the presence of two or more persons and offended persons of ordinary sensibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">The assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-11\">Baird and Reece, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b193-12\">Cacioppo, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b193-13\">Cacioppo, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AhP\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-14\">I respectfully disagree with the majority in this case. R.C. 2917.11(B)(1) requires a nexus between the voluntary intoxication and the conduct. The Committee Comment to R.C. 2917.11 explains this nexus requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-15\">\u201cThe gist of the second part of the section is being intoxicated, and in a public place or while in the presence of others, engaging in conduct which the offender knows or should know is offensive, or else in public or private doing any act or creating any condition hazardous to the offender or another. Former law merely prohibited being found in a state of intoxication, whereas this section is aimed at particular conduct rather than at the condition. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>\u201cThe intoxication portion of this section is, in part, intended as a device for taking intoxicated persons into custody to permit their commitment and treatment under section 2935.33 and Chapter 3720. of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In the case at bar, there is no evidence that if Butler were not intoxicated, he would have avoided the confrontation with the police officers. The record shows that the police officers did not have a warrant for Butler\u2019s arrest. The officers approached Butler at his home, late at night. Butler assured the officers that they could not enter his home. Butler did not impede the officers\u2019 efforts but verbally engaged them in \u201cneedless debate.\u201d Immediately upon stepping outside his door, Butler was frisked and placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The charge indicates that the arrest ended the confrontation. R.C. 2917.-11(E) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">\u201c(E) Whoever violates this section is guilty of disorderly conduct, a minor misdemeanor. If the offender persists in disorderly conduct after reasonable warning or request to desist, disorderly conduct is a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">Butler was charged and found guilty of a minor misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">The police officer did not testify as to what Butler said. The testimony was that Butler used profanity and was berating, antagonistic, and basically engaged in a lot of rhetoric. The trial court found this testimony established conduct which violates R.C. 2917.11(B)(1). I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Butler was inside his home at the time the confrontation occurred. If Butler engaged in conduct which violates R.C. 2917.11(B)(1), while within his own home, the record does not disclose such conduct. The lay opinion of one police officer, expressed in terms such as \u201crhetoric\u201d and \u201cantagonistic,\u201d is not sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that, but for his voluntary intoxication, Butler engaged in conduct he should know is likely to be offensive to persons of ordinary sensibilities. For these reasons I would reverse the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
