He raises three assignments of error<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> challenging the denial of his motion to suppress the cocaine, the manifest weight of the evidence, and the propriety of the court\u2019s remarks to defense counsel. We find the defendant\u2019s first and third assignments meritorious and remand the cause for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Village of Oakwood Police Officer Theodore Rongers told the jury that in October 1986 Randy Miller implicated himself and his purported girlfriend, Rhonda Gillman, in a series of burglaries in surrounding communities. Miller accurately described the stolen items and told Rongers he took the property to Boyd\u2019s Melrose Avenue apartment. Police officers executed a search warrant at the premises and, in addition to the named items, they found four packets containing cocaine in a bowl of bleach as well as E-Z Wider rolling papers on a living room end table, test tubes and a straw with cocaine residue in the kitchen area and a slip of paper containing cocaine in a bedroom dresser drawer. The officers arrested Boyd and Gillman, both of whom were present when police arrived. The officers also confiscated a syringe found in Gill-man\u2019s purse. At trial, Gillman explained she was \u201cstaying\u201d with the defendant at the time of the search. She claimed ownership of the packets of cocaine and the slip of paper with cocaine residue and testified that she used the drugs without Boyd\u2019s knowledge. Gillman, however, denied ownership of the straw containing cocaine residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">Initially we address Boyd\u2019s allegations of judicial impropriety. In his third assignment the defendant asserts the trial judge committed reversible error in his comments to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">During the state\u2019s cross-examination of Gillman, the defendant requested a side-bar conference. The court and defense counsel engaged in the following dialogue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-11\">\u201cMR. TITTLE: Your honor, move for a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b824-12\">\u201cI objected to the Prosecutor\u2019s questions about the toot straws and certain other things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>\u201cThat woman did not have a lawyer while she was up there. She incriminated herself about those things. Those are charges separate from what she did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-5\">\u201cI asked to approach the bench so you could appoint a lawyer. You wouldn\u2019t let me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-6\">\u201cNow, in this case, from the day this case, the minute this case is begun, either you, your Honor, or me is severely wrong here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-7\">\u201cI feel every time I try to do something, I\u2019m being hampered and I\u2019m wrong. If I\u2019m wrong, I am ineffective. If you\u2019re wrong, you did not allow me to put my defense on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Is that your motion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-9\">\u201cMR. TITTLE: Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Get rid of your motion. Let\u2019s not talk about what you\u2019re doing or I\u2019m doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-11\">\u201cMR. TITTLE: Your Honor said that loud enough so the jury could hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m going to sit you down in a minute and it\u2019s going to cost you some money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-13\">\u201cMR. TITTLE: May we do this in the back, your Honor? The jury can hear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-14\">\u201cMR. CHANDLER: Yes, your Honor, maybe we could dismiss the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-15\">\u201cI would like to take ten minutes before final arguments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-16\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now make a motion or you\u2019re going to jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-17\">\u201cMR.

TITTLE: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-24\">\u201cYour Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-25\">\u201cTHE COURT: Come on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b825-26\">The court then recessed to chambers where defense counsel requested the jury be polled to determine whether they overheard the court\u2019s comments. The court denied this motion. Boyd now argues the court\u2019s threat to jail his attorney constituted reversible error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>It is well established that a trial judge must at all times be impartial and refrain from comments which might influence the jury. <em>State, ex rel. Wise, v. Chand </em>(1970), 21 Ohio St.2d 113, 50 O.O.2d 322, 256 N.E.2d 613; <em>State v. Kish </em>(1981), 4 Ohio App.3d 252, 4 OBR 468, 448 N.E.2d 455. In <em>State v. Kay </em>(1967), 12 Ohio App.2d 38, 49, 41 O.O.2d 91, 98, 230 N.E.2d 652, 660, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-5\">\u201cStatements made by a trial judge during the progress of a trial and within hearing of the jury are of the same effect as though embodied in the charge to the jury, and, where such remarks or questioning may lend themselves to being interpreted as an opinion on the part of the judge as to the credibility of witnesses or of a defendant or an opinion on his part as to the facts of the case, prejudicial error results. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The record does not demonstrate whether or not the jury overheard the court\u2019s comments including his threat to jail defense counsel. We, however, must presume so since, in refusing the request to poll the jury, the trial judge did not indicate his remarks were outside the jury\u2019s hearing. Further, the prosecutor\u2019s support for excusing the jury reflects a concern that they could hear the court\u2019s comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">We find the judge\u2019s remarks, particularly the threat of jail, could be construed as a reflection of the court\u2019s opinion on the merits of defendant\u2019s case. Such comments are inappropriately made before a jury in a criminal case. See <em>Kish, supra. </em>Further, in light of the evidence at trial, we cannot conclude that the error was harmless. Accordingly, we sustain this assignment of error and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">In his first assignment, Boyd contends the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-9\">Boyd argues that the affidavit supporting the search warrant failed to demonstrate probable cause. In assessing the legal sufficiency of a challenged affidavit, \u201c * * * a reviewing court\u2019s task is to ensure, through a conscientious review of the affidavit, that the issuing magistrate had a \u2018substantial basis\u2019 for concluding that probable cause existed to search. * * * \u201d <em>State v. Bean </em>(1983), 13 Ohio App.3d 69, 71, 13 OBR 83, 85, 468 N.E.2d 146, 149. See, also, <em>United States v. Harris </em>(1971), 403 U.S. 573, 581, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 2080, 29 L.Ed.2d 723, 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-10\">At the suppression hearing, Officer Rongers testified that he relied upon Randy Miller\u2019s admission that Boyd supplied him with drugs in exchange for stolen property. In limited circumstances, such a statement against a declarant\u2019s penal interest may support a finding of probable cause. See <em>Harris, supra; State v. Header </em>(May 11, 1983), Medina App. Nos. 1205, 1206, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>unreported, 1983 WL 4093. We note, however, that the prosecutor incorrectly argued that probable cause was not an issue since the warrant was issued by a judge. The court appeared to agree when he stated that, \u201cWell, the court feels that Judge Feighan felt that they had probable cause to go over there.\u201d The court further remarked that Miller\u2019s information was reliable since the police later found drugs on the premises. The court\u2019s proper focus should have been whether Miller was a reliable informant before issuance of the search warrant. <em>Hams, supra. </em>Upon remand, the issue of probable cause should be addressed anew.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Finally, we note that the defendant failed to provide a copy of the affidavit or search warrant for appellate review. The record demonstrates that both were marked as exhibits at the suppression hearing and considered by the trial court. They were not admitted, nor were the contents of the affidavit read into the record. If errors at the hearing were not so apparent from the record, we would presume the regularity of the court\u2019s decision. <em>Ostrander v. Parker-Fallis </em>(1972), 29 Ohio St.2d 72, 58 O.O.2d 117, 278 N.E.2d 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">This assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Boyd\u2019s second assignment of error challenges the manifest weight of the evidence supporting each conviction. Specifically, he asserts the state failed to prove the element of \u201cpossession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">A reviewing court will not reverse a criminal conviction as against the manifest weight of the evidence if substantial evidence exists from which a jury rationally could conclude that each element of the offense was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Eley </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 169, 10 O.O.3d 340, 383 N.E.2d 132. An appellate court is empowered to weigh the evidence and consider the credibility of witnesses. <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 218-219, 485 N.E.2d 717, 719-721. Such determinations, however, are reserved primarily for the trier of fact. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-9\">R.C. 2925.11 prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>the knowing possession of a controlled substance. Possession of criminal tools is defined in R.C. 2923.24 which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-10\">\u201c(A) No person shall possess or have under his control any substance, device, instrument, or article, with purpose to use it criminally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-11\">\u201c(B) Each of the following constitutes prima-facie evidence of criminal purpose:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-12\"><em>\u201c </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>\u201c(3) Possession or control of any substance, device, instrument, or article commonly used for criminal purposes, under circumstances indicating such item is intended for criminal use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Boyd contends the state failed to prove he possessed the drugs and drug-use items. R.C. 2925.01(L) defines \u201cpossession\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\">\u201c \u2018Possess\u2019 or \u2018possession\u2019 means having control over a thing or substance but may not be inferred solely from mere access to the thing or substance through ownership or occupation of the premises upon which the thing or substance is found.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Possession may be actual or constructive. See <em>State v. Haynes </em>(1971), 25 Ohio St.2d 264, 269-270, 54 O.O.2d 379, 381-382, 267 N.E.2d 787, 790-791. To establish constructive possession the state must prove the defendant \u201cwas able to exercise dominion or control over the object, even though that object may not be within his immediate physical possession.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson </em>(Nov. 21, 1985), Cuyahoga App. No. 49746, unreported at 7, 1985 WL 8451. See, also, <em>State v. Wolery </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 316, 329, 75 O.O.2d 366, 374, 348 N.E.2d 351, 360, certiorari denied (1976), 429 U.S. 932, 97 S.Ct. 339, 50 L.Ed.2d 301; <em>State v. Torres </em>(Mar. 5, 1987), Cuyahoga App. No. 51563, unreported, 1987 WL 7434. The evidence does not support the defendant\u2019s argument on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">The cocaine and drug-related items were recovered on the third floor apartment of the Melrose house which the defendant leased. The slip of paper containing cocaine was found in a dresser drawer located in Boyd\u2019s bedroom next to his bed. Gillman claimed she placed the cocaine under her underwear in the drawer but Officer Paul Payne testified he did not observe any of Gillman\u2019s clothing in the drawer. Gillman also denied any knowledge of the straws, which tested positive positive for cocaine. Although Gillman claimed she took the drugs without Boyd\u2019s knowledge, the cocaine and drug-use items were in plain view throughout the apartment. Based upon this evidence the jury reasonably could conclude the state met its burden of proof on both charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">Accordingly, this assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-10\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-11\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b828-12\">Veit, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b828-13\">Thomas J.

Parrino, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANSE\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">A magistrate must find the existence of probable cause before the issuance of a search warrant. In making that determination the magistrate should apply a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d standard. <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527. Though the record in the case <em>sub judice </em>does not contain the affidavit executed by the informant in support of the requested warrant, nor does it contain the search warrant itself, upon consideration of the of the total record, viewing it from the totality of the circumstances, I find that the trial court was justified in overruling defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">As to the comments of the trial court concerning the possible imposition of sanctions against defense counsel, it is obvious that those remarks were intemperate and inappropriate. However, there is nothing in this record to show that the jurors heard the judge\u2019s remarks. Since the remarks were made at side bar in a discussion between the trial court and counsel, I am unable to conclude, as the majority of this court has, that it must be presumed that the jurors heard the trial court's comments and that those remarks prejudiced the defendant. There is no evidence in this record that anyone else in the courtroom heard the remarks. The grant or denial of defendant\u2019s motion to voir dire the jury was subject to the trial court\u2019s discretion. In my opinion I believe the trial court was justified in overruling defendant\u2019s motion to voir dire the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">For these reasons I respectfully dissent. I would affirm this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">I</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-11\">\u201cThe trial court erred by overruling appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant where said warrant was not based on a credible, reliable informant and was so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">II</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-13\">\u201cThe verdict is against the weight of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Akj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>III</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-4\">\u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error in failing to grant defense counsel\u2019s motion to poll the jury to determine whether the jury was able to hear the trial judge threatening defense counsel with jail, said threat having been made in the presence of the jury and resulting in a denial of due process of law to the defendant-appellant.\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
