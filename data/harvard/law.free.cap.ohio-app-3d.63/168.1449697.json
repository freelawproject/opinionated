Ferraro and Allied Pest Control, Inc. (hereinafter both referred to as \u201cAllied Pest\u201d), appeal from a declaratory judgment issued against them by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">Prior to the entry of the declaratory judgment, a consent judgment was executed between the state of Ohio and Allied Pest. Therein, the following conclusions of law were set forth:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">\u201c2. O.R.C. \u00a7 1345.01 <em>et seq. </em>and Ohio Administrative Code \u00a7 109:4-3-01 <em>et seq., </em>and O.R.C. \u00a7 1345.21 <em>et seq. </em>govern the business practices of the Defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\"><em>\u201c </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-12\">\u201c4. Defendants, Michael J. Ferraro, as president of Allied Pest and as a custom licensed applicator, and Allied Pest, in the course of doing business in Ohio, were engaged, at all times relevant to this consent judgment, in the solicitation, consummation, and effectuation of \u2018consumer transactions\u2019, directly or indirectly, within the meaning of O.R.C. \u00a7 1345.01(A).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">The complaint filed against Allied Pest alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Allied Pest had violated several sections of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act and substantive rules, to wit: R.C. 1345.02(A) and (B)(10) (deceptive consumer sales practices involving false representations regarding warranty, disclaimer of warranty, or other rights, remedies or obligations); R.C. 1345.03(A) and (B)(5) (unconscionable consumer sales practices wherein supplier knew consumer transaction to be substantially one-sided in favor of the supplier); and Ohio Adm.Code 109:4-3-05(A)(l), the \u201crepairs or services rule\u201d (unfair and deceptive practice involving consumer transaction over $25 wherein supplier failed to provide an estimate form and anticipated date of completion of service).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-14\">Following the entry of the consent judgment, two issues were specifically reserved for consideration by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>\u201c(1) the applicability of the \u2018Repairs and Services\u2019 rule, Ohio Administrative Code 109:4-3-05, to consumer transactions involving the solicitation and sale of pest control inspection services and pest control treatment services; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">\u201c(2) whether or not a supplier who gives a warranty in connection with pest control treatment services which limits the warrantor\u2019s liability under the warranty to \u2018retreatment only\u2019 offers an illusory warranty and thereby commits an unfair, deceptive, and/or unconscionable act or practice in violation of Ohio Revised Code 1345.02(A) and/or 1345.03(A).\u201d (Consent judgment, at 10-11.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">To its memorandum on these two issues, the state attached as Exhibit 1 a document entitled, \u201cControl Contract and Guarantee,\u201d which was executed between Allied Pest and Julia Gibson, one of numerous customers upon whose behalf this action was brought. The bottom portion of the contract is labelled, \u201cControl Guarantee\u201d and states: \u201cThe purchaser further understands that Allied\u2019s liability under this agreement is limited to retreatment only and in no way, implied or otherwise, is responsible for damages or repairs to the structure or contents, or any other liabilities that might occur from this treatment.\u201d That contract lists a price of $405 for the protection of a building against the attack of termites.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">In addition, the state attached to its memo a notice from Allied Pest to its customers which instructed them to remit $25 \u201cso that we may schedule your property for inspection and chemical treatment. This will protect your property <em>and keep your warranty alive.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The trial court found against Allied Pest on each of the two issues reserved for review. It is from this judgment that appellants now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">\u201cThe trial court erred in concluding that the solicitation and sale of pest control inspection services and pest control treatment services is a consumer transaction and that Administrative Code Section 109:4-3-05 is applicable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Allied Pest argues that the trial court had insufficient evidence upon which to base its holding that the services provided by Allied Pest comprised consumer transactions. We disagree in light of the previous consent judgment to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">As part of the consent judgment, Allied Pest agreed that it was engaged in consumer transactions governed by the Consumer Sales Practices Act and Ohio Adm. Code 109:4-3-01 <em>et seq., </em>which includes 109:4-3-05, the repairs or services rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>In <em>Gilbraith v. Hixson </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 127, 129, 512 N.E.2d 956, 959, the Supreme Court explained the effect of a consent judgment upon subsequent proceedings.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\">\u201c[W]e have said, in <em>Horne v. Woolever </em>(1959), 170 Ohio St. 178 [10 O.O.2d 114, 163 N.E.2d 378] * * * that as a general rule, a consent judgment operates as <em>res judicata </em>with the same force given to a judgment entered on the merits in a fully adversarial proceeding. * * * Implicit in the rule is the recognition that a judgment entered by consent, although predicated upon an agreement between the parties, is an adjudication as effective as if the merits had been litigated and remains, therefore, just as enforceable as any other validly entered judgment.\u201d (See, also, <em>Ohio State Medical Bd. v. Zwick </em>[1978], 59 Ohio App.2d 133, 13 O.O.3d 178, 392 N.E.2d 1276.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Therefore, the trial court properly reasoned: \u201cThis Court will not take the inconsistent position of finding the treatment to be a consumer transaction for purposes of the consent judgment in this case and now define the same treatment as a fixture, as Defendant urges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">\u201cThe trial court erred in concluding that the appellants\u2019 limited warranty was illusory and thereby an unfair, deceptive and/or unconscionable act or practice in violation of R.C. 1345.02(A) and/or 1345.03(A).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">R.C. 1345.02(A) prohibits a supplier from committing an unfair or deceptive act or practice in connection with a consumer transaction. R.C. 1345.02(B) lists specific acts and practices which are characterized as \u201cdeceptive,\u201d and it is well settled that the \u201ccommission of any listed act or practice is deceptive and violative of the Act.\u201d <em>Clayton v. McCary </em>(N.D.Ohio 1976), 426 F.Supp. 248, 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">The instant allegations against Allied Pest focus on R.C. 1345.02(B)(10), which indicates that the following is a deceptive practice: \u201cThat a consumer transaction involves or does not involve a warranty, a disclaimer of warranties or other rights, remedies, or obligations if the representation is false.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AkI\">In reference to this alleged violation, the trial court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-11\">\u201cAlthough bold face type [within the contract between Allied Pest and its customer] indicates services are guaranteed, the explanatory language is, in substance, a waiver or limitation of liability. In essence, Allied Pest agrees to retreat the premises when their services are ineffective, but Allied Pest in no way guarantees its original work. * * * Here, within the document itself, a warranty is boldly noted and subsequently carved away.\u201d (Decision Answering the Issues Reserved for Declaratory Judgment in the Affirmative, at 5-6.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>In addition to the misleading label of \u201cguarantee,\u201d Allied Pest engaged in the practice of mailing notices to customers encouraging them to pay a $25 fee for a yearly retreatment and continued warranty. Such a notice reinforces the notion that some type of warranty does, in fact, exist. However, we find, as did the trial court, that the ostensible warranty or guarantee is illusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">It has been held that \u201c[a]n act is deceptive if it \u2018has the likelihood of inducing a state of mind in the consumer that is not in accord with the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crull v. Maple Park Body Shop </em>(1987), 36 Ohio App.3d 153, 158, 521 N.E.2d 1099, 1104. We find that the guarantee in question and the notice regarding the continuation of warranty have the effect of lulling the consumer into believing that the services offered by Allied Pest are somehow guaranteed when such is not the case. The only remedy of the consumer is a retreatment of the premises. Upon envisioning the worst case scenario, it is possible that even after pest treatment by appellants, the home of a consumer could be thoroughly destroyed by termite damage. Nonetheless, pursuant to appellants\u2019 \u201cguarantee,\u201d the sole recourse of the consumer would be to request that appellants come and retreat a mass of rotten and useless wood which had formerly comprised the consumer\u2019s home. This \u201cguarantee\u201d does not even permit the refund of a consumer\u2019s original investment. Such a remedy is clearly inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Allied Pest\u2019s \u201cguarantee\u201d is akin to that described in <em>Kusens v. Bodyguard Rustproofing Co. </em>(June 26, 1980), Cuyahoga App. No. 41202, unreported, 23 O.O.3d 440, wherein defendant-appellant issued a warranty permitting it the option of repairing any rust damage subsequent to its treatment or refunding the cost of the rustproofing. The court proposed this example to illustrate the illusory nature of the warranty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">\u201cA buys a car but does not have it rustproofed. The car rusts and A pays $233.00 to have it repaired. B buys a car, pays $79.00 to have it rustproofed. The car rusts, B gets a $79.00 refund and pays $233.00 to have it repaired. A and B are in identical positions because B\u2019s warranty is so limited that he obtains no benefit at all from his contract for rustproofing. The warranty is so limited as to make it illusory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The documentation supplied to consumers by appellant is designed to create the appearance that services rendered by appellant are somehow under warranty. As we have discussed, such an appearance is illusory and deceptive. We hold that the practices of appellants are in violation of R.C. 1345.02(B)(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">The complaint against appellants also includes claims that their business practices are unconscionable pursuant to R.C. 1345.03(A) and, in particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>lar, R.C. 1345.03(B)(5), which sets forth the following as a circumstance to be considered in determining whether a given practice is unconscionable: \u201cWhether the supplier required the consumer to enter into a consumer transaction on terms the supplier knew were substantially one-sided in favor of the supplier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">We note here that \u201cunlike the deceptive sales provision, commission of any of the listed acts does not in and of itself constitute a violation of the Act. Rather, * * * such acts are only circumstances to be considered in determining whether an act or practice is unconscionable.\u201d <em>Clayton v. McCary, supra, </em>426 F.Supp. at 260-261. Therefore, our review must focus upon whether the decision of the trial court was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">We look to the standard set forth in <em>Seasons Coal Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80,10 OBR 408, 411-412, 461 N.E.2d 1273,1276, to guide our analysis: \u201cJudgments supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case will not be reversed by a reviewing court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d Citing <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">This court has held that \u201cscienter is a necessary element which must be proven prior to an unconscionable act being found under R.C. 1345.03.\u201d <em>Bierlein v. Bernie\u2019s Motor Sales, Inc. </em>(June 12, 1986), Montgomery App. No. 9590, unreported, 1986 WL 6757. In that opinion, we quoted the legislative definition of \u201cknowledge\u201d as \u201cactual awareness, but such actual awareness may be inferred where objective manifestations indicate that the individual acted with such awareness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">In its decision, the trial court cites the following evidence from which appellants\u2019 knowledge of their wrongdoing may be inferred: \u201cDefendant undisputedly is aware of language which appears on preprinted contracts which Allied routinely gives to its customers.\u201d (Decision Answering the Issues Reserved for Declaratory Judgment in the Affirmative, at 7-8.) Indeed, the party who drafts a contract is generally chargeable with knowledge of its contents. Therefore, we cannot say that the inference of appellants\u2019 knowledge drawn by the trial court was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">As to the allegation that appellants\u2019 contract was substantially one-sided, the trial court, citing <em>Gordon v. Crown Central Petroleum Corp. </em>(N.D.Ga. 1976), 423 F.Supp. 58, 61, explained that \u201cunconscionability is generally recognized to include the absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the parties.\u201d Further, the trial court found appellants\u2019 \u201cretreatment only\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>remedy to be \u201cundoubtedly one-sided. It not only limits Allied Pest\u2019s liability for ineffective services done the first time, but also limits the consumer\u2019s remedy in that if <em>[sic </em>] forces the consumer to again deal with a company who has not effectively performed the work the first time.\u201d (Decision Answering the Issues Reserved For Declaratory Judgment in the Affirmative, at 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In light of our discussion, <em>supra, </em>regarding the illusory nature of the contract, we must agree with the trial court that the contract is entirely one-sided.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error is overruled. The judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b206-7\">Fain and Grady, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
