R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss his claims challenging SunTrust Mortgage, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cSunTrust\u201d) foreclosure action against his real property, brought pursuant to the Federal Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e-1692g, and Alabama state law. Farkas argues on appeal that his complaint did state a claim for relief, asserting that, based on data in the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\u201cMERS\u201d) database, SunTrust is not the creditor and owner of the debt. Farkas also contends that the district court erred in considering the form of his <em>pro se </em>complaint rather than its substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-21\">We review <em>de novo </em>the grant of a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Speaker v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>623 F.3d 1371, 1379 (11th Cir.2010). In order to avoid dismissal, a complaint must allege \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face\u201d and that rises \u201cabove the speculative level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1380 (citing <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 1974, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). A claim is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>facially plausible \u201c \u2018when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, -, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009)). The plausibility standard requires that a plaintiff allege sufficient facts to nudge his \u201cclaims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. at 1974. <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less strict standard than pleadings filed by lawyers and thus are construed liberally.\u201d <em>Alba v. Montford, </em>517 F.3d 1249, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). This liberal construction, however, \u201cdoes not give a court license to serve as <em>de facto </em>counsel for a party, or to rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.\u201d <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. Cnty. of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998) (citations omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds, see Randall v. Scott, </em>610 F.3d 701, 709 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">Farkas\u2019s claim that SunTrust had to establish a \u201cproof of claim\u201d under the U.C.C. to enforce the promissory note as a \u201cnegotiable instrument\u201d did not state a claim for relief under Alabama law. A foreclosure is an action on a mortgage and, as such, is not governed by the U.C.C. See Ala.Code 7-3-104(a) (1975) (defining a negotiable instrument); Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 35-10-11 to 35-10-14 (1975) (Alabama\u2019s foreclosure statute); <em>Triple J Cattle, Inc. v. Chambers, </em>551 So.2d 280, 282 (Ala.1989) (stating that, upon a default, the mortgagee has various remedies, including obtaining a judgment on the note secured by the mortgage and a separate action to foreclose the mortgage). Alabama\u2019s foreclosure statute sets forth the requirements for conducting a nonjudicial foreclosure under the \u201cpower of sale\u201d contained in the mortgage, but the statute does not provide a cause of action for a mortgagor to require the mortgagee to establish proof of claim prior to initiating the foreclosure. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 35-10-11 to 35-10-14 (1975). Farkas did not allege sufficient facts to support a claim for relief under Alabama law such that the district court did not err in dismissing his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
