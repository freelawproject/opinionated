We granted a certificate of appealability as to one issue: whether the district court erred, in light of <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>560 U.S. -, 180 S.Ct. 2549, 177 L.Ed.2d 130 (2010), in finding that Poveromo was not entitled to equitable tolling (to excuse the untimely filing of is petition) because attorney negligence cannot serve as a basis for equitable tolling.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-12\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d), a petitioner has one year in which to file a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition. The year begins to run on the latest of four triggering events. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The triggering event relevant to this case is \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). After entry of a final judgment of conviction by a state court, the defendant has 90 days to petition the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. Sup.Ct.R. 13.1. If no such petition is filed, the judgment is considered final for purposes of \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) at the expiration of that 90-day window. <em>Chavers v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dept. of Corr., </em>468 F.3d 1273, 1274-75 (11th Cir.2006). The one-year limitation period for filing a \u00a7 2254 petition is tolled during times in which a properly filed application for state post-conviction relief is pending. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). However, a state application filed after the \u00a7 2244(d) limitations period has already run does not toll, as there is no limitations period remaining to be tolled. <em>Webster v. Moore, </em>199 F.3d 1256, 1259 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-14\">Equitable tolling applies only where the litigant satisfies his burden of establishing \u201c(1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\u201d <em>Id., </em>560 U.S. at -, 130 St.Ct. at 2562 (quotation omitted); <em>see Arthur v. Allen, </em>452 F.3d 1234, 1252 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that a petitioner must show <em>both </em>extraordinary circumstances and diligence in order to prevail). The diligence prong requires \u201creasonable diligence,\u201d rather than \u201cmaximum feasible diligence.\u201d <em>Holland, </em>560 U.S. at -, 130 S.Ct. at 2565 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-17\">Under the former law of this circuit, attorney negligence could never serve as a basis for equitable tolling. <em>Holland v. Florida, </em>539 F.3d 1334, 1339 (11th Cir.2008). The Supreme Court rejected this view in <em>Holland, </em>calling it \u201coverly rigid\u201d that an attorney\u2019s gross negligence cannot warrant tolling absent bad faith, dishonesty, divided loyalty, or mental impairment. <em>Holland, </em>560 U.S. at -, 130 S.Ct. at 2563-65. The Court held that while a \u201cgarden variety claim of excusable ne-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>gleet,\u201d such as an attorney\u2019s \u201csimple miscalculation\u201d that results in a missed filing deadline, does not warrant equitable tolling, \u201cserious instances of attorney misconduct\u201d could. <em>Id. </em>at -, 130 S.Ct. at 2564 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">A review of the district court\u2019s decision reveals that it erred in adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, which stated that \u201cthe Eleventh Circuit has repeatedly held that attorney negligence is not a basis for equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Holland </em>expressly rejected that rule, and it was improper for the district court to rely upon this court\u2019s <em>pre-Holland </em>precedent. The proper analysis is to determine whether the facts show garden variety attorney negligence or serious attorney misconduct. Furthermore, the magistrate judge noted that Poveromo had not alleged that Poveromo\u2019s attorney lied to or misled him, relying again on our old rules. The magistrate judge also failed to consider Poveromo\u2019s father\u2019s affidavit, which mentioned repeated requests to the attorney that he file a Fla. R.Crim. P. \u00a7 3.850 motion before the federal limitations period ran, the sort of fact that the Supreme Court in <em>Holland </em>found relevant to both prongs of the equitable tolling analysis. Accordingly, we VACATE the dismissal of Poveromo\u2019s petition and REMAND the case to the district court with the instruction that it conduct the proper equitable tolling analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
