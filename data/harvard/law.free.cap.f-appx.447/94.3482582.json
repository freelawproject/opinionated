Darville claims that the district court\u2019s dismissal was improper because it seriously hinders his ability to raise Claim Two again, in the event that his state convictions are vacated or expunged; namely, that his next attempt will be considered a .\u201csecond or successive\u201d motion under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), and thus subject to stringent standards of consideration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because we recently held in <em>Stewart v. United States </em>that a \u00a7 2255 motion arising from the vacatur or expungement of state convictions will <em>not </em>be considered \u201csecond or successive\u201d under AEDPA, we affirm the district court. 646 F.3d 856, 865 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">Darville was convicted of federal drug offenses on December 3, 2008, and the government filed an information on that same day notifying Darville of its intent to seek an enhanced penalty under 21 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>\u00a7 851, based on a prior state felony narcotics conviction. The enhancement was granted, and it increased his potential sentencing range from 10 to 40 years of imprisonment to 20 years to life imprisonment. Darville acknowledged this change in his subsequent plea agreement and plea hearing. On February 20, 2009, the district court sentenced Darville to 240 months of imprisonment, and this conviction became final March 12, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">On February 9, 2010, Darville filed a timely motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Claim Two of this motion was that his sentence enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 was invalid because Darville was pursuing vacation in state court of his prior narcotics convictions. Darville acknowledged that because his challenges to the state convictions had not yet been decided, Claim Two was not yet ripe, so he requested that the district court either hold the claim in abeyance or dismiss it without prejudice and allow him to re-file later when it ripened.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">The motion was referred to a magistrate judge who recommended, in relevant part, that the motion to stay Claim Two should be denied and that Claim Two should be dismissed without prejudice. The magistrate noted in his report that Darville might be barred from re-filing Claim Two because of the one-year statute of limitations established by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d) or other procedural defenses. The district court then issued an order adopting the magistrate\u2019s report. Darville was issued a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) by this court regarding whether the district court erred in dismissing Claim Two without prejudice, subject to any federal procedural limitations that may apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam). Our scope of review is limited to issues specified in the COA. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">In <em>Stewart, </em>the petitioner, Sherodney Stewart, had his prior state convictions vacated, then filed a chronologically second \u00a7 2255 motion requesting vacatur of his sentence enhancement based on his career-offender status. 646 F.3d at 857-58. In considering whether <em>Stewart\u2019s </em>motion was second or successive under AEDPA, we noted that <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 295, 125 S.Ct. 1571, 161 L.Ed.2d 542 (2005), had established that \u201cthe basis for a claim challenging a sentence predicated on' faulty state convictions arises when the order vacating those predicate convictions issues.\u201d 646 F.3d at 858-59 (citing <em>Johnson </em>544 U.S. at 305, 125 S.Ct. at 1579). We also explained that the phrase \u201csecond or successive\u201d did not \u201crefer to all habeas applications filed second or successively in time,\u201d but was a \u201cterm of art that takes its full meaning from the Supreme Court\u2019s case law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 859-60. We then pointed out that in <em>Panetti v. Quarterman, </em>551 U.S. 930, 127 S.Ct. 2842, 168 L.Ed.2d 662 (2007), the Court declined to interpret \u201csecond or successive\u201d in a \u201cmanner that would require unripe (and, often, factually unsupported) claims to be raised as a mere formality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 863-65. Therefore, we held that because the basis for Stewart\u2019s claim did not exist at the time of the ruling on Stewart\u2019s initial \u00a7 2255 motion, his chronologically second claim was not \u201csecond or successive\u201d within the meaning of AEDPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">Darville contends that the district court\u2019s actions have \u201ceffectively prevented Mr. Darville from refiling\u201d Claim Two, but his argument does not account for the holding of <em>Stewart. </em>The precedent of <em>Stewart </em>establishes that if Darville, acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>diligently, succeeds in having his state convictions vacated or expunged, then he may bring another \u00a7 2255 motion raising Claim Two without having it be deemed \u201csecond or successive\u201d within the meaning of AED-PA. Because the only contention raised in Darville\u2019s appeal \u2014 that the district court\u2019s actions prejudiced his rights to seek future relief \u2014 is unfounded, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-9\">. The entire motion was dismissed, but Dar-ville appeals only Claim Two.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b119-10\">. A \u00a7 2255 motion that has been declared \"second\u201d or \"successive\u201d may only be considered by a court if it complies with gatekeep-ing provision of \u00a7 2255, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-11\">A second or successive motion must be certified as provided in section 2244 by a panel of the appropriate court of appeals to contain\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahi\">(1) newly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAT\">(2) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-18\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
