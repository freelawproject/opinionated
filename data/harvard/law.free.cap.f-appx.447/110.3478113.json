Joseph also contends that the court erred by finding that Peggy Kennon, a white female co-worker, was not a comparator, as she and Joseph had experienced similar difficulties, and Kennon was promoted, while Joseph was fired. Finally, Joseph asserts that she demonstrated that CB &amp; T\u2019s articulated reasons were pretextual, as her improving sales belied CB &amp; T\u2019s poor sales performance rationale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>and little evidence was presented of her attendance problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all evidence and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1023 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en </em>banc). Summary judgment is appropriate where the moving party demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact exists, and it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cA genuine issue of material fact does not exist unless there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a reasonable jury to return a verdict in [her] favor.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Title VII prohibits an employer from discriminating against a person based on race. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). Where, as here, the plaintiff relies on circumstantial evidence of discrimination, we apply the burden-shifting framework articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>Alvarez v. Royal Atl. Developers, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 1253, 1264 (11th Cir.2010). Under that framework, a plaintiff is first required to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>Id. </em>To do that, she may show, among other things, that her employer treated similarly situated employees who were not members of her protected class more favorably, or replaced her with someone outside of her protected class. <em>Maynard v. Bd. of Regents of Div. of Univs. of Fla. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>342 F.3d 1281, 1289 (11th Cir.2003). If the plaintiff presents a <em>prima facie </em>case and the employer offers legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the stated reasons are mere pretexts for unlawful discrimination. <em>Alvarez, </em>610 F.3d at 1264. A reason is not pretext for discrimination unless it is shown both that the reason was false and that discrimination was the real reason. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Ultimately, an employee must meet the employer\u2019s stated reason \u201chead on and rebut it, and [she] cannot succeed by simply quarreling with the wisdom of that reason.\u201d <em>Alvarez, </em>610 F.3d at 1266. To show pretext, the plaintiff must \u201ccome forward with evidence, including the previously produced evidence establishing the prima facie case, sufficient to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the reasons given by the employer were not the real reasons for the adverse employment decision.\u201d <em>Wascura v. City of South Miami, </em>257 F.3d 1238, 1243 (11th Cir.2001) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">The inquiry into whether an employer\u2019s proffered reasons were merely pretextual centers on the employer\u2019s beliefs, not the beliefs of the employee or even the objective reality. <em>Alvarez, </em>610 F.3d at 1266. Conclusory allegations or unsupported assertions, without more, \u201care not sufficient to raise an inference of pretext[.]\u201d <em>Mayfield v. Patterson Pump Co., </em>101 F.3d 1371, 1376 (11th Cir.1996). If the plaintiff \u201cdoes not proffer sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether each of the defendant employer\u2019s articulated reasons is pretextual, the employer is entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiffs claim.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024-25 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also Crawford v. City of Fairbum, Ga., </em>482 F.3d 1305, 1309 (11th Cir.2007) (holding that plaintiff who failed to rebut each legitimate nondiserimi-natory reason of the defendant failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact about whether those reasons were pretext for discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>record here supported each of the reasons given for termination. First, Joseph provided CB &amp; T with sufficient reason to believe that she was unwilling to perform the sales aspect of her job, based on her: (1) inconsistent and generally poor sales efforts; (2) failure to follow up on her supervisors\u2019 plan for her to improve her sales; (3) statement to a supervisor that she did not wish to perform that aspect of her job; and (4) statements to her supervisors that she was \u201cthrowing in the towel,\u201d and that she did not wish to be considered for any upcoming opportunities, that her job wasn\u2019t for her, and that she was just waiting to move on to other opportunities. Second, Joseph presented no evidence to support her claim that she never had the attendance problems that CB &amp; T ascribed to her, while CB &amp; T presented evidence that Joseph had been counseled for lateness and absenteeism as early as 2003, was often late to work, had been informed that her development as an employee was being impaired by her rate of absenteeism, and had been told that she needed to make arrangements for the care of her children that did not involve her being absent from work. She, therefore, failed to meet these reasons \u201chead on and rebut [them].\u201d <em>See Alvarez, </em>610 F.3d at 1266. Furthermore, Joseph did not demonstrate pretext through CB <em>&amp; </em>T\u2019s treatment of Kennon, because there was no evidence presented that Kennon was treated differently, as Joseph was also offered the opportunity to become a personal banker. <em>Maynard, </em>342 F.3d at 1289.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In sum, because Joseph did not present evidence to show that CB &amp; T\u2019s reasons for her termination were both false and discriminatory, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-11\">. Joseph also alleged claims for gender discrimination and breach of contract. However, the court later deemed these claims abandoned before awarding summary judgment to CB &amp; T in these respects. Because Joseph does not challenge this decision on appeal, any gender discrimination or breach of contract claims are abandoned. <em>See Horsley v. Feldt, </em>304 F.3d 1125, 1131 n. 1 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that issue not argued on appeal deemed waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
