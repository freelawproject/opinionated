Shattuck conceded before the immigration judge that she is removable for remaining in the United States longer than permitted, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), and she failed, before the Board, to challenge the finding of the immigration judge that she was removable for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude within five years of her admission to this country, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1227(a)(2) (A) (i). The only form of relief that would permit Shattuck to remain in the United States is an adjustment of her status from an alien to a permanent resident. The Board found that Shattuck was \u201cstatutorily ineligible to adjust status,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii), 1255(a), and Shattuck does not challenge that determination. We deny Shattuck\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-22\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
