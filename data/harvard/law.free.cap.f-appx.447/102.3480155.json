On appeal, Powell argues that his sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-14\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion using a two-step process. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, such as miscalculating the advisory guidelines range, treating the guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b127-15\">Then, we examine whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>Although we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect such a sentence to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence imposed well below the statutory maximum is another indicator of a reasonable sentence. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). The defendant bears the burden to show his sentence is unreasonable in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Here, Defendant Powell has not shown that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable. The record belies Powell\u2019s claim that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Before imposing the sentence, the district court stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Moreover, the district court explicitly discussed several factors, including Powell\u2019s HIV-positive status, his need for drug treatment, his homelessness, his abusive childhood, his extensive criminal history and the likelihood of recidivism.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Specifically, the district court noted Powell\u2019s seven prior felony convictions and that, despite participating in several court-ordered drug programs, Powell continued to have substance abuse problems and appeared not to have \u201csufficient motivation to apply himself.\u201d The district court referred to a psychologist\u2019s report that opined that Powell\u2019s behavior during the instant offenses was influenced by \u201csevere psychological deficits that are of longstanding duration\u201d and that Powell was \u201camenable to psychological intervention.\u201d The district court acknowledged that Powell\u2019s traumatic childhood kidnapping and abuse, his homelessness as an adult and his medical conditions presented a \u201csituation that\u2019s difficult for someone to overcome.\u201d However, the district court stated that \u201cthere is nothing in this PSI to indicate to [the court] that\u201d Powell could \u201cbecome[ ] a productive member of society when he gets out of jail,\u201d and concluded that it could not \u201ctake a chance\u201d that Powell would get the treatment he needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">Under our precedent, the district court\u2019s discussion of the factors was more than sufficient. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>568 F.3d 923, 928 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cWhile the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it commits no reversible error by failing to articulate specifically the applicability-if any-of each of the section 3553(a) factors, as long as the record demonstrates that the pertinent factors were taken into account by the district court.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">Defendant Powell also has not shown that his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Powell\u2019s 77-month sentence is at the low end of the advisory guidelines range of 77 to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment and well below the forty-year statutory maximum pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Powell acted as a facilitator for a drug trafficking organization, bringing buyers who contacted him to a crack cocaine supplier. Powell has an extensive criminal history, including twenty-seven adult convictions, seven of which were felony convictions. Many of Powell\u2019s past crimes involved drugs, and his chronic substance abuse problems have clearly contributed to his continuing life of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">Defendant Powell argues that the district court failed to properly consider that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Powell had no equity interest in the cocaine sold or the money received and placed too much weight on Powell\u2019s criminal history. The district court considered Powell\u2019s minor role in the drug trafficking, and, indeed, gave Powell a minor role reduction in calculating his advisory guidelines range. When determining what sentence to impose, however, it was within the district court\u2019s discretion to give more weight to Powell\u2019s extensive criminal history and his risk of recidivism than to his minor role in the instant offense. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[T]he weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Under the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in imposing a 77-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-6\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
