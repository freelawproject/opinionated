On November 1, 2010, the district court sentenced Perez to concurrent prison terms of 121 months. He now appeals his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Perez argues that the district court, in determining his total offense level under the Sentencing Guideline applicable to his offenses, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, erred in enhancing the base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), for possession of a firearm by his codefendants, and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), for his role as a manager or supervisor in the offense. He therefore asks that we vacate his sentences and remand for resentencing pursuant to a Guidelines sentence range determined without reference to these enhancements. We find no error and accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-7\">Perez argues that the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement was inappropriate because his purported possession of a firearm via his codefendants was neither reasonably foreseeable nor in furtherance of the conspiracy. Section 2Dl.l(b)(l) provides that, if a defendant possessed a dangerous weapon \u2014 two handguns in this case \u2014 during a drug-trafficking offense, his offense level should be increased by two levels. This enhancement is applied when such weapon is possessed by a co-conspirator if the Government proves by a preponderance of the evidence that: (1) the possessor of the weapon was a co-conspirator; (2) the possession was in furtherance of the conspiracy; (3) the defendant was a member of the conspiracy at the time of possession; and (4) the co-conspirator\u2019s possession was reasonably foreseeable by the defendant. <em>United States v. Gallo, </em>195 F.3d 1278, 1284 (11th Cir.1999). The commentary to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) states that the enhancement should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that it was connected to the offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-9\">To prove that possession was in furtherance of the conspiracy, the Government need only show by a preponderance of the evidence that the weapon was present at the site of the charged offense, unless it was clearly improbable that it was connected with the offense. <em>United States v. Fields, </em>408 F.3d 1356, 1359 (11th Cir.2005). Once the Government shows that a weapon was present, the burden shifts to the defendant to show that a connection between the weapon and the offense is clearly improbable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">With regard to the reasonable foreseeability prong of <em>Gallo, </em>we have recognized that handguns are a tool of the drug trade, and that there is a frequent and overpowering connection between their use and narcotics trafficking. <em>Pham, </em>463 F.3d at 1246. To this end, we have found it reasonably foreseeable that a co-conspirator would possess a firearm where the conspiracy involved trafficking in lucrative and illegal drugs. <em>Fields, </em>408 F.3d at 1359. We have also upheld application of the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement even where the defendant claims he was unaware of the firearm possession. <em>United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1246 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">In this case, the Government proved that the handguns were connected to the charged offenses and that their use by a co-conspirator was reasonably foreseeable. <em>Id. </em>And Perez failed to show that a connection between the handguns and the offense was clearly improbable. The \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement was therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>Perez argues that the \u00a7 3B 1.1(b) enhancement was inappropriate because the evidence was insufficient to prove that he managed or supervised another person in connection with the occurrence of the offenses for which he pled guilty. Section 3Bl.l(b) instructs the district courts to increase a defendant\u2019s offense level by three levels if the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) of the offense, and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive. The Government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant played such a role in the offense. <em>United States v. Glinton, </em>154 F.3d 1245, 1260 (11th Cir.1998). In determining the defendant\u2019s role in the offense, the district court should consider the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-4\">[T]he exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.4). There is no requirement that all the considerations must exist in any one case. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>426 F.3d 1344, 1356 (11th Cir.2005). The defendant need only manage or supervise one other participant for the enhancement to apply. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2). The Government is not required to prove that the defendant controlled another participant. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>168 F.3d 1234, 1250 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">Given the uncontested factual statements in the presentence investigation report and the testimony presented at Perez\u2019s sentencing hearing concerning Perez\u2019s direction of his courier, Maria Lopez, we conclude that the Government satisfied its burden of proof and that the court could reasonably find that Perez occupied a managerial role in the offense. Accordingly, no error occurred in the court\u2019s application of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
