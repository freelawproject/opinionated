We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-22\">We lack jurisdiction to consider two of Isufi\u2019s arguments. First, Isufi challenges the denial of asylum and withholding of removal, but Isufi waited more than 30 days to petition for review of the final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). The \u201cfinality [of the order] [was] not affected by the subsequent filing of [Isufi\u2019s] motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Second, Isufi argues that she was denied a fair hearing because of \u201cadministrative errors and due process violations,\u201d but Isufi never presented this argument to the Board. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006). We dismiss in part Isufi\u2019s petition about these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-23\">The Board did not abuse its discretion by denying Isufi\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Isufi argues that the Department submitted an article from Wikipedia that was unreliable, but the Board relied on information about changed country conditions in the Country Reports and 2006 Profile of Asylum Claims to find that Isufi lacked an objectively reasonable fear that she would be persecuted on removal to Albania. <em>See Imelda v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>611 F.3d 724, 728 (11th Cir.2010). The Board found that Isufi had been persecuted by the Socialist Party, but that the Country Reports and Profile established that the Democratic Party, of which Isufi was a member, had assumed control of the Albanian government in 2005 and had worked to eliminate political oppression and police abuse. Although Isufi argues that \u201cthe burden of proof [had been] improperly placed on [her]\u201d to prove that her fear of future persecution was well found<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>ed, the Board stated that it had \u201csimply observed that there was not evidence of any ... threats\u201d that would suggest that the Socialist Party remained interested in Isufi. Isufi argues that the Board failed to \u201caddress[] the question of humanitarian asylum,\u201d but Isufi \u201cwithout excuse or exception\u201d failed to request that form of relief in her motion. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. Isufi also argues that the Board should have reopened her proceedings, but her argument \u201cis so con-clusory that [it is] deemed abandoned.\u201d <em>Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Se. Floating Docks, Inc., </em>632 F.3d 1195, 1201 n. 7 (11th Cir.2011). We deny that part of Isufi\u2019s petition that challenged the denial of her motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
