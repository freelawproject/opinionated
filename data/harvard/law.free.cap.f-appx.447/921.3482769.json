Socorro did not move the district court to dismiss his indictment on that speedy trial ground; moreover, his plea of guilty operated as a waiver of all nonjuris-dictional defects in the criminal proceeding, including a violation of the right to a speedy trial. <em>United States v. Yunis, </em>723 F.2d 795, 796 (11th Cir.1984). Socorro\u2019s conviction is, accordingly, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-16\">.
