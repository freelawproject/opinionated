Ruston appeals the district court\u2019s order on remand finding him incompetent under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241 and ordering him to remain civilly committed to the custody of the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The district court did not clearly err in determining that Ruston was not competent under \u00a7 4241 based on a forensic psychological evaluation performed by Shawn E. Channell, Ph.D. and the parties\u2019 joint stipulation. Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is GRANTED, the appeal is DISMISSED, and all other motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
