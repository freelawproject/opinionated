On June 16, 2011, the district court revoked Varela\u2019s supervised release and sentenced him to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. Varela raises two issues on appeal. First, he argues that the district court committed multiple procedural errors in determining his sentence. Second, he argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-20\">Varela asserts that the district court committed procedural error when it: (1) failed to calculate his guidelines range; (2) failed to consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; (3) failed adequately to justify an upward variance; and (4) impermissibly based his sentence on his immigration status.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-21\">We generally review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number><em>States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). However, where a defendant fails to object to a sentencing error before the district court, we review the sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2006). An error constitutes invited error and cannot serve as grounds for reversal if the appealing party induces or invites the district court into making the error. <em>United States v. Brannan, </em>562 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">First, Varela argues that the district court committed procedural error by not formally calculating the guideline range. Because Varela affirmatively agreed that the guidelines range proffered by the government was correct, the doctrine of invited error precludes appellate review of this argument. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Next, Varela argues that the district court failed to consider all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Varela failed to raise this issue before the district court. Thus, it is subject to plain error review. <em>See Castro, </em>455 F.3d at 1251. Upon determining that a defendant violated a condition of supervised release, a district court may revoke the term of supervision and impose a term of imprisonment after considering certain \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>473 F.3d 1345, 1348 (11th Cir.2007). One of the factors a court must consider is the applicable guidelines range. <em>Id. </em>Because the Guidelines have always been advisory for sentences imposed upon revocation of supervised release, it is sufficient that there be \u201csome indication\u201d that the district court \u201cwas aware of and considered\u201d the sentencing range established under the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 1349 (quotations omitted). Although a sentencing court is not required to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each factor, it should set forth enough to satisfy an appellate court that it has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising its legal decision-making authority. <em>See United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Here, the district court implicitly adopted the guideline range submitted by the government and agreed to by Varela. The court acknowledged the guidelines calculation by stating that a within-guidelines sentence was not appropriate. Thus, the district court \u201cwas aware of and considered\u201d the guidelines range. <em>See Campbell, </em>473 F.3d at 1349 (quotations omitted). The court discussed Varela\u2019s history and characteristics and the nature, circumstances, and seriousness of the violations. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The court\u2019s concern that Varela had failed to appreciate its prior leniency toward him indicates that the court also implicitly considered the need to promote respect for the law and deter additional criminal conduct. <em>See id. </em>Although the district court did not explicitly state that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the record establishes that it considered the parties\u2019 arguments and had a reasoned basis for exercising its legal decision-making authority. <em>See Agbai, </em>497 F.3d at 1230.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">Next, Varela argues that the district court failed to adequately justify its upward variance. Varela failed to raise this issue before the district court. Thus, it is subject to plain error review. <em>See Castro, </em>455 F.3d at 1251. If a district court decides that a sentence outside of the Guidelines is warranted, it must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as a whole, justify the degree of the variance. <em>United States v. Pugh, 515 </em>F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008); <em>see also United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1186-87 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (explaining that the justification for the variance must be \u201csufficiently compelling\u201d to support the extent of the deviation), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number><em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). We will remand on grounds that a sentence is procedurally unreasonable if a district court fails adequately to explain its deviation from the guidelines range in a way that allows for meaningful appellate review. <em>United States v. Livesay, </em>525 F.3d 1081, 1093 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">Here, the district court concluded that, based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, a within-guidelines sentence was not appropriate. Although it might have been prudent for the court to have provided a more thorough justification for the extent of the deviation, the court\u2019s discussion provides enough explanation to allow for meaningful appellate review. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">Finally, Varela argues that the district court impermissibly based his sentence on his immigration status. We generally review <em>de novo </em>whether a factor considered by a district court in sentencing is impermissible. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). A sentence based entirely upon an impermissible factor is unreasonable because such a sentence does not achieve the purposes of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>A sentencing court may not impose a more severe sentence than it would have otherwise based on unfounded assumptions regarding one\u2019s immigration status. <em>Id. </em>at 1253. Although the district court discussed Vare-la\u2019s immigration status, the record does not indicate that the court based its sentence in any way \u2014 much less entirely \u2014 on that status. <em>See id. </em>at 1252. We find no procedural errors in Varela\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion, in light of the totality of the circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>see also United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that it is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We will reverse only if left with the \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d that a district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">The reference in \u00a7 3553(a) to avoidance of sentencing disparities concerns defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct. <em>United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1252 (11th Cir.2009). The need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities is only one of several factors to be weighed against each other in order to determine the proper sentence. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1197 n. 24. The maximum prison sentence that may be imposed for violations of conditions of supervised release upon a first-time conviction of passport fraud is 24 months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1544, 3583(e)(3), 3559(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">As discussed above, the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors prior to imposing its sentence. Varela has not cited any cases in which defendants similarly situated to him received substantially different sentences. Varela\u2019s 24-month sentence \u2014 the statutory maximum \u2014 is not outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1190; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Accordingly, we affirm Varela\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
