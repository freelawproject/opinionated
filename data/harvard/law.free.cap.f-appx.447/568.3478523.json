Thomas appeals the 87-month above-guidelines sentence he received after pleading guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. According to Thomas, the district court committed procedural error by imposing the sentence without addressing his mitigation arguments in a meaningful manner and by failing to provide a detailed statement of reasons. He also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-17\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are reviewed for reasonableness in light of the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), this court must first determine whether the sentence imposed is procedurally sound. <em>See United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). As Thomas concedes, because he raised the procedural error issue for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-18\">Despite Thomas\u2019s assertions otherwise, the record reveals that the district court considered his mitigation arguments. At sentencing, the district court stated that it had read Thomas\u2019s sentencing memorandum, which included Thomas\u2019s argument that a sentencing departure was not warranted due to his troubled childhood and adolescence, his father\u2019s drug addiction, losing close friends and family members to violence involving firearms, and suffering fingering health problems from gunshot wounds. In addition, the district court allowed Thomas to speak and engaged Thomas in conversation about the issues. Thomas\u2019s mitigation arguments were mentioned in the presen-tence report (PSR), which the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>court considered in its entirety. The district court\u2019s decision to impose an upward departure despite express knowledge of the issues affecting Thomas constitutes an implicit rejection of Thomas\u2019s mitigation arguments. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>see also United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 530 (5th Cir.2008) (finding no procedural error where the district court, inter alia, allowed both parties to present arguments about the appropriateness of their requested sentences).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Moreover, the district court provided adequate and detailed reasons for imposing an above-guidelines sentence. After reviewing Thomas\u2019s continuous and extensive criminal history, the district court noted that many of Thomas\u2019s offenses involved drugs and weapons as well as fleeing from or other dangerous interactions with law enforcement officials. The district court stated on the record that it was imposing what it considered to be an appropriate sentence based upon Thomas\u2019s previous firearms-related offenses, the lack of deterrence by lenient sentences, Thomas\u2019s violent and \u201cantisocial behavior,\u201d the likelihood of recidivism, Thomas\u2019s prior unsuccessful supervision periods, and the need to protect the public. Additionally, the district court explained that it had considered the entire PSR and listed specific \u00a7 3553(a) factors. As the record demonstrates, the district court considered Thomas\u2019s arguments and provided an adequate explanation for imposing an above-Guidelines sentence; therefore, Thomas has not shown procedural error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d at 262-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Thomas\u2019s assertion that his sentence is substantively unreasonable is equally without merit. He argues that because the district court relied solely on his criminal history and ignored his mitigating arguments, the departure from the advisory guidelines imprisonment range of 46 to 57 months up to 87 months was \u201cconsiderable\u201d and \u201cunreasonable.\u201d We consider \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586; <em>see also United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">An upward departure may be warranted \u201cif reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l). The record reveals that the district court did not ignore Thomas\u2019s mitigation arguments and did not rely solely on Thomas\u2019s criminal history to calculate an appropriate sentence, but also considered the PSR and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The district court was in the best position to evaluate Thomas\u2019s history and characteristics as well as the need for the sentence imposed to further the objectives set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), and the district court\u2019s reasoned decision is entitled to deference. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51-52, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Even taking into account Thomas\u2019s mitigating issues, the 87-month sentence imposed was not unreasonable, especially in light of Thomas\u2019s young age and extensive criminal history, his inability to successfully complete probation or supervised release, and his repetitive engagement in dangerous and violent interactions with law enforcement officials. <em>See United States v. Gutierrez, </em>635 F.3d 148, 155 (5th Cir.2011). Furthermore, the 30-month difference between the 57-month top of the advisory guidelines range and the 87-month sentence imposed is considerably less than other sentences that we have affirmed. <em>See id. </em>at 155 n. 34 (collecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>cases); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 708 n. 5, 709-10 (5th Cir.2006) (upholding as reasonable variance from guidelines range maximum of 27 months to 60 months). We must give the district court\u2019s conclusion that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justified the extent of the deviation due deference, and it is immaterial that we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Thomas has failed to demonstrate that the district court abused its discretion. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
