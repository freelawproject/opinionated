Berk (collectively \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d), appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendant-Appellee Continental Casualty Company (\u201cContinental\u201d) disposing of Plaintiffs\u2019 insurance-based claims. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">PAS and its sole owner, Berk, provide fee-only investment advice to clients. PAS does not take custody or possession of its clients\u2019 funds; the funds and assets are held by custodian Charles Schwab (\u201cSchwab\u201d) in accounts in the clients\u2019 names.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">In October 2003, PAS employed Andrew Petrofsky. At Petrofsky\u2019s urging, Petrof-sky\u2019s grandparents, Howard and Merle Schultz, moved their investment accounts to Schwab for PAS\u2019s management. In early 2005, Petrofsky began stealing money from his grandparents\u2019 account and continued to do so into 2008. Petrofsky carried out his theft, in part, by writing checks on his grandparents\u2019 accounts \u2014 on checks issued by Schwab directly to the grandparents \u2014 and forging his grandparents\u2019 signatures. Petrofsky carried out and concealed his conduct by using his position at PAS to gain access to Schwab\u2019s software. With access to Schwab\u2019s software, Petrofsky was able to modify his grandparents\u2019 Schwab account data to escape detection.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">Berk discovered Petrofsky\u2019s theft in August 2008 and discharged him. Petrofsky is currently in prison. Before Berk\u2019s discovery of theft, no one at PAS had knowledge of Petrofsky\u2019s acts except Petrofsky. PAS sought coverage for the losses incurred by Petrofsky\u2019s grandparents under a professional liability policy issued by Continental. The policy issued in 2002 and was renewed each year. Continental denied coverage. Plaintiffs brought suit in circuit court in Alabama seeking a declaratory judgment that coverage existed under the policy; the case was removed to federal district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-14\">The policy issued to Plaintiffs by Continental provided that Continental would pay all claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-15\">first made against <em>you </em>and reported in writing to us during the policy period by reason of an act or omission in the performance of professional services by <em>you </em>or by any person for whom you are legally liable provided that ... prior to the effective date of this policy, none of <em>you </em>had a basis to believe that any such act or omission, or interrelated act or omission, might reasonably be expected to be the basis of a claim. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Continental contends that no coverage is due under the policy because Petrofsky\u2014 an employee of PAS \u2014 falls within the definition of <em>\u201cyou </em>\u201d in the policy. Continental also argues that Petrofsky was conducting \u201cprofessional services\u201d in the commission of his wrongful acts and knew or should have known at the time of the policy\u2019s effective renewal date that his acts might reasonably result in a claim on the policy. The district court agreed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Plaintiffs advance three arguments in an attempt to overcome Continental\u2019s denial of coverage. Plaintiffs contend that Pe-trofsky was not performing \u201cprofessional service\u201d when he stole the funds so he can not fall within the definition of <em>\u201cyou </em>\u201d under the policy; a material issue of facts exists about whether Petrofsky had reason to believe that his acts would result in a claim; and coverage is due under the policy\u2019s \u201cinnocent insured\u201d provision notwithstanding the prior knowledge of its employee who was misappropriating funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">As we have said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">[i]t is well established ... that when doubt exists as to whether coverage is provided under an insurance policy, the language used by the insurer must be construed for the benefit of the insured. Further, when ambiguity exists in the language of an exclusion, the exclusion will be construed so as to limit the exclusion to the narrowest application reasonable under the wording. However, it is equally well settled that in the absence of statutory provisions to the contrary, insurers have the right to limit their liability by writing policies with narrow coverage. Indeed, if there is no ambiguity, courts must enforce insurance contracts as written and cannot defeat express provisions in a policy, including exclusions from coverage, by making a new contract for the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-10\"><em>HR Acquisition I Corp. v. Twin City Fire Ins. Co., </em>547 F.3d 1309, 1315 (11th Cir.2008) (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Petrof-sky\u2019s theft cannot constitute \u201cprofessional services\u201d because Petrofsky acted outside the scope of his duties to accomplish the theft is without merit. That a person acted outside his authority does not mean he was not in the act of rendering professional services. And, as the district court aptly noted, if Plaintiffs are correct that Petrofsky\u2019s acts fall outside the definition of \u201cprofessional services,\u201d then no coverage could be claimed because a valid claim under the policy requires that the conduct arise \u201cin the rendering of professional services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">About Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that a material issue of fact exists about Petrofsky\u2019s belief that his acts would result in a claim against PAS, the stipulated facts show that Petrofsky expended some effort to hide his theft from his victims. Under the language of the policy, the question is whether an objective person in Petrofsky\u2019s posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>tion should have expected that his acts might form the basis of a claim. So, apart from Petrofsky\u2019s subjective beliefs, on these stipulated facts a reasonable person could only expect that these acts might form the basis of a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The \u201cinnocent insured\u201d clause also fails to support Plaintiffs\u2019 coverage claim. The \u201cinnocent insured\u201d clause provides that if coverage is excluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\">as a result of any criminal, dishonest, illegal, fraudulent or malicious acts by any of you, we agree that the insurance coverage that would otherwise be afforded under this Policy will continue to apply to any of you who did not personally commit, have knowledge of, or participate in such criminal, dishonest illegal, fraudulent or malicious acts or in the concealment thereof from us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">As noted by the district court, Continental\u2019s denial of coverage is not based on the \u201ccriminal, dishonest, illegal, fraudulent or malicious\u201d nature of Petrofsky\u2019s acts. Continental argues that the innocent insured clause is inapplicable: Petrofsky\u2019s prior knowledge of the claim defeated coverage, not the criminality of his acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In a case brought against Continental involving similar language and a dishonest employee with knowledge of his own wrongdoing on the policy\u2019s effective date, in an unpublished opinion, a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit \u2014 citing with approval the opinion of the district court in this case\u2014 upheld the denial of coverage based on the knowledge of the dishonest employee. <em>Bryan </em>Brothers, <em>Inc. v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>419 Fed.Appx. 422 (4th Cir.2011). Although the <em>Bryan Brothers </em>opinion is not binding precedent in the circuit where it issued, its reasoning seems persuasive here.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The professional liability policy that PAS purchased from Continental negated coverage of a claim if any of a broad group of persons affiliated with PAS \u2014 including all employees \u2014 knew of the basis of a claim on the policy\u2019s effective date. Continental had the right to so limit its liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b123-8\"> Petrofsky also urged his mother-in-law to move her investment account to Schwab for PAS's management. According to Plaintiff, no thefts against that account occurred until after the effective date of the policy in 2008. Thefts from the mother-in-law\u2019s account were accomplished in the same manner as the thefts from the grandparents\u2019 account. The district court ruled that the mother-in-law thefts during the policy period were interrelated to the pre-policy thefts from the grandparents and were also foreclosed from coverage by Petrofsky's prior knowledge of his pre-policy thefts. Plaintiff\u2019s brief argues in con-clusory and unpersuasive terms that the district court erred in its treatment of the mother-in-law thefts. Plaintiff's cursory treatment of this issue fail to address the terms of the policy \u2014 quoted above \u2014 which include expressly \u201cinterrelated act[s]\u201d that \"might reasonably be expected to be the basis of a claim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
