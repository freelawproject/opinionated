Edwards appeals his conviction and sentence for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e)(1). Edwards raises four challenges to his conviction: (1) that the district court\u2019s issuance of a flight instruction to the jury was unduly misleading and prejudicial, (2) that \u00a7 922(g), the statute criminalizing possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon, violates the Commerce Clause both on its face and as applied to him, (3) that \u00a7 922(g) violates the Tenth Amendment both on its face and as applied to him, and (4) that the Armed Career Criminal Act sentencing enhancement contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) violates Edwards\u2019s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights because his triggering prior convictions were neither alleged in the indictment nor proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-17\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b68-18\">I. Flight Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b68-19\">With respect to Edwards\u2019s claim that the district court\u2019s issuance of a flight in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>struction was unduly misleading and prejudicial, we review the district court\u2019s jury instructions under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>541 F.3d 1087, 1089 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). District courts have broad discretion in crafting jury instructions, provided that the charge accurately reflects the law and the facts. <em>United States v. Kennard, </em>472 F.3d 851, 854 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cWe examine whether the jury charges, considered as a whole, sufficiently instructed the jury so that the jurors understood the issues and were not misled.\u201d <em>United States v. Fulford, </em>267 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Evidence of flight is admissible and probative to demonstrate \u201cconsciousness of guilt and thereby guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Blakey, </em>960 F.2d 996, 1000 (11th Cir.1992); <em>Kennard, </em>472 F.3d at 855 (\u201cevidence of flight is admissible and probative\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We have held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in giving a flight instruction when the evidence presented was sufficient for the jury to reasonably conclude that the defendant fled to avoid apprehension for the charged crime. <em>Williams, </em>541 F.3d at 1089. We also found a flight instruction proper that \u201ccautioned the jury that it was up to them to determine whether the evidence proved flight, and the significance, if any, to be accorded such a determination....\u201d <em>United States v. Borders, </em>693 F.2d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">In this case, the circumstantial evidence supported the district court\u2019s issuance of a flight instruction to the jury. The government offered testimony and evidence regarding Edwards\u2019s possession and use of a firearm and his subsequent flight from police apprehension, first as a passenger in a vehicle, and then on foot. One witness, Breanna Doe, testified that she saw Edwards standing in the street, leaning over a dark four-door car holding a long, wooden and black gun. R3 at 191, 201, 204. Officer Bain testified that he followed a dark car driving erratically which accelerated and switched lanes when he turned his sirens on. <em>Id. </em>at 224-28. Officer Bain testified that after the dark car collided with another vehicle, he observed a male exit the passenger-side door of the dark car and flee on foot. <em>Id. </em>at 229, 231. Later, Officer Bain identified this male as Edwards after he was discovered hiding in a shed on a nearby property. <em>Id. </em>At 243-44. Officer Bain then approached the car and the driver of the vehicle, later identified as Xavier Outler, was arrested and an assault rifle was found in the passenger side of the car. <em>Id. </em>at 237-38, 241. A reasonable jury could have concluded, based on this evidence, that Edwards fled the police in order to avoid apprehension for his possession and use of a firearm. Moreover, the district court instructed the jury that, if proved, intentional flight in itself was not sufficient to establish guilt. The Court instructed the jury to \u201cconsider that there may be reasons for [flight] which are fully consistent with innocence.\u201d R5 at 501-02. Whether and why Edwards fled police apprehension were issues for the jury to determine. Because the circumstantial evidence presented at trial supported the issuance of a flight instruction to the jury, the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">II. Commerce Clause and Tenth Amendment Challenges to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">Edwards argues for the first time on appeal that \u00a7 922(g) violates the Commerce Clause both facially and as applied to him because intrastate possession of a firearm by a convicted felon does not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Edwards also argues that \u00a7 922(g) violates the Tenth Amendment, because the suppression of crime is traditionally a police power left to the states. Edwards acknowledges that our precedent forecloses these arguments, but he seeks to preserve the issues for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">We generally review the constitutionality of a statute <em>de novo. United States v. White, </em>593 F.3d 1199, 1205 (11th Cir.2010). However, when the issue is raised for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Peters, </em>403 F.3d 1263, 1270 (11th Cir.2005). Plain error review provides federal appellate courts limited power to correct error, and they may not act unless there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>474 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). If all three conditions are met, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error only when it seriously affects \u201cthe fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). An error cannot be \u201cplain\u201d unless it is \u201cclear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Humphrey, </em>164 F.3d 585, 588 (11th Cir.1999) <em>citing United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Our law is emphatic in that only the Supreme Court or this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>can judicially overrule a prior panel decision. <em>United States v. Marte, </em>356 F.3d 1336, 1344 (11th Cir.2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 922(g)(1), it is unlawful for a convicted felon \u201cto ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2006). We have repeatedly held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is not facially an unconstitutional exercise of Congress\u2019s power under the Commerce Clause. <em>See e.g. United States v. Scott, </em>263 F.3d 1270, 1273 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that \u201cthe jurisdictional element of the statute, <em>ie., </em>the requirement that the felon \u2018possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition,\u2019 immunizes \u00a7 922(g)(1) from [a] facial constitutional attack\u201d); <em>United States v. Dupree, </em>258 F.3d 1258, 1259-60 (11th Cir.2001) (rejecting the argument that \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional, both facially and as applied, because the jurisdictional element of \u00a7 922(g) brought it within Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause powers); <em>United States v. McAllister, </em>77 F.3d 387, 389-90 (11th Cir.1996) (holding that as long as the weapon in question has a \u201cminimal nexus\u201d to interstate commerce, \u00a7 922(g) is constitutional). We have also held that \u00a7 922(g)(1) was not unconstitutional as applied to a defendant who only possessed a firearm intrastate because \u201c \u00a7 922(g) is an attempt to regulate guns that have a connection to interstate commerce\u201d and the government demonstrated that the firearm in question \u201chad traveled in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>McAllister, </em>77 F.3d at 390. A \u201cminimal nexus to interstate commerce\u201d is all that \u00a7 922(g) requires. <em>Dupree, </em>258 F.3d at 1260 (holding that brandishing a firearm that was manufactured in another state suffices to establish the required \u201cminimal nexus to interstate commerce\u201d). This Court has consistently held that \u00a7 922(g) is Constitutional both on its face and as applied to defendants possessing firearms intrastate which had previously traveled in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">With respect to the Tenth Amendment, we have held that Congress does not violate the Tenth Amendment when it enacts legislation through the constitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>permissible exercise of its Commerce Clause power. <em>Cheffer v. Reno, </em>55 F.3d 1517, 1521 (11th Cir.1995) (\u201cBecause the [challenged legislation] is within Congresses] Commerce Clause power, it does not violate the Tenth Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The binding precedent of this Circuit forecloses Edwards\u2019s arguments that Congress violated the Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment in enacting \u00a7 922(g)(1). Since this binding precedent is \u201cclear under current law,\u201d the district court did not plainly err in convicting Edwards of violating \u00a7 922(g)(1). III. Fifth and Sixth Amendment Challenges to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Edwards also argues for the first time on appeal that the armed career criminal sentencing enhancement contained in \u00a7 924(e)(1) violates his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. Since this argument is first raised on appeal, we review this issue for plain error. <em>Peters, </em>403 F.3d at 1270. Edwards acknowledges that our precedent forecloses these arguments, but he seeks to preserve the issues for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The Armed Career Criminal Act, as contained in \u00a7 924(e)(1), increases the sentence of imprisonment under \u00a7 922(g) by requiring a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years for anyone who violates \u00a7 922(g) by illegally possessing a firearm after three convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>the Supreme Court held that the government need not allege in its indictment nor prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions to enhance a sentence. 523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 239, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 1228, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). In <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>the Supreme Court explicitly declined to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\"><em>Post-Apprendi, </em>we have held that a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights did not include having the three predicate felonies charged in an indictment or proven to a jury, even if they trigger application of \u00a7 924(e)(1). <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1034-35 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cwe are bound to follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>unless and until the Supreme Court itself overrules that decision.\u201d) (citation omitted). In <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>we held that the decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was \u201cleft undisturbed by <em>Apprendi </em>\u201d and that \u201ca district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d 400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">In this case, the district court properly looked to evidence of Edwards\u2019s prior convictions according to \u00a7 924(e)(1) to enhance his sentence under \u00a7 922(g), even though the prior convictions were neither charged in the indictment nor proven at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">Edwards\u2019s argument that his enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(e)(1) was unconstitutional is foreclosed by Supreme Court and Eleventh Circuit precedent. Thus, the District Court did not err by enhancing Edwards\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 924(e)(1), based on a finding that he qualified as an armed career criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">Upon careful review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Edwards\u2019s conviction and sentence for possession of a firearm and ammunition by a convicted felon. The circumstantial evidence in Edwards\u2019s case supported the issuance of a flight instruction, and his arguments as to the constitutionality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u00a7 922(g)(1) and \u00a7 924(e)(1) are foreclosed by the binding precedent of this Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
