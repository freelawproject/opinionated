King appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Unum\u2019s favor. Because King\u2019s claims are untimely, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-18\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-19\">In connection with his employment at Weyerhaeuser Company, King was entitled to disability insurance coverage under a Unum group disability insurance policy (the \u201cPolicy\u201d). The Policy provides the following relevant definitions:</p>\n<p id=\"b644-20\">\u201cDisability\u201d and \u201cdisabled\u201d mean that because of injury or sickness:</p>\n<p id=\"b644-21\">1. the insured cannot perform each of the material duties of his occupation; and</p>\n<p id=\"b644-22\">2. after benefits have been paid for 24 months, the insured cannot perform each of the material duties of any gainful occupation for which he is reasonably fitted by training, education or experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-23\">On January 25, 1999, Unum received a claim for benefits from King. According to the claim forms, King worked as a Feeder Operator at Weyerhaeuser. In a statement in support of King\u2019s claim for disability benefits, Dr. Neil Veggeberg indicated that King\u2019s primary diagnosis was spondy-lolisthesis,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and stated that King should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>not engage in any \u201cheavy lifting.\u201d Dr. Veggeberg also stated that King\u2019s prognosis for recovery was \u201cfair\u201d and that he expected \u201cfundamental changes in [King\u2019s] medical condition\u201d in three to four months.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In a letter dated January 27, 1999, Unum acknowledged its receipt of King\u2019s claim for disability benefits. This letter also stated that Unum was reviewing King\u2019s claim and would contact him if they needed additional information to determine his eligibility for benefits. On February 8, 1999, Unum received additional medical records from Dr. Howard Berg, an orthopedist who had treated King.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">The following day, Dr. Reynold T. Schmidt reviewed Dr. Berg\u2019s records and completed a medical file review of King\u2019s claim. Dr. Schmidt concurred with Dr. Veggeberg\u2019s recommendation that King engage in no heavy lifting. Dr. Schmidt also agreed with Dr. Berg\u2019s opinion that King could only perform \u201clight duty work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">On March 12, 1999, Steve Jacobs, a Rehabilitation Coordinator for Unum, completed a vocational review for King\u2019s claim. After performing his review, Jacobs concluded that the Dictionary of Occupation Titles (\u201cDOT\u201d) generally rated King\u2019s occupation as \u201cheavy,\u201d but the specific job that King performed at Weyerhaeuser appeared to have been \u201clight,\u201d particularly since the maximum lifting and carrying requirement was, at least as described by a Weyerhaeuser representative, only 45 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">In a letter dated March 18, 1999, Unum informed King that his request for disability benefits had been approved. Later that year, Unum received supplemental claim forms from King. In these forms, King included an update from Dr. Berg, who advised Unum that King had undergone lumbar fusion surgery on June 30, 1999. Dr. Berg noted that King\u2019s prognosis for recovery was good and that he expected \u201cfundamental changes in [King\u2019s] medical condition\u201d in three to four months. In addition, Dr. Berg observed that in an eight hour workday King could perform \u201clight activity,\u201d which could involve \u201c20 lbs. maximum lifting, carrying 10 lbs. articles frequently!.]\u201d In concluding, Dr. Berg also stated that he expected King to be able to perform \u201cmedium activity\u201d by December 1,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">On March 1, 2000, Unum sent King a letter requesting an updated certification of his continued disability. That same day, Unum sent Dr. Berg a letter requesting updated information regarding King\u2019s medical restrictions and limitations. In response to this request, Dr. Berg sent the observations he made after he examined King on January 11, 2000. According to these notes, Dr. Berg stated that King could return to modified work on January 17, 2000. He did, however, recommend a lifting limit of 50 pounds, along with limited bending and twisting.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">On March 20, 2000, King sent Unum the requested updated information regarding his disability. In his submission, King included an Estimated Functional Abilities Form completed by Dr. Berg which indicated an improved functional ability. While in a prior report Dr. Berg stated that King was only capable of \u201clight duty work,\u201d in this updated form he opined that King was capable of performing \u201cmedium activity,\u201d which is defined as \u201c50 lbs. maximum lifting with frequent lifting/carrying of up to 25 lbs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">Six days later, Unum revisited the conclusions drawn by the March 12, 1999 vocational review by referring King\u2019s case to a vocational consultant. In light of new information Unum received, the vocational consultant indicated that King\u2019s position at Weyerhaeuser was best represented by the DOT Title \u201cBox Printer,\u201d which was classified as requiring only light physical capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>This updated classification of King\u2019s position, combined with Dr. Berg\u2019s opinion that King was capable of \u201cmedium activity,\u201d led Unum to conclude that King was no longer eligible for disability benefits. In a letter sent in April 2000, Unum informed King that he would not receive benefits past April 27, 2000. This letter also informed King that he had the right to appeal Unum\u2019s denial of benefits decision within 90 days of receiving this letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">After Unum\u2019s decision, a dispute arose as to whether Unum received a timely request for administrative review. On September 19, 2000, Unum received a fax from West Texas Legal Services that included a letter dated July 24, 2000. In this letter, King requested that his claim for disability benefits be reviewed. By letter dated December 20, 2000, Unum advised King that because it received the notice of appeal over 90 days after the decision to deny benefits was made, it considered his appeal untimely. Although the letter that was faxed on September 19, 2000 was dated July 24, 2000, Unum stated that it had no record of King\u2019s request for an appeal before September 19. Accordingly, Unum refused to review its initial decision denying King further disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In April 2001, Ronald T. Spriggs, an attorney for King, sent Unum a letter threatening it with litigation if it did not provide King with restitution. The following month, on May 15, 2001, Unum sent Spriggs a letter denying King\u2019s request for relief. Several years passed before any further activity regarding King\u2019s claim occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">On November 18, 2004, Unum, the Department of Labor, and various state insurance departments entered into a Regulatory Settlement Agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d). As part of the Agreement, Unum consented to establishing a Claim Reassessment Process which would provide certain individuals another opportunity to challenge Unum\u2019s decision to deny benefits. On March 11, 2005, King asked to participate in the Claim Reassessment Process.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">In January 2006, King submitted a Reassessment Information Form which provided Unum with information regarding his employment. Along with various other pieces of information, King stated that he had been employed by Steamatic of Amarillo since February 2001 and had received unemployment benefits of $7,512.00 in 2000. In choosing to participate in the Claim Reassessment Process, King signed a Conditional Waiver and Release which, in pertinent part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">To the extent that following the reassessment there remains a complete or partial denial of benefits, my right to initiate or continue litigation regarding that portion of the prior denial that has not been reversed or changed is not waived. In addition, any applicable statute of limitations is tolled during the pendency of the reassessment of my claim; however, I understand that my participation in the Claim Reassessment Process will not revive or reinitiate the statute of limitations with respect to the previous claim decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">On April 13, 2006, James Ludlow, a Claim Reassessment Consultant for Unum, requested that King complete an Education and Employment History form (the \u201cEmployment Form\u201d). King completed and returned the Employment Form, which confirmed his employment at Stea-matic since February 2001, and provided his job requirements at Steamatic.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">Upon receiving this information, Ludlow requested an opinion regarding the proper classification for King\u2019s position while at Weyerhaeuser. On July 31, 2006, Dorothy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Edwards completed a vocational review and concluded that King\u2019s position at Wey-erhaeuser required exertion at a medium demand level. Notably, this opinion differed from the \u201clight physical capacity\u201d assessment which led to the termination of King\u2019s benefits. In her review, Edwards stated that King\u2019s position at Steamatic also required exertion at a medium demand level.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">After receiving the vocational information from Edwards, Ludlow requested a medical file review. Dr. Charles Stern-bergh subsequently completed this review and concluded that twelve months after King\u2019s June 1999 lumbar surgery, King \u201cwould be supported to sustain medium work, with accommodation to prevent repetitive bending, lifting, or twisting. Lifting limitation would be 35 pounds occasionally and 50 pounds rarely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Upon receiving Dr. Sternbergh\u2019s opinion, Ludlow referred the matter back to Edwards for further comment on King\u2019s occupational ability. In this subsequent review, Edwards opined that King would have been unable to perform his duties at Weyerhaeuser, which required exertion at a medium demand level. Because Dr. Sternbergh \u201cessentially described the light exertional demand level,\u201d Edwards stated that King would have been precluded from satisfying the work requirements of his position at Weyerhaeuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Ludlow then used this information in filling out a Director Referral in which he advised that King\u2019s claim should not have been closed as of April 27, 2000. In his referral, Ludlow stated that while King should receive additional benefits, those benefits should be limited because: (1) King was able to return to work that required exertion at a \u201cmedium demand level\u201d at Steamatic, and was thus able to perform the demands of his pre-disability position at Weyerhaeuser by February 1, 2001; and (2) King\u2019s earnings at Steamatic were in excess of 80% of his indexed pre-disability earnings. Given these considerations, Ludlow recommended that King\u2019s claim be reopened and benefits be paid from April 27, 2000 (the date at which his disability benefits were previously terminated) until February 1, 2001 (the beginning of his employment at Steamatic). Ludlow also noted that King\u2019s unemployment benefits, which were related to his inability to work due to his medical condition, were \u201coffsettable\u201d from his disability benefits. Ludlow\u2019s recommendation was approved on September 29, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Approximately one month later, Ludlow informed King of the reassessment decision and communicated the basis for the decision. In a letter dated October 25, 2006, Ludlow told King that he would receive $5,425.29 for past due disability benefits, which was offset by the unemployment benefits he received in 2000. Ludlow also told King that he was going to receive $2,281.04 in interest. King subsequently accepted the additional disability benefits from Unum.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">Over three years after he received notice of the reassessment decision, King wrote to Ludlow and requested a copy of his claim file. On January 7, 2010, Unum sent King a response to his request and provided a copy of his claim file and the Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">In a letter dated March 3, 2010, King complained about Unum\u2019s reassessment decision and requested an administrative review of that decision. Specifically, he disagreed with the grounds used to limit the disability payment received through the Claim Reassessment Process, along with the decision to offset the unemployment benefits he had received from this payment. In a letter dated March 16, 2010, Unum provided the following response:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>We regret we are not able to comply with your request for an additional administrative review. Your claim has already received an additional administrative review in accordance with the terms of the Regulatory Settlement Agreement (\u201cRSA\u201d). The RSA established specific procedures for both the reassessment of eligible claims and the monitoring of the reassessment decision-making process. The decision made on your claim was subject to the monitoring process. This monitoring was conducted at the direction of the Company\u2019s Regulatory Compliance Unit and also by the Lead Regulators under the RSA. Furthermore ... the claim reassessment process ended approximately two years ago.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">On October 25, 2010, King filed a lawsuit in state court which was subsequently removed to federal court. In his complaint, King presented a claim for benefits under the Employee Retirement Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) in which he alleged that he was improperly denied disability benefits. Additionally, he brought a second claim under ERISA in which he averred that Unum not only failed to provide statutorily required information to him, but also \u201cfailed to provide [him] with the opportunity for a full and fair review of his claim.\u201d On March 18, 2011, 2011 WL 971158, the district court granted summary judgment in Unum\u2019s favor. Notably, the district court held that King\u2019s claim for benefits was time barred, and that his second claim failed as a matter of law. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in ERISA cases de novo, applying the same standard as the district court.\u201d <em>Lafleur v. La. Health Serv. and Indem. Co., </em>563 F.3d 148, 153 (5th Cir.2009). A grant of summary judgment is proper if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). In evaluating the existence of a genuine issue of material fact, we review the evidence and inferences drawn from that evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Baker v. Metro. Life. Ins. Co., </em>364 F.3d 624, 627-28 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">i.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">Under ERISA, a cause of action accrues after a claim for benefits has been made and formally denied. <em>Hall v. Nat\u2019l Gypsum Co., </em>105 F.3d 225, 230 (5th Cir.1997). Since ERISA does not contain a statute of limitations for benefit claims, we apply the state statute of limitations most analogous to the cause of action raised by a plaintiff. <em>Hogan v. Kraft Foods, </em>969 F.2d 142, 145 (5th Cir.1992). Because King\u2019s claim for benefits, which is brought pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B), seeks to enforce his rights under the Policy, it is analogous to a state breach of contract claim. <em>Id. </em>As such, we will apply the Texas four year limitations statute governing breach of contract claims. <em>Id.] Stine v. Stewart, </em>80 S.W.3d 586, 592 (Tex.2002) (\u201cA party asserting a breach of contract claim must sue no later than four years after the day the claim accrues.\u201d) (citing Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code \u00a7 16.051).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">On appeal, King argues that the district court erred in determining that his claim for benefits was time barred. We disagree. Although an argument can be made that the statute of limitations actually began running in April 2000, we will base our analysis on an accrual date of May 15, 2001 \u2014 the date Unum sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Spriggs a letter denying King\u2019s request for relief. For purposes of this analysis, we will also assume that King\u2019s March 11, 2005 request to participate in the Claim Reassessment Process made his claim \u201cpenden[t],\u201d and thus tolled the statute of limitations pursuant to the Conditional Waiver and Release. On this date, King had approximately two months remaining on the four year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">When Unum communicated its reassessment decision to King in October 2006, the statute of limitations clock started running again. Given the two months that were remaining in the statute of limitations period, King had until December 2006 to bring his claim for benefits. Because King did not file his lawsuit until October 25, 2010, this claim is clearly time barred. The district court therefore did not err in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In an attempt to salvage his claim, King argues that the decision he is appealing is not the initial denial of benefits, but rather the decision made at the conclusion of the Claim Reassessment Process. This contention, we conclude, does not further King\u2019s cause. Contrary to what King suggests, the reassessment decision which granted him additional disability benefits was not a separate and independent decision, but rather was, as the name suggests, a reassessment of a previous decision. In signing the Conditional Waiver and Release, King acknowledged that his \u201cparticipation in the Claim Reassessment Process w[ould] not revive or reinitiate the statute of limitations with respect to the previous claim decision.\u201d His efforts to characterize the reassessment decision as a separate and independent denial of benefits is a legally unsupported attempt to do precisely what the plain terms of the Conditional Waiver and Release prohibit: reviving or reinitiating the statute of limitations. This contention therefore does not unsettle our conclusion regarding the timeliness of King\u2019s claim for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Next, King argues that the district court erred in rejecting his claim asserting that Unum deprived him of his procedural rights under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133. He specifically contends that this deprivation took place when he was initially denied benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">The statutory provision King relies upon provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-11\">In accordance with regulations of the Secretary, every employee benefit plan shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-12\">(1) provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied, setting forth the specific reasons for such denial, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-13\">(2) afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-14\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133. \u201cFailure to fulfill procedural requirements generally does not give rise to a substantive damage remedy.\u201d <em>Hines v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins., Co., </em>43 F.3d 207, 211 (5th Cir.1995). Remand to the plan administrator for full and fair review of a plaintiffs claims is usually the appropriate remedy when the administrator fails to substantially comply with ERISA\u2019s procedural requirements. <em>Lafleur, </em>563 F.3d at 158. Here, even if we were to assume, purely for the sake of argument, that a procedural violation took place during the initial denial of disability benefits, any claim arising out of such a violation would be time barred because the underlying substantive claim for benefits is itself untimely. Since his presentation of a procedural violation is untimely, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>court did not err in granting Unum\u2019s motion for summary judgment on his Section 1133 claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Finding no error in the district court\u2019s judgment, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
