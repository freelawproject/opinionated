The district court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on two issues, so we have jurisdiction to hear his appeal. Because we conclude that the state court\u2019s decision was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">In May 2002, a jury convicted Chaney of second-degree murder in the shooting death of Curtis Burns. Chaney admitted that he killed Burns but argued that he did so in self-defense. According to Chaney, Burns approached him with a knife and began to attack and, to protect himself, Chaney shot Burns three times and then kicked him when he fell onto the ground.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But Chaney was convicted and received a sentence of life imprisonment. The appeals court in Florida upheld his conviction and sentence on direct appeal, and the Florida Supreme Court declined review. Chaney petitioned for post-conviction relief in state court, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Chaney then filed a \u00a7 2254 petition in district court, asserting several trial errors and ineffective assistance of counsel claims. The district court denied his petition but granted a COA on two claims: (1) that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to consult with and proffer the testimony of an edged-weapons defense tactics expert; and (2) that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to introduce the testimony of Assistant Medical Examiner Dr. Emma Lew. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">We review a district court\u2019s order denying a \u00a7 2254 petition <em>de novo. Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). We may not grant a habeas petitioner relief on any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the adjudication of the claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-9\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">In determining whether a state court unreasonably applied federal law, we:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiN\">must determine what arguments or theories supported or, ... could have supported, the state court\u2019s decision; and then [we] must ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of [the Supreme Court].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-14\"><em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). We must deny relief if there is <em>any </em>argument to support the state court\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[E]ven a strong case for relief does not mean the state court\u2019s contrary conclusion was unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-16\">To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must show that (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) his defense was prejudiced by that deficient performance. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). There is a \u201c\u2018strong presumption\u2019 that counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable and that counsel made \u2018all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Newland v. Hall, </em>527 F.3d 1162, 1184 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689-90, 104 S.Ct. 2052). \u201cThus, the petitioner must establish that no competent counsel would have taken the action that his counsel did take.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>When analyzing a claim of ineffective assistance under \u00a7 2254(d), our review is \u201cdoubly\u201d deferential to counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Harrington, </em>131 S.Ct. at 788. Under \u00a7 2254(d), \u201cthe question is not whether counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable. The question is whether there is <em>any </em>reasonable argument that counsel satisfied <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>deferential standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). To demonstrate prejudice, there must be \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Chaney first argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to consult with and proffer the testimony of an edged weapons defense tactics expert. Specifically, he contends that the testimony of a veteran police trainer and edged weapons defense tactics expert, Emanuel Kapelsohn, would have provided the jury with explanations of: (1) the imminen-cy of a knife attacker\u2019s threat when in close proximity to a victim; (2) the absence of a reasonable path of retreat during a knife attack; (3) the need for repeated gunshots to a knife attacker to neutralize the threat; (4) the possibility that a knife attacker, once fatally shot, can continue to attack for thirty seconds or more; (5) the possibility of a gun jam and the need to use one\u2019s hands and feet in defense if a jam occurs; and (6) the reasonableness of an attacker being shot in the back in self defense. According to Chaney, the absence of this testimony prejudiced his defense. The state court found that Chaney failed to show that Kapelsohn\u2019s testimony was admissible and therefore did not establish that his counsel\u2019s failure to introduce the testimony constituted deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">We conclude that the state court\u2019s ruling was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established law. Ineffective assistance claims based on \u201ccomplaints of uncalled witnesses are not favored, because the presentation of testimonial evidence is a matter of trial strategy and because all allegations of what a witness would have testified are largely speculative.\u201d <em>Buckelew v. United States, </em>575 F.2d 515, 521 (5th Cir.1978).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cWhich witnesses, if any, to call, and when to call them, is the epitome of a strategic decision\u201d that seldom, if ever, serves as grounds to find counsel\u2019s assistance ineffective. <em>Conklin v. Schofield, </em>366 F.3d 1191, 1204 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">We have held that \u201cthe mere fact a defendant can find, years after the fact, [an] ... expert who will testify favorably for him does not demonstrate that counsel was ineffective for failing to produce that expert at trial.\u201d <em>Davis v. Singletary, </em>119 F.3d 1471, 1475 (11th Cir.1997) (counsel was not ineffective for failing to call a mental health expert to testify). This is especially true when reviewing a state court\u2019s finding that counsel was not ineffective for failing to call such an expert to testify. <em>See Harvey v. Warden, Union Correctional Institution, </em>629 F.3d 1228, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2011) (emphasizing the deference afforded the state court in determining whether counsel was deficient in failing to call a particular expert). In this case, Chaney provided the state court with Kapelsohn\u2019s affidavit, dated January 2007, five years after his 2002 trial. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>mere fact that Kapelsohn\u2019s purported testimony is favorable does not render trial counsel\u2019s performance deficient. For this reason, the state court\u2019s decision to deny Chaney\u2019s claim was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Chaney also argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to introduce the testimony of Assistant Medical Examiner Dr. Emma Lew. According to Chaney, Dr. Lew \u2014 listed as a state witness but not called during trial\u2014 would have testified that autopsy results, police reports, and crime scene photographs were consistent with Burns being the initial attacker. Chaney contends that the absence of Dr. Lew\u2019s testimony was prejudicial because her testimony would have contradicted the state\u2019s medical examiner, Dr. Daniel Spitz, who testified that based on his examination of the crime scene and of Burns\u2019s body at the scene and during the autopsy, including gunshot residue, Burns was likely unarmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The state court found that trial counsel\u2019s failure to introduce Dr. Lew\u2019s testimony was not prejudicial because Dr. Lew could not testify whether or not Burns was holding or attacking with a knife and did not have an opinion as to whether the shooting was in self-defense. This ruling was a reasonable application of <em>Strickland. </em>Dr. Lew\u2019s testimony would not have reliably contradicted Dr. Spitz\u2019s testimony because Dr. Lew\u2019s observations were based on an incomplete and second-hand analysis of the crime scene. Dr. Lew examined only police reports and Dr. Spitz\u2019s autopsy report and crime scene photographs; she did not personally examine the crime scene, Burns\u2019s body, or gunshot residue at the scene and on Burns\u2019s body, as Dr. Spitz did. Because Dr. Lew\u2019s testimony was not definitively sufficient to rebut Dr. Spitz\u2019s comprehensive testimony based on firsthand observations, the state court\u2019s determination that counsel did not prejudice Chaney\u2019s defense by failing to introduce the testimony was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Because Chaney failed to establish that the state court\u2019s ruling on either of his ineffective assistance claims was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, we affirm the ruling of the district court denying his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-10\">.
