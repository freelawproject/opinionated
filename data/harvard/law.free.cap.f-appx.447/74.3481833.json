Rodriguez claims that she will be persecuted if she returns to Venezuela on account of her employment with an organization, Centro Interamericano de Gerencia Pol\u00edtica, whose mission is to promote democracy throughout Latin America, including in Venezuela, and because she recently started a personal blog that is opposed to the Venezuelan government.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-15\">We review the BIA\u2019s decision as the final judgment, unless the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). In that case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, and, therefore, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-16\">As an initial matter, Rodriguez has not challenged the BIA\u2019s adverse-credibility determination or its conclusion that Rodriguez was ineligible for withholding under CAT. Because she failed to raise those issues in her petition before us, we deem them abandoned and need not further address them. <em>See Singh v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>561 F.3d 1275, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2009). Additionally, we lack jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s determination that her asylum application was untimely filed. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Fahim v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that federal courts do not have jurisdiction to review the Attorney General\u2019s decision regarding the timeliness of an asylum application). Thus, the only issue before us is the BIA\u2019s alternative determination that, notwithstanding her lack of credibility, Rodriguez failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that her life or freedom would be threatened in Venezuela on account of her political activities, therefore denying her request for withholding of removal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>Upon review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record, we see no reversible error in the BIA\u2019s decision that Rodriguez failed to meet her burden of proof for withholding of removal. The BIA did not err when it upheld the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision to give little weight to the illegible, uncertified translations of web pages that Rodriguez submitted as the regulations provide that foreign language documents must be legible and accompanied by a certification from the translator as to competency and accuracy. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.83. Moreover, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s findings that no one in Venezuela was aware of Rodriguez\u2019s political activities or would seek to harm her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b99-11\">. To qualify for withholding of removal under the INA, the applicant must show that if returned to her country, her \"life or freedom would be threatened in that country because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>of [her] race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). The petitioner must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that she will be persecuted or tortured upon removal to her country. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-27\">. To the extent that Rodriguez faults her prior trial counsel for any deficiencies in her immigration court proceedings and attempts to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we lack jurisdiction to consider this issue as it has not been administratively exhausted. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1249-51 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
