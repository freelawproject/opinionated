No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">On appeal, Ingram argues that his above-guidelines sentence substantively is unreasonable because the record did not justify the degree of the upward variance. We evaluate the substantive reasonableness of a sentence \u2014 whether inside or outside the guidelines range \u2014 under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both the record and the section 3553(a) factors.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-14\">When a district court decides to impose an upward variance, its justifications for doing so must be \u201c \u2018compelling\u2019 enough \u2018to support the degree of the variance\u2019 and complete enough to allow meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1238 (11th Cir.2009). We will vacate a sentence based on such an upward variance only \u201cif we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-15\">We conclude that Ingram\u2019s sentence is reasonable. Although the 180-month sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>tence varied upward from the top of the advisory guidelines range by 74 months, it was still well below the statutory m\u00e1xi-mums that he faced for his offenses \u2014 20 years\u2019 imprisonment for bank robbery and life imprisonment for his firearms offense. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (comparing, as one indication of reasonableness, the sentence imposed and the statutory maximum sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">In determining Ingram\u2019s sentence, the court noted his extensive criminal history, which included 5 burglary and robbery convictions, and that he had spent all but 4 of his 26 adult years in prison. In particular, the court focused on Ingram\u2019s earlier bank robbery conviction, for which he was sentenced to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment. Concluding that Ingram had not learned from this earlier sentence \u2014 and because he used a gun during the instant bank robbery \u2014 the court stated that an above-guidelines sentence was necessary to accomplish the goals set forth in section 3553(a), including the need to provide adequate deterrence and to protect the public from future crimes. The court\u2019s justifications are compelling enough to support its upward variance, and we are not convinced that it erred in weighing the statutory factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">We also reject Ingram\u2019s contention that the district court failed to specify in its written order its reasons for imposing a sentence outside the guidelines range, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). Although the district court\u2019s explanation was brief, it stated the required reasons for the above-guidelines sentence in its written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b125-10\"> Under section 3553(a), a district court must consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the sentence to provide adequate deterrence, respect for the law, and protection of the public, the defendant\u2019s medical and educational needs, the advisory guideline range, the Sentencing Commission's policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities and provide restitution. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(7).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
