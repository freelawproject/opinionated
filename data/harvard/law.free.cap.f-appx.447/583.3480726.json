He was sentenced to 46 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release on each count, to be served concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-23\">Pascual-Duran argues that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(iv) on the basis that his prior conviction under Colorado Revised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Statute \u00a7 18-6-40S(3)(b.5) constituted a \u201cchild pornography offense.\u201d He maintains that the Colorado statute of conviction is broader than the federal child pornography statutes set forth in \u00a7 2L1.2 because the Colorado statute criminalizes the possession of visual depictions that portray minors observing explicit sexual conduct, whereas the federal statutes prohibit only those visual depictions that portray minors actually engaging in sexually explicit conduct. Pascual-Duran properly concedes that his argument is subject to review for plain error because he did not raise the instant argument before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">To establish plain error, Pascual-Duran must identify a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Whether the conviction at issue constituted a \u201cchild pornography offense\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(iv) is an issue of first impression in this circuit. Thus, if any error occurred, it was not clear or obvious and does not warrant relief on plain error review. See <em>United States v. Ellis, </em>564 F.3d 370, 376-78 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Pascual-Duran also argues that his sentence is unreasonable because the district court failed to consider the unwarranted disparity that exists between him and defendants who were sentenced in jurisdictions in which \u201cfast track\u201d programs are available. As Pascual-Duran correctly concedes, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 559-64 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 808 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
