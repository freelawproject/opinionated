Rayfield denied liability and counterclaimed against the Bank for fraudulent inducement and other tor-tious conduct related to the execution of the note and guarantee. Rayfield also cross-claimed against Algernon for fraud in the inducement and brought a third-party action against Jule Herbert (Alger-non\u2019s principal) for fraud in the inducement and legal malpractice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following extensive discovery, the Bank moved the district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for summary judgment on its claim against Algernon and Rayfield and Rayfield\u2019s counterclaim. The court granted the motion and gave the Bank the judgment it sought. The court also entered judgment for Algernon on Rayfield\u2019s cross-claim against it and for Herbert on Rayfield\u2019s third-party claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">Rayfield appeals the court\u2019s judgments, raising two arguments. They are, succinctly stated, (1) that the court \u201cmisstated and misapplied the standard for entering summary judgment,\u201d and (2) that \u201c[a] genuine issue of fact does exist. The testimony of the [Bank\u2019s] commercial lending officer [and] various loan documents show that Rayfield was presented false and fraudulent facts about the purpose of the note he was guarantying.\u201d We have carefully reviewed the record on these points and find (1) no error in the court\u2019s application of the summary judgment standard and (2) no genuine issue of fact. The court\u2019s judgments are therefore due to be and are</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\">. The fraud-in-the-inducement cross-claim and third-party claim related to the execution of the note and guaranty in favor of the Vision Bank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\">. The case was adjudicated by a magistrate judge by consent of the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\">. The court\u2019s statement as to why it entered judgment against Rayfield on these two claims is contained in the court's dispositive order of June 17, 2011:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">Rayfield has been given adequate opportunity to address the legal issues [regarding his cross-claim and third-party claim] that the court has raised both in its written order and during the pendency of the June 16, 2011 hearing. At the hearing, Rayfield offered no further evidence or argument to support his claims and stated that he was relying on his brief. Moreover, Rayfield's counsel conceded in open court that all of Rayfield's claims were essentially predicated on his fraud claims against Vision Bank and Herbert and, without a viable fraud claim, Rayfield\u2019s \u2018entire case goes out.\u2019 Consequently, for the reasons set forth in the Court\u2019s Orders of April 12, 2011 ... and May 27, 2011 ... as well as Rayfield's concessions at the hearing conducted this day, Rayfield has failed to establish that he has asserted a viable claim against either Alger-non or Herbert and judgment is, therefore, due to be entered in their favor as to the claims asserted against them by Rayfield.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
