Powell, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the dismissal without prejudice of her complaint, filed pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), for failure to comply with court orders and to prosecute her case, Fed. R.Civ.P. 16(f) and 41(b).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Reversible error has been shown; we vacate and remand for additional proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The magistrate judge recommended that Powell\u2019s complaint be dismissed, pursuant to Rules 16(f) and 41(b), because she filed her amended complaint five days after the court\u2019s deadline, failed to appear for a hearing on her lawyer\u2019s motion to withdraw, and failed to engage in discovery. The magistrate, however, recommended that the dismissal be without prejudice \u201cbecause it [was] not evident that Powell\u2019s noncompliance was willful or in bad faith.\u201d The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation, and dismissed the complaint without prejudice, pursuant to Rules 16(f) and 41(b), for failure to comply with court orders and failure to prosecute the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">When a complaint is dismissed without prejudice, but a statute of limitations bars a plaintiff from refiling her complaint, we review the dismissal as <em>though it was with prejudice. See Boazman v. Econ. Lab., Inc., </em>537 F.2d 210, 212-13 (5th Cir.1976). Because more than 90 days passed after the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) issued Powell a right to sue letter and before the district court\u2019s dismissal, we will assume that she was barred from refiling her complaint. <em>See Santini v. Cleveland Clinic Fla., </em>232 F.3d 823, 825 (11th Cir.2000) (stating that Title VII actions must be brought within 90 days after the plaintiff receives notice that the EEOC has dismissed the charge of discrimination).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\">We review a dismissal under Rule 41(b) for abuse of discretion. <em>Gratton v. Great Am. Commc\u2019ns, </em>178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir.1999). Dismissal with prejudice under Rule 41(b) is proper only \u201cwhere there is a clear record of \u2018willful\u2019 contempt and an implicit or explicit finding that lesser sanctions would not suffice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Violations \u201ccaused by simple negligence, misunderstanding, or inability to comply\u201d do not constitute \u201cwillfulness.\u201d <em>In re Se. Banking Corp., </em>204 F.3d 1322, 1332 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-15\">The district court determined that it was \u201cnot evident that Powell\u2019s noncompliance was willful or in bad faith,\u201d and it is not otherwise clear from the record that her conduct was willful. Moreover, because it was not established that Powell, as opposed to her lawyer, was responsible for her untimely filing or failure to engage in discovery, we are reluctant to conclude that the case warranted such an extreme sanction. <em>See Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V Monada, </em>432 F.3d 1333, 1338 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that dismissal with prejudice is often reserved for cases in which a party \u2014 not the party\u2019s lawyer \u2014 is culpable for the misconduct). Perhaps sharing our reluctance, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>dismissed the complaint <em>without </em>prejudice. But the district court failed to recognize that, due to the running of the statute of limitations, its dismissal was tantamount to a dismissal <em>with </em>prejudice and failed to consider whether lesser sanctions would have been sufficient. As a result, the court abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint pursuant to Rule 41(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">For similar reasons, we conclude that the court\u2019s dismissal under Rule 16(f) was also an abuse of discretion. We review a court\u2019s imposition of sanctions under Rule 16(f) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Duran Samaniego, </em>345 F.3d 1280, 1284 (11th Cir.2003). Rule 16(f) authorizes a court to impose sanctions, including dismissal under Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(v), if a party fails to obey a pretrial order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f)(1). Such sanctions are \u201cdesigned to punish lawyers and parties for conduct which unreasonably delays or otherwise interferes with the expeditious management of trial preparation.\u201d <em>Duran Samaniego, </em>345 F.3d at 1284. \u201c[District courts have discretion to decide if there is a pattern of delay or a deliberate refusal to comply with court orders or directions that justifies a sanction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dismissal under Rule 37, however, is \u201cappropriate only as a last resort, when less drastic sanctions would not ensure compliance with the court\u2019s orders.\u201d <em>Malautea v. Suzuki Motor Co., </em>987 F.2d 1536, 1542 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Nothing evidences that Powell\u2019s conduct was deliberate, constituted a pattern of delay, or unreasonably delayed the proceedings. Her amended complaint \u2014 filed by her lawyer \u2014 was filed only five days late; and despite Powell\u2019s failure to appear, the court proceeded with the hearing on her lawyer\u2019s motion to withdraw. Because the court failed to consider whether Powell would be barred from refiling her complaint and whether other less drastic sanctions would have been adequate, it abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">We vacate and remand to the district court to determine whether Powell is in fact barred from refiling her complaint and, in the light of that information, whether lesser sanctions would suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b117-10\"> We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
