Escobe-do-Quezada argues, for the first time, that his multiple punishments violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Escobedo-Quezada also argues that his sentence of 20 months of imprisonment for his illegal reentry is procedurally and substantively unreasonable. We affirm Escobedo-Quezada\u2019s sentences, and we vacate the written judgment and remand to correct a clerical error.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The district court did not err, much less plainly err, by imposing two terms of imprisonment. Escobedo-Quezada\u2019s crimes \u201cconstitute[ ] a violation of two distinct statutory provisions\u201d because \u201ceach provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). Escobedo-Quezada pleaded guilty to reentering the United States illegally after having been deported three times previously, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), and to entering the United States \u201cat a time and place other than as designated by immigration officers,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1325(a). Because the government could prosecute Escobedo-Quezada under both statutes, he \u201cwaived his double jeopardy argument by pleading guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>532 F.3d 1125, 1129 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by varying upward from the advisory guideline range to sentence Escobe-do-Quezada to term of 20 months of imprisonment for his illegal reentry that would run concurrent with a term of 6 months for entering the United States illegally. Escobedo-Quezada was deported from the United States in January and February of 1999 and again in March 2003; he pleaded guilty to drug crimes in December 2003 and November 2004; and he has outstanding warrants for his arrest in Florida and Illinois. The district court decided to vary upward because of Escobe-do-Quezada\u2019s \u201cdismissive attitude towards the laws of the United States\u201d governing \u201cimmigration and ... other behavior,\u201d the lack \u201cof effect\u201d of previous within-guidelines sentences, his previous election of an eight-month sentence of imprisonment \u201cover making his own way [on probation] for six or eight months,\u201d and his \u201cpersistence in reentering repeatedly and ... remaining in the United States for a protracted time.\u201d The district court reasonably determined that the advisory guideline range of 2 to 8 months would not adequately reflect Escobedo-Quezada\u2019s criminal history or \u201cachieve the statutory purposes of sentencing,\u201d <em>see United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237-40 (11th Cir.2009), and that a sentence of 20 months of imprisonment was necessary to \u201cpromote respect for the law,\u201d provide adequate punishment, deter similar future crimes, and protect the public, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Eseobedo-Quezada\u2019s sentences are reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">We notice a clerical error in the written judgment. The written judgment states mistakenly that Escobedo-Quezada pleaded guilty to two counts of illegal reentry. Because \u201cit is fundamental error for a court to enter a judgment of conviction against a defendant who has not been charged, tried, or found guilty of the crime recited in the judgment,\u201d <em>United States v. James, </em>642 F.3d 1333, 1343 (11th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted), we vacate the written judgment and remand .for the district court to enter a new judgment stating that Escobedo-Quezada pleaded guilty to one count of illegal reentry and one count of illegal entry into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>We AFFIRM Escobedo-Quezada\u2019s sentences, and we REMAND for correction of the written judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
