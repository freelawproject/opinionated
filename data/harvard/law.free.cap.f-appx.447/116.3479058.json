Because Bell\u2019s motion was actually a successive habeas petition filed without our authorization, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to rule on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-16\">Bell was convicted in 2001 of two counts of distribution of crack cocaine. Before the trial, the government had filed a notice of intent to seek enhanced penalties under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 based on Bell\u2019s prior drug-related felony convictions. The district court applied the \u00a7 851 enhancement, sentencing Bell to two concurrent mandatory life sentences. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). After Bell\u2019s conviction and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal, he filed a motion to vacate his sentences under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, which the district court denied. He did not appeal that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-17\">Later, Bell filed a <em>pro se </em>\u201cMotion for Clarification\u201d in the district court arguing that the government\u2019s \u00a7 851 enhancement notice did not give him adequate notice of the government\u2019s allegations because it cited to the wrong subsection of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. Thus, Bell argued the district court had lacked jurisdiction to impose the mandatory life sentences. The district court summarily denied the motion. Bell asks us to vacate his sentence and remand his case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-19\">\u201cWhether the district court had jurisdiction ... is a legal question subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>plenary review.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir.2002). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c), a district court generally \u201cmay not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed,\u201d but \u201cmay modify an imposed term of imprisonment to the extent otherwise expressly permitted by statute or by Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[E]xpressly permitted by statute refers to situations where the defendant is incarcerated pursuant to a plainly illegal sentence.\u201d <em>Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d at 1316 (quotation marks omitted). It does not, however, refer to situations where the second or successive motion bar prohibits bringing a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">We must \u201clook beyond the label of a <em>pro se </em>inmate\u2019s motion to determine if it is cognizable under a different statutory framework.\u201d <em>United States v. Stossel, </em>348 F.3d 1320, 1322 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990) (same). However labeled, Bell\u2019s motion sought modification of his sentence, and that could have been done, if at all, only under Rule 35 or under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Rule 35 does not apply, and Bell\u2019s motion is properly construed as a motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Because Bell had already filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, this one is his second.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">A second or successive motion under \u00a7 2255 must be certified by the appropriate court of appeals to contain newly discovered evidence that establishes the petitioner\u2019s innocence or \u201ca new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 2244(b). Absent this Court\u2019s permission, the district court lacks jurisdiction to address the motion, and it must be dismissed. <em>See United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWithout authorization, the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive petition.\u201d); <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The district court should have construed Bell\u2019s \u201cMotion for Clarification\u201d as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. Because that motion was filed without authorization from this Court, the district court should have dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s denial and remand the matter to the district court with instructions to dismiss the motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-6\">. Rule 35 permits a sentencing court to correct \u201ca sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error\u201d within 14 days or to reduce a sentence for substantial assistance. Neither applies here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
