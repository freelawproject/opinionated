On appeal, Odum argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of his medical condition and his time served for a state sentence underlying some of the violations. Odum acknowledges that the sentence of 60 months imprisonment was \u25a0within the guidelines range, but contends that the totality of the circumstances required a lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-23\">We review the substantive unreasonableness of a sentence imposed by the district court for an abuse of discretion. See <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cThe review for substantive unreasonableness involves examining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3558(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>526 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations and alteration omitted). We will vacate a sentence only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1190 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). \u201cAlthough we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we ordinarily expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (quotations and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">When sentencing a defendant upon revocation of supervised release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), a district court must consider: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and to provide the defendant with training, medical care, or correctional treatment; (3) the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 range; (4) pertinent Sentencing Commission policy statements; (5) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities among similarly situated defendants with similar records; and (6) the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e) (providing that the court must consider the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), and (a)(4)-(7) when sentencing a defendant upon revocation of supervised release); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(B)-(D), and (a)(4)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm. Odum\u2019s 60-month sentence was substantively reasonable. The sentence was within the guideline range, and we accord an expectation of reasonableness to such a sentence. <em>United States v. Alfaro-Moncada, </em>607 F.3d 720, 735 (11th Cir.2010); <em>Hunt, </em>526 F.3d at 746. In addition, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors favored a lengthy sentence, and the record shows that the district court clearly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when it imposed the sentence. Odum had an extensive criminal history, committed serious offenses, and was undeterred by prior sentences. Indeed, Odum had been on supervised release less than two months before committing the instant violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
