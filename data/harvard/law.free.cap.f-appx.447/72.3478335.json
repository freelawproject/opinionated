He was convicted and sentenced to 24 months imprisonment. The district court also imposed a 3-year term of supervised release, and the conditions of that supervised release prohibited Powe from committing another federal, state, or local crime or illegally possessing a controlled substance. Powe\u2019s term of supervised release began on May 9, 2008, and was scheduled to expire on May 8, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-17\">On March 23, 2011, police in Prichard, Alabama, arrested Powe for the crimes of unlawful distribution and possession of a controlled substance. Powe\u2019s probation officer then filed a petition for the revocation of his supervised release. In response the district court issued a warrant ordering Powe to appear before the court and answer the probation officer\u2019s allegations that he had violated the conditions of his supervised release by (1) committing the crimes of unlawful distribution and possession of a controlled substance and (2) illegally possessing a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-18\">At the revocation hearing, the district court found that Powe had violated the conditions of his supervised release. The court revoked his supervised release and sentenced him to 24 months imprisonment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">The district court may revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release if it finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of that release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The court must revoke a defendant\u2019s supervised release if the court finds that the defendant violated the specific condition prohibiting the illegal possession of a controlled substance. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3583(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s judgment revoking a defendant\u2019s supervised release. <em>United States v. Velasquez Velasquez, </em>524 F.3d 1248, 1252 (11th Cir.2008). We review for clear error the district court\u2019s findings of fact at a revocation hearing, <em>United States v. Almand, </em>992 F.2d 316, 318 (11th Cir.1993), and will reverse only if the record lacks substantial evidence to support those findings. <em>See United States v. Robertson, </em>493 F.3d 1322, 1330 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Substantial evidence presented at the revocation hearing supports the district court\u2019s finding that Powe violated the conditions of his supervised release. Jerrail Ramsey, a police officer involved in Powe\u2019s arrest, testified that an undercover police officer, wired for audio, purchased crack cocaine from a drug dealer. As that drug dealer approached the undercover officer\u2019s truck, that officer described the drug dealer as an African-American male wearing dark bluejeans, a white t-shirt, a blue cap with a red bib, and a silver chain with a big cross. Shortly after the drug transaction, police officers arrested Powe. Powe is an African-American male, and he was arrested wearing dark blue jeans, a white t-shirt, a blue cap with a red bib, and a silver chain with a big cross. Police also found crack cocaine on Powe\u2019s person. Later, the undercover officer identified Powe as the drug dealer from whom he had purchased the crack cocaine. Although the undercover officer did not testify at the revocation hearing, reliable hearsay is admissible at a revocation hearing. <em>See United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 114 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">AFFRIMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
