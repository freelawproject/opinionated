After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b63-16\">Charles Burke resided in a Florida nursing home for approximately eighteen months. After becoming seriously ill, Burke was removed from the nursing home and died in a hospital. During Burke\u2019s hospital stay, the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cSecretary\u201d or \u201cDHHS\u201d), on behalf of Medicare, paid $38,875.08 for his medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-17\">Subsequently, Plaintiff-Appellant Bradley, on behalf of Burke\u2019s estate, brought a wrongful death claim against the nursing home and its liability insurance carrier. Bradley settled the claim for $52,500 and notified the Secretary of the settlement. The Secretary asserted that Burke\u2019s estate had to reimburse Medicare for Burke\u2019s net medical expenses of $22,480.89.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-18\">Plaintiff-Appellant Bradley then filed in probate court an application for the court to adjudicate the rights of the estate and the children to the settlement funds. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Secretary declined to participate in the probate court proceeding. The probate court determined that DHHS was entitled to only $787.50 of the settlement funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The Secretary declined to recognize the probate court\u2019s determination, relying upon DHHS\u2019s Medicare Secondary Payer Manual (\u201cMedicare Manual\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Secretary continued to assert that Burke\u2019s estate owed Medicare $22,480.89. Bradley paid that amount under protest. After exhausting her administrative remedies, Bradley appealed the Secretary\u2019s decision to the federal district court. The district court deferred to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the Medicare Manual, and held that Medicare was entitled to reimbursement in the amount of $22,480.89.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Bradley then appealed to this Court. In <em>Bradley v. Sebelius, </em>we reversed the district court\u2019s decision, concluding that DHHS\u2019s Medicare Manual was not entitled to deference. 621 F.3d 1330, 1338 (11th Cir.2010). Accordingly, we held the Secretary\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence and found the Secretary was entitled to only $787.50, as determined by the probate court. <em>Id. </em>at 1339.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On remand, the district court entered judgment in accordance with our appellate opinion. Subsequently, Plaintiff-Appellant Bradley filed a motion for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 2412(b) of the EAJA. The district court denied Bradley\u2019s motion, finding that DHHS had not acted in bad faith. The district court explained that our appellate decision involved an issue of first impression and that nothing suggested the Secretary had acted in bad faith, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX\">The Secretary acted in conformity with [DHHS\u2019s] long-held legal position, one supported by decisions from other Courts of Appeal[s]. The Secretary\u2019s position in this particular case was also supported by most of the judges who heard this dispute. Ultimately, two of the three judges on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the Plaintiffs on a question of first impression. But neither of those judges suggested that the Secretary acted in bad faith in litigating this case, and the Plaintiffs have not provided any basis for such a conclusion in their motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">We review a district court\u2019s decision denying a request for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 2412(b)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the EAJA for abuse of discretion. <em>Maritime Mgmt., Inc. v. United States, </em>242 F.3d 1326, 1331 (11th Cir.2001). We review a district court\u2019s finding regarding a party\u2019s lack of bad faith for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-13\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b), a district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees is discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>tionary. The district court may appropriately exercise its discretion to award fees under \u00a7 2412(b) where the government acted \u201cin bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.\u201d <em>Maritime Mgmt., </em>242 F.3d at 1331 (quoting <em>Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co. v. Wilderness Soc\u2019y, </em>421 U.S. 240, 258-59, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 1622, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975)) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cBad faith,\u201d in turn, means \u201cnot simply bad judgment or negligence, but rather it implies the conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity; ... it contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or ill will.\u201d <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>198 F.3d 1293, 1299 (11th Cir.1999) (alteration in original) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Here, the district court\u2019s finding of no bad faith was not clearly erroneous and thus its denial of attorney\u2019s fees was not an abuse of discretion. In explaining its finding, the district court noted that the Secretary\u2019s actions followed \u201c[DHHS\u2019s] long-held legal position,\u201d which other circuit court decisions supported. While our circuit (in a 2-1 opinion) reached a different conclusion than the Secretary on a matter of first impression in this circuit, that is not enough to compel a finding of bad faith. <em>See Gilbert, </em>198 F.3d at 1299. Nothing in the record indicates DHHS pursued its position \u201cbecause of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Further, Plaintiff-Appellant Bradley has presented no evidence that DHHS acted vexatiously or wantonly, such as by pursuing dilatory tactics or abusive discovery practices. Accordingly, we must affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Bradley\u2019s \u00a7 2412(b) attorney\u2019s fee request.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\">. In pertinent part, the Medicare Manual states: \"The only situation in which Medicare recognizes allocations of liability payments to non-medical losses is when payment is based on a court order on the merits of the case.\u201d Medicare Secondary Payer Manual (CMS Pub. 100-05) Chapter 7, \u00a7 50.4.4 (currently under review).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-8\">. In the district court, Bradley filed a motion entitled: \"Plaintiffs' Verified Motion for Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Costs as Prevailing Parties in These Proceedings Pursuant to Federal Common Law and Equal Access to Justice Act ('EAJA') 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(b)/Memorandum of Law in Support.\u201d The Memorandum of Law argues for attorney\u2019s fees exclusively under \u00a7 2412(b). Because Bradley argued before the district court only that she was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 2412(b), we decline to address her argument on appeal as to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines, Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (\"[A]n issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered by this court.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
