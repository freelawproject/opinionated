He argues that his 46-month sentence was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Lopez-Lara argues that a presumption of reasonableness should not apply to his within guidelines sentence because it was not based on \u201cempirical data\u201d and it \u201cdouble counts\u201d his criminal history. He also asserts that a 16-level enhancement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>excessive, that a single prior conviction resulted in the enhancement and all of his criminal history points, that the sentence failed to account for his motives for returning to the United States, and that the sentence failed to account for his low risk of recidivism based on his age.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Lopez-Lara\u2019s empirical data argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009). We have previously rejected the argument that the double counting of a defendant\u2019s criminal history necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31; <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.6). Lopez-Lara\u2019s remaining arguments, which amount to a disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the appropriateness of his within-guidelines sentence, do not suffice to show error in connection with his sentence. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Lopez-Lara has not shown that his sentence was unreasonable, and he has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554-55 (5th Cir.2006). Lopez-Lara has not shown that the district court abused its discretion under <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-50, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and thus he has shown no error, plain or otherwise. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b606-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
