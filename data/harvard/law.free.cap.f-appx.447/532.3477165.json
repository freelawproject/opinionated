Cornell Blanks, Plaintiff-Appellant, has appealed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for his former employer Defendant-Appellee Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc. (\u201cVought\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-20\">Blanks worked for Lockheed Martin (\u201cLockheed\u201d), an aircraft manufacturer, until he was laid off in 2005 or 2006. He moved away from the Dallas-Fort Worth area but returned in 2007 after learning that Lockheed intended to call back some laid-off employees. While he waited to hear from Lockheed, Vought, another aircraft manufacturer, hired Blanks for a similar full-time position. Blanks began work for Vought in January 2008. Less than half a year later, in June 2008, Lockheed offered Blanks a full-time job. Rather than decline Lockheed\u2019s offer or quit working for Vought, Blanks elected to balance both full-time positions, informing neither Lockheed nor Vought of his plan. Blanks immediately began to request substantial time off from Vought, alternately citing the Family Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d) or requesting personal time. Over the next weeks, he missed several scheduled shifts. In late June he claimed an on-the-job injury with Vought and sought worker\u2019s compensation. Due to multiple inconsistencies in his worker\u2019s compensation claim, including that he did not work on the date he claimed he was injured, and also because he worked at Lockheed each day he failed to show up at Vought, Vought terminated Blanks. Vought noted Blanks\u2019s \u201cdeliberate falsification of information [he] provided on a worker\u2019s compensation claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-21\">Blanks soon sued Vought in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas Division, primari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>ly alleging that (1) his termination was motivated by unlawful race discrimination in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, and the Texas Labor Code; and that (2) he was physically injured at work by a defective hoist. His complaint also contained passing references to the FMLA, the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1970 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1988 and 1985, his age, whistle-blowing, and a union contract, as well as violations of state and federal law not clearly related to his claimed injury. Blanks sought leave to file an out-of-time amended complaint, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Vought and Blanks moved for summary judgment. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation that it grant Vought\u2019s motion and deny Blanks\u2019s motion. The magistrate found that (1) Blanks failed to establish a prima facie case of race or age discrimination under Title VII based on e-mails that reflected only his employer\u2019s concern over Blanks\u2019s repeated absences for work and questions about his worker\u2019s compensation claim; (2) Blanks failed to establish that Vought\u2019s reason for his termination\u2014 worker\u2019s compensation fraud \u2014 was pretext for discrimination; (3) Blanks\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation claim barred his state law negligence claim; (4) Blanks did not work for Vought long enough to be eligible for FMLA leave; (5) Blanks failed to establish that he is a qualified individual with a disability, or that he suffered an adverse action because of his alleged disability, to support a claim under the ADA; (6) Blanks did not allege any facts to support his ERISA claim of unlawful discharge; (7) Blanks failed to show that he exhausted any union grievance regarding Vought\u2019s alleged refusal to provide medical leave or insurance or Vought\u2019s alleged discrimination in order to support a claim of breach of contract based on his collective bargaining agreement; and (8) Blanks failed to establish that Vought, a private employer, acted under color of state law to deprive him of any rights secured by the constitution or that deprived him of rights protected by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 or 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">After Blanks unsuccessfully moved the district court to reconsider its order, the district court entered judgment in Vought\u2019s favor and dismissed Blanks\u2019s claims. Blanks appealed, and Vought filed a motion for attorney\u2019s fees with the district court. Because Blanks\u2019s claims were \u201cgroundless, unreasonable, and frivolous,\u201d and brought in bad faith, the district court ordered Blanks to pay Vought $66,605. Blanks appealed the district court\u2019s order on attorney\u2019s fees, and this court consolidated his appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Blanks articulates his primary issue on appeal as being whether a district court may treat a pro se litigant like a second-class citizen. Blanks attacks the court\u2019s entry of summary judgment against him based on what he characterizes as Vought\u2019s discovery abuses and the district court\u2019s failure to delay ruling on Vought\u2019s motion pending correction of these abuses. He challenges <em>Iqbal/Twombly </em>and conflates the standards and burdens on a motion to dismiss with those on summary judgment, asserting that his bare pleadings entitle him to summary judgment. Finally, Blanks disputes the district court\u2019s grant of attorney\u2019s fees in light of the fact that Blanks was not represented by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Interpreting Blanks\u2019s \u201cbrief liberally to afford all reasonable inferences which can be drawn,\u201d <em>In re Tex. Pig Stands, Inc., </em>610 F.3d 937, 941 n. 4 (5th Cir.2010), we find that the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for Vought and dismissal of his claims was proper and also affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees. This record suggests no discovery abuses. Blanks has identified no legal er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ror by the district court; nor has he identified any facts that would support a claim entitling him to the relief he seeks. Further, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion by ordering Blanks to pay Vought\u2019s fees. <em>See Volk v. Gonzalez, </em>262 F.3d 528, 534 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court and its award of attorney\u2019s fees for the reasons set forth in the magistrate judge\u2019s reports, as adopted by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b557-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
