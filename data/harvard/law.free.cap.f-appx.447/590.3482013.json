The written judgment included as a special condition of supervised release the requirement that, \u201c[wjithin 72 hours of being placed on supervised release or upon completion of the custody sentence, the defendant shall surrender to a duly authorized immigration official\u201d. Salmer\u00f3n contends: because the district court did <em>not </em>orally impose this special condition at sentencing, the written judgment should be amended and the condition removed to conform with the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-21\">Because Salmer\u00f3n had no opportunity at sentencing to challenge the special condition, the district court\u2019s subsequent imposition of the condition is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. Bigelow, </em>462 F.3d 378, 381 (5th Cir.2006). When a written judgment and an oral pronouncement conflict, the latter controls. <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 935 (5th Cir.2003). On the other hand, \u201cthe [written] judgment\u2019s inclusion of conditions [not pronounced orally] that are mandatory, standard, or recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines does not create a conflict\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 938. But, \u201cif the district court fails to mention a <em>special </em>condition at sentencing, its subsequent inclusion in the written judgment creates a conflict that requires amendment of the written judgment to conform with the oral pronouncement\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 936 (emphasis in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-22\">As Salmer\u00f3n contends, the special condition is <em>not </em>listed among the standard conditions of supervised release found either in Guideline \u00a7 5D1.3(c) or the relevant portion of the Southern District of Texas\u2019 General Order No. H-1996-10. Furthermore, the condition is <em>not </em>rendered standard or mandatory by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d) (\u201cIf an alien ... is subject to deportation, the court ... <em>may </em>order that he be delivered to [an immigration official]\u201d. (emphasis added)). Nor does the condition comport with the recommended special condition of supervised release or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>dering deportation in Guideline \u00a7 5D1.8(d)(6) (applies only when alien has consented to deportation or Government has proved by clear and convincing evidence alien is deportable, neither of which occurred here). Therefore, because the district court did <em>not </em>impose the special condition orally at sentencing, its inclusion in the written judgment creates a conflict and was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED in part; and REMANDED for amendment of the written judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b614-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
