Otayek responded, claiming an interest in the property and counterclaiming against the Bank. After the Magistrate Court set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the case for a hearing, Otayek removed the action to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, asserting that that court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441 and 1443.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The Bank moved the court to remand the case to the Magistrate Court, and the district court granted its motion and remanded the case. Otayek appeals the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Otayek argues that the district court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 1443 because Georgia\u2019s law governing foreclosures and dispossessory actions violates his civil rights. In doing so, he challenges our precedents holding that \u00a7 1443 pertains only to the \u201cequal civil rights\u201d relating to racial equality. He urges us to consider the plain language of the statute and overturn those precedents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">We review de novo whether a district court had federal subject matter jurisdiction following removal. <em>Castleberry v. Goldome Credit Corp., </em>408 F.3d 773, 780-81 (11th Cir.2005). Remands based on grounds specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) are insulated from appellate review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). <em>Hernandez v. Seminole C\u2019nty., </em>334 F.3d 1233, 1236 (11th Cir.2003). To the extent that a district court bases its remand order on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1447(d) and 1443, however, we have jurisdiction to review that order. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d); <em>Alabama v. Conley, </em>245 F.3d 1292, 1293 n. 1, 1295 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Under \u00a7 1443, a defendant may remove a case initiated in state court if he is \u201cdenied or cannot enforce in the courts of such State a right under any law providing for the equal civil rights of the United States, or of all persons within the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1). The removal petition must show: (1) \u201cthat the right upon which [he] relies arises under a federal law \u2018providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality\u2019 \u201d and (2) that he has been denied or cannot enforce that right in the state courts. <em>Conley, </em>245 F.3d at 1295 (quoting <em>Georgia v. Rachel, </em>384 U.S. 780, 792, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 1790, 16 L.Ed.2d 925 (1966)). The district court lacked removal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1443 because this action does not arise under a federal law protecting civil rights stated in terms of racial equality; moreover, Otayek can enforce his rights in state court. <em>Rachel, </em>384 U.S. at 792, 794, 86 S.Ct. at 1790-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-9\">. In his reply brief, Otayek argues that the Bank has not registered with Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State and argues that, as a result, he cannot file a civil action against the Bank in Georgia\u2019s courts. We deem the argument abandoned since he did not raise it in his opening brief. <em>Al-Amin v. Smith, </em>511 F.3d 1317, 1336 n. 38 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
