Now, we know, from common observation, that coke-ovens are about six feet in height, and are arched over at the top, a hole being left in the crown for the exit of gases, and for the introduction of coal, with a door in front for the discharge of the coke, which during the burning process is walled up. Is, then, a coke-oven a \u201cbuilding,\u201d within the meaning of the mechanic\u2019s lien act of 1836? The word as there used cannot be held to include every species of erection on land. <em>Truesdell v. </em>Gay, 13 Gray, 311. \u201cTaken in its broadest sense,\u201d says the court in that case, \u201cit can mean only an erection intended for use and occupation as a habitation, or for some purpose of trade, manufacture, ornament, or use, constituting a fabric or edifice, such as a house, a store, a church, a shed.\u201d That a coke-oven is not intended as a habitation or for .shelter is certain. Neither is it capable of occupation and use for the purpose of trade, etc., in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>sense of the above definition. It is no more a building than is any other oven erected on land i'or the purpose of baking bread, or drying any substance. In tbc recent case of <em>Cowdrich </em>v. Morris, 9 Pa. Co. Ct. R. 312, it was decided by the court of common pleas of Center county, Pa., that a lime-kiln is not a building within the scope of the mechanic\u2019s lien law. But if a lime-kiln is not such a building, neither is a coke-oven. In the ease of <em>Truesdell </em>v. <em>Gay, supra, </em>it was held that a wall built around three sides of the stack of an iron furnace at the distance of a few feet from it, in order to protect it from earth slides, was not a building within the meaning of sueli a law. It is worthy here of note that since the act of June 16,1836, giving a mechanic\u2019s lien against buildings, there has been supplemental legislation expressly extending the act to steam-engines, coal-breakers, pump-gearing, etc., (Act April 21, 1856; P. L. 496,) and, in certain counties, to \u201cimprovements, pumps, engines, tanks,\u201d etc., (Act Feb. 27, 1868; P. L. 212,) connected with oil refineries, and to \u201coil-tanks,\u201d whether connected with a refinery or not. Thus have we in subsequent statutes <em>in pari materia </em>a legislative indication of the moaning of the word \u201cbuilding\u201d which should govern in the construction of the original act. <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>3 How. 556. We do not think that the cases of <em>Short </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>120 Pa. St. 470, 14 Atl. Rep. 374; <em>Short </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>121 Pa. St. 530, 15 Atl. Rep. 607; and <em>Titusville Iron-Works </em>v. <em>Keystone Oil Co., </em>130 Pa. St. 24, 18 Atl. Rep. 739,--sustain the position taken by the petitioner. In our judgment, in no reasonable sense can a coke-oven be said to be a building.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">But, if the contrary conclusion were admissible, still another obstacle confronts the petitioner. The mortgage of the Cameron Iron <em>&amp; </em>Coal Company to the Central Trust Company was recorded August 8, 1888, whereas the contract between the Cameron Iron- <em>&amp; </em>Coal Company and the petitioner, under which the latter built the coke-ovens, was not signed or made until November 1,1888. The petitioner, however, claims the benefit of that clause of the mechanic\u2019s lien act which provides that \u201cthe lien for work and materials aforesaid shall he preferred to every other lien or incumbrance which attached upon such building and ground, or either of them, subsequently to the commencement of such building.\u201d But we are of opinion that the evidence fails to show that the building of the coke-ovens commenced before the recording of the mortgage. The written contract of November 1,1888, on its face is against that view, for it provides for the whole work of construction, and the first clause of the specification roads: \u201cThe ground on which the ovens, wharves, and railroad tracks are to be placed must be cleared from ail stumps, logs, and other material that will give an insecure foundation for the work, and ditched so ns to drain fhe bottom thoroughly.\u201d Nor does the parol testimony sustain the allegation that the commencement of building was before the recording of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The evidence which comes from the witnesses shows this state of facts: In September, 1887, the Cameron Iron &amp; Coal Company cleared off the land intended and selected i'or the coke-ovens; stumps were then taken out; the brush cleared off; and in November of that year a ditch was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>cut through the center of the coke-ground, to take off the water. That fall other ditches were cut, and roads were cut. During the fall of 1887 and the succeeding winter stone was quarried and hauled to and delivered on the coke-ground, and also logs.. Ultimately this stone was used in building the ovens, and the logs in building the cribbing for a coke-wharf. But the petitioner had nothing whatever to do with the above-mentioned work, or with any work done on the premises before the date of his contract. And, then, in point of fact, no part of the building of the coke-ovens was done prior to November 1, 1888. It seems very clear to us that all the previous work on the ground was of a preliminary nature, \u2014 preceding the commencement of building, \u2014 and hence did not have the effect of carrying back the petitioner\u2019s alleged lien under his contract of November 1, 1888, so as to give him priority over ths mortgage. Such a result would be unreasonable and inequitable. When the mortgage was recorded the work of construction of the coke-ovens had not actually begun. Not a stone had b\u00e9en laid, nor a stick of timber put in place. Such work as then appeared on the ground was, at the most, merely preparatory to the building of coke-ovens, and by no means the commencement of building. Moreover, this preliminary work was entirely the work of the Cameron Iron <em>&amp; </em>Coal Company itself, and it would be most extraordinary if it could by relation give to the petitioner\u2019s subsequent contract precedence over the mortgage. No case has been cited which sanctions such a doctrine, while the case of <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Stonehill, </em>5 Whart. 301, 306, is directly against it. It follows, therefore, from what has been said, that the petitioner is not entitled to a decree that his claim is a lien paramount to the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Reed, J.
