Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a7 3; Act Cong. March 3, 1875, \u00a7 1, (18 St. at Large, 470, 473;) Act Cong. March 3, 1887, gg 2, 6, (24 St. at Large, 552;) Act Aug. 13,1888, \u00a7 1, (2-5 St. at Large, 483;)' <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Huffmaster, </em>35 Fed. Rep. 81. As to the fact that national banks and their officers are to be considered the same as individuals, and are to be governed by the same laws as respects jurisdiction: Act Cong. Aug. 13,1888, \u00a7 4, (25 St. at Large, 433.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b859-14\"><em>John R. Read </em>and <em>Silas W. Pettit, </em>for plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b859-15\">Clause 3, \u00a7 629, Rev. St. H. S., provides that circuit courts of United States shall have original jurisdiction \u201cof ail suits at common law where the United States, or any officer thereof, suing under the authority of any act of congress, are plaintiffs. \u201d Where there is such a plaintiff, jurisdiction attaches independent of the amount. <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Mooney, </em>116 U. S. 104, 6 Sup. Ct. Rep. 304. A receiver of a national bank is an officer of the United States \u201csuing under the authority of an act of congress.\u201d <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Gibson, </em>8 Wall. 498; <em>Frelinghuysen </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>12 Fed.

S. </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>39 Fed. Rep. 433. Another ground of jurisdiction lies in the fact that prior to 1882 a national bank might sue in the district where the bank was situated, regardless of amount of claim. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>2 Browne; Nat. Bank. Cas. 180; Rev. St. \u00a7 629, clause 10. A receiver succeeds to bank\u2019s rights, <em>(Kennedy </em>v. <em>Gibson, 8 </em>Wall. 498;) and he could sue, after 1882, in district where bank is located, <em>(Hendee </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>26 Fed. Rep. 677.) The act of August 13, 1888, \u00a7 4, (25 St. at Large, 433,) provided that section should not refer to \u201csuits for winding up national banks.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b860-4\">Acheson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AayD\">We have considered the question of jurisdiction in above case, and are satisfied that the court has jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
