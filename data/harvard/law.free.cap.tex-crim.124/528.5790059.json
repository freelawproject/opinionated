At some periods of the year, notably in the summer, the company is able to transport its produce in its own trucks. At times the volume is too great to be handled by the trucks owned by the company. At such times it is more economical for the company to rent or lease trucks than to buy such additional trucks as may be necessary to take care of the increased business. This is due in a measure to the fact that if additional trucks were bought they would remain idle during the summer months.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">Appellant was the owner of the truck and trailer described in the following written agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-14\">\u201cMemorandum of agreement made and entered into this Fourth day of April, A.

The driver of the truck was employed by appellant. Armour and Company had the sole and exclusive use of the truck. The driver was subject to the control and direction of the company in the conduct of its business in hauling and delivering its products.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">On the 31st of May, 1932, authorities stopped the truck in question while it was being driven by the driver employed by appellant in transporting Armour and Company\u2019s products along a public highway from Fort Worth to Nacogdoches. The truck was being operated without having obtained a permit from the Railroad Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Subdivision (g), section 1, chapter 277, Acts of the Regular Session, 42nd Legislature, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">\u201cThe term \u2018motor carrier\u2019 means any person, firm, corporation, company, co-partnership, association or joint stock association, and their lessees, receivers or trustees appointed by any court whatsoever, owning, controlling, managing, operating or causing to be operated any motor propelled vehicle used in transporting property for compensation or hire over any public highway in this state, where in the course of such transportation a highway between two or more incorporated cities, towns or villages is traversed; provided, that the term \u2018motor carrier\u2019 as used in this Act shall not include, and this Act shall not apply to motor vehicles operated exclusively within the incorporated limits of cities or towns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Subdivision (h), section 1, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">\u201cThe term \u2018contract carrier\u2019 means any motor carrier as hereinabove defined transporting property for compensation or hire over any highway in this state other than as a common carrier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">Subdivision (a), section 6, of the Act is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-12\">\u201cNo motor carrier now operating as a contract carrier or that may hereafter desire to engage in the business of a contract carrier shall so operate until it shall have received a permit from the Commission to engage in such business and such permit shall not be issued until the applicant shall have in all things complied with the requirements of this Act; nor shall such permit be issued unless the character of business being done or to be done by the applicant strictly conforms with the definition of a contract carrier. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>A penalty is provided in the Act for a violation of its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\">Appellant takes the position that the evidence on the part of the state shows that the truck was not engaged in the transportation of property for compensation or hire, but was being operated exclusively by Armour and Company in the hauling of its own products. We are unable to bring ourselves to appellant\u2019s view. We are constrained to hold that the trial court was warranted in concluding that the method employed was merely a device which enabled appellant to use the truck in transporting property for compensation or hire without first having complied with the statutes to which reference has been made. Under the memorandum of agreement, appellant paid all of the expenses of operation, including the wages of the driver. He kept the truck in good running condition. \u25a0 He agreed to hold Armour and Company harmless from any claim which might be made against said company by the driver under the compensation laws of Texas in the event of injury to the driver. He obligated himself to substitute another truck in the event of a breakdown, or if for any other reason the truck in question \u25a0 could not be used. The contract stipulated the approximate number of miles the truck would be driven a week; provided, that any excess mileage should not be considered as a breach of the contract, nor make Armour and Company liable for greater compensation than sixty dollars per week. Appellant was responsible to the company for the prompt remittance of all collections made by the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The case of Public Utilities Commission of Ohio v. Boughtonville Farmers Exchange Co. et al., 178 N. E., 859, presents a similar situation. The defendant Starkey was engaged in hauling livestock raised by various farmers to the Cleveland Union Stockyards. The livestock was transported by Starkey under a contract with the defendant, the Boughtonville Farmers Exchange Company, by the terms of which Starkey acted as an independent contractor in operating the trucks, and the defendant company made the arrangements for hauling with the farmers, and after the sale at the stockyards remitted the proceeds of the sale, less yardage and commission charged at the stockyards and sixty cents per hundred for the hauling by truck. The sixty cents was divided, ten cents to the defendant company, and fifty cents to Starkey. Transportation was furnished for livestock to all farmers who wanted it, up to the limit of the capacity of the trucks, there being a willingness to carry all livestock that was offered. When the stock were re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>ceived from the farmers, \"bills of sale from the farmers to the Boughtonville Farmers Exchange Company were executed, which contained the following stipulation: \u201cThe title passes, to buyer from seller upon the signing of this instrument. Price to be computed at $.60 below the price received by buyer at Cleveland Union Stockyards, whose weights are accepted by both parties. Buyer has three days to make payment.\u201d This agreement was executed by the farmer making the sale of the livestock and by the Boughtonville Farmers Exchange Company. In the course of the opinion it was stated that the defendants had not procured a certificate of public convenience and necessity as required of common carriers. The court said that if the defendant company purchased and paid for the stock and then caused it to be transported to Cleveland under special contract with an operator of a truck who did no other work of transportation, such truck operator would not be a common carrier. However, the concltision was reached that the method, employed did not obviate the necessity of a certificate of public convenience and necessity. We quote from the opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">\u201cThe method of doing business in the instant case, however, amounted to nothing more nor less than a plan of transporting livestock for the public in that vicinity at a charge of sixty cents per hundred. It was merely a device which enabled the truck owner to carry on the work of a common carrier through, the defendant company. If such a device could be used to evade the law, all truck owners engaged in transporting goods to market as common carriers could operate under special contract with another person, or a .corporation, and avoid the legal necessity of obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">By analogy, the case from which the above quotation is taken is deemed to support our conclusion that the plan adopted, by appellant did not obviate the necessity of obtaining a permit as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b557-11\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b557-12\">LATTIMORE, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Acu\">Appellant moves for rehearing. The facts are stated in our former opinion. Briefly, \u2014 Armour &amp; Company had goods which they wanted transported from Fort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Worth, Texas, to Nacogdoches, Texas. Appellant had a truck, for whose use in carriage of goods, etc., he wanted pay. A written contract was mutually signed by whose terms Armour <em>&amp; </em>Company got their goods carried to Nacogdoches on appellant\u2019s truck, for which they agreed to pay $60.00 per week to appellant. Appellant carried said goods in his truck on a public highway. His sole object in so doing was to earn pay for the use of his truck and his services. Armour &amp; Company were to get their goods carried at the agreed price of carriage. The contract is set out in our former opinion. What each party thereto was to do in the premises is set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\">Construction of a word here and there in such contract would get us nowhere, and could not operate to change or obscure the plain import of the agreement. Appellant was a contract carrier for pay over the highways of this state. Our statutes require that such carrier have a permit before engaging in such occupation. Appellant had none. He thus violated the statute, and his conviction was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">There is nothing applicable in Staacke v. Routledge, 241 S. W., 994. It was there merely held that a corporation organized to purchase, sell, or rent automobiles, had authority under its charter to rent them, and that this was not ultra vires. In the case before us Armour &amp; Company were not renting or hiring out their trucks, and there is no question but that appellant had the power to rent out his. The facts in this case, however, show that he operated his truck, oiled it, gasolined it, repaired it, ran it upon the highways, and carried goods in it,\u2014 for the contract consideration. The lessee company neither had nor attempted to exercise any control over the management or operation of such truck. The state cites as applicable Shoen v. C. St. P., etc. Ry. Co., 127 N. W., 433; Norton v. Union Traction Co., 110 N. E., 113; Industrial Commission v. Hammond, 236 Pac., 1006. The point involved, i. e., the liability of appellant for his failure to procure a permit to operate said truck, seems plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
