However, the record fails to disclose the procedure by which the county judge was elected. It also fails to show that he took the oath of office prescribed by law. These matters must be shown by the record. See James v. State, 99 Texas Crim. Rep., 395, 269 S. W., 788. In the present condition of the record, the judgment of conviction cannot be sustained. See Kahn v. State, 115 Texas Crim. Rep., 92, 30 S. W.
