He said he was discussing the question of trading appellant a' gun when the officer saw them together. He declared that he went with appellant to the alley for the purpose of answering a call of nature. He testified that he did not see any whisky while there, and that he saw no whisky in appellant\u2019s possession. Appellant testified that he had been ill with influenza for several days, and that a physician had prescribed whisky for him. He denied that he had sold Rhyner any whisky, and declared that at the time the officer saw them together Rhyner was trying to trade him a gun. As to the pint of whisky found in his possession, he said that upon the suggestion of his doctor he was using it for medicinal purposes. Without objection, appellant introduced in evidence a letter from his physician in which it was stated that he should use whisky as a remedy for his influenza. Several witnesses testified that appellant had been ill with influenza.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Bill of exception No. 7 presents the following occurrence : One Dodson was tried on the morning of February 21 for transporting intoxicating liquor. Appellant was in the courtroom during Dodson\u2019s trial. Dodson defended on the ground that he transported the liquor for medicinal purposes. Counsel representing appellant also represented Dodson. Two members of the jury who sat upon appellant\u2019s trial had served in the case of Dodson. In Dodson\u2019s Case the trial was concluded before noon, the jury returning a verdict of not guilty. Appellant\u2019s case was tried in the afternoon of February 21st. Several of the witnesses supporting appellant\u2019s defense that he was using the \u2022liquor for medicinal purposes were not summoned until after Dodson\u2019s Case had been tried. There was no evidence before the jury in appellant\u2019s case that he had issued process for the witnesses during the morning of Dodson\u2019s trial. At this juncture, we quote from the bill of exception as follows: \u201cAfter the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>evidence had been concluded in the above entitled and numbered cause and the charge of the court had been read to the jury, the county attorney of Franklin county, Texas, in his opening argument, made the following statement to the jury, which statement was unwarranted by the evidence, prejudicial and calculated to prejudice the jury against the defendant and was as follows, to-wit: \u2018Gentlemen of the Jury, the papers in this case show that the defendant did not summon his witnesses until just a few hours before his case went to trial The reason that he did not summon his witnesses was that he conceived' the defense that he is making in this case after hearing the same defense in another case that was tried in this court this morning.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJLf\">Appellant\u2019s timely and proper objection to the foregoing argument was overruled, and the court refused to give appellant\u2019s requested instruction withdrawing the remarks from the jury. In the state of the record, the opinion is expressed that the bill of exception presents reversible error. The argument was, in eifect, the unsworn testimony of the county attorney that appellant, after hearing the defense interposed in another case, had made application for witnesses in order that he might interpose the same defense. After injecting such unsworn testimony into the case, the county attorney drew therefrom an inference unfavorable to appellant; that is, that appellant\u2019s defense was fabricated because it had not been conceived, as shown by his belated application for process, until he had heard the same defense interposed in another case. The court, in overruling the objection to the argument, was in the attitude of placing his stamp of approval upon the conduct of the county attorney. In viewing appellant\u2019s defensive testimony, it cannot be said that the jury did not adopt the inference drawn by the county attorney from the unwarranted statement of facts embraced in his remarks. Similar situations have been before this court in numerous appeals. In all of the cases, where it has appeared that remarks of the character in question have been obviously prejudicial, a reversal has been ordered. See Thomas v. State, 6 S. W. (2d) 118; Pendleton v. State, 26 S. W. (2d) 240; Davis v. State, 28 S. W. (2d) 168; Reed v. State, 36 S. W. (2d) 526; Ayers v. State, 27 S. W. (2d) 540. Moreover, it is observed that the trial court certified in the bill of exception that the argument was unwarranted by the evidence, and was calculated to prejudice the jury against appellant. The portion of the bill referred to does not appear as a ground of objection to the argument, nor as reasons for excepting to the ruling of the court, but appears as the statement of a fact. The bill is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>similar to those dealt with in Roberts v. State, 27 S. W. (2d) 159; McKee v. State, 34 S. W. (2d) 592; and Traylor v. State, 47 S. W. (2d) 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\">Bill of exception No. 8 recites that the county attorney, in his closing argument, used the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\">\u201cGentlemen of the jury, just before the defendant\u2019s trial he heard another case tried in this court in which the same defense was made that he is making. It seems that every bootlegger we have had up at this term of court claims he had the liquor for medicinal purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In this bill it is certified that the remarks were \u201cunwarranted by the evidence, prejudicial and calculated to prejudice the jury against the defendant.\u201d Again, it is certified that there was no evidence before the jury supporting the argument. The court overruled the objection, and declined to submit appellant\u2019s requested instruction withdrawing the remarks from the jury. The reasons we have given in support of our conclusion that the bill of exception No. 7 presented reversible error impels us to hold that the bill in question also manifests reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has. been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
