The Motor Vehicle Administration, Petitioner, as a result, asks us to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">Is a police officer\u2019s testimony that a subject had been driving a vehicle involved in a collision, based on the officer\u2019s post-crash investigation that included witness statements that the detained suspect had been \u201ctraveling at a high rate of speed\u201d and \u201chad struck the car,\u201d sufficient to establish reasonable grounds to request an alcohol content test under \u00a7 16 \u2014 205.1(b)(2)<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark> of the Transportation Article?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>We shall hold that, pursuant to Section 16-205.1(b)(2) of the Transportation Article, the administrative law judge\u2019s determination that the police officer had reasonable grounds to detain Carpenter was supported by substantial evidence and was not premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">At a show cause hearing<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> before Administrative Law Judge A.J. Novotny, Officer Pirritano of the Elkton Police Department testified how she came to request Carpenter to submit to a chemical breath test. She testified that she was dispatched to investigate a two-car collision in Elkton on May 23, 2010 and, through her investigation and interview of witnesses at the scene, determined that one of the cars involved in the collision, a maroon Ford Truck, was owned by Carpenter, who was also at the scene:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">I work for the Elkton Police Department, it\u2019s actually patrol division Squad A. On May 23rd at approximately 2345 hours, or 11:45pm, I was dispatched to route 213 in West Pulaski Highway along westbound Route 40 in reference to an accident with personal injury. Upon arrival there, I made contact with a Maryland state police trooper who was already on scene. He advised it was a, a two-vehicle accident involving a Chevy Cavalier and a maroon color Ford truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">I observed that the Cavalier with Maryland registration had extensive disabling damage on the passenger side of the vehicle, also that the victim of that vehicle was being assessed by Singerly Fire Department due to injuries sustained in the accident. I made contact with the victim who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>was the owner and operator of the Chevy Cavalier. She stated that she wasn\u2019t aware of the events. She didn\u2019t\u2014 couldn\u2019t recall them, and was trying to turn into McDonald\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-4\">And then I made contact with several individuals identified as witnesses. And they were Mr. Long \u2014 Mr. Vincent Long (phonetic) and Ms. Ann Long (phonetic). They advised they were directly in front of the vehicle that was struck. They went on to say that they had a green light, and they were, they were driving. They saw a truck that was coming pretty fast from the right-hand turn late on westbound Pulaski. They stated that did not see it but they heard it hit the vehicle and thought they were struck, but it didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t get hit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">I then made contact with a witness who was identified as Ms. Melissa Hickman (phonetic). She advised she was traveling out of the McDonald\u2019s parking lot onto South Bridge Street, and she observed a red truck coming through the red light which hit the car on the passenger side. That car was identified as the Chevy Cavalier that was struck. The truck turned the car completely around and it went up on the grass and hit a sign.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">I then motioned to the truck that was down by Seasons which on West Pulaski Highway. There was actually a turn lane to go into Seasons Pizza from westbound Pulaski Highway. And I asked them if that was the truck that they were talking about. They said yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">I interviewed all of them and concluded the victim, Victim Lovelace (phonetic) was traveling northbound on about 213 or Augustine Herman Highway, passing through the intersection which was at a green light. She was struck on the passenger side of her vehicle by the maroon Ford colored truck which was identified as belonging to Mr. Carpenter. He was identified by his Maryland driver\u2019s license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">She was transported to Union Hospital by Singerley. I later made contact with Mr. Carpenter, and he, from witnesses\u2019 point of view, seemed that he was traveling at a high rate of speed. I can\u2019t conclude whether he was or not. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>I do know that he did make contact with the passenger side of the vehicle, and there was significant damage to his truck as well as the car. His car was towed on scene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Officer Pirritano further testified that, after making contact with Carpenter, she observed his watery eyes, slurred speech, and dilated pupils; Carpenter also had stated that he was coming from Delaware and had consumed two beers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">Once I made contact with him, I noted what appeared to be a very, very strong smell of oral mouthwash and that his eyes were very red and watery. His pupils were dilated, and his speech was slurred. I asked him if he had consumed any alcoholic beverages at which time he stated that he had two beers at a cookout, and he was coming from the Fox Run area in Delaware.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Officer Pirritano then administered several field sobriety tests to Carpenter, including recitation of the alphabet, finger dexterity, one leg stand, and the walk and turn test, all of which he failed, and then asked him to submit to a preliminary breath test, which Carpenter refused. She arrested Carpenter for driving under the influence, read to him from the Advice of Rights DR-15 Form,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and again requested that Carpenter take a breath test, which he refused:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Once I placed him under arrest, I read him his rights, his Advice of Rights, part of the DR-15. He said he couldn\u2019t hear me because of the noise and his shoulder was hurting from the handcuffs, and that was due to his limited flexibility. When I was arresting him, I actually used to [sic] sets of handcuffs, which is not common practice, it\u2019s usually one set. He\u2019s obviously a very broad-shouldered man. I used two sets of cuffs. And once that was done, he still stated that he couldn\u2019t hear, and there was a lot of noise due to the, the ambulance and all the other vehicles on scene, so I transported him to our station, the Elkton Police Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">The handcuffs were removed and we placed him in the book-in interview room. I then re-initiated the Advice of Rights and proceeded with the same. During that process he was uncooperative stating several times I\u2019m not listening to you until I speak with my lawyer, and advised that he was required to complete \u2014 I advised that he was required to complete the Advice of Rights and Request Consent or refusal from him. Upon finishing that, I requested that he consent \u2014 the consent or refusal to take the test, and he stated very abrasively that he wasn\u2019t going to check it, take the test. I checked the refusal box and advised him to sign the bottom admitting his refusal and consenting to the refusal. That was checked. He continued to be uncooperative stating he wasn\u2019t signing anything; therefore he was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>a holding cell at our police department until paperwork was completed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The administrative law judge also received and considered the DR-15 Form, signed by Carpenter, indicating his understanding that his refusal to submit to a chemical breath test would result in a suspension of his driver\u2019s license pursuant to Section 16-205.1.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Carpenter\u2019s counsel then made a motion that no action be taken, arguing that Officer Pirritano lacked reasonable grounds to believe that Carpenter was driving while under the influence of alcohol because no one testified that he was the driver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">At this point, I am going to make a motion. I want the Court to take no action. And the reason, the basis for my motion is really fairly simple. I listened very carefully to the testimony of Officer [Pirritano]. And as the Court knows, the burden at this point, at least initially, is to show that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that my client was driving while under the influence of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">The officer clearly did not see the accident. The officer did not testify that any of the witnesses saw the defendant driving the motor vehicle. And the officer did not, at least apparently from her testimony, did not ask the question were you the driver of the motor vehicle. So you have Mr. Carpenter on the scene. You have a vehicle, I will concede; that is, she testified, I believe, that it was registered to him. But unfortunately, you don\u2019t \u2014 we\u2019re not in a situation where we have anybody that has testified to the fact that he was the driver of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Now, the next, I guess the next part of the analysis, then, technically, would be is there a reasonable inference from which you could derive that he was the driver of the vehicle. Well, I would suggest to you that the fact that he\u2019s on the scene himself could mean that he was the \u2014 at this point, without anything further, he could \u2014 you could just as easily infer that he was a passenger as you could that he was a driver. You know, it certainly would not have been difficult to have asked one of the witnesses to say was this gentleman the driver of the vehicle. But that is not apparent from the testimony we have in front of the Court today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">And you have to rely upon what\u2019s in the four corners of the testimony and the documents. And I would suggest at this point that there simply is, is no evidence from which you could deduce or infer that, in fact, he was driving, which is part of that reasonable, reasonable basis to believe that he was driving under the influence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The administrative law judge denied Carpenter\u2019s motion because the officer could reasonably infer that Carpenter was driving, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">We\u2019re not dealing with a court proceeding of beyond a reasonable doubt, it\u2019s just reasonable grounds. And I still think it gets into reasonable inference ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay2\">and in a written decision, the administrative law judge concluded that Officer Pirritano had reasonable grounds to believe Carpenter had been driving while intoxicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">FINDINGS OF FACT</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">After considering the evidence and testimony presented in this case, I find by preponderance of the evidence the following facts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">1) The police officer who stopped or detained Licensee had reasonable grounds to believe that Licensee was driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, drugs, a controlled dangerous substance, or any combination of the aforementioned, or in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of MD <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>CODE ANN., TRANSP. II \u00a7 16-813 based on the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\"><em>Stop/inquiry 5/23/10 for investigation of accident. Licensee a driver </em>* <em>2 officers involved </em>\u2014 OK <em>(McDorman/Bryant cases) Not shown bad faith witness information was considered</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">2) There was evidence of the use of alcohol, drugs, controlled dangerous substances, or any combination of the aforementioned based on the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\"><em>Strong odor of alcohol/mouthwash. Watery eyes </em>+ <em>slurred speech. Clues on same SFST (w </em>+ <em>s; OLS). Admitted drinking earlier.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-8\">OTHER FACTS [IF NEEDED]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-9\"><em>MVA Witness: Ofc Pirritano </em># <em>255 appeared</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD4\">* <em>Motion for No action: Not identified as driver. Reasonable inference of being the driver (officer\u2019s statements). Denied: Officer\u2019s testimony presented reasonable grounds to believe Licensee had been driving for refusal issue. Licensee declined to testify.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">Carpenter\u2019s driving privileges were suspended, for 120 days, but the administrative law judge stayed the suspension, provided Carpenter participate in the Ignition Interlock Program for 12 months, and disqualified Carpenter from driving a commercial vehicle for one year pursuant to Section 16-812 of the Transportation Article.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Carpenter then sought judicial review of the administrative law judge\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Cecil County. The Circuit Court found that the evidence was \u201creplete with indications\u201d that Carpenter had been drinking, but observed that the Officer Pirritano had not established that Carpenter had been drinking and driving:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">The evidence was that there was an accident between two vehicles; that one of the vehicles involved in the accident was registered to Mr. Carpenter, the appellant; and that Mr. Carpenter apparently was in the area of the accident at the time that the Officer encountered him. But as I\u2019ll mention in a minute, there is not evidence where that was, whether it was a block away from the accident or whether it was right up against the vehicle or inside the vehicle, or just where that was. But he was in the general vicinity of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The judge determined that, although there was a \u201c97 percent chance\u201d that Carpenter had driven his truck at the time of the accident, nonetheless, Officer Pirritano lacked reasonable grounds to believe that Carpenter was the driver, thereby reversing the suspension of Carpenter\u2019s license:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">Now, let me speak about the practical and what very likely the actuality is. In my opinion, just looking at this from a practical standpoint, there is probably about a 97 percent chance that Mr. Carpenter was driving the truck this day that wound up colliding with the small car. That\u2019s on the practical side. So the question is, is the record that is established before the hearing officer sufficient for ... [the officer] to decide whether or not there was a reasonable articulable suspicion that Mr. Carpenter was driving.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">So just with the fact that an accident happened, that the vehicle was registered to Mr. Carpenter, and that he was in the general area of the accident I don\u2019t find is enough. 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough reasonable grounds to show that he was driving the car. On the practical side, 97 percent chance that he was, but as far as the record is concerned, I don\u2019t think that there was enough.... I\u2019ll reverse the hearing officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Section 10-222 of the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Maryland Code (1984, 2009 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article, provides that a court, upon judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s decision may decide to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-10\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction 10 of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-11\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-12\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-13\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-14\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-15\">In <em>Maryland Aviation Administration v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005), Judge John C. Eldridge, writing for this Court, outlined the appropriate standard of review of an adjudicatory decision by an administrative agency, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afq\">A court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow; it \u201cis limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-16\">In applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides \u201cwhether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court \u201cmust review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence\u201d and to draw inferences from that evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-4\">Despite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to \u201csubstitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.\u201d Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajr\"><em>Id. </em>at 571-72, 873 A.2d at 1154-55 (footnote omitted) (citations omitted). In applying this standard, we review the decision of the administrative agency, rather than the determination of the lower court, and will defer to the administrative law judge\u2019s findings of fact and inferences drawn, insofar as supported by the record. <em>MVA v. Shea, </em>415 Md. 1, 17, 997 A.2d 768, 777 (2010) (\u201c[O]ur role is not to review the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment, but rather to review the decision of the ALJ____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Section 16-205.1 of the Transportation Article, also known as Maryland\u2019s Implied Consent Law,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> provides for the suspen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>sion of driving privileges when a driver refuses to submit to a chemical breath test for intoxication. Section 16-205.1(b)(2) defines the process an officer is to follow before requesting that a driver submit to a chemical breath test and requires that the officer have reasonable grounds to believe that the person has been driving or attempting to drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-5\">(2) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, if a police officer stops or detains any person who <em>the police officer has reasonable grounds to believe is or has been driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, </em>while impaired by alcohol, while so far impaired by any drug, any combination of drugs, or a combination of one or more drugs and alcohol that the person could not drive a vehicle safely, while impaired by a controlled dangerous substance, in violation of an alcohol restriction, or in violation of \u00a7 16-813 of this title, and who is not unconscious or otherwise incapable of refusing to take a test, the police officer shall:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">(i) Detain the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">(ii) Request that the person permit a test to be taken;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">(iii) Advise the person of the administrative sanctions that shall be imposed for test results indicating an alcohol concentration of at least 0.08 but less than 0.15 at the time of testing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">(iv) Advise the person of the administrative sanctions, including ineligibility for modification of a suspension or issuance of a restrictive license unless the person participates in the Ignition Interlock System Program under \u00a7 16-404.1 of this title, that shall be imposed for refusal to take the test and for test results indicating an alcohol concentration of 0.15 or more at the time of testing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>(v) Advise the person of the additional criminal penalties that may be imposed under \u00a7 27-101(x) of this article on conviction of a violation of \u00a7 21-902 of this article if the person knowingly refused to take a test arising out of the same circumstances as the violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The Motor Vehicle Administration contends that the administrative law judge was correct in concluding that Officer Pirritano had sufficient reasonable grounds to request that Carpenter take a breath test. Officer Pirritano\u2019s investigation following the accident, the Motor Vehicle Administration argues, yielded facts that, taken together, allowed her to reasonably infer that Carpenter had been driving the Ford truck, including: witness statements relaying that Carpenter\u2019s truck sped through a red light and hit another car, Carpenter\u2019s presence at the scene of the accident, and Carpenter\u2019s admission to Officer Pirritano that he had been traveling from Delaware to Elkton. According to the Motor Vehicle Administration, the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion reversing the suspension incorrectly interpreted \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to require that the arresting officer, or a witness interviewed at the scene, actually having witnessed Carpenter driving the Ford truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Carpenter, in support of the Circuit Court\u2019s decision, maintains that \u201creasonable grounds to believe [the arrestee] has been driving\u201d under Section 16-205.1(b)(2) requires that Carpenter be seen actually driving and the administrative law judge\u2019s \u201cdecision was clearly erroneous in light of the fact that no one identifies Mr. Carpenter as the driver of the vehicle and without that identification a determination cannot be made that there was reasonable grounds to believe he was driving or attempting to drive a vehicle under the influence of alcohol in violation of [Section] 16-205.1.\u201d In essence, Carpenter refutes an officer\u2019s ability to infer an individual\u2019s driving without an eyewitness, or, in the alternative, argues that in this particular case, Officer Pirritano\u2019s inference, based on her testimony, was not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Under Section 16-205.1, reasonable grounds to believe that an individual has been driving while intoxicated is \u201ca \u2018common sense, nontechnical conception that considers factual and practical aspects of daily life and how reasonable and prudent people act.\u2019 \u201d <em>MVA v. Shea, </em>415 Md. 1, 19, 997 A.2d 768, 778 (2010), quoting <em>Crosby v. State, </em>408 Md. 490, 507, 970 A.2d 894, 903-04 (2009); <em>see also MVA v. Shepard, </em>399 Md. 241, 258-59, 923 A.2d 100, 110 (2007) (concluding that \u201creasonable grounds\u201d equates to reasonable articulable suspicion, such that \u201cthe officer may take the evidence at face value and simply decide whether, if true, it leads to a reasonable belief that an offense has been committed\u201d). Reasonable grounds depends on the totality of the circumstances, including observations, statements of other witnesses and, most notably in this case, the reasonable inferences developed therefrom. <em>Shea, </em>415 Md. at 19, 997 A.2d at 778, citing <em>Crosby v. State, </em>408 Md. 490, 508, 970 A.2d 894, 904 (2009) (\u201cThe [reasonable suspicion standard] requires courts to give appropriate deference to the training and experience of the law enforcement officer and to the officer\u2019s ability to make reasonable inferences from his or her observations, based on that training and experience.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">The salient issue in this case is whether Officer Pirritano\u2019s inference that Carpenter was driving, based upon her observations at the scene of the accident, was reasonable. To be reasonable, an inference must be the application of \u201ccommon sense, powers of logic, and accumulated experiences in life to arrive at conclusions from demonstrated sets of facts.\u201d <em>Robinson v. State, </em>315 Md. 309, 318, 554 A.2d 395, 399 (1989). As we previously have recognized, \u201c \u2018[t]here are <em>few </em>facts, including even ultimate facts, that cannot be established by inference.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Walter, </em>407 Md. 670, 678, 967 A.2d 783, 788 (2009), quoting <em>Moore v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 36, 45, 533 A.2d 1, 5 (1987) (emphasis added). Judge Charles E. Moylan, Jr., writing for the Court of Special Appeals, similarly illustrated the commonality of drawing reasonable inferences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>From fact A, we infer fact B. From a confession, we infer guilt. From the pulling of a trigger, we infer an intent to harm. From the possession of recently stolen goods, we infer the theft.
