The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\u201d Elroy Matthews, Jr., Petitioner, invoked Rule 4-345(a) to challenge the legality of the sentence he received following his plea of guilty to certain charges, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, as part of a plea agreement. Petitioner argued that the sentence was illegal because it exceeded the sentence to which the court had bound itself. The Circuit Court denied the motion without a hearing, and Petitioner appealed. The Court of Special Appeals held that a challenge to the legality of a sentence on the ground that it violates a binding term of a plea agreement is not cognizable under Rule 4-345(a) and, even if it were, the sentence Petitioner received was not illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">For the reasons that follow, we hold that Rule 4-345(a) is an appropriate vehicle for challenging a sentence that is imposed in violation of a plea agreement to which the sentencing court bound itself. We further hold that the sentence Petitioner is serving is illegal because it exceeds the sentencing \u201ccap\u201d to which the Circuit Court agreed to be bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">Petitioner entered a plea of guilty to charges of attempted first-degree murder, two counts of first-degree assault, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>unlawful use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence. In exchange for that guilty plea, the State agreed to: (1) enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>to the remaining counts with which Petitioner was charged in that case; (2) enter a <em>nolle 'prosequi </em>to the charges in a related case; and (3) argue, with respect to the charges to which Petitioner was pleading guilty, \u201cfor incarceration within the \u2014 to the top of the guidelines range ...[,] twenty-three to forty-three years.\u201d The State added that it would \u201cbe asking for incarceration of forty-three years.... That cap is a cap as to actual and immediate incarceration at the time of initial disposition.\u201d The sentencing court stated that it \u201cagreed to cap any sentence.\u201d In addition, the court advised Petitioner that \u201ctheoretically I can give you anything from the mandatory minimum on the one count, which is five years without parole, up to the maximum of life imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">At the sentencing proceeding several months later, the State asked the court to \u201cimpose a sentence of life imprisonment, suspend all but forty-three years of that.\u201d Petitioner requested \u201ca split sentence and a substantial period of incarceration\u201d and argued that \u201cten years is appropriate.\u201d The court sentenced Petitioner on the lead count of attempted first-degree murder to life imprisonment, with all but thirty years suspended, with concurrent sentences of twenty-five years for each of the two assault charges, and twenty years, with a mandatory five-year minimum, for the handgun charge. Petitioner thereby received a total sentence of life imprisonment, with thirty years of it as executed time.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\n<em>The postconviction proceeding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Approximately eighteen months later, Petitioner filed a petition for postconviction relief, followed by an amended petition nearly twenty months later. The amended petition asserted ineffective assistance of counsel for, <em>inter alia, </em>failing to object to the State\u2019s breach of the plea agreement in requesting a life sentence with all but forty-three years suspended, instead of a total sentence of forty-three years, inclusive of any suspended portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The postconviction court, evidently having reviewed the transcript of the plea hearing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> made a finding that the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney had said at the plea proceeding that he would recommend \u201cforty-three years,\u201d but then, at sentencing, breached that term of the agreement by recommending \u201clife imprisonment, suspend all but forty-three years.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The post-conviction court therefore concluded that Petitioner was deprived of the benefit of his bargain. Evidently the parties did not raise, and the postconviction court did not address, what the sentencing court meant by stating at the plea hearing that it had bound itself to \u201ccap\u201d the sentence. The postconviction court nonetheless stated in the order that the plea agreement was \u201cnot presented as a binding plea under Rule 4~243(c)<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark>, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>[so] the trial court upon resentencing shall be free to impose whatever sentence it feels appropriate.\u201d The postconviction court issued an order granting Petitioner a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\n<em>The Re-sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">As is customary, the original sentencing judge presided at the re-sentencing. The Assistant State\u2019s Attorney informed the sentencing judge that the postconviction court had \u201cultimately determined that when I [the State] said \u2018Life suspend all but forty-three\u2019 as opposed to \u2018forty-three,\u2019 that somehow breached the plea agreement that had been reached.\u201d The State added that the postconviction court\u2019s ruling had no bearing on the legality of the sentence the court originally imposed. The State argued that the sentencing court could \u201cturn around and impose the same very sentence that you imposed before and there would be nothing unlawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Petitioner disagreed with the State\u2019s understanding of the import of the postconviction court\u2019s ruling. Petitioner, represented by counsel, argued that the court was bound at re-sentencing not to exceed a total sentence of forty-three years, with no more than thirty years of executed time. Petitioner reasoned that the court had indicated at the plea hearing that it would \u201ccap any sentence\u201d in response to the State\u2019s representation that the guidelines range was \u201ctwenty-three to forty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>three years\u201d and the State would \u201cargue for the top.\u201d Further, the State\u2019s agreement to recommend \u201cforty-three years\u201d was intertwined inextricably with the court\u2019s stated agreement at the plea hearing to \u201ccap\u201d Petitioner\u2019s sentence. And, given that the postconviction court granted Petitioner a new sentencing proceeding because the State had breached the plea agreement by recommending life imprisonment, suspend all but forty-three years, it necessarily followed that the court\u2019s sentence of life, all but thirty years suspended, was likewise illegal in that it violated the agreed-upon \u201ccap\u201d of forty three years of both executed and un-executed time. Finally, because the court\u2019s original sentence contained only thirty years of executed time, the new sentence, capped at a total of forty-three years, could not contain more than thirty years of executed time.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The court re-imposed the original sentence of life, suspend all but thirty years, on the lead count of attempted murder, with concurrent sentences on each of the remaining three counts. The court explained why it believed it could reimpose that sentence: \u201c[T]he Court is of the opinion I was clear at the time I accepted this individual\u2019s plea, I was clear at the time I sentenced this individual, and that the sentence in this case that I could give [Petitioner] would be life on the first count suspend all but thirty years----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Petitioner thereafter filed, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(a), the \u201cMotion to Correct Illegal Sentence\u201d that is the subject of the present appeal. We have mentioned that the motion was denied without a hearing, and Petitioner appealed. <em>See State v. Wilkins, </em>393 Md. 269, 273, 900 A.2d 765, 767 (2006) (noting that the denial of a motion to correct an illegal sentence is an appealable final order).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\n<em>The Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">On appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Petitioner supported his argument that his sentence was illegal with two recently decided cases from this Court, <em>Cuffley v. State, </em>416 Md. 568, 7 A.3d 557 (2010), and <em>Baines v. State, </em>416 Md. 604, 7 A.3d 578 (2010). In those cases, about which we shall say <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>more <em>infra, </em>we held that, when the record of a plea proceeding reflects that a defendant reasonably could have understood that the sentencing court agreed to be bound to a certain maximum sentence, inclusive of any suspended portion, then the court that imposes a sentence in excess of that maximum breaches the plea agreement. In that circumstance, the original sentence is illegal and the court must re-sentence the defendant, if that is the defendant\u2019s wish, in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement. <em>See Cuffley, </em>416 Md. at 586, 7 A.3d at 567; <em>Baines, </em>416 Md. at 620, 7 A.3d at 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The State responded that Petitioner\u2019s new sentence was not illegal. The State also argued preliminarily that Petitioner\u2019s challenge could not be presented by way of a Rule 4-345(a) motion to correct an illegal sentence. The State asserted that Rule 4-345(a) is not a proper vehicle for raising the type of sentencing illegality that Petitioner was claiming.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The Court of Special Appeals agreed with both of the State\u2019s contentions and affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court. <em>Matthews v. State, </em>197 Md.App. 365, 387, 13 A.3d 834, 847 (2011). The intermediate appellate court held that Petitioner\u2019s challenge failed at the threshold because his claim that the sentence violated the plea agreement was not cognizable under Rule 4-345(a). 197 Md.App. at 375, 13 A.3d at 840. That court further held that, in any case, the sentence was not illegal. <em>Id. </em>at 378, 13 A.3d at 841. On that score, the Court of Special Appeals saw the pertinent question as whether the sentencing court \u201ccomplied with the mandate of [the postconviction court]\u201d to impose whatever sentence the court deemed appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at 386-87, 13 A.3d at 847. The Court of Special Appeals concluded that life imprisonment with all but thirty years suspended was a legal (and appropriate) sentence for an individual guilty of attempted murder in the first degree. <em>Id. </em>at 387, 13 A.3d at 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, <em>Matthews v. State, </em>419 Md. 646, 20 A.3d 115 (2011), to consider the following question: \u201cWhether a plea agreement, conditioned on an agreed upon \u2018capped\u2019 term of years, results in an illegal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>sentence when the trial court sentences the Defendant to life, but suspends a portion of the life sentence to make the non-suspended portion not exceed the agreed upon \u2018cap\u2019?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\n<em>\u201cIllegal sentence\u201d under Rule 4-345(a)?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Implicit in the question Petitioner presents is the threshold question of whether his challenge to the sentence the court re-imposed following the grant of postconviction relief is cognizable under Rule 4-345(a). We have noted that, in the view of the Court of Special Appeals, the answer to that question is \u201cno.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we hold that the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">Petitioner and the State disagree about the meaning of our prior decisions on the issue. Both recognize that Rule 4-345(a) provides a means to seek correction of an illegal sentence whenever the illegality \u201cinhere[s] in the sentence itself.\u201d The parties are at odds, though, as to what is included within the meaning of an illegality that \u201cinheres\u201d in the sentence. Petitioner asserts that our recent decisions make clear that sentences in excess of binding plea agreements are illegal and therefore may be challenged pursuant to Rule 4-345(a). The State counters that prior caselaw stringently limits the category of sentences that may be deemed \u201cillegal\u201d under Rule 4-345(a) to those that either exceed the statutory maximum or are imposed where no conviction was entered. We conclude that Petitioner presents the more accurate view of our caselaw interpreting Maryland Rule 4-345(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">To begin, we agree with Petitioner and the State, as well as the Court of Special Appeals in its opinion in this case, Matthews, 197 Md.App. at 375, 13 A.3d at 840, that, for purposes of Rule 4-345(a), the illegality must inhere in the sentence itself, rather than stem from trial court error during the sentencing proceeding. <em>See, e.g., Montgomery v. State, </em>405 Md. 67, 74-75, 950 A.2d 77, 82 (2008) (\u201cA motion to correct an illegal sentence ordinarily can be granted only where there is some illegality in the sentence itself or where no sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>should have been imposed. On the other hand, a trial court error during the sentencing proceeding is not ordinarily cognizable under Rule 4-345(a) where the resulting sentence or sanction is itself lawful.\u201d (quotation mark and citations omitted)); <em>Randall Book Corp. v. State, </em>316 Md. 315, 322-23, 558 A.2d 715, 719 (1989) (explaining that \u201cwhether the trial judge was motivated by ... impermissible considerations in imposing sentence will be considered on direct appeal. However, while improper motivation may justify vacation of the sentence, it does not render the sentence illegal within the meaning of Rule 4-345\u201d (citations omitted)). <em>Accord Tshiwala v. State, </em>424 Md. 612, 616-21, 37 A.3d 308, 310-13, 2012 WL 171345 (2012) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">We have also made clear that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">[i]f a sentence is \u201cillegal\u201d within the meaning of [Rule 4-345(a) ], the defendant may file a motion in the trial correct to \u201ccorrect\u201d it, notwithstanding that (1) no objection was made when the sentence was imposed, (2) the defendant purported to consent to it, or (3) the sentence was not challenged in a timely-filed direct appeal. That is the thrust of <em>Walczak [v. State, </em>302 Md. 422, 488 A.2d 949 (1985) ], <em>Goff [v. State, </em>387 Md. 327, 875 A.2d 132 (2005) ], and a dozen other cases. The sentence may be attacked on direct appeal, but it also may be challenged collaterally and belatedly, and, if the trial court denies relief in response to such a challenge, the defendant may appeal from that denial and obtain relief in an appellate court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-7\"><em>Chaney v. State, </em>397 Md. 460, 466, 918 A.2d 506, 509 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Consistent with the distinction between illegal sentences that are cognizable under Rule 4-345(a) and those that are not, we have denied relief pursuant to Rule 4-345(a) because the sentences imposed were not inherently illegal, despite some form of error or alleged injustice. <em>See, e.g., Pollard v. State, </em>394 Md. 40, 47, 904 A.2d 500, 504 (2006) (holding that the trial judge\u2019s failure to exercise discretion in sentencing did not render substantively illegal the life sentence imposed); <em>Wilkins, </em>393 Md. at 272, 900 A.2d at 767 (holding same); <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number><em>v. Kanaras, 357 </em>Md. 170, 185, 742 A.2d 508, 517 (1999) (holding that a sentence was not illegal when the Parole Commission\u2019s actions had the effect of denying the inmate parole consideration to which he was statutorily entitled because the illegality was in the Parole Commission\u2019s conduct, not in the sentence). <em>See also Chaney, </em>397 Md. at 465-68, 918 A.2d at 509-511 (concluding that probation conditions were permissible and not inherently illegal; therefore, a challenge to the condition could be waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">We have deemed sentences inherently \u201cillegal\u201d pursuant to Rule 4-345(a) when the sentences exceeded the limits imposed by law, be it statute or rule. <em>See, e.g., Solorzano v. State, </em>397 Md. 661, 672-74, 919 A.2d 652, 658-59 (2007) (holding that the defendant was entitled to vacatur of the sentence and re-sentencing in conformance with the sentencing term of the plea agreement because the trial court had accepted the terms of the defendant\u2019s plea agreement, the defendant relied on that acceptance in pleading guilty, and the trial court had refused to correct the sentence in accordance with the plea agreement pursuant to a Rule 4-345(a) motion); <em>Walczak, </em>302 Md. at 433, 488 A.2d at 954 (holding that a condition of probation to pay restitution in connection with a crime of which the defendant was not convicted was illegal in that it exceeded the statutory authority to impose a requirement of restitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">We have said that the State, as well as the Court of Special Appeals, <em>see Matthews, </em>197 Md.App. at 375, 13 A.3d at 840, are of the view that a sentence that exceeds the sentence agreed upon as part of a binding plea agreement is not cognizable under Rule 4-345(a). To our knowledge, we have not had the occasion before now to respond directly to a fully briefed argument to that effect. So, we make clear with this opinion what we believe to be strongly suggested by our opinion in <em>Solorzano, </em>and stated more plainly in <em>Cuffley, </em>that such an illegal sentence is cognizable under Rule 4-345(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">In <em>Solorzano, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty to attempted murder and, in exchange, the State agreed to \u201cbind itself to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>the top of the guidelines, ... believed to be twelve to twenty years.\u201d 397 Md. at 664, 919 A.2d at 654 (quotation mark omitted). The court accepted the plea based on the anticipated guidelines range, found Solorzano guilty, and ordered a pre-sentence report, which confirmed the guidelines range of twelve to twenty years. <em>Id. </em>at 665, 919 A.2d at 655. At sentencing, however, the court indicated that \u201c[t]he State has agreed not to recommend more than twenty years ... but the Court is not bound to that recommendation and could in fact sentence up to life in prison.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 666, 919 A.2d at 655. After sentencing, Solorzano filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence and a motion to vacate his guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at 667, 919 A.2d at 655. The sentencing court denied both motions. <em>Id., </em>919 A.2d at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">We recognized that, although Rule 4-243(c)(1) imposes upon \u201ca trial court ... no obligation to accept any particular sentence agreed upon by the State and a defendant,\u201d Rule 4-243(c)(3) requires the trial court, if it has approved the agreement, to \u201cfulfill the terms of that agreement if the defendant pled guilty in reliance on the court\u2019s acceptance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 669-70, 919 A.2d at 657. Applying the dictates of Rule 4-243, we held that the trial court had accepted the plea agreement and Solorzano was entitled to specific performance of it. <em>Id. </em>at 670, 919 A.2d at 657. We recognized, in addition to the requirements of Rule 4-243, that, \u201c[o]nce a defendant enters a guilty plea and the plea is accepted by the court, due process requires the plea bargain be honored.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 673, 919 A.2d at 659 (citing <em>Santobello v. New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 262, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971)). Relevant to the issue we consider here, we gave no indication that the sentence imposed in breach of the binding plea agreement could not have been corrected by review of the court\u2019s denial of Solorzano\u2019s Rule 4-345(a) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Consistent with the holding of <em>Solorzano, </em>and more directly on point with the case at bar, is our decision in <em>Cuffley. </em>In <em>CMffley </em>we considered \u201cwhether ... a judge who agrees to be bound to the terms of a plea agreement that calls for a sentence \u2018within the guidelines\u2019 may impose a sentence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>involves a term of incarceration that exceeds the guidelines but suspends all but the part of the sentence that falls within the guidelines.\u201d 416 Md. at 573, 7 A.3d at 560. Cuffley pleaded guilty to robbery pursuant to a plea agreement that the State would \u201crecommend a sentence within the guidelines ... [of] four to eight years.\u201d <em>Id., </em>416 Md. 568, 7 A.3d at 560. The trial court repeated its understanding of the agreement, that the court would \u201cimpose a sentence somewhere within the guidelines. The guidelines in this case are four to eight years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 7 A.3d at 560. The court ensured that defendant\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary and then accepted the plea agreement and bound itself to its terms. <em>Id., </em>7 A.3d at 560. At the sentencing hearing, the court imposed a sentence of fifteen years, suspend all but six. <em>Id., </em>7 A.3d at 560.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Several years later, Cuffley filed a motion pursuant to Rule 4-345(a) to correct what he believed was a sentence that violated the sentencing cap to which the court had bound itself. <em>Id. </em>at 574-75, 7 A.3d at 561. The sentencing court denied the motion, reasoning that \u201csuspended time and conditions of probation are within [the court\u2019s] discretion,\u201d and the court\u2019s discretionary powers were \u201calluded to ... even if not specifically stated on the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576, 7 A.3d at 561 (first alteration in original). We disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Analyzing Rule 4-243(c), which mandates that a court that has accepted and approved a plea agreement <em>\u201cshall </em>embody in the judgment the agreed sentence\u201d <em>id. </em>at 581, 7 A.3d at 565, we explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">by its express terms, Rule 4-243 requires strict compliance with its provisions. We further conclude, as the natural consequence of requiring strict compliance with the Rule, that any question that later arises concerning the meaning of the sentencing term of a binding plea agreement must be resolved by resort <em>solely </em>to the record established at the Rule 4-243 plea proceeding. The record of that proceeding must be examined to ascertain precisely what was presented to the court, in the defendant\u2019s presence and before the court accepts the agreement, to determine what the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>dant reasonably understood to be the sentence the parties negotiated and the court agreed to impose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 582, 7 A.3d at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Applying that rule to Cuffley\u2019s plea agreement, we concluded that a lay person in Cuffley\u2019s position would not reasonably have understood the plea agreement term of \u201cwithin the guidelines\u201d to include a suspended portion beyond the four to eight years. <em>Id. </em>at 585, 7 A.3d at 567. Ultimately, we held that \u201cthe court breached the agreement by imposing a sentence that exceeded a total of eight years\u2019 incarceration\u201d; therefore, the sentence was illegal. <em>Id. </em>at 586, 7 A.3d at 567. We viewed the illegality as inhering in the sentence itself;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the sentence, in other words, was not merely the product of procedural or trial court error. Consequently, \u201cthe Circuit Court should have corrected it to conform to a sentence for which Petitioner bargained and upon which he relied in pleading guilty.\u201d <em>Id., </em>7 A.3d at 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Court of Special Appeals concluded that, because the issue was not addressed specifically in our opinion in <em>Cuffley, </em>that decision did not resolve conclusively whether Rule 4-345(a) is a proper vehicle through which to challenge a sentence imposed allegedly in excess of a binding plea agreement. 197 Md.App. at 375-77, 13 A.3d at 840-41. The intermediate appellate court reasoned further that, if so interpreted, <em>Cttffley </em>would \u201coverrule the rationale that permeates [prior caselaw].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 376, 13 A.3d at 840-41. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\"><em>Cuffley </em>adhered to our precedent limiting relief pursuant to Rule 4-345(a) to challenges to inherently illegal sentences. Cuffley\u2019s sentence was imposed in violation of Rule 4-243(c), which by operation of its terms establishes the maximum sentence a court lawfully can impose after approving a plea agreement. Because Cuffley\u2019s sentence exceeded the maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>mum sentence the court had bound itself to impose, the sentence was not merely the product of procedural error; rather it was inherently illegal and thereby subject to correction under Rule 4-345(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\"><em>Cuffley </em>adds further judicial gloss to the concept we recognized in <em>Dotson v. State, </em>321 Md. 515, 583 A.2d 710 (1991). <em>Dotson </em>came to this Court as an appeal of a sentence imposed by a review panel. <em>Id. </em>at 521, 583 A.2d at 713. Dotson had pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, to two counts for which the State agreed it would recommend a maximum total sentence of 18 years. <em>Id. </em>at 519, 583 A.2d at 712. \u201c[T]he court agreed that ... the total sentence imposed would be 15 years.\u201d <em>Id., </em>583 A.2d at 712. After the court imposed a sentence of 15 years for each conviction, the sentences to run concurrently, Dotson sought panel review. <em>Id. </em>at 520, 583 A.2d at 712. The review panel \u201cvacated the sentence ... and imposed a sentence of 15 years on each conviction to run consecutively rather than concurrently.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 521, 583 A.2d at 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">It was in that context that we held illegal the sentence imposed by the panel. <em>Id. </em>at 524, 583 A.2d at 714. The court had accepted Dotson\u2019s guilty pleas and bound itself to impose no more than 15 years. <em>Id. </em>at 524, 583 A.2d at 714. The length of sentence to which the court had bound itself became the \u201cmaximum permissible sentence\u201d and the subsequent increase, therefore, was illegal. <em>Id., </em>583 A.2d at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In short, we held in <em>Dotson </em>that, although generally the legislature determines the maximum sentence allowable by law, once a judge accepts a plea agreement, \u201cthe judge [is] required under the dictate of Rule 4-243(c)(3) to embody in the judgment the agreed sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 583 A.2d at 714. Pertinent here, we emphasized in <em>Dotson </em>that, because the Maryland Rules \u201chave the force of law,\u201d the maximum sentence \u201callowable by law\u201d was dictated by the plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 523, 583 A.2d at 714. We concluded that \u201c[Dotson\u2019s] plea agreement fixed the maximum sentence allowable by law\u201d and, because a review panel thereafter im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>posed a sentence in excess of the plea agreement, the sentence was illegal. <em>Id. </em>at 524, 588 A.2d at 714. As explained <em>supra, </em>that <em>Dotson </em>arrived in this Court via an appeal of the sentence imposed by a panel review, as opposed to a Rule 4-345(a) motion, does not undermine the applicability of its holding to the latter context.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">We repeat what at this point should be self-evident: whether a sentence illegality is cognizable under Rule 4-345(a) depends <em>solely </em>on whether the illegality inheres in the sentence itself, and <em>not </em>on the timing of the claim of illegality or the procedural posture of the case. If the sentence is inherently illegal, then correction of the illegality can be done by way of a motion brought pursuant to Rule 4-345(a). And, again to be clear, a sentence imposed in violation of the maximum sentence identified in a binding plea agreement and thereby \u201cfixed\u201d by that agreement as \u201cthe maximum sentence allowable by law,\u201d is, as we held in <em>Dotson, </em>an inherently illegal sentence. 321 Md. at 524, 583 A.2d at 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Before leaving our discussion of this issue, we address the State\u2019s concern regarding the finality of conviction, despite precedent recognizing that Rule 4-345(a) creates an exception to finality. <em>See State v. Griffiths, </em>338 Md. 485, 496, 659 A.2d 876, 882 (1995) (\u201cThis Rule [4-345(a) ] creates a limited exception to the general rule of finality, and sanctions a method of opening a judgment otherwise final and beyond the reach of the court.\u201d). The State argues that permitting a Rule 4-345(a) challenge to a sentence imposed allegedly in excess of a plea agreement \u201cruns afoul of the principles of \u2018finality and cloture\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Matthews, </em>197 Md.App. at 375, 13 A.3d at 840), because \u201ca claim by the defendant is the exclusive trigger for consideration of whether a sentence violates the terms of a plea agreement.\u201d This is so, the State asserts, because,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">unlike where a sentence is illegal because it is in excess of that allowed by statute, or where it is cruel or unusual, or where one should not have been imposed at all, all of which are transparent and obvious claims ... only a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>knows whether he or she has been sentenced in conformity with what he objectively and reasonably believed to be the terms of his plea agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">This assertion by the State reveals a misreading of <em>Cuffley. </em>What a defendant \u201creasonably believe[s]\u201d to be the maximum sentence bargained for and to which the court agreed to be bound is ascertained by application of an objective test. We explained in <em>Cuffley:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">The test for determining what the defendant reasonably understood at the time of the plea is an objective one. <em>It depends not on what the defendant actually understood the agreement to mean, </em>but rather, on what a reasonable lay person in the defendant\u2019s position and unaware of the niceties of sentencing law would have understood the agreement to mean, based on the record developed at the plea proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">416 Md. at 582, 7 A.3d at 565 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">It remains for us to consider whether the record of Petitioner\u2019s plea hearing demonstrates that the trial court bound itself to the agreement, and, if so, whether the agreement allowed the court to impose a suspended sentence in excess of the upper limit of the guidelines, forty-three years. We make an independent determination of whether the trial court breached the terms of Petitioner\u2019s plea agreement. <em>See Cuffley, </em>416 Md. at 581, 7 A.3d at 564. We do that by resort solely to the record of the plea hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">[A]ny question that later arises concerning the meaning of the sentencing term of a binding plea agreement must be resolved by resort <em>solely </em>to the record established at the Rule 4-243 plea proceeding. The record of that proceeding must be examined to ascertain precisely what was presented to the court, in the defendant\u2019s presence and before the court accepts the agreement, to determine what the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>dant reasonably understood to be the sentence the parties negotiated and the court agreed to impose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 582, 7 A.3d at 565. And, as we have mentioned, \u201c[t]he test for determining what the defendant reasonably understood at the time of the plea is an objective one,\u201d dependent \u201cnot on what the defendant actually understood the agreement to mean, but rather, on what a reasonable lay person in the defendant\u2019s position and unaware of the niceties of sentencing law would have understood the agreement to mean, based on the record developed at the plea proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 7 A.3d at 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Petitioner asserts that a reasonable defendant would have understood the trial court\u2019s agreement to \u201ccap\u201d the sentence to mean that the trial court had bound itself to a maximum total sentence at the upper limit of the guidelines, forty-three years. The State counters that the trial court only bound itself to \u201cforty-three years to be served,\u201d and any suspended portion of the sentence remained within the trial court\u2019s authority. This is evident, the State asserts, from the trial court\u2019s advisement to Petitioner that \u201ctheoretically I can give you anything from the mandatory minimum ... up to the maximum of life imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The following colloquy took place at Petitioner\u2019s plea hearing on December 3, 2003:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY: ... There have been plea negotiations in case ending in 2799 which are as follows: The State is going to call count one of the criminal information charging this defendant with attempted first-degree murder of Christine Davis, count five charging the Defendant with first-degree assault of Leroy Jackson, count six charging the Defendant with first-degree assault of Marvin Davis, and count eleven charging this defendant with unlawful use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">The Defendant will tender a guilty plea to each of those counts. In return for the Defendant\u2019s guilty pleas, the State, upon a finding of guilt, has agreed to enter a nol pros ... as to the balance of all remaining counts.

Defense counsel is free to argue for whatever disposition they deem appropriate. That cap is a cap as to actual and immediate incarceration at the time of initial disposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">Prior to disposition, the State and the Defense are asking the Court to order a presentence investigation, to order a presentence psychiatric report, and to schedule the matter for approximately one-half day so testimony and argument may be presented to the Court at the appropriate time. THE COURT: [Defense Counsel] is that your understanding as well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">[Defense Counsel]: Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">[Defense Counsel]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\">And you understand that, Mr. Matthews; is that correct, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-11\">THE DEFENDANT: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-12\">THE COURT: You are entering a guilty plea to the first count of attempted first-degree murder, that carries up to life imprisonment; count five, first-degree assault, carries up to twenty years; count six, first-degree assault, that carries up to twenty-five years; count eleven, use of a handgun in a crime of violence, that carries twenty years with a mandatory minimum of five without parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-13\">Your guidelines are twenty-three to forty-three years. The State is asking for a sentence of forty-three years to be served. The Court has agreed to cap any sentence and your defense attorneys are free to argue. And theoretically I can give you anything from the mandatory minimum on the one count, which is five years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>without parole, up to the maximum of life imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">Do you understand what the plea agreement is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-6\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">(Emphasis added.) The Court questioned Petitioner, satisfied itself that the pleas were \u201cknowingly, voluntarily and intelligently given,\u201d and accepted Petitioner\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">In both <em>Cuffley </em>and <em>Baines, </em>filed on the same day, we considered whether a defendant reasonably would understand a sentence \u201cwithin the guidelines,\u201d with no further explication, to mean that the trial court had bound itself to impose a total sentence that would include both the non-suspended and suspended, if any, portions. 416 Md. at 585-86, 7 A.3d at 567, 416 Md. at 620, 7 A.3d at 588. We concluded that the record of the plea hearing in each of those cases plainly supported that a reasonable lay defendant would not have understood the agreement to allow the trial court to impose a suspended sentence beyond the upper limit of the guidelines range. <em>Cuffley, </em>416 Md. at 585-86, 7 A.3d at 567, <em>Baines, </em>416 Md. at 620, 7 A.3d at 588. In both cases, we further concluded that, even if the sentencing terms, as expressed at the plea hearings, were ambiguous, the ambiguities must be resolved in the defendants\u2019 favor. <em>Cuffley, </em>416 Md. at 586, 7 A.3d at 567; <em>Baines, </em>416 Md. at 620, 7 A.3d at 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">The State and Petitioner agree that the court bound itself to the agreed-upon sentencing \u201ccap,\u201d but they disagree about what was contemplated by the cap. The State argues that the court agreed only to cap the sentence at forty-three years of executed time, excluding any suspended time. Petitioner argues that there is some ambiguity in that regard and, by application of our decisions in <em>Cuffley </em>and <em>Baines, </em>any ambiguity must be resolved in Petitioner\u2019s favor. For the reasons that follow, we agree that the record of the plea hearing is ambiguous on this point and the ambiguity must be resolved in favor of Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">The State said that it \u201cwould be arguing within the \u2014 to the top of the guidelines range,\u201d and \u201c[t]he guidelines range is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>twenty-to forty-three years.\u201d The State also said that it would be arguing for incarceration of forty-three years, and the \u201ccap is a cap as to actual and immediate incarceration at the time of initial disposition.\u201d The court then added: \u201cYour guidelines are twenty-three to forty-three years. The State is asking for a sentence of forty-three years to be served. The Court has agreed to cap any sentence and your defense attorneys are free to argue. And theoretically I can give you anything from the mandatory minimum on the one count, which is five years without parole, up to the maximum of life imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The State\u2019s averments that it would \u201cbe arguing to the top of the guidelines range,\u201d \u201cbe asking for incarceration of forty-three years,\u201d and \u201cthat cap is a cap as to actual and immediate incarceration\u201d may well have been clear to the State, defense counsel and the court. But the record of the plea hearing does not persuade us that Petitioner \u201creasonably understood\u201d (as that phrase is explicated in <em>Cuffley) </em>the maximum agreed-upon sentence to be. No one mentioned, much less explained to Petitioner on the record, that a sentence greater than the forty-three year \u201ccap\u201d could be imposed, with a suspended portion of the sentence in excess of those forty-three years. Neither did the State, defense counsel, or the court explain for the record that the words \u201cguidelines range\u201d referred solely to executed time. We grant the possibility that a lay defendant might reasonably understand the phrase \u201cactual and immediate incarceration\u201d to include only the non-suspended portion of a sentence because a defendant might never serve the suspended portion. Yet, it is also possible that a lay defendant who, as in the case at bar, has just heard the State inform the court that it would be \u201casking for incarceration within the guidelines\u201d might reasonably understand the State to be referring to the total years of incarceration to which the defendant would be exposed, including any suspended portion.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The trial court\u2019s statements concerning the sentence cap embodied in the agreement, when viewed through the prism of the objectively reasonable lay defendant, did not resolve the ambiguity. The court, after \u201cagreeing to cap any sentence,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>explained to Petitioner that \u201ctheoretically I can give you anything from the mandatory minimum on the one count, which is five years without parole, up to the maximum of life imprisonment.\u201d The court did not explain that the cap to which it agreed to be bound concerned only a non-suspended portion of the sentence. And the court\u2019s explanation of what \u201ctheoretically\u201d could be imposed as the sentence did not add clarity to the court\u2019s statement that it would agree to the cap. If anything, the court\u2019s mention of the \u201ctheoretical! ]\u201d maximum sentence of life imprisonment, without clarification of the context in which that theoretical sentence was being mentioned, more likely confused further what already was unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We are left to conclude that the sentencing term of Petitioner\u2019s plea agreement, as placed on the record at the plea hearing, is ambiguous. The ambiguity, moreover, is reflected in the ruling of the postconviction judge. That judge determined that the prosecutor had breached the plea agreement because he had agreed to \u201cincarceration of forty-three years,\u201d but at sentencing argued for a sentence of life, suspend all but forty-three years. The postconviction judge\u2019s view of the sentencing term of the plea agreement supports our conclusion that a reasonable lay defendant in Petitioner\u2019s place would not have clearly understood what was contemplated by the agreed-upon sentence of \u201cincarceration of forty-three years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">The ambiguity we discern in the sentencing term of the plea agreement must be resolved in Petitioner\u2019s favor. Therefore, Petitioner is entitled to have the plea agreement enforced, based on the terms as he reasonably understood them to be: a maximum sentence, including any suspended portion, of forty-three years. The sentence he received at re-sentencing following the grant of postconviction relief exceeded that agreed-upon term, creating a substantive illegality that inheres in the sentence. We correct that illegality by directing vacatur of the sentence and remand of the case for a new sentencing proceeding. We agree with Petitioner that, at the resentencing proceeding, the court is bound not to exceed a total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>sentence of 43 years, with all but 30 years suspended.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 2006 Rep.
