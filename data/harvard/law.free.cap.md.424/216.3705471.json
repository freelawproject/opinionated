Allen has been drawn-out and contentious. Allen died in 2005; after much legal maneuvering, and scores of docket entries, the Orphans\u2019 Court for Dorchester County finally approved an account of his estate in 2009. Before personal representative Sharon J. Ritter (\u201cAppellee\u201d) would make the distribution under that account, she required that Roy Allen\u2019s children sign a document releasing her from liability related to her duties as personal representative. Roy Allen\u2019s daughter, Virginia Leitch, signed and returned the document, but his sons, Deane J. Allen and Robert L. Allen (\u201cAppellants\u201d), refused. The orphans\u2019 court then ordered Appellants to sign, but they again refused. They appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed the order of the orphans\u2019 court. <em>Allen v. Ritter, </em>196 Md.App. 617, 632, 10 A.3d 1183, 1191-92 (2010). We granted <em>certiorari. Allen v. Ritter, </em>419 Md. 646, 20 A.3d 115 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-12\">Considering the years of legal wrangling among the parties, we are asked to decide a relatively narrow issue. Appellants presented the following questions for our review, which we have summarized and restated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>1. Does Estates <em>&amp; </em>Trusts Section 9-111 allow a personal representative to obtain a release when he or she is acting pursuant to a court-approved distribution?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">2. Does an orphans\u2019 court have the authority to order legatees to sign releases when requested by a personal representative under Section 9-111?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">We shall hold that Section 9-111 entitles a personal representative to obtain a release when she requests one, and that an orphans\u2019 court may order heirs and legatees to sign such releases when requested. We shall affirm the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">STATEMENT OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Roy H. Allen died January 28, 2005, survived by three children, Virginia Leitch, Deane J. Allen, and Robert L. Allen. Since Roy Allen\u2019s death, the personal representative of his estate has shifted. First, Leitch was named personal representative in Roy Allen\u2019s will. Then, Leitch and Robert Allen were named co-personal representatives by the Orphans\u2019 Court for Dorchester County (\u201corphans\u2019 court\u201d). After ongoing estate disputes, the orphans\u2019 court removed Leitch and Robert Allen and named Sharon J. Ritter as personal representative on February 26, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Appellants continued to quarrel over Roy Allen\u2019s estate. The record reflects numerous actions by Appellants objecting to Appellee\u2019s handling of the estate. In an attempt to close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>the matter, Appellee filed a First and Final Administration Account (\u201cAccount\u201d) of Roy Allen\u2019s estate on September 17, 2008, in the orphans\u2019 court. Appellants excepted to portions of this Account, including attorney\u2019s fees to be paid to Appellee and health-care reimbursement costs borne by Leitch. Despite these exceptions, the orphans\u2019 court approved the Account on May 5, 2009, as filed by Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In a June 10 letter that year, Appellee mailed a request to Appellants that they sign a release before Appellee would distribute money to them. The release read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">That the undersigned, Robert Allen, hereby acknowledges to have received from Sharon J. Ritter, Personal Representative of the Estate of Roy Harry Allen, deceased, being in full satisfaction of the distribution to the undersigned, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">Cash: $71,273.76</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">and in consideration thereof the undersigned does hereby release, acquit, exonerate and discharge the said Sharon J. Ritter, Personal Representative, as aforesaid, her heirs, executors and administrators of and from all and every action, suit, claim or demand which could or might possibly be brought, exhibited or prosecuted against her, for or on account of her duties as Personal Representative of said estate, arising from or in any way related to the administration thereof, and on account of such distribution, or any part thereof, hereby declaring myself fully satisfied, contented, and paid, as above specified. I do hereby verify and affirm under the penalties of perjury that I executed the foregoing Release for the purposes therein contained.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">Appellants did not sign the releases. Responding to the June 10 letter, Appellants\u2019 attorney inquired what law required his clients to sign the releases. Appellants\u2019 attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>was concerned that Appellants could face a lawsuit from Leiteh on a related matter, and stated that they were \u201cnot going to foreclose any recourse they may have against anyone else in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In an attempt to assuage Appellants\u2019 concerns about a potential lawsuit, Leitch\u2019s attorney sent a letter to Appellants on July 21, 2009, stating that Leiteh did not intend to pursue legal action against Appellants. He also observed that Leiteh was barred from raising such claims and that \u201cthe appeal time [had] elapsed.\u201d Regardless, Appellants still did not sign the releases.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Appellee then filed a petition for release, asking the orphans\u2019 court to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">enter an Order requiring [Appellants] to show cause why they should not be ordered to sign the Releases prior to distribution of estate funds from the Personal Representative and further, Order that all Orders issued by this Court pertaining to all matters raised during the administration of this estate are binding and further, since the time for appeals has passed, that such Orders have been issued with prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">To support this petition, Appellee cited Section 9-111 of Maryland\u2019s Estates <em>&amp; </em>Trusts Article. The petition said this section \u201cstates that a personal representative may obtain a release from an heir or legatee.\u201d The full language of that section reads: \u201cUpon making a distribution, a personal representative may, but is not required to, obtain a verified release from the heir or legatee.\u201d Md.Code (1974, 2011 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-111 of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article. Appellee reiterated her desire to \u201cexercise this right\u201d and that she would \u201cnot distribute without a Release signed by\u201d Appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">On September 29, 2009, the orphans\u2019 court ordered Appellants to show cause why they had not given Appellee a \u201cReceipt and Release regarding [their] distribution\u201d under Roy Allen\u2019s will. In their October 20, 2009, response to the court\u2019s order, Appellants argued that Appellee was not entitled to a release. They said the language in the release \u201cfar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>exceeds the scope of having made a distribution\u201d of the residuary estate. They argued that because the distribution was court-ordered, there was \u201cnothing to protect\u201d Appellee. And they concluded by arguing that Section 9-111 applies only to \u201ctangible property and not a cash distribution of a residuary estate,\u201d and accordingly, that \u201cSection 9-111 is not applicable to this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Appellee answered a week later, disputing Appellants\u2019 interpretation of the law. Appellee stated that \u201cSection 9-111 is a stand-alone provision allowing for the personal representative to obtain a release\u201d and disputed the assertion that Section 9-111 applies only to tangible property. Appellee further asked the orphans\u2019 court to order Appellants to sign the releases.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">After a further answer by Appellants, the orphans\u2019 court ordered Appellants on November 10, 2009, to sign the releases and return them to Appellee within two weeks. Appellants filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">Pursuant to \u00a7 9-111, a personal representative \u201cmay ... obtain\u201d a release from an hem or legatee. We hold that this language provides a personal representative with the right to require a release from a distributee. As such, [Appellee] had the right to require a release from the [Appellants] prior to making a distribution pursuant to the Final Account.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-9\"><em>Allen, </em>196 Md.App. at 632, 10 A.3d at 1191. The Court of Special Appeals also held that the orphans\u2019 court had the power to order Appellants to sign the releases, as such power was \u201cincident to the exercise of its powers to administer estates.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633, 10 A.3d at 1192. The court denied Appellants\u2019 motion for reconsideration on February 4, 2011, and we granted <em>certiorari </em>on May 20, 2011. <em>Allen, </em>419 Md. at 646, 20 A.3d at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">Pursuant to the questions presented by Appellants, we must interpret the meaning of Section 9-111 of the Estates &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Trusts Article, which reads: \u201cUpon making a distribution, a personal representative may, but is not required to, obtain a verified release from the heir or legatee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">To construe the statute, we apply principles of statutory interpretation, as we have recently described:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. Statutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology. When a statute\u2019s plain language is unambiguous, we need only to apply the statute as written, and our efforts to ascertain the legislature\u2019s intent end there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-6\"><em>Carven v. State Ret. &amp; Pension Sys., </em>416 Md. 389, 407-08, 7 A.3d 38, 49 (2010) (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Crofton Convalescent Ctr., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>413 Md. 201, 216, 991 A.2d 1257, 1266 (2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">\n<em>1. Statutory Scope</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">This statute was enacted in 1969 as part of a comprehensive reform of Maryland testamentary law. The language of Section 9-111 comes directly from the Second Report of the Governor\u2019s Commission to Review and Revise the Testamentary Laws of Maryland, which was appointed in 1965 to help the state in \u201crecodifying and revising the Maryland laws concerning testamentary matters[.]\u201d William L. Henderson et al., <em>Second Report of Governor\u2019s Commission to Review and Revise the Testamentary Laws of Maryland, Article 93: Decedents\u2019 Estates </em>i, 144-45 (1968) <em>(\u201cHenderson Commission Report </em>\u201d). The comments to the Commission\u2019s report suggest that Section 9-111 was designed to continue the \u201cMaryland practice of not requiring releases, although personal representatives, out of caution, have, in the past, obtained releases in many instances.\u201d <em>Henderson Commission Report </em>at 144. Additionally, the comments indicate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">The Commission does not, however, intend to imply ... that an heir or legatee does not have the right to petition a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Court to compel the personal representative to make a distribution, if the personal representative is abusing his discretion in withholding any distribution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><em>Henderson Commission Report </em>at 145. Appellants make several arguments for why the language of Section 9-111 does not require them to sign the releases sent to them by Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">At oral argument, Appellants argued that a \u201crelease\u201d under Section 9-111 does not extend to \u201crelease from liability,\u201d asserting instead that personal representatives are only entitled to something more akin to a \u201creceipt.\u201d We do not agree. If the Legislature had intended for Section 9-111 to allow only for a \u201creceipt,\u201d then that word would have appeared in the statute. Instead, the plain meaning of the word \u201crelease\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> unambiguously indicates that a release of liability is intended. Furthermore, a leading treatise on Maryland estate and trust law contains sample release forms that use language similar to the releases in this case. <em>See </em>Allan J. Gibber, <em>Gibber on Estate Administration </em>10-114 (5th ed.2011) (sample form containing this language: \u201cI do hereby Release, Acquit, Exonerate and Discharge ... Personal Representative of and from all and every action, suit or demand which could or might possibly be brought, exhibited or prosecuted[.]\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Appellants argue that the discretionary nature of the statute and the Henderson Commission comments preclude a personal representative from obtaining a release in this case. They argue, in effect, that an heir may refuse to sign a release because the statute only says that a personal representative \u201cmay, <em>but is not required to </em>\u201d obtain a release before distribution. None of the legislative history or case law indicates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>an heir or legatee may refuse to sign a release before distribution when presented with one. Although the comments to the Henderson Commission Report indicate that Section 9-111 continued the \u201cMaryland practice of not requiring releases,\u201d <em>Henderson Commission Report </em>at 144, it is clear to us that this practice simply means that a release is not necessary for distribution to proceed in all cases. Section 9-111 says that a personal representative \u201cmay\u201d obtain a release. We therefore agree with the Court of Special Appeals in that \u201cwe construe the plain language of the statute involved here, providing that the personal representative \u2018may ... obtain\u2019 a release, as conferring the right to obtain a release prior to distribution.\u201d <em>Allen v. Ritter, </em>196 Md.App. at 628, 10 A.3d at 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Moving away from plain language, Appellants argue that Section 9-111 does not apply when the corresponding distribution is made according to a court order. Appellants assert: \u201cNo where in the language of the statute is it even intimated that the personal representative has the right to demand and obtain any release prior to paying over to the distributees the amount approved by the Orphans\u2019 Court when it approved the [Account].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Appellants contend that the functional need for a release, when a personal representative is acting under a court-ordered distribution, is obviated by the language of Section 9-112(e), which reads: \u201cDistribution by the personal representative in accordance with the direction of the court at the meeting protects and indemnifies the personal representative acting in obedience to it.\u201d \u00a7 9-112(e) of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article. Appellants continue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">If a personal representative making a distribution pursuant to a court order in accordance with a 9-112 situation is protected, because that is clearly not a final account situation, then why isn\u2019t a personal representative making a distribution in accordance with a final account approved by an orphans\u2019 court not also protected from further litigation? Appellants aver that a personal representative is so protected and the case law supports that view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>Appellants proceed to cite numerous Maryland cases for the principle that a personal representative distributing an estate under a court order is protected from lawsuits from heirs or legatees. Appellants imply that the case law makes a release unnecessary in such a situation. It is true, as Appellants state, that \u201conce a will has been construed by an equity court, a personal representative is bound to make distribution in accordance with that court\u2019s order, since the personal representative is fully protected by it[.]\u201d <em>Webster v. Larmore, </em>270 Md. 351, 354, 311 A.2d 405, 406 (1973) (citations omitted). This court has applied \u201cthe same rationale ... to the order of an orphans\u2019 court directing distribution^]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Nevertheless, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that Section 9-112 is inapplicable here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the specific procedures prescribed by that section were not followed here, that section simply does not apply to Roy Allen\u2019s estate. Furthermore, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that adopting Appellants\u2019 view of Section 9-112 would serve to strip Section 9-111 of certain meaning. Such a view would effectively prevent a personal representative from obtaining a release, despite what Section 9-111 says. As the Court of Special Appeals observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">even if \u00a7 9-112 were applicable and protected the representative from a claim regarding the final distribution, nothing in that statutory provision suggests that it nullifies the right of the personal representative to obtain a release prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>distribution. To read the statutes in this manner would render \u00a7 9-111 superfluous. <em>See Pete v. State, </em>384 Md. 47, 65-66, 862 A.2d 419 (2004) (statutes addressing the same subject should be read together and harmonized to avoid rendering \u201c \u2018any portion, meaningless, surplusage, superfluous, or nugatory\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Whiting-Turner Contracting Co. v. Fitzpatrick, </em>366 Md. 295, 303, 783 A.2d 667 (2001)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIq\"><em>Allen v. Ritter, </em>196 Md.App. at 631 n. 11, 10 A.3d at 1191; <em>see also Police Comm\u2019r v. Dowling, </em>281 Md. 412, 418, 379 A.2d 1007, 1011 (1977) (\u201cWhere two statutes deal with the same subject matter as here, they must be construed together if they are not inconsistent with one another. Thus, to the extent possible, full effect should be given to each.\u201d). A personal representative is indeed \u201cprotected\u201d when acting in a Section 9-112 proceeding, but this protection does not negate the personal representative\u2019s ability to obtain a release from the legatees if he or she so desires. This reading is consistent with our principles that the statutory sections should be \u201charmonized\u201d and that \u201cfull effect should be given to each.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AWg\">Appellants attempt to turn this principle of statutory construction in their favor by asserting that a full and toothy enforcement of Section 9-111 would \u201cnegate[ ] the liability of a personal representative under\u201d Sections 6-303<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 10-103.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>We are again unpersuaded. A release is specifically designed to shield a personal representative, who asks for one, from the background liabilities spelled out in those sections. If we were to hold that Appellee could not obtain a release here, we would strip Section 9-111 of meaning. As Appellee correctly stated in oral argument, Section 9-111 says that a personal representative \u201cmay obtain\u201d a release, not that he or she \u201cmay ask for\u201d one.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">There is an important practical reason, moreover, for a personal representative to obtain a release before the final distribution is made. Without a release, heirs could sue the personal representative for alleged malfeasance, improper distribution, or other claims, and with all estate assets distributed, the personal representative would have no assets with which to fund a defense, or if appropriate, settle or satisfy the claim. Although in some instances, the personal representative might be liable for such expenses out of personal funds, in other \u2014 likely more frequent \u2014 instances, the estate should pay for the defense and satisfaction of the claim. If we were to say that a personal representative could not obtain a release before the statute of limitations, in Section 10-103, runs, then Section 9-111 would not offer any additional protection beyond the statute of limitations. \u201cFull effect\u201d can be given to each of these three sections and still enable a personal representative to obtain a release.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We are mindful of the implications of Appellants\u2019 argument regarding the scope of releases. In their questions presented, Appellants are seemingly concerned with \u201csweeping\u201d releases, and in their brief they mention \u201ca release which far exceeds mere acknowledgment of a receipt of the distribution to which the legatee has been determined to be entitled to by an Orphans\u2019 Court[.]\u201d Section 9-111 extends to more than a mere \u201creceipt,\u201d but we recognize that the releases in that section are not limitless in scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Although the language of Section 9-111 is bare on the scope of a valid release, as is the Henderson Commission Report, Section 10-103 prevents the statute of limitations from running on claims against personal representatives in cases of fraud, material mistake, or substantial irregularity. Reading these sections together suggests that the Legislature did not intend to give the personal representative a right to a release under Section 9-111 that would negate the extended opportunity for a beneficiary to claim fraud, material mistake, or substantial irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Looking further, this Court has consistently held that fraud can and will invalidate an otherwise-complete release of liability. <em>See, e.g., Gingell v. Backus, </em>246 Md. 83, 90, 227 A.2d 349, 352 (1967) (\u201cWhether the release is rescinded by a court of equity for fraud or fraud is pleaded to bar its legal effect as satisfaction of the plaintiffs claim in a court of law, the result is the same. In either situation the release is vitiated and consequently cannot defeat a recovery in a subsequent or contemporaneous law action.\u201d); <em>Parish v. Md. &amp; Va. Milk Producers Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>261 Md. 618, 690-91, 277 A.2d 19, 53 (1971) (\u201cA release, however, is a contract and may be set aside for the same reasons for which any other contract may be avoided. If the release is obtained by fraud, it may be set aside lor this reason.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Clinton Petroleum Servs., Inc. v. Norris, </em>271 Md. 665, 669, 319 A.2d 304, 306 (1974) (\u201cThe discharge of a debtor in bankruptcy is personal to the bankrupt and does not release his fraudulent grantees from liability for the fraud committed by them and in no way precludes the trustee from recovering property of the estate thus fraudulently transferred.\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Bernstein v. Kapneck, </em>290 Md. 452, 460, 430 A.2d 602, 606-07 (1981) (observing that fraud is grounds for admitting parol evidence to contradict a release).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Although we do not attempt to decipher the exact contours of releases under Section 9-111, we read such releases, consistent with the common law rule and with Section 10-103, as stopping short of acts of fraud, material mistake, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>irregularity on the part of the personal representative. Accordingly, we hold that the scope of a release pursuant to Section 9-111 does not and cannot release a personal representative from claims that might arise from fraud, material mistake, or substantial irregularity on the part of the personal representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\n<em>2. Power of Orphans\u2019 Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Appellants also challenge the ability of the orphans\u2019 court to mandate their signatures on the releases before distribution. The Estates and Trusts Article spells out the jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">(a) <em>Powers. </em>\u2014 The court may conduct judicial probate, direct the conduct of a personal representative, and pass orders which may be required in the course of the administration of an estate of a decedent. It may summon witnesses. The court may not, under pretext of incidental power or constructive authority, exercise any jurisdiction not expressly conferred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">\u00a7 2-102(a) of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article. This Court has also construed the orphans\u2019 courts\u2019 powers to include \u201cjurisdiction over interested persons and creditors, who invoke the court\u2019s power to determine issues within its express powers.\u201d <em>Kaouris v. Kaouris, </em>324 Md. 687, 709, 598 A.2d 1193, 1204 (1991).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">Thus the orphans\u2019 courts are empowered to decide such matters as are necessarily incident to the exercise of the powers expressly granted them. We have stated that the legislative intention was to confer adequate power and jurisdiction upon [orphans\u2019 [cjourts in every case in which their general powers would enable them to act.

The court had approved the [Account] presented by [Appellee], and the only thing impeding the distribution of the [Appellant\u2019s] shares of the Estate was their refusal to sign the release, which, as indicated, [Appellee] had the right to obtain pursuant to \u00a7 9-111.

Crandall, </em>218 Md. 598, 601-02, 147 A.2d 754, 756 (1959), which held that the \u201cOrphans\u2019 Court was without jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the release^]\u201d <em>Crandall, </em>however, is inapplicable, as here the orphans\u2019 court did not pass on the validity of the releases; that court merely ordered them signed, incident to its administration of Roy Allen\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. Section 9-111 allows a personal representative to obtain a release from legatees even when acting pursuant to the distribution order of an orphans\u2019 court, and such a court may order those legatees to sign the release when the personal representative so requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-10\">. The questions, as presented by Appellants, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-11\">1. Does Estates &amp; Trusts Section 9-111 entitle a Personal Representative to demand and receive a sweeping release from the Appellants before she pays over to them sums of money the Court had determined they were entitled to when it approved the First And Final Administration Account?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-12\">2. Did the Orphans\u2019 Court for Dorchester County, Maryland have the authority to order the Appellants to sign a sweeping release of liability to the Successor Personal Representative before they could secure payment of their respective shares of their father\u2019s estate that had been directed by the Orphans\u2019 Court when it approved the Successor Personal Representative\u2019s First And Final Administration Account?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-11\">.

This protection, however, is limited to proceedings taken pursuant to the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">In this case, the record does not reflect any proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 9-112.

Rather, in accordance with E.T. \u00a7\u00a7 7-302 and 7-303, [Appellee] filed, and the Orphans\u2019 Court approved, a Final Account of the Estate.
