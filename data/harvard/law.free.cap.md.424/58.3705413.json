Specifically, Ogundipe presented one question for our review, which we have reworded for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-10\">Whether there is a duty of the trial court to disclose a signed verdict sheet to a defendant or his counsel before the jury is discharged?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>Ogundipe argues that the verdict sheet was a \u201ccommunication\u201d between the court and the jury, which was required to be disclosed in accordance with Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 326(d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rule 4-326(d) requires the court to notify and disclose to counsel any jury communication received, before responding to the communication. We shall hold that the jury verdict sheet is not a communication within the meaning of the Rule, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals in holding that the trial court did not err in failing to disclose the contents of the verdict sheet prior to dismissing the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURE</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Ogundipe was charged with multiple crimes stemming from his involvement in an incident that occurred on July 23, 2006, in which Jackson Augustin Rodriguez was killed, Tony Perry was seriously injured, and Steven Ramel Broadhead was assaulted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We adopt the following facts as stated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>Court of Special Appeals in <em>Ogundipe v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 370, 991 A.2d 200 (2010):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">After a two-day trial, which began on May 13, 2008, the judge instructed the jury concerning its deliberations, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">Alright, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you will retire to consider your verdict in this matter. As I indicated, there is a verdict sheet that will be given to you. It consists of twelve questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">Questions One and Two relate to the charges of first and second degree murder of Jackson Rodriguez. Question is: As to the charge of first degree murder of Jackson Augustin Rodriguez, on or about July twenty-three 2006, how do you find the defendant Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe, guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">You\u2019re given further instruction then: If your answer to that question would be not guilty, then I would ask you to consider Question Number Two, which is second degree murder of Jackson Rodriguez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-10\">After you have done that, then Question[s] Three and Four relate to the attempted first and second degree murder of Tony Perry. You would consider first degree murder. If your answer to that would be not guilty then you would consider attempted second degree murder of Tony Perry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-11\">Questions Five and Six relate to the first degree assault of Jackson Augustin Rodriguez. Using the same means of analysis, Questions Seven and Eight relate to the first and second degree assault of Tony Perry. And Questions Nine and Ten relate to the first and second degree assault of Steven Broadhead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-13\">Question Eleven relates to the charge of the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. I would ask you to once again consider the instructions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>were given. Before you consider that question and the last question is as to the charge of wearing and carrying and transporting a handgun. How do you find the defendant, guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-5\">Once again, I would remind you that your decision must be unanimous. In other words, all twelve of you must agree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-6\">Two hours after the jury retired to deliberate, the court reconvened, and the following discourse took place:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">The Court: Alright, the defendant is present. Please bring the jury in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">(The jury returns to the jury box.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">Alright, the jury is present. The defendant and counsel are present. It\u2019s my understanding the jury has reached a verdict. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\">Foreman: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">The Court: Okay. Mr. Clerk, if you would take the verdict of the jury, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-12\">Clerk: Yes, sir. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, are you agreed as to your verdict?

The clerk stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9\">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, hearken your verdict as the Court hath recorded it. Your foreman saith that Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe is guilty of first degree murder of Jackson Augustin Rodriguez on or about July 23, 2006.

That Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe is not guilty of first degree assault of Jackson Augustin Rodriguez on or about July 23, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">That Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe is not guilty of second degree assault of Jackson Augustin Rodriguez on or about July 23, 2006. And Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe is guilty of first degree assault of Tony Perry on or about July 23, 2006. That Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe is guilty of first degree assault of Steven Ramel Broadhead on or about July 23, 2006. That Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe is guilty of the charge of use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence on or about July 23, 2006. And that Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe is guilty of wearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>carrying and transporting a handgun on or about July 23, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">And so say you all? If so, please answer, \u201cWe do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">After the jury replied, \u201cWe do,\u201d Ogundipe\u2019s counsel requested that the jury be polled. Each juror was asked individually, \u201c[I]s this your individual verdict?\u201d Each responded, \u201cYes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\"><em>Ogundipe, </em>191 Md.App. at 373-76, 991 A.2d at 202-04 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Once the verdict was announced orally, and the jury was polled and hearkened, the verdict was recorded. Following trial, defense counsel obtained the completed verdict sheet, which listed the charges and the corresponding verdicts:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Question Number Question or Instruction Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">1 [First degree murder of Rodriguez] -x \u2014 GUILTY_NOT GUILTY</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">If your answer to Question 1 is not guilty, please consider Question 2.

The trial judge instructed the jury to \u201cconsider\u201d the second degree charge if the jury\u2019s answer to the corresponding first degree charge was not guilty. Reinforcing this, the language in the verdict sheet instructed the jury, following the charge of first degree murder of Rodriguez, \u201cIf your answer to Question 1 is not guilty, please consider Question 2. If your answer to Question 1 is guilty, please answer Question 3,\u201d where Question 2 asked the jury to determine whether the defendant was guilty of second degree murder, and Question 3 asked about a separate charge. The same language was employed for the charges of first degree murder of Perry and the first degree assaults of Rodriguez, Perry, and Broadhead. This instruction implies that if the jury finds the defendant guilty of the charge in the first degree, the jury should skip the next question, containing the same charge in the second degree, and should presumably leave that question blank because it merely inquires about the lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">The jury did not follow verbatim the trial judge\u2019s instructions on how to utilize the verdict sheet; rather than leaving the second degree offenses blank when it determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Ogundipe was guilty of the first degree offenses, the jury instead checked the boxes marked \u201cNOT GUILTY.\u201d For example, the jury found Ogundipe guilty of the offense listed in Question 1, first degree murder of Rodriguez. Rather than leaving Question 2, second degree murder of Rodriguez, blank, the jury instead checked the box marked \u201cNOT GUILTY.\u201d Pursuant to the instructions, however, the clerk did not ask the foreperson to recite the jury verdict for Questions 2, 4, 8, or 10, which contained the lesser included offenses for which the jury found Ogundipe guilty of the greater offenses. Ogundipe appealed the verdict to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the trial judge erred in not reading the verdicts for the lesser included offenses and that the verdict sheet constituted an inconsistent verdict. <em>Ogundipe, </em>191 Md.App. at 377, 991 A.2d at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the jury\u2019s verdict and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">The clerk of the court was following the directions of the circuit court by skipping the second degree questions after the jury announced that the defendant was guilty of the charges in the first degree. Once the jury found the defendant guilty of the crimes in the first degree, there was no reason to consider the second degree charges as they legally merged with the greater charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-6\"><em>Ogundipe, </em>191 Md.App. at 382, 991 A.2d at 207-08. The intermediate appellate court stated that \u201cthe verdict sheet itself is a tool for the jury to utilize in deciding its verdict but it does not constitute the verdict\u201d in itself. <em>Ogundipe, </em>191 Md.App. at 381, 991 A.2d at 207. The court concluded that the hearkening and polling of the jury as to the questions which were orally announced \u201creflected the jury\u2019s unanimous verdict,\u201d and the verdict was therefore valid. <em>Ogundipe, </em>191 Md.App. at 383, 991 A.2d at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Ogundipe argued, in the alternative, that the verdict sheet was a \u201ccommunication\u201d under Rule 4 \u2014 326(d), and he therefore asserted that the Circuit Court erred in failing to disclose the contents of the verdict sheet. The Court of Special Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>stated that whether Rule 4-326(d) applies to a jury verdict sheet \u201cappears to be a question of first impression.\u201d <em>Ogundipe, </em>191 Md.App. at 384, 991 A.2d at 209. To answer the question, the court consulted the procedure for returning a jury verdict under Rule 4-327,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in order to determine whether the proper procedure was followed. <em>Id. </em>The court held that Rule 4-327</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">does not require the judge to review the verdict sheet or to show the verdict sheet to the defendant at any time during the return of the verdict. Moreover, the jury verdict sheet is not a \u201ccommunication\u201d from the jury to the court seeking a response by the court. Its purpose is to facilitate the deliberations of the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-6\"><em>Ogundipe, </em>191 Md.App. at 385, 991 A.2d at 209. Therefore, the court held, \u201cthe [trial] court was not required to notify or disclose the verdict sheet to the parties[.]\u201d <em>Ogundipe, </em>191 Md.App. at 385, 991 A.2d at 209-10. We granted Ogundipe\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Ogundipe v. State, </em>415 Md. 40, 997 A.2d 791 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The question presented in the petition for writ of certiorari encompasses ..two separate issues. First, in addressing Ogundipe\u2019s claim that there was an inconsistent or confusing verdict, we will discuss whether the signed verdict sheet constituted the jury\u2019s verdict. Second, we will address whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>verdict sheet was a \u201ccommunication\u201d which was required to be disclosed under Maryland Rule 4-326(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">In order to determine whether a verdict sheet constitutes the jury\u2019s verdict, we first turn to <em>Jones v. State, </em>384 Md. 669, 866 A.2d 151 (2005). In <em>Jones, </em>four counts against the defendant relating to a robbery were submitted to the jury. <em>Jones, </em>384 Md. at 675, 866 A.2d at 154-55. After deliberations, when the jury returned to the courtroom, the courtroom clerk asked the foreperson for the verdict on three of the four counts, and the foreperson answered \u201cguilty\u201d on each of those three counts. <em>Jones, </em>384 Md. at 675-76, 866 A.2d at 155. The jury was then polled and the verdict was hearkened only as to the three counts. <em>Jones, </em>384 Md. at 676-77, 866 A.2d at 155. The clerk never inquired about the fourth count. <em>Id. </em>The completed verdict sheet, however, reflected that the jury marked Jones guilty on all four counts. <em>Jones, </em>384 Md. at 676 n. 9, 866 A.2d at 155 n. 9. The verdict sheet was filed in the record, <em>Jones, </em>384 Md. at 675 n. 9, 866 A.2d at 155 n. 9, and Jones was later sentenced for all four counts. <em>Jones, </em>384 Md. at 677, 866 A.2d at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">On appeal, Jones argued that the verdict as to the count that was not orally conveyed, polled, or hearkened \u201cshould not stand because the jury foreman did not announce the guilty verdict in open court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agreed with Jones, reversing the Court of Special Appeals, which held that \u201csubstance will prevail over form even if the guilty verdict is not announced[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>We held that a verdict is not valid until orally conveyed and either polled or hearkened. <em>Jones, </em>384 Md. at 678, 866 A.2d at 156. In reaching this conclusion, we reviewed the historic procedures for returning a verdict, and we stated that the \u201c \u2018return\u2019 of a verdict by a jury has been comprised of three distinct procedures, each fulfilling a specific purpose.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>384 Md. at 682, 866 A.2d at 159. First, the foreman orally answers the inquiry of the clerk, stating the verdict of the jury in open court. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Second, the jury is polled \u201cto ensure the unanimity of the verdict prior to its entry on the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Smith v. State, </em>299 Md. 158, 166, 472 A.2d 988, 992 (1984)). Third, the jury is heark<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ened to its verdict as a \u201c \u2018traditional formality announcing the recording of the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones, </em>384 Md. at 684, 866 A.2d at 160 (quoting <em>Smith, </em>299 Md. at 166, 472 A.2d at 991). We noted that hearkening and polling are conducted to \u201c \u2018secure certainty and accuracy, and to enable the jury to correct a verdict, which they have mistaken, or which their foreman has improperly delivered.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Smith, </em>299 Md. at 165, 472 A.2d at 991). Turning to the issue before us in <em>Jones, </em>we held that \u201cfor a verdict to be considered final in a criminal case it must be announced orally,\u201d and thus the verdict for the count which was not announced orally, polled, or hearkened, was not valid. <em>Jones, </em>384 Md. at 685-86, 866 A.2d at 160-61.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Subsequently, in <em>State v. Santiago, </em>412 Md. 28, 40, 985 A.2d 556, 562 (2009), we reaffirmed the procedure outlined in <em>Jones. </em>In <em>Santiago, </em>the foreperson stated the verdict for multiple charges in open court, but the jury was not polled and the verdict was not hearkened. <em>Santiago, </em>412 Md. at 33-34, 985 A.2d at 559. We held that \u201cthe clerk\u2019s failure to hearken the verdict was fatal and rendered the jury\u2019s verdict defective____ The failure to hearken the verdict rendered the verdict a nullity.\u201d <em>Santiago, </em>412 Md. at 41-42, 985 A.2d at 563; <em>see also Heinze v. State, </em>184 Md. 613, 616, 42 A.2d 128, 130 (1945) (\u201cIt is a fundamental principle that the verdict of a jury in a criminal case has no effect in law until it is recorded and finally accepted by the court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">In the present case, while Ogundipe focuses his argument on whether or not the verdict sheet was a communication, Ogundipe also implies that the verdict sheet itself was the verdict, referring to the verdict sheet as \u201cthe ultimate communication,\u201d and arguing that a \u201clarge portion of the verdict ... went unspoken and unaddressed[.]\u201d Ogundipe claims that the contents of the verdict sheet constituted \u201cevidence of confusion, inconsistency, and potential acquittal[.]\u201d Ogundipe also maintains that the verdict sheet evidenced an inconsistent verdict, stating that the \u201cverdict sheet shows Petitioner not guilty of lesser included offenses and guilty of the greater offenses as they pertain to each victim in the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>The State argues that Ogundipe\u2019s contention that a part of the verdict went unspoken is unavailing because in Maryland \u201cthere is no such thing as an \u2018unspoken\u2019 verdict.\u201d The State relies on <em>Jones </em>and <em>Santiago, </em>asserting that the verdict, which was \u201cdelivered in open court, about which the jury was polled, and to which the jury hearkened,\u201d constitutes the entire verdict, rather than the contents of the verdict sheet. Further, the State contends that the jury did not express \u201cconfusion, inconsistency, or ambiguity during the announcement, polling, or hearkening of the verdict.\u201d Thus, the verdict, as announced in open court, was comprised of only those questions that were answered by the foreperson, and the jurors were hearkened and polled in accordance with <em>Jones.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Although this Court has not had occasion to specifically determine whether the verdict sheet itself constitutes the verdict of the jury, other jurisdictions have grappled with this exact issue and have determined that it does not. For example, two cases decided by the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York are directly on point. In <em>People v. Clark, </em>293 A.D.2d 624, 624, 742 N.Y.S.2d 70 (N.Y.App.Div.2002), the trial court instructed the jury to consider the second degree charge only if it first found the defendant not guilty of the first degree charge. The verdict sheet revealed that the \u201cjury had checked \u2018guilty\u2019 next to the charge of manslaughter in the first degree, and \u2018not guilt/ next to the charge of manslaughter in the second degree,\u201d in violation of the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Id. </em>The defendant claimed that the verdict manifested the \u201cjury\u2019s confusion\u201d and that the trial court\u2019s failure to apprise defense counsel of the error deprived the defendant of due process of law. <em>Clark, </em>293 A.D.2d at 625, 742 N.Y.S.2d 70. The appellate court affirmed the judgment, holding that the verdict sheet did not constitute the verdict of the jury and, therefore, the court did not err in accepting the guilty verdict as it was conveyed. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in <em>People v. Boatwright, </em>297 A.D.2d 603, 748 N.Y.S.2d 541 (N.Y.App.Div.2002), the appellate court held that the trial court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9N\">had no sua sponte obligation to inform [the] defendant that the verdict sheet, contrary to the court\u2019s instructions, also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>contained a notation by the jury indicating a proposed not guilty verdict on the lesser included offense of second-degree assault. A verdict sheet is neither a verdict nor a substantive communication from the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><em>Boatwright, </em>297 A.D.2d at 604, 748 N.Y.S.2d 541 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Therefore, although this Court has not previously determined the precise issue presented by Ogundipe for review, we are persuaded by the logic of other courts on the matter, and we believe that <em>Jones </em>and <em>Santiago </em>support the holding that the contents of the verdict sheet do not constitute the jury\u2019s verdict. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals \u201cthat the verdict sheet itself is a tool for the jury to utilize in deciding its verdict but it does not constitute the verdict.\u201d <em>Ogundipe, </em>191 Md.App. at 381, 991 A.2d at 207. As framed by the intermediate appellate court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">Ogundipe, in effect, is asking, if a jury is directed by the court not to answer a question related to the second degree of a crime when the jury finds the defendant guilty of that crime in the first degree, is the clerk of the court required to ask the jury for its answer to those questions once the jury announces, in open court, that it finds the defendant guilty of the crimes in the first degree? In our view, the answer is, \u201cNo.\u201d The clerk of the court was following the directions of the circuit court by skipping the second degree questions after the jury announced that the defendant was guilty of the charges in the first degree. Once the jury found the defendant guilty of the crimes in the first degree, there was no reason to consider the second degree charges as they legally merged with the greater charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-8\"><em>Ogundipe, </em>191 Md.App. at 382, 991 A.2d at 207-08. We held in <em>Jones </em>that the verdict on the fourth count was not valid because it was not orally announced in court. Similarly, in the present case, any questions on the verdict sheet that were not announced orally in court cannot be considered verdicts in themselves. The verdict sheet is merely a tool used to aid the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>jury in reaching its verdict; it therefore does not bind the jury or the court to its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The verdict sheet also did not evidence any confusion by the jury as to the charges. The instructions directed the jury to \u201cconsider\u201d the second degree offense if the jurors found the defendant not guilty of the corresponding first degree offense, but the instructions did not specifically direct the jurors to skip the question entirely if they found the defendant guilty of the greater offense. The jury\u2019s marking of \u201cnot guilty\u201d for the second degree charges, for which the jury found Ogundipe guilty of the corresponding first degree charges, emphasized the jury\u2019s intent to convict Ogundipe of the greater offenses. Nonetheless, the courtroom clerk acted properly and in accordance with the judge\u2019s instructions by skipping Questions 2, 4, 8, and 10, relating to those corresponding lesser included offenses, and by reading aloud only that the jury found Ogundipe guilty of the greater offenses. Finally, had the jurors intended a different result, they could have made their objections known during the polling or hearkening.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Now that we have determined that the verdict sheet itself is not the verdict, we must address whether the verdict sheet is instead a communication within the purview of Maryland Rule 4 \u2014 326(d) that should have been disclosed. We shall hold that a verdict sheet is not a \u201ccommunication\u201d within the plain meaning and intent of the law, and therefore the trial judge did not err in failing to disclose the contents of the verdict sheet.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">In order to determine whether a verdict sheet is the type of communication contemplated by Rule 4-326(d), \u201cwe look first to the plain language of the statute [or Rule]\u201d to determine legislative intent. <em>Perez v. State, </em>420 Md. 57, 63, 21 A.3d 1048, 1052 (2011) (quoting <em>Dove v. State, </em>415 Md. 727, 738, 4 A.3d 976, 982 (2010)). Further, as stated in <em>Briggs v. State, </em>413 Md. 265, 992 A.2d 433 (2010), \u201c \u2018[we] neither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain language of the [rule]; nor [do we] construe the [rule] with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>application.\u2019 \u201d <em>Briggs, </em>413 Md. at 275, 992 A.2d at 439 (quoting <em>Rosemann v.

State, </em>66 Md.App. 603, 624, 505 A.2d 564, 574 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>306 Md. 371, 509 A.2d 134 (1986)). In <em>Denicolis v. State, </em>378 Md. 646, 837 A.2d 944 (2003), we discussed Rule 4-326(c)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in detail, stating that \u201can accused in a criminal prosecution has the absolute right to be present at every stage of trial from the time the jury is impaneled <em>until it reaches a verdict </em>or is discharged[.]\u201d <em>Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 656, 837 A.2d at 950 (emphasis added) (citing <em>Midgett v. State, </em>216 Md. 26, 36-37, 139 A.2d 209, 214 (1958)). Any failure of the trial court to disclose a communication under Rule 4-326(d) is evaluated under the harmless error standard and will not be considered harmless \u201cunless the record affirmatively shows that such communications were not prejudicial or had no tendency to influence the verdict of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Ogundipe argues that he was denied the right to be present at every stage of the trial. Ogundipe claims that he was not \u201cpresent\u201d for the verdict because he did not have knowledge of the contents of the verdict sheet; he therefore concludes that a \u201clarge portion of the verdict ... went unspoken and unaddressed[.]\u201d Ogundipe contends that if he \u201chad the knowledge that there were not guilty findings for lesser included offenses, his counsel could have requested the trial court not to accept the verdict and to send the jury back for further deliberation, or asked for other action to protect [his] rights.\u201d Ogundipe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>also argues that the Court of Special Appeals \u201cignored the plain reading of Rule 4-326,\u201d under which, in his view, a verdict sheet would be considered a communication that must be disclosed by the court. Ogundipe faults the intermediate appellate court for relying on Rule 4-327 in outlining the procedure for returning a jury verdict, arguing that the court should only have evaluated whether the verdict sheet was a communication under Rule 4-326.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The State counters that Ogundipe\u2019s contention that the verdict sheet was a communication is \u201cwithout merit\u201d because the \u201cverdict sheet is not the type of communication contemplated by [the plain language of] Rule 4-326(d).\u201d The State presents two reasons supporting its conclusion that verdict sheets are not within the purview of Rule 4-326. First, the State asserts that the language of the Rule requires the court to notify the parties upon receipt of a communication, which implies that the parties would likely be otherwise unaware of the communication. According to the State, however, the submission of a verdict sheet \u201cis done in open court, in the presence of all both parties, who have been given prior notice that the jury has reached a verdict\u201d; therefore, both parties and the court are aware of the submission of the verdict sheet. Second, the State contends that Rule 4-326(d) requires notification to the parties of the receipt of a jury communication prior to the court\u2019s response, which assumes, according to the State, that a communication requires a response of some kind by the court. The State argues that a verdict sheet does not require such notification because a verdict sheet does not require a response from the court. Rather, the verdict sheet is used by the jury and the foreman to convey the jury\u2019s conclusions in the case, and thus it does not seek a response. The Court of Special Appeals agreed with the State, indicating that the purpose of the verdict sheet is that of a tool used \u201cto facilitate the deliberations of the jury,\u201d and it is therefore not a communication requiring disclosure. <em>Ogundipe, </em>191 Md. App. at 385, 991 A.2d at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>In the present case, the plain language of Rule 4-326(d) compels the conclusion that the verdict sheet is not the type of communication contemplated by the Rule. In accordance with <em>Briggs, </em>we will not construe the Rule with forced or subtle interpretations that extend its application. <em>See Briggs, </em>413 Md. at 275, 992 A.2d at 439. As we have previously held, the purpose of Rule 4-326(d) is to ensure that the parties have an opportunity to provide input before the court responds to a communication. Unlike communications received by the court during the presentation of evidence or during deliberation, a verdict sheet does not require input from counsel or from the court. Accordingly, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the verdict sheet is merely a tool for the jury to use in order to aid in its deliberation, rather than a communication requiring action by the court or by counsel. Thus, the verdict sheet is not a communication requiring disclosure under Rule 4-326(d). Further, the Court of Special Appeals did not err in referencing Rule 4-327, which governs the return of a jury verdict and requires that the jury return a unanimous verdict in open court, in evaluating whether the trial court followed the proper procedure in receiving the jury\u2019s verdict. To be clear, Rule 4-326(d) governs any communication received up until the time when the jury returns its verdict; once the jury has concluded its deliberations and returns to the courtroom to deliver its verdict, Rule 4-327 is triggered, and the court must follow the specific procedure outlined therein to render the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Additionally, Ogundipe\u2019s reliance on <em>Denicolis </em>to support his contention that the verdict sheet is a communication that should have been disclosed is misplaced. Although <em>Denicolis </em>does emphasize the importance of Rule 4-326 and clearly requires disclosure of any communication between the jury and the court, the case does not support the claim that a verdict sheet is a communication. Rather, a closer reading of <em>Denicolis </em>reveals that a verdict sheet is not a \u201ccommunication\u201d as contemplated by the Rule. First, <em>Denicolis </em>applies the Rule to any communications received \u201cuntil [the jury] reaches a verdict or is discharged[.]\u201d <em>Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 656, 837 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>A.2d at 950. Second, when discussing the harmless error standard, <em>Denicolis </em>focuses on the potential influence the error would have on the verdict of the jury. <em>Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 657, 837 A.2d at 950. Thus, <em>Denicolis </em>contemplates those communications that take place up to and until the time when the jury reaches a verdict, not after the jury completes its deliberations and returns to the courtroom to announce the verdict. In a situation where the verdict sheet contains the jury\u2019s final determination on each count, the jury has already reached its verdict and is simply using the verdict sheet as a tool to help deliver its decision to the court. Finally, those other courts that held that the verdict sheet does not constitute the verdict also agree that the verdict sheet is not a communication. <em>See Clark, </em>293 A.D.2d at 625, 742 N.Y.S.2d 70 (holding that the verdict sheet need not be disclosed to counsel because it is not \u201ca jury communication requesting information or instruction\u201d) (internal quotation omitted); <em>Boatwright, </em>297 A.D.2d at 604, 748 N.Y.S.2d 541 (\u201cA verdict sheet is neither a verdict nor a substantive communication from the jury.\u201d). Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals in holding that the Circuit Court did not err in failing to disclose the contents of the verdict sheet to defense counsel because the verdict sheet was neither a verdict in itself nor a communication under Rule 4-326(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS AFFIRMED.

The majority, agreeing with the Court of Special Appeals, holds that a verdict sheet cannot be considered a \u201ccommunication\u201d within the meaning of Rule 4-326(d) and, therefore, the trial court did not commit reversible error in failing to disclose it and its contents to the defendant or his counsel. <em>Ogundipe v. State, </em>73-74, 33 A.3d at 992-93 (2011). Under the circumstances of this case, I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">A jury sitting in the Circuit Court for Washington County found the petitioner, Olusegun Ogundipe, guilty of first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, two counts of first degree assault, use of a handgun during the commission of a crime of violence, and wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun. The instructions given the jury and the circumstances surrounding the taking of its verdict provide the predicate for the issue this Court must resolve. To assist it in its deliberations and to record its verdict, the jury was given a verdict sheet containing twelve questions. In his instructions to the jury, the trial judge explained the composition of the verdict sheet and related the twelve questions to the charges against the petitioner, and addressed the consequences of the answer on other questions and charges. Thus, in that regard, the jury was instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">\u201cQuestions One and Two relate to the charges of first and second degree murder of Jackson Rodriguez. Question One is: As to the charge of first degree murder of Jackson Augustin Rodriguez, on or about July twenty-three 2006, how do you find the defendant Olusegun Hakeem Ogundipe, guilty or not guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u201cYou\u2019re given further instruction then: If your answer to that question would be not guilty, then I would ask you to consider Question Number Two, which is second degree murder of Jackson Rodriguez.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">\u201cAfter you have done that, then Question Three and Four relate to the attempted first and second degree murder of Tony Perry. You would consider first degree murder. If your answer to that would be not guilty then you would consider attempted second degree murder of Tony Perry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">\u201cQuestions Five and Six relate to the first degree assault of Jackson Rodriguez. Using the same means of analysis, Questions Seven and Eight relate to the first and second degree assault of Tony Perry. And Questions Nine and Ten relate to the first and second degree assault of Steven Broadhead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">\u201cQuestion Eleven relates to the charge of the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. I would ask you to once again consider the instructions that were given.

With respect to the charges of first degree murder, first degree assault, use of a handgun in commission of a crime of violence, and wearing, carrying and transporting a handgun, the jury answered \u201cguilty.\u201d Contrary to the court\u2019s instructions, however, it went on to answer, \u201cnot guilty,\u201d to the subsequent questions addressing second degree murder, and second degree assault, lesser degrees of two of the above offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Thereafter, with the defendant present, the verdict was taken, as required by Maryland Rule 4-327,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in open court.

The jury responded in the affirmative, and, upon being individually polled at the request of defense counsel, confirmed that they each, indeed, had arrived at this verdict unanimously. The jury was then dismissed. At no time prior to its dismissal was it revealed that the jury had inconsistently completed the verdict sheet. Judgment was entered consistent with the verdict rendered in open court and the petitioner subsequently was sentenced to life imprisonment plus an additional ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">The petitioner learned of the inconsistencies on the verdict sheet days after the trial, <em>id., </em>whereupon, after filing a motion for modification which was held <em>sub-curia </em>by the trial court, he challenged the verdict, in particular, the process by which the verdict was taken.

The trial court disagreed, as did the Court of Special Appeals, to which the petitioner noted an appeal. The intermediate appellate court held that the presiding trial judge is neither required \u201cto review the verdict sheet, [n]or to show the verdict sheet to the defendant during the return of the verdict,\u201d and further, that \u201cthe jury sheet is not a \u2018communication\u2019 from the jury to the court seeking a response by the court.\u201d <em>Ogundipe, </em>191 Md.App. at 385, 991 A.2d at 209-10. It relied, in part, on Maryland Rule 4-327, <em>supra, </em>note 2, which governs the procedure for returning a jury verdict, stating that it \u201cdoes not require the judge to review the verdict sheet or to show the verdict sheet to the defendant at any time during the return of the verdict.\u201d <em>Id., </em>191 Md.App. at 385, 991 A.2d at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The majority affirms the decision of the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Ogundipe, </em>61-62, 33 A.3d at 985-86. It holds that a verdict sheet does not come within the meaning of \u201ccommunication\u201d as used in Rule 4-326(d). <em>Id., </em>73-74, 33 A.3d at 992-93. That this is so, the majority says, is demonstrated by the plain language of, as well as by the intent underlying, the Rule. <em>Id., </em>74-76, 33 A.3d at 993-94. The majority relies on <em>Denicolis v. State, </em>378 Md. 646, 837 A.2d 944 (2003). There, we addressed the purpose of Rule 4-326(d), concluding that it is to allow parties the opportunity to provide input before the court responds to a communication. <em>Id., </em>378 Md. at 656, 837 A.2d at 950. It follows, the majority states, looking to the plain language of the Rule and noting that a verdict sheet does not require input from counsel or the court, <em>Ogundipe, </em>75-76, 33 A.3d at 994, that a verdict sheet cannot be the sort of communication contemplated by 4-326(d). Moreover, according to the majority, agreeing with the intermediate appellate court, since a \u201cverdict sheet itself is a tool for the jury to utilize in deciding its verdict,\u201d <em>id., </em>72, 33 A.3d at 992 quoting 191 Md.App. at 381, 991 A.2d at 207, the contents of a verdict sheet do not evince a final verdict. <em>Ogundipe, </em>72-73, 33 A.3d at 992. It reasons further that the verdict sheet, as it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>completed by the jurors, did not reflect or demonstrate any confusion, since the trial court did not specifically instruct the jurors to skip those questions regarding the lesser included offenses of which the petitioner was found not guilty. <em>Id., </em>72-73, 33 A.3d at 992. The majority finally is satisfied that the courtroom clerk acted properly in skipping the questions related to those lesser included offenses. <em>Id., </em>72-73, 33 A.3d at 992. Accordingly, it holds that the trial court did not commit error and, thus, that the petitioner\u2019s convictions must be upheld. <em>Id., </em>76-77, 33 A.3d at 994-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">I agree that it is unnecessary for this Court to look beyond the plain meaning of Rule 4-326(d) to resolve the question this case presents. I do not agree, however, with the conclusion it reaches upon conducting the plain meaning analysis. I believe, on the contrary, that the plain language of Rule 4-326(d) requires, without exception, that <em>\u201cany communication from a jury pertaining to the action </em>\u201d be disclosed to counsel. (Emphasis added). Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The question before us for resolution is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-8\">\u201cWhether there is a duty of the trial court to disclose a signed verdict sheet to a defendant or his counsel before the jury is discharged when that verdict sheet has been completed in violation of the trial court\u2019s instructions, which verdict sheet evidences an inconsistent verdict, confusion and/or possible acquittal, and which verdict sheet was only partially covered during oral pronouncement of the verdict by the jury?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">As a threshold matter, the majority elects to address only that portion of the question that asks whether disclosure is required. 60, 33 A.3d at 985 n. 1. It reasons that the second portion, questioning the accuracy of the verdict sheet, is based on an underlying assertion which was not accepted by the Court of Special Appeals and, thus, is irrelevant, and improp<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>er. <em>Id., </em>61, 33 A.3d at 985. As I will demonstrate, this approach is unwarranted. Indeed, by taking this approach, the majority ignores a key part of the issue on which we granted certiorari. As a result, it fails to provide a complete response to the issue we agreed to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Turning first to the question of the nature of a verdict sheet, we look for guidance, first, to the language of Maryland Rule 4-326(d). It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\u201cThe court shall notify the defendant and the State\u2019s Attorney of the receipt of any communication from the jury pertaining to the action as promptly as practicable and in any event before responding to the communication. All such communications between the court and the jury shall be on the record in open court or shall be in writing and filed in the action. The clerk or the court shall note on a written communication the date and time it was received from the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In construing a court rule, as in the case of a statute, <em>see Pickett v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>365 Md. 67, 78, 775 A.2d 1218, 1224 (2001), <em>Johnson v. State, </em>360 Md. 250, 264, 757 A.2d 796, 804 (2000), we \u201cbegin[ ] with the plain language of the statute,\u201d and look to \u201cordinary, popular understanding of the English language [to] dictate[ ] interpretation of its terminology.\u201d <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 576, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005). It is important, in so doing, that we \u201cneither add nor delete language so as to reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain language of the statute; nor construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that limit or extend its application.\u201d <em>Id., </em>385 Md. at 566-77, 870 A.2d at 193. \u201cIf statutory language is unambiguous when construed according to its ordinary and everyday meaning, then we give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d <em>Id., </em>385 Md. at 577, 870 A.2d at 193. Specifically, \u201c[i]f there is no ambiguity in that language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, ... we do not need to resort to the various, and sometimes inconsistent, external rules of construction, for the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant.\u201d <em>Arundel Corp. v. Marie, </em>383 Md. 489, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>502, 860 A.2d 886, 894 (2004) (quoting <em>Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 525, 801 A.2d 160, 165 (2002)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying these principles of construction to the interpretation of Rule 4-326(d) makes clear that a verdict sheet is a \u201ccommunication\u201d within its ambit.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Rule 4-326(d) references \u201cany communication received from the jury pertaining to the action.\u201d It requires, without further defining \u201ccommunication\u201d or making any exception, that such communications be disclosed to counsel \u201cas promptly as practicable and in any event before responding to the communication.\u201d To decide whether a jury verdict comes within the Rule, it is necessary, therefore, that we determine the meaning of \u201ccommunication,\u201d and \u201cpertains.\u201d Looking to the ordinary usage of the language in question, as we are instructed by the canons of construction to do, <em>Kushell, supra, </em>we find that the Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a \u201ccommunication\u201d as \u201cinformation communicated\u201d; \u201ca verbal or written message.\u201d Merriam-Webster Dictionary 100 (3d ed. 2005). To \u201ccommunicate\u201d, according to Merriam-Webster, is \u201cto convey knowledge of or information about: make known.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">The word, \u201cpertain\u201d, as it is used in Rule 4-326(d), is defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary as, \u201cto have reference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 370, 870 A.2d 186. A verdict sheet certainly \u201cha[s] reference\u201d to the action at hand. It is, in fact, as characterized by the petitioners, \u201cthe ultimate communication.\u201d While it is not really the ultimate communication with regard to the case, it is, at that moment, the most critical communication concerning the issues to be decided that the jury could make. As such, it meets and far exceeds the requirement of simply referencing the action. Concluding otherwise, in light of the plain language of the Rule, is illogical.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">A verdict sheet, containing the jury\u2019s findings, albeit required by, and in response to, the court\u2019s instructions, on its face, is a communication and it very clearly pertains to the case. It is the encapsulation, in written form, of the result of the jury\u2019s deliberations. Specifically, it apprises the court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the jury\u2019s findings, following deliberations, on the factual issues of a case, to be subsequently announced in open court. See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1696 (9th ed. 2009). The jury verdict indubitably \u201cconvey[s] knowledge of or information about\u201d the case and the jury\u2019s findings, Merriam-Webster, <em>supra; </em>it \u201cmakes known\u201d those findings. <em>Id. </em>Rule 4-326(d) does not limit or even address how, by whom, or with what purpose a \u201ccommunication\u201d may be initiated. Indeed, and therefore, it clearly does not exclude jury verdicts. This is clear on the face of the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Nor does the existence of Rule 4-327, pertaining to jury verdicts, suggest or require a different conclusion. That Rule does not require that verdicts be recorded on verdict sheets, thus creating a separate and distinct communication device for the taking of a verdict. Like Rule 4-326, Rule 4-327 recognizes that the communication of the verdict, like the communication of a jury question, can be oral, in which case it must occur in open court, on the record. The Rule requires only that \u201c[t]he verdict of a jury shall be unanimous and shall be returned in open court.\u201d Rule 4-327(a). And there is, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, a response, or several responses, required of the court: polling of the jury, see Rule 4-327(d), hearkening of the verdict and discharge of the jury. To hold that the plain meaning of \u2018communication\u2019 does not encompass a verdict sheet requires that we construe Rule 4-326(d) \u201cwith forced or subtle interpretations that limit ... its application.\u201d <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. at 576-77, 870 A.2d at 193. But that is precisely what the majority does.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">That it is so clear, from the face of Rule 4-326(d) alone, that a verdict sheet is a communication that pertains to an action, renders the majority\u2019s opposite conclusion all the more inexplicable. More notable, our cases involving Rule 4-326(d), and its underpinnings, buttress the conclusion that a verdict sheet is a communication that must be disclosed to counsel. Our prior analyses of Rule 4-326(d) have occurred, to be sure, only in the context of jury communications, originating with the jury, during deliberations, requiring a response from the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>court, <em>see Denicolis, </em>378 Md. 646, 837 A.2d 944; <em>Stewart v. State, </em>334 Md. 213, 638 A.2d 754 (1994); however, contrary to what the majority suggests, 75-76, 33 A.3d at 994, we have never held that the reach of Rule 4-326(d) does not extend beyond those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">We discussed the purpose of the Rule 4-326(d) requirements in <em>Denicolis v. State, </em>378 Md. at 656, 837 A.2d at 950, where we recognized, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Rule sought to safeguard \u201cthe Constitutional and common law right of a criminal defendant to be present at every critical stage of trial.\u201d Citing <em>Midgett v. State, </em>216 Md. 26, 36-37, 139 A.2d 209, 214 (1958), we again emphasized the principle, consistently adhered to by this Court, that \u201can accused in a criminal prosecution has the absolute right to be present at <em>every </em>stage of trial from the time the jury is impaneled until it reaches a verdict or is discharged,\u201d and further, that \u201cany communications whatsoever between the court and the jury\u201d must be conducted in the presence of the defendant. <em>Denicolis, </em>378 Md. at 656, 837 A.2d at 950 (emphasis added). It is significant, and telling, that the reference is to \u201cany communication,\u201d rather than to one that requires a response from the court. Surely, the fact that a communication does not seek a direct response from the court or require input from counsel does not make it any less critical to the outcome of the trial. Nor should it automatically undermine a defendant\u2019s right to be present and, more important, be privy to the information it conveys, all of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">It is not enough simply to be present. The right to be present means nothing, is but a show, if all information is not available to all parties. When the jury verdict is announced in open court orally, the parties are on the same field; they have all the available information.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That is not the case when the jury verdict is written and not all of what the jury wrote is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>shared. To be sure, a defendant well may be physically present when the jury verdict is taken, but if he is not given access to information on that written verdict sheet that may undermine the verdict announced and that may be used to explore that possibility, his right to be present will be rendered hollow.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Had the petitioner been aware of how the verdict sheet was completed, he could have, and I expect, would have asked the court to voir dire the jury on the point and, perhaps, sought to present a case for mistrial. The point is that the petitioner was not playing on a level playing field.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Furthermore, contrary to what the majority suggests and would be the result of this decision, this right to be present does not expire immediately at the conclusion of the jury\u2019s deliberations; it persists until the jury has been discharged from its duties, <em>after </em>the reading of the verdict in open court, the polling of the jury and the hearkening of the verdict. <em>See Midgett, supra. </em>In <em>Denicolis, supra, </em>we also explained, relying on <em>Stewart, </em>334 Md. at 225, 638 A.2d at 759 (1994), that \u201cthis right is absolute and that a judgment of conviction ordinarily cannot be upheld if the record discloses a violation of the right.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Our Rule 4-326(d) jurisprudence, thus, demonstrates that the majority\u2019s conclusion that verdict sheets are not \u201ccommunications\u201d within its contemplation is unfounded, both in light of the plain language of the rule, and the rights it seeks to protect. This is made especially clear upon reviewing the facts of this case where the petitioner\u2019s constitutional and common law right to be present was, in fact, infringed upon by the trial court\u2019s nondisclosure. The record demonstrates that, whether or not the jury misunderstood the detailed instructions provided by the trial court, it answered questions that did not need to be answered and that the court appeared to say did not have to be answered, resulting in inconsistent verdicts, and, thus, logically could be found to be confused. The court\u2019s failure to disclose the verdict sheet, then, and the courtroom clerk\u2019s failure to read the sheet in its entirety, deprived defense counsel of valuable information necessary to the defense of his client and deprived the petitioner of information that gave substance to his right to be present. With the knowledge that the jury failed to comply with the instructions they were provided, the petitioner would have had an opportunity to provide input, including urging the court to take curative measures. The existence of this possibility, alone, is sufficient to call into question whether the petitioner\u2019s rights were safeguarded throughout the trial. Such uncertainties have no place in criminal proceedings, where the freedom and, indeed, the lives of defendants are at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Additionally, whether a verdict sheet constitutes the final verdict of the jury may be an interesting question to be addressed, but it is hardly one that is dispositive of the pivotal question in this case \u2014 whether the trial court, upon receipt, was required to disclose the contents of the verdict sheet to the petitioner. Consequently, as we did not grant certiorari on that issue and it is not argued by the petitioner, I believe that it should not have been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The verdict sheet was, in fact, completed in contravention of the trial court\u2019s instructions. The effect and consequence of the jury having done so must be addressed as a part of the Court\u2019s overall analysis. In any event, I do not agree that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>intermediate appellate court\u2019s refusal to accept the petitioner\u2019s argument that the verdict sheet was completed in error, as the majority believes, 60, 33 A.3d at 985, somehow limits this Court\u2019s ability to address that very issue anew or, at the very least, to consider it as part of our overall analysis. We are authorized to review the decision of the lower court <em>de novo, </em>and may do so, in its entirety, regardless of that court\u2019s disposition. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-131. Furthermore, as I have explained, even if we were to accept the proposition that the verdict sheet was not completed in error, the plain language of Rule 4-326(d) still requires a trial court to disclose its contents under all circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The majority conflates the issue before this Court, whether a jury verdict sheet is a jury communication, with a related, but irrelevant question, whether a verdict sheet constitutes the actual verdict of a jury. Admitting that the latter issue was not raised by the petitioners and is not one on which we granted \u201ccert,\u201d it justifies its decision to address it by reference to the petitioner\u2019s complaint with regard to the clerk\u2019s failure to read the verdict sheet in its entirety, in which he referred to the verdict sheet as \u201cthe ultimate communication,\u201d implying, according to the majority, 70-71, 33 A.3d at 991, that the verdict sheet constituted the verdict itself. That is, I think, an overly expansive and inappropriate understanding of the petitioner\u2019s position. As I read the question he presents, whether a trial judge is required to disclose the contents of a verdict sheet, particularly, when it \u201cevidences an inconsistent verdict, confusion and/or possible acquittal, and which verdict sheet was only partially covered during oral pronouncement of the verdict by the jury,\u201d the petitioner is simply seeking to assert that the clerk\u2019s failure to read the answers to the other questions, much like the court\u2019s decision not to disclose the contents of the verdict sheet, denied the petitioner the knowledge that it was completed in error and, more important, the opportunity to urge the court to take curative measures before the conclusion of the proceedings. Addressing those circumstances did not require the majority to determine whether a verdict sheet constituted the verdict of the jury. Its relevance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>to our inquiry is in its indication that the failure of the trial court to disclose the contents of the verdict sheet not only ran afoul of the language of Rule 4-326(d), but also, that the court\u2019s and the clerk\u2019s subsequent conduct infringed upon the petitioner\u2019s right to be present at every critical stage of the trial, a right which the rule seeks to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">It is particularly troublesome that the majority fails to sufficiently support its position and, instead, seeks to debunk the notion that a verdict sheet constitutes a communication within the reach of Rule 4r-326(d), with an analysis intended to demonstrate that a verdict sheet is distinguishable from the actual verdict of the jury. I do not undertake to explore that question since, as I have explained, that is not the issue before this Court today. Indeed, even if a verdict sheet is not considered the actual jury verdict, this does not make it any less of a communication which pertains to the action. The majority\u2019s decision to embark upon that line of analysis was, thus, unnecessary, as the issue of distinguishing the verdict sheet from the actual verdict does not, and should not, bear on the conclusion of whether this particular verdict sheet is a communication as contemplated by Rule 4 \u2014 326(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-9\">. Md. Rule 4-326(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">\"Communications with jury.
