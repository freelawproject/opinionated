On August 3, 1999, a jury found Tshiwala guilty of attempted armed robbery, use of a handgun in a felony or crime of violence, first degree assault, and conspiracy to commit armed robbery. On December 2, 1999, another jury found Tshiwala guilty of two counts of armed robbery and two counts of using a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence. Finally, on February 24, 2000, a third jury found Tshiwala guilty of three counts of armed robbery, three counts of using a handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, and one count of first degree assault. The same circuit judge, Vincent E. Ferretti, presided over all three trials. Judge Ferretti, on April, 28, 2000, sentenced Tshiwala to an aggregate of 70 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Tshiwala appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s judgments in an unreported opinion. Tshiwala\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari was denied by this Court, <em>Tshiwala v. State, </em>367 Md. 88, 785 A.2d 1291 (2001) . Subsequently, his certiorari petition filed in the United States Supreme Court was denied by that Court, <em>Tshiwala v. Maryland, </em>535 U.S. 1065, 122 S.Ct. 1934, 152 L.Ed.2d 839 (2002) .</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">Tshiwala then filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County an application for relief under the Maryland Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act, Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 7-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Criminal Procedure Article. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>After a hearing, the Circuit Court granted to Tshiwala the right to file a belated \u201cApplication for Review of Sentence\u201d pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 8-101 through 8-109 of the Criminal Procedure Article and Maryland Rule 4-344.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Tshiwala filed an application for review of his sentences, and a three-judge panel of the Sixth Judicial Circuit (which includes Montgomery County) was convened to review the sentences. The panel consisted of Circuit Administrative Judge Harrington as panel chairperson, Circuit Judge Mason and Circuit Judge Debelius. On February 21, 2007, an order by the review panel was filed which reduced the particular sentences for several of Tshiwala\u2019s convictions, so that the total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>period of imprisonment was reduced from 70 years to 39 years. Thus, the re-imposed sentences totaling 39 years became the only sentences for Tshiwala\u2019s 1999 and 2000 convictions. <em>See Gardner v. State, </em>420 Md. 1, 14, 20 A.3d 801, 809 (2011) (\u201c[W]hen a sentence review panel alters the original sentence ..., the panel\u2019s sentence becomes the \u2018sentence of the court.\u2019 * * * The original sentence is erased, having been superseded\u201d); <em>Hoile v. State, </em>404 Md. 591, 614, 948 A.2d 30, 43-44, <em>cert. denied, </em>555 U.S. 884, 129 S.Ct. 257, 172 L.Ed.2d 146 (2008), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Next, on April 26, 2007, Tshiwala filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(e), a \u201cMotion For Reconsideration of Sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He sought a modification of the sentences imposed by the review panel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This motion was denied in a brief order signed by Circuit Administrative Judge Harrington and Circuit Judges Mason and Debelius. The order did not expressly state that the three judges were acting pursuant to the sentence review statutory provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 8-101 through 8-109 of the Criminal Procedure Article, and the order made no reference to those provisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>In November 2008, Tshiwala instituted the present action by filing in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a \u201cMotion To Correct Illegal Sentence\u201d pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(a). The purported legal basis for this motion was that the three judges who denied reconsideration were acting in their capacity as a sentence review panel under \u00a7 8-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Criminal Law Article, and that \u201cthe sentence review panel lacked jurisdiction to rule on the Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence.\u201d According to Tshiwala, a three-judge sentence review panel, under the statutory provisions and Rule 4-344, is limited to reviewing and acting upon the application for modification of the sentence, but, where the review panel modifies the sentence, the panel has no authority over a motion to reconsider the modified sentence. Tshiwala requested that the motion for reconsideration of the sentences imposed by the review panel \u201cbo considered by his original sentencing judge or another judge of the Circuit Court who was not part of the sentence review panel.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AHK\">Administrative Judge Harrington denied Tshiwala\u2019s \u201cMotion To Correct Illegal Sentence,\u201d stating that reconsideration of the sentences totaling 39 years was denied by the same judges who imposed the sentences, that the original sentencing judge had retired, and that \u201c[tjhere is no requirement that this Court assign this case to another judge.\u201d Tshiwala appealed to the Court of Special Appeals from the order denying his Rule 4-345(a) motion to correct an illegal sentence, and this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Court issued a writ of certiorari prior to any further proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The parties\u2019 arguments before us present essentially two issues: (1) whether Tshiwala\u2019s claim is cognizable under a Rule 4-345(a) motion to correct an illegal sentence; (2) if the claim is cognizable on a motion of the defendant to correct an illegal sentence, whether Judges Harrington, Mason and Debel\u00e1is were authorized to decide Tshiwala\u2019s Rule 4-345(e) motion for reconsideration of his sentences. We shall hold that Tshiwala\u2019s claim is not about alleged illegal sentences and, therefore, cannot be considered under a Rule 4-345(a) motion to correct an illegal sentence. Consequently, we shall not reach the second issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Tshiwala\u2019s complaint clearly does not involve an \u201cillegal sentence\u201d within the meaning of Rule 4-345(a). The only sentences in this case are those, totaling 39 years, imposed by the review panel, and Tshiwala does not contend that they are illegal. As set forth in <em>Montgomery v. State, </em>405 Md. 67, 74, 950 A.2d 77, 81-82 (2008), quoting <em>Evans v. State, </em>382 Md. 248, 278-279, 855 A.2d 291, 309 (2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1150, 125 S.Ct. 1325, 161 L.Ed.2d 113 (2005) (some internal quotation marks deleted),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">\u201ca Rule 4-345(a) motion to correct an illegal sentence is not appropriate where the alleged illegality \u2018did not inhere in [the defendant\u2019s] sentence.\u2019 <em>State v. Kanaras, supra, </em>357 Md. [170,] at 185, 742 A.2d [508,] at 517 [1999]. A motion to correct an illegal sentence ordinarily can be granted only where there is some illegality in the sentence itself or where no sentence should have been imposed.... On the other hand, a trial court error during the sentencing proceeding is not ordinarily cognizable under Rule 4-345(a) where the resulting sentence or sanction is itself lawful. <em>Randall Book Corp. v. State, </em>316 Md. 315, 323, 558 A.2d 715, 719 (1989)....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Moreover, where the sentence imposed is not inherently illegal, and where the matter complained of is a procedural error, the complaint does not concern an illegal sentence for purposes of Rule 4-345(a). <em>Montgomery v. State, supra, </em>405 Md. at 75-77, 950 A.2d at 82-83. A sentence does not become \u201can illegal sentence because of some arguable procedural flaw in the sentencing procedure.\u201d <em>State v. Wilkins, </em>393 Md. 269, 273, 900 A.2d 765, 768 (2006), quoting <em>Corcoran v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 252, 255, 507 A.2d 200, 202, <em>cert. denied, </em>307 Md. 83, 512 A.2d 377, <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 932, 107 S.Ct. 404, 93 L.Ed.2d 357 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>See also Hoile v. State, supra, </em>404 Md. at 622-623, 948 A.2d at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">These principles, delineating the narrow scope of a Rule 4-345(a) motion to correct an illegal sentence, have been recognized and applied in a multitude of this Court\u2019s opinions. <em>See, e.g., Taylor v. State, </em>407 Md. 137, 141 n. 4, 963 A.2d 197, 199 n. 4 (2009) (\u201cHistorically, ... a motion to correct an illegal sentence ... \u201cwas entertained only where the alleged illegality was in the sentence itself or the sentence never should have been imposed,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Baker v. State, </em>389 Md. 127, 133, 883 A.2d 916, 919 (2005)); <em>Chaney v. State, </em>397 Md. 460, 466, 918 A.2d 506, 509-510 (2007) (\u201cThe <em>scope </em>of this privilege, allowing collateral and belated attacks on the sentence and excluding waiver as a bar to relief, is narrow, however. We have consistently defined this category of \u2018illegal sentence\u2019 as limited to those situations in which the illegality inheres in the sentence itself\u2019); <em>Pollard v. State, </em>394 Md. 40, 42, 904 A.2d 500, 501 (2006) (The sentencing judge erroneously \u201cdid not recognize his discretion to suspend a portion of the sentence imposed. Because the alleged illegality did not inhere in the sentence itself, the motion to correct an illegal sentence is not appropriate\u201d); <em>State v. Wilkins, supra, </em>393 Md. at 275, 900 A.2d at 769 (Similar error as that in <em>Pollard, </em>and the Court reiterated that \u201c[a]n error committed by the trial court during the sentencing proceeding is not ordinarily cognizable under Rule 4-345(a) where the resulting sentence or sanction is itself lawful\u201d); <em>Evans v. State, </em>389 Md. 456, 463, 886 A.2d 562, 565 (2005) (\u201c[WJhere the sentence itself was lawful, such a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>[under Rule 4-345(a) ] was not appropriate.... There was nothing intrinsically illegal in Evans\u2019s sentence\u201d); <em>Ridgeway v. State, </em>369 Md. 165, 171, 797 A.2d 1287, 1290 (2002) (The trial court imposed sentences on certain counts where the jury had acquitted the defendant, and Rule 4-345(a) authorized the court\u2019s later order vacating those sentences which were clearly illegal); <em>State v. Kanaras, </em>357 Md. 170, 185, 742 A.2d 508, 517 (1999) (The illegal acts of certain public officials, which denied \u201cinmates in Kanaras\u2019s position the parole consideration to which they were entitled ..., did not render illegal Kanaras\u2019s sentence. The illegality was in the conduct of [the officials]; it did not inhere in Kanaras\u2019s sentence\u201d); <em>Moosavi v. State, </em>355 Md. 651, 662, 736 A.2d 285, 291 (1999) (Where the defendant was charged, convicted and sentenced \u201cunder an entirely inapplicable statute,\u201d the \u201csentence under the inapplicable statute is an illegal sentence [under Rule 4-345(a) ] which may be challenged at any time\u201d); <em>Campbell v. State, </em>325 Md. 488, 508-509, 601 A.2d 667, 677 (1992) (same); <em>Walczak v. State, </em>302 Md. 422, 425-427, 488 A.2d 949, 951 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">It is obvious that Tshiwala\u2019s complaint is not cognizable under Rule 4-345(a). His complaint is not that the sentences totaling 39 years, imposed by the review panel, are in any manner illegal. He has not suggested or intimated that there is any infirmity in the 39-year sentences. Instead, his complaint is aimed at a procedural matter occurring after the imposition of the 39-year sentences, namely the Circuit Court\u2019s handling of his Rule 4-345(e) motion for reconsideration. Tshiwala\u2019s complaint is that the motion should not have been assigned to Judges Harrington, Mason and Debel\u00e1is. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that this assignment was improper, a sentence does not become illegal \u201cbecause of some arguable procedural flaw,\u201d <em>State v. Wilkins, supra, </em>393 Md. at 273, 900 A.2d at 768. This is particularly true when the alleged \u201cprocedural flaw\u201d occurred after sentencing and related to a motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">Tshiwala has phrased his argument in terms of \u201cjurisdiction,\u201d contending that Judges Harrington, Mason and Debel\u00e1is \u201clacked jurisdiction to rule on the Motion for Reconsideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>of the Sentence.\u201d If we assume, for purposes of this case only, that it constituted error for these three judges to rule on the motion, this would not mean that they lacked subject matter jurisdiction or, as it is often called, \u201cfundamental jurisdiction.\u201d There is a difference between a court or judge lacking \u201cfundamental jurisdiction\u201d and improperly \u201cexercising jurisdiction.\u201d Because a court or judge is unauthorized to take particular action or is erroneously exercising jurisdiction, does not mean that the court or judge does not have basic subject matter jurisdiction. This distinction has been explained in numerous opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">In the leading case of <em>First Federated Commodity Trust Corp. v. Commissioner, </em>272 Md. 329, 322 A.2d 539 (1974), the appellant argued that a decree of the Circuit Court was inconsistent with a statute and that, therefore, the Circuit Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. This Court initially pointed out that (272 Md. at 334, 322 A.2d at 543)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">\u201c[wjhat is meant by the lack of jurisdiction in its fundamental sense such as to make an otherwise valid decree void is often misunderstood. As Judge Horney noted for this Court in <em>Moore v. McAllister, </em>216 Md. 497, 507, 141 A.2d 176 (1958):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">\u2018Juridically, jurisdiction refers to two quite distinct concepts: (i) the <em>power </em>of a court to render a valid decree, and (ii) the <em>propriety </em>of granting the relief sought. 1 <em>Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence </em>(5th ed. 1941), Secs. 129-31.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">In a holding that the violation of the statute did not deprive the Circuit Court of subject matter jurisdiction, Judge Digges for this Court set out the definition of subject matter jurisdiction which has repeatedly guided this Court (272 Md. at 335, 322 A.2d at 543):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">\u201cIf by that law which defines the authority of the court, a judicial body is given the <em>power </em>to render a judgment over that class of cases within which a particular one falls, then its action cannot be assailed for want of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>In a much later case where one of the parties asserted that a tribunal\u2019s decision, jurisdiction, <em>Board of License Comm. v. Corridor Wine, Inc., </em>361 Md. 403, 417-418, 761 A.2d 916, 923 (2000), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">\u201cSimply because a statutory provision directs a court ... to decide a case in a particular way, if certain circumstances are shown, does not create an issue going to the court\u2019s ... subject matter jurisdiction. There have been numerous cases in this Court involving the situation where a trial court ... has jurisdiction over the subject matter, but where a statute directs the court ..., under certain circumstances, to exercise its jurisdiction in a particular way, ... and the tribunal erroneously refuses to do so because an error of statutory interpretation or an error of fact. In these situations, this Court has regularly held that the matter did not concern the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial court....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\"><em>See also, e.g., Brown v. State, </em>409 Md. 1, 5-9, 971 A.2d 932, 934-936 (2009); <em>John A. v.

Throughout this action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>Tshiwala has not suggested any illegality in those sentences.
