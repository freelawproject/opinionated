In January of 2009, CWA, representing approximately 5,000 Verizon employees, petitioned to intervene in the settlement discussion and in PSC\u2019s investigation into the quality of Verizon\u2019s service to customers. Intervention was granted in February of 2009, conditioned on CWA\u2019s acceptance of the written testimony in the record filed by other parties, because deadlines established by PSC for filing testimony had passed. The Commission held a hearing on the first petition to settle on February 12 and 13 of 2009. Then, on April 6, 2009, the Commission rejected the settlement proposed in the December 2008 petition, but stated that it would permit a modification and resubmission of the proposal. See PSC Order 82584. On August 28, 2009, Verizon submitted its second petition to settle the six pending cases. Hearings were held on November 3 and 4, 2009. By Order 83137, the Commission approved the second petition to settle on February 2, 2010, with some modifications. On February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>22, 2010, Verizon notified PSC that it had accepted the proposed modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The six cases settled by Order 83137 are: (1) PSC Case 9114, begun in August 2007 to investigate Verizon\u2019s service quality as a result of consumer complaints; (2) PSC Case 9133, begun in October 2007, which rejected Verizon\u2019s requested price increases, which were not tied to service quality; (3) PSC Case 9120 which reviewed whether Verizon could bundle services with affiliates and increase its prices without violating Verizon\u2019s Price Cap Plan;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (4) PSC Case 9072, which reviewed Verizon\u2019s request to reclassify some of its services as competitive; (5) PSC Case 9121, which investigated local calling areas and foreign exchange prices; and (6) PSC Case 9123, which was filed by the Office of People\u2019s Counsel following complaints by customers who had switched from the older copper wire system to a fiber optic service. Case 9123 sought to determine if Verizon was adequately informing its customers of the difference between the two services.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Order 83137 is sixty-six pages long. It found that \u201cVerizon\u2019s service quality performance ha[d] fallen far below [PSC\u2019s] regulatory standards, and neither competitive market forces nor an open service quality investigation ha[d] improved Verizon\u2019s performance.\u201d The regulatory standard of principal concern on this appeal is COMAR 20.45.04.08. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-6\">\u201c.08 Trouble Reports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">\u201cA. Each utility shall provide for the receipt of customer trouble reports at all hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">\u201cB. Trouble Reporting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-10\">\u201c(1) Arrangement shall be made to clear all trouble of an emergency nature at all hours, consistent with the bona fide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>needs of the customers and the personal safety of the utility personnel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-4\">\u201c(2) Arrangement shall be made to clear all out-of-service troubles, not requiring unusual repairs, within 8 hours of the report to the company (excluding clock hours between 5 p.m. and 9 a.m. weekdays and Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">\u201c(3) Arrangements shall be made to clear all non-out-of-service troubles, not requiring unusual repairs, within 24 hours of the report to the company (excluding clock hours between 5 p.m. and 9 a.m. weekdays, and Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">\u201c(4) If unusual repairs are required, or rehabilitation programs or other factors preclude clearing of reported troubles promptly, when practical, the customer shall be so notified and an estimated time given as to when the trouble will be cleared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">\u201cC. Appointment Missed. The utility shall grant appointments to customers on reported troubles which are consistent with the objective intervals of clearance as specified in \u00a7 B(l), (2), and (3), above. If appointments with the customer cannot be kept, the utility shall make every reasonable effort to notify the customer in timely fashion of the delay. The number of appointments the utility fails to meet may not be greater than 20 percent of the total commitments given per month with a district service center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">\u201cD. Subsequent Trouble Reports. The utility shall make reasonable efforts to prevent subsequent reports through the proper and effective administration of \u00a7\u00a7 B and C, above. To the extent possible, the utility shall grant appointments which are consistent with the needs of the customer. The rate of the subsequent reports may not be greater than 13 percent of the total reports per month registered within a district service center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">\u201cE. Repeated Trouble Reports. It is incumbent upon the utility to make the necessary tests and inspections on reported troubles to prevent customers from again experi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>encing the same type trouble. These tests and inspections shall include all necessary and reasonable repairs and rehabilitation efforts which the utility feels are necessary to keep repeated reports at minimum levels. The rate of the repeated reports may not be greater than 25 percent of total trouble reports registered per month within a district service center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">\u201cF. The utility shall keep such records of customer complaints and trouble reports as will enable it to review and analyze its procedures and actions as an aid in rendering improved service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The Order further compared and contrasted the second settlement offer with the previously rejected first offer. In particular, PSC noted that Verizon\u2019s first proposal for settlement included the following provisions that were unacceptable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">\u201cRetrospective credits for missed appointments could not exclude customers who suffered missed appointments but had their complaints resolved within 24 hours of the missed appointment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-7\">\u201cThe two-day proxy for the eight-hour standard set forth in COMAR 20.45.04.08[B(2) ] could not average times to restore service for businesses and residential customers.<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">\u201cVerizon could not exclude customers [from retrospective credits] \u201cwho agreed or failed to object to Verizon\u2019s standard appointment offer by deeming them to have agreed affirmatively to an appointment longer than two calendar days from their call\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">\u201cThe next installation missed appointment metric could not exempt customers moving from regulated voice service over copper lines to regulated voice service over fiber.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>\u201cThe amount of Verizon money at risk as a function of its failure to satisfy customer service metrics must be increased so that it \u2018mirror[ed] more closely the revenue increases Verizon seeks under the current Price Cap Plan and the new AFOR the proposed settlement would create.\u2019<footnotemark>[6]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-4\">\u201cMissed appointment compliance must be measured monthly rather than quarterly, because COMAR 20.45.04.08C prescribes a monthly standard, and Verizon could not meet the missed appointment metric by extending its standard appointment times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-5\">\u201cThe Service Quality Plan must ensure State-wide consistency, so that Verizon cannot comply with State-wide standards by \u2018concentrating its efforts on the Baltimore-Washington corridor and leaving other parts of the State with sub-standard service.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-6\">\u201cThe Service Quality Plan could not terminate automatically due to the passage of time or erosion of Verizon\u2019s market share, but rather only after Verizon \u2018meets and sustains the required level of performance ... for four consecutive quarters.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Order 83137 discussed at length Verizon\u2019s response to each of these issues. Particularly relevant here is the discussion of the \u201cService Quality Plan\u201d (Plan), which the Commission noted was the \u201cheart\u201d of the second settlement offer. The Plan created an AFOR. It \u201cdefine[d] new proxies, new and larger penalties if Verizon fail[ed] to meet these proposed standards, and a more stringent, performance-based end-point.\u201d Order 83137 enumerated five tenets of the Plan that would be implemented by Verizon. Specifically, (1) the Plan would measure Verizon\u2019s performance in hours a residential voice customer was without service, instead of by the two-day proxy, and measure without including business customers;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (2) the Plan would measure Verizon\u2019s performance both on a statewide basis and also according to four intra-state regions, thereby specifically addressing PSC\u2019s concern that parts of the State, outside of the Baltimore-Washington corridor, were not receiving proper quality of service; (3) Verizon increased its \u201cmoney at risk\u201d to $6 million per year, which more closely \u201cmirrored\u201d the revenue increase Verizon sought under the new AFOR;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (4) the Commission noted that Verizon contin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ued problematically to propose excluding customers who agreed to Verizon\u2019s standard appointment time from the calculation of its service quality metrics; and (5) consistent with the prior order rejecting Verizon\u2019s first settlement offer, \u201cVerizon would be released from its crediting obligations ... only after meeting both the out-of-service and missed appointments metrics for four consecutive quarters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">In its lengthy analysis, the Commission found that the settlement contained \u201csignificant public benefits\u201d including credits to compensate customers for extended loss of service, a connection between future price increases and improved quality of service, reductions in the price of foreign exchange service, funding for outreach programs to educate lower income customers regarding telephone service and possible discounts, and the development of a program which would enable disabled and elderly customers to pre-certify for priority repair service. The Commission further found that the AFOR would \u201cbenefit Verizon\u2019s customers ... by providing a framework for improved service at reasonable rates ... [and] also by bringing about what [it] hope[d would] be a productive and long-lived regulatory d\u00e9tente.\u201d The Commission concluded that \u201capproval [of the proposed AFOR was] consistent with the public interest and the statutory standard for Alternative Forms of Regulation\u201d pursuant to PUC \u00a7 4-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">CWA sought judicial review of Order 83137 in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City which affirmed the Commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>approval of the AFOR. CWA then appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. This Court, on its own motion, granted certiorari prior to consideration of the case by the intermediate appellate court. <em>Communications Workers v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>420 Md. 463, 23 A.3d 895 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Additional facts will be stated in the discussion of particular issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">CWA\u2019s Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">CWA\u2019s attack on the AFOR is directed primarily at the service quality aspects of Order 83137. CWA\u2019s principal contention is that the language of PUC \u00a7 4-301(b)(l)(ii), allowing the Commission to adopt an AFOR if it finds that the AFOR \u201cprotects consumers by ... <em>ensuring </em>the quality, availability, and reliability of telecommunications services throughout the State,\u201d requires literal interpretation. (Emphasis added). Because the Commission recognized in its discussion of the second settlement offer that the end result after implementation of the AFOR for service quality was not assured, CWA submits that PSC did not meet the statutory requirement of \u201censuring\u201d success, and thus the Order is \u201caffected by an error of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Casting the same argument in factual terms, CWA contends that there is \u201cno evidence in the record that the Proposed Settlement\u201d will meet the \u00a7 4-301(b)(l)(ii) standard, as CWA construes it. Appellant says that the \u201cassertions by Verizon\u2019s lone witness that Verizon\u2019s proposal will work\u201d are unsubstantiated. The Union particularly criticizes Order 83137 because the methods by which Verizon is to achieve the performance metrics are left to Verizon to develop and are not dictated by PSC. Rather, in addition to the reports on OOS clearances, the Commission required Verizon to file an annual report setting forth Verizon\u2019s operational plan. The Union avers that Verizon did not \u201cundertaken any assessments of the problems with the existing copper network, the amount of funds that would be required to repair and maintain [it], nor the number of personnel that would be required ... to provid[e] adequate service.\u201d CWA asserts that \u00a7 4-301 requires Verizon to outline a specific plan before the AFOR may be adopted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Thus, the Union concludes, PSC \u201chas put the cart before the horse. It has approved the AFOR and then asked for a plan rather than asking for the plan in order to determine if it can approve the AFOR.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">CWA next argues that the Commission erroneously employed a different standard than that required by law when it approved the second settlement offer. The assertion is that PSC was not permitted to balance the interests of Verizon with the interests of the consumers in deciding the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">CWA\u2019s third argument is that the Order \u201cconsistently misstate[d] the position of the CWA set forth in [its] testimony and briefing.\u201d CWA states that, contrary to the notions PSC expressed in the Order, CWA\u2019s witness recommended rejection of the second offer for settlement. This \u201cmischaracterization,\u201d in CWA\u2019s view, constitutes grounds for reversal because the Commission \u201cuse[d] as one of [its] key building blocks ... [the fact] that no party contended that the Commission should reject the proposal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Verizon\u2019s Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Verizon contends that CWA\u2019s argument, based on the term \u201censuring,\u201d in PUC \u00a7 4 \u2014 301(b)(l)(ii), is unsupported by case law and would create an unworkable requirement. If PSC must \u201cguarantee and prove a definitive and specific future outcome,\u201d Verizon submits, any decision by PSC would be legally insufficient, \u201csince by its very nature, PSC must make predictive judgments.\u201d More broadly, Verizon avers that \u201cno agency or administrative or judicial body can ever guarantee in advance what will happen in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Verizon cites <em>In re Inquiry into Alternative Forms of Regulating Telephone Cos., </em>Case No. 8715, 174 P.U.R.4th 120, at *3, Order No. 73011 (Md. PSC Nov. 8, 1996), which approved the original AFOR proposed by Verizon. There, PSC said that \u201c[w]e <em>expect </em>this plan to protect consumers, improve efficiency, encourage modernization of services and equipment, and enable [Verizon] to respond to the emergence of competition and rapid technological advancement in the telecommunications industry.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>Responding to CWA\u2019s argument about balancing, Verizon denies that considering the interests of all the parties when reaching a decision is creating a new standard for approval of an AFOR. The standard applied, Verizon states, was the public interest based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">PSC\u2019s Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">PSC makes many of the arguments asserted by Verizon, and it advances several other points. Although the case presents the settlement of six cases in, or originating in, the PSC, and represents a resolution by which competing interests gave in on some issues and benefitted from others, the Commission did not simply compare the second proposal to the previously rejected proposal. Rather, PSC analyzed \u201cthe [second] Proposal as a whole against the statutory AFOR standard and decide[d] independently that it qualifie[d] on its own merits.\u201d In addition to the record made when the Commission specifically addressed the second proposal, PSC points out that, when approving the second settlement offer, the Commission reviewed the record on the first settlement proposal, consisting of \u201chundreds of pages of pre-filed testimony and exhibits, including both fact and expert witnesses, addressing the state of competition for telecommunications services in Maryland, pricing, and other issues bearing on the appropriate structure for an AFOR for Verizon.\u201d Further, the Commission reviewed the transcripts of the hearings and the records developed in the cases resolved by Order 83137.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The Commission also notes that if the settlement offer is rejected, Verizon and the PSC would still have to litigate the six cases resolved by the settlement offer. This is risky, according to PSC, because \u201cthe ultimate disposition of [those] cases in the courts could limit the Commission to incenting Verizon solely through the threat of civil fines and resulting in Maryland consumers receiving no bill credits for poor service.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Here, we review an order of the Commission that approves and enforces a settlement of six contested cases. \u201cConsent orders are final agency orders and reviewable as if the product of a hearing.\u201d 3 C.H. Koch, Jr., <em>Administrative Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 10:13, at 405 (3d ed. 2010). Consequently, we shall review Order 83137 under the standards applicable to the agency\u2019s decision in a contested case.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">PUC \u00a7 3-203 governs judicial review of a final PSC order. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">\u201cEvery final ... order ... of the Commission is prima facie correct and shall be affirmed unless clearly shown to be:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">\u201c(1) unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">\u201c(2) outside the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the Commission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">\u201c(3) made on unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">\u201c(4) arbitrary or capricious;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-11\">\u201c(5) affected by other error of law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-12\">\u201c(6) if the subject of review is an order entered in a contested proceeding after a hearing, unsupported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">So long as a reasoning mind could have reached the same conclusion as the agency, we will not disturb the agency\u2019s decision. <em>Public Serv.

Because the Commission is well informed by its own expertise and specialized staff, a court reviewing a factual matter will not substitute its own judgment on review of a fairly debatable matter. <em>Public Serv.

As we observed in <em>Spencer [v. Maryland State Bd. of Pharm., </em>380 Md. 515, 846 A.2d 341 (2004) ], when an agency acts in its discretionary capacity, it is taking actions that are specific to its mandate and expertise and, unlike conclusions of law or findings of fact, have a non-judicial nature. For this reason, we \u2018owe a higher level of deference to functions specifically committed to the agency\u2019s discretion.\u2019 <em>Spencer, </em>380 Md. 515, 529-31, 846 A.2d 341, 349-50.... \u2018[A]s long as an administrative agency\u2019s exercise of discretion does not violate regulations, statutes, common law principles, due process and other constitutional requirements, it is ordinarily unreviewable by the courts.\u2019 <em>Maryland State Police v.

Courts thus generally only intervene when an agency exercises its discretion \u2018arbitrarily\u2019 or \u2018capriciously.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 558, 625 A.2d at 922.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 199, 849 A.2d at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Substantial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The aspects of the alternative form of regulation that are challenged by the Union are those designed to ensure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>reliability of Verizon\u2019s residential voice network. To achieve that end, the Commission ordered, <em>inter alia, </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">\u2022 Verizon comply with the Service Quality Plan that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">a) established performance standards for Verizon\u2019s restoring out-of-service troubles that apply State-wide, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">b) required Verizon to pay up to $6 million in credits to customers if out-of-service trouble reports were not cleared in accordance with the standards;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">\u2022 Verizon\u2019s request for a rate increase for residential basic service customers be tied to defined tangible improvement in that service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">\u2022 Verizon be required to file monthly performance reports; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">\u2022 Verizon be required to file annually an operation plan detailing the steps it will take to meet the service quality metrics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">The Commission determined that these features of the AFOR met the very broad requirements of PUC \u00a7 4-301. That type of determination is at the essence of the discretion vested in the PSC by the General Assembly. Simply because the Commission chose to require Verizon to meet certain goals, and did not dictate specific means for achieving those goals, does not make the decision arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">One aspect of Order 83137 dealt with copper retirement. This relates to the replacement, or potential replacement, of copper loops and sub-loops by a fiber optical system (FiOS). Order 83137 rejected a recommendation of the PSC\u2019s hearing examiner in Case 1923 that a work group be established to create a set of specific copper retirement rules. Because the record before the Commission demonstrated that Verizon was not currently retiring any copper facilities in Maryland, the Commission concluded that it was unnecessary to convene a work group at that time. We do not understand CWA to argue for an immediate convening of a work group.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">Rather, CWA argues that the Commission did not require Verizon to invest money or personnel into its copper network, and, in that way, the Union utilizes the copper retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>aspects of Verizon\u2019s business to argue that the Service Quality Plan is inadequate. The Union asks how the Commission could enter Order 88137 \u201cif Verizon doesn\u2019t know what is wrong, how much it will cost to fix it[,] and how many people will be needed to repair and maintain the existing copper network?\u201d The argument merely points out one aspect of the difference between an order that lays out specifics as to how Verizon is to conduct its business and the format used in the AFOR of relying on incentives to cause Verizon to follow an operational plan that would meet the performance standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Also, the PSC staff agreed with Verizon\u2019s request for approval of the second settlement proposal. For the reasons set forth in its report to the Commission, the staff opined that \u201cas a whole [the proposal] is in the public interest [and] meets the requirements of PUC Article \u00a7 4-301.\u201d That report furnishes substantial evidence and makes the issue fairly debatable. <em>See Board of County Comm\u2019rs v. Turf Valley Assocs., </em>247 Md. 556, 233 A.2d 753 (1967). There, a developer sought to reclassify 730 acres from a one and two family residential zoning district into garden apartment and shopping center districts, by analogizing the request to the grant of a special exception. There was no neighborhood opposition to the request. This Court held, reversing the circuit court, that the reclassification could not be sustained absent substantial proof of mistake in the original zoning or subsequent change in conditions. The developer alternatively argued that the change or mistake rule had been satisfied. The planning commission, however, had opposed the reclassification for the reasons stated in its report to the county commissioners. Speaking through Judge Oppenheimer, this Court held that \u201c[t]hat report of itself, constituted probative evidence for the denial of the petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 233 A.2d at 756-57. <em>See also Storch v. Zoning Board, </em>267 Md. 476, 488-89, 298 A.2d 8, 15 (1972) (holding \u201cthat a Report by a Planning Board or by its Technical Staff is, in itself, sufficient evidence to make a Zoning Board\u2019s action fairly debatable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Further, in the course of the hearing, the Commission had Verizon furnish \u201cstatistics applying the new proxy to [out-of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>service] data going back as far as January 2007.\u201d PSC found this data \u201cextremely useful,\u201d because it helped the Commission to \u201cunderstand Verizon\u2019s baseline performance against the proposed standard, at a time when the Service Quality Plan\u2019s credits were not in place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Order 83137 is additionally supported by substantial evidence of a more conventional type. Verizon\u2019s expert witness explained how the details of the second settlement proposal met or addressed each objection and concern that the Commission had raised concerning the first settlement proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">There was substantial evidence to support Order 83137.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u201cEnsuring\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Faced with a huge administrative record that overflows with substantial evidence supporting the challenged AFOR, CWA places its principal emphasis on a narrow construction of \u201censuring\u201d in PUC \u00a7 4-301(b)(l)(ii) (\u201censuring the quality, availability, and reliability of telecommunications services throughout the State\u201d). The argument is based on a reservation expressed by the Commission over whether its Service Quality Plan would motivate Verizon sufficiently to attain the performance and, thereby, the statutory goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The Commission\u2019s reservation, in context, is fairly presented in the following passage from Order 83137:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">\u201cWe have serious concerns about whether and how Verizon will bring about the improvements it is committing in the Proposal to make. Verizon admitted during the hearing that neither the measures it had taken since our original Show Cause Order in Case No. 9114, including hiring and moving technicians and increasing its preventive maintenance budget, nor the looming threat of our service quality investigation had succeeded in improving Verizon\u2019s service quality performance. Its monthly performance reports bear this out. Verizon also testified that it had hired additional new technicians, but the Union questioned whether Verizon had increased the number of available technicians, particularly since it also declared a surplus of 165 technicians in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Maryland. Either way, Verizon is not in compliance with our service quality regulations at this writing, and something has to change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">\u201cIf we knew with certainty what set of actions would bring about the necessary improvement in Verizon\u2019s service quality, we would have ordered them long ago. Because we do not, we can and will do the two next best things. <em>First, </em>with the modifications we have made above, the Service Quality Plan will establish the levels of performance we expect Verizon to attain, and will impose serious, ongoing sanctions (in the form of credits to customers) until Verizon actually achieves them. <em>Second, </em>whether or not <em>we </em>could formulate an operational plan designed to achieve these improvements, <em>Verizon </em>must do so if it is to have any hope of achieving them. Accordingly, as part of the ongoing reporting we will require as part of this Order, we direct Verizon to file annually an Operational Plan detailing the steps it will take to meet the service quality metrics. We will not prescribe a particular plan, nor will we substitute our judgment for Verizon\u2019s as to what operational steps will best accomplish its service quality goals. But we will review the Plan to determine whether it contains sufficient detail to allow us to monitor Verizon\u2019s progress, we will require monthly reporting against the Plan, and we will take appropriate action if the Plan fails to improve service quality after a reasonable period of time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Despite the reservation, the Commission, in its discretion, found that, -with certain modifications, \u201capproval [of the second settlement proposal] is consistent with the public interest and the statutory standard for Alternative Forms of Regulation.\u201d The reservation is no more than an expression of the concept articulated by Oliver Wendell Holmes: \u201cCertitude is not the test of certainty. We have been cock-sure of many things that were not so.\u201d O.W. Holmes, <em>The Natural Law, </em>printed in Collected Legal Papers, 311 (Harcourt, Brace and Howe 1920).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Examples of usages of the term, \u201censure,\u201d in contexts where it cannot possibly mean a completely certain result, may be found in William S. Hein &amp; Co., Inc., <em>Modem Dictionary for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>the Legal Profession </em>(3d ed. 2001). There, \u201cManaged Care Organization\u201d is defined as an organization that contracts for prearranged fee schedule services by health care providers, whose \u201cdecisions are systematically reviewed by the M.C.O. to ensure that the care provided was medically necessary and cost efficient.\u201d Query: Why do governments have Medicare and Medicaid fraud units? \u201cQuality Assurance\u201d is defined as \u201ca system of controls used in manufacturing to ensure that the finished product is complete, operational and ready to sell to the consumer.\u201d Query: Why are there product liability cases? \u201cNational Conference of Bar Examiners\u201d is defined as a nonprofit organization which prepares uniform bar examination components and \u201cchecks the personal references and employment histories of J.D. candidates and contacts law enforcement agencies to ensure that individuals taking the exams are competent and ethical.\u201d Query: Why do we have legal malpractice cases and an Attorney Grievance Commission?</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><em>The Oxford English Dictionary </em>(Clarendon Press, corrected reissue 1933) lists nine meanings for \u201censure.\u201d They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">\u201c1. To make (a person) mentally sure; to convince, render confident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">\u201c2. To give security to, pledge one\u2019s faith to (a person) for the execution of a promise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">\u201c3. To pledge one\u2019s credit (to a person); to tell (a person) confidently that something is true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">\u201c4. To guarantee (a thing) to a person; to warrant (a fact).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">\u201c5. To engage (a person) by pledge or contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">\u201c6. To secure, make safe (against, from risks).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-11\">\u201c7. To insure (a person\u2019s life, property, etc.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-12\">\u201c8. To make certain the occurrence or arrival of (an event); or the attainment of (a result); = ASSURE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-13\">\u201c9. To make (a thing) sure to or for a person; to secure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">The Commission\u2019s finding of compliance with \u00a7 4-301 employs the second usage. Having established criteria for the quality and reliability of telecommunications services in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Quality Service Plan, PSC required Verizon to give security, in the form of the $6 million of at-risk funds, to ensure the execution of Verizon\u2019s promise to meet those standards. CWA\u2019s argument, on the other hand, employs the eighth possible meaning by saying that the Commission must make certain the attainment of the performance standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Assuming that \u201censuring\u201d creates an ambiguity in the statute, we turn to the rules of statutory construction. \u201cWhere the meaning of the plain language of the statute, or the language itself, is unclear, \u201cwe seek to discern legislative intent from surrounding circumstances, such as legislative history, prior caselaw, and the purposes upon which the statutory framework was based.\u2019 \u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel v.

The issue was \u201cwhether telecommunication rates set pursuant to Maryland Code (1957,1995 Repl.Vol.), Article 78, \u00a7 69(e), an \u2018alternative\u2019 form of regulation, must meet the \u2018just and reasonable rates\u2019 requirement of the traditional rate of return regulatory scheme.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel, </em>355 Md. at 6, 733 A.2d at 998.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Following the passage of \u00a7 69(e), the Commission received four Price Cap proposals on which hearings were held. Thereafter, PSC issued the order being contested in <em>People\u2019s Counsel. </em>\u201cUnder [this] plan, the PSC set the initial price for telecommunication services, with future price changes being controlled by a formula that [took] into account the rate of inflation, the increasing productivity of the Company and costs ... that are beyond the Company\u2019s control.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We noted that the approved plan adopted a \u201c \u2018broader and more forward-looking measure of rate reasonableness\u2019 \u201d than could otherwise be had without the adoption of an AFOR. <em>Id. </em>at 7, 733 A.2d at 998. Because \u00a7 69(e) \u201cha[d] never been interpreted, much less consistently applied, for a substantial period of time,\u201d and because PSC\u2019s \u201cproffered interpretation ... [was] neither long-standing nor a product of a \u2018process of reasoned elaboration,\u2019 the scope of [our] review [was] essentially plenary, with a primary reliance upon the plain meaning and purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17-18, 733 A.2d at 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">We held that PSC \u201cproperly exercised its discretion, as authorized by the General Assembly\u201d when it interpreted \u201cjust and reasonable rates.\u201d Looking to the legislative history of \u00a7 69(e), we said that \u201cthere is no dispute that \u00a7 69(e) was enacted to achieve three legitimate goals: (1) provide price and quality protection for Maryland customers, (2) encourage the development of competition in the regulated telecommunications industry, and (3) protect the public interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 733 A.2d at 1010. \u201cTo achieve these goals, the Legislature authorized the Commission to regulate telephone companies \u2018by means of alternative forms of regulation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>We stated that the AFORs were \u201cintended to achieve the goals enumerated and that they are, therefore, rationally related to achievement of those objectives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When approving the Price Cap Plan, PSC had found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the \u201c \u2018plan also ensure[d] the quality, availability, and reliability of telecommunications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>services throughout the <em>State.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>(quoting PSC Order No. 73011). We held that the Commission was not arbitrary in its definitional interpretations of \u00a7 69(e), that its findings were supported by \u201c \u2018rational analysis,\u2019 \u201d and that it did not abuse its discretion in approving the Price Cap Plan as an AFOR under then \u00a7 69(e). <em>Id. </em>at 30, 733 A.2d at 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><em>People\u2019s Counsel </em>determined that the General Assembly intended that an AFOR could be forward looking and goal oriented. Because precognition is not an attribute of mere humans, the General Assembly could not have intended that the Commission be absolutely certain, when ordering the subject AFOR, that it would achieve its stated goals. The Commission did not commit an error of law by expressing the commonsense observation that it could not guarantee the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">PSC Statement of Union Position</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In Order 83137 the Commission at one point stated that the Union \u201cstopped short of asking us to reject the Proposal entirely,\u201d and, at another point, the Commission observed that \u201c[n]o party contended that we should reject the Proposal completeIy[.]\u201d CWA then points to the testimony of its witness concerning the second settlement offer, and to statements in its brief before the PSC, urging that the proposal be rejected. It seems to us that the Commission was saying that CWA was not objecting to each and every aspect of the entire settlement package while the Union was saying that, because of the reasons that it gave, the proposal should be completely rejected. The dispute is immaterial to the merits of our judicial review. The power of the Commission is not restricted by a need for the consent of intervenors before adopting an AFOR, and reading. Order 81317 as a whole makes plain that the result was not intended to be dependent on the Union\u2019s approval. It is sufficient that there was substantial evidence to support that order and that the Commission made no error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>New Standard for Approval</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">The Commission stated that \u201c[i]n making the decisions set forth in this Order, we have sought to balance the interests of [Verizon] with the interests of its customers and our State as a whole.\u201d CWA says that \u00a7 4-301 contains no balancing test and that the correct standard to be applied \u201cis grounded in the protection of consumers, the encouragement of competition and the public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">At any proceeding before the Commission, a party, including a public service company, may \u201cpresent evidence[] and present argument[.]\u201d PUC \u00a7 3-107(1). Obviously, the Commission should consider that evidence. Further, the public interest and the protection of consumers requires that the public service company be able to deliver its service at fair and reasonable charges. This necessitates considering, or \u201cbalancing,\u201d the interests of the public service company.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">For all the foregoing reasons, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b456-15\">.
