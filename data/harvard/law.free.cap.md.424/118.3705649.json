Moore appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed his conviction in a reported opinion, <em>Moore v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 90, 983 A.2d 583 (2009), and we granted his Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, 412 Md. 689, 990 A.2d 1046 (2010), to address the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\">1. Is proof of the operability of the firearm a prerequisite to a conviction for illegal possession of a regulated firearm [under Section 5-133 of the Public Safety Article, Maryland Code (2003) ]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\">2. If so, was the evidence insufficient to prove operability in the present case? <footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Although the handgun in question could certainly have qualified as operable,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the purposes of our opinion, we shall assume it was not and shall hold that a firearm, as it is defined in Section 5 \u2014 101(h), does not have to be operable in order to sustain a conviction under Section 5-133(c), which prohibits a person convicted of a crime of violence or offenses related to the sale and distribution of controlled dangerous substances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>from possessing a regulated firearm. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In July 2007, a robbery and shooting took place that ultimately resulted in the execution of a search warrant at Rodney Taureen Moore\u2019s residence, during which a .32 caliber, Harrington and Richardson, Model II revolver was recovered from beneath his bed. Moore was indicted by a grand jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, wherein it was alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that he \u201cdid unlawfully possess, own, carry and transport a regulated firearm after having been convicted of an offense,\u201d based upon a conviction, in 2005, for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, one of the enumerated offenses in Section 5-133(c)(l)(ii).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Moore filed a motion <em>in limine </em>prior to trial, in which he asked the court to determine whether, as a matter of law, a conviction under Section 5-133(c) required proof of the operability of the firearm. In denying Moore\u2019s motion, the judge ultimately relied on the \u201cplain and ordinary meaning of the definition\u201d of firearm located in Section 5-101(h) and determined that, for a \u201cconviction under Section 5-133 of the Public Safety Article, the handgun does not have to be operable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Thereafter, after the State agreed to <em>nolle prosequi </em>the remaining counts in the Indictment upon a finding of guilt, Moore entered a not guilty plea on an agreed statement of facts directed at Count Nine, in which a violation of Section 5-133(c) was alleged. The State\u2019s Attorney proffered the agreed statement of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Your Honor, if the case were to have gone to trial, the [Sjtate would have presented the following evidence: That is that, on July 5th, 2007, detectives from the violent crimes unit of the Baltimore County Police Department were called upon to investigate a robbery and shooting that occurred here in Baltimore County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">During the course of that investigation, two witnesses came forward with information at that time that implicated this defendant, Rodney Moore, as well as the co-defendants later also charged in this case. Those two witnesses came forward approximately two to three weeks after the actual robbery and shooting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-6\">The information provided led to the detectives obtaining a lawful search and seizure warrant for the residence of this defendant, Rodney Moore. The detectives received information that the defendant, Rodney Moore, lived at the location, as well as his girlfriend and possibily one of the other co-defendants that was involved in the robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">When the tactical squad entered, they found this defendant, Rodney Moore, and his girlfriend in bed in the master bedroom, and they also recovered a handgun that was under the bed where the defendant was sleeping. They described the gun as in close proximity to this defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-9\">The gun recovered was a .32 caliber revolver, Harrington and Richardson, Model II. It was a hinge frame revolver. It did bear a proper serial number.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">The detectives also recovered underneath the bed a shell casing, a fired casing and projectile. Both of those items were wrapped in a paper towel under the very same bed. Additionally, when the handgun was recovered, detectives checked it to make sure it was safe, and they did find that it had one loaded round in the cylinder. Those items were properly seized and packaged and sent to the lab for analysis additionally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">The State\u2019s Attorney then described the forensic examination that ensued after police recovered the gun:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The handgun had been sent for more forensic examination to the Baltimore County crime lab. Michael Thomas, a firearm examiner, did analyze both the handgun, as well as the fired casing and the fired projectile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\">Mr. Thomas\u2019s findings, specifically with regard to the handgun, was that it was defective. Though defective, it was tested and found to fire. Mr. Thomas, for his own safety, replaced a latch on the handgun that was cracked in order to test fire the gun. Once he did so, it did. It was found to properly function and fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">If Mr. Thomas were called to testify, he would be offered as an expert in forensic or in firearm identification. He would indicate that he, although defective, he did essentially fix the handgun for his own safety. He would indicate, if he would not have fixed the handgun and test fired it, the gun would have gone off, but it could have exploded or the shell casing could have come back and hit him in the head, and that was reason for fixing the gun, and that is for his own safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The State\u2019s Attorney described that, in 2005, Moore had been convicted of a disqualifying offense that prohibited him from possessing a regulated firearm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-7\">Your honor, the defendant, on May 5th, 2005, was convicted of a crime which prohibits him from possessing a regulated firearm. As a indicated, he was convicted May 5, 2005, of possession with intent to distribute cocaine. He was convicted in Baltimore City, and his sentence was two years, suspend all but a month, probably a time served type of sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">He is prohibited from possessing a regulated firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The State\u2019s Attorney, then, further described the weapon found beneath Moore\u2019s bed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">The .32 caliber revolver in this case is a regulated firearm. It is a handgun with a barrel less than 16 inches in length, and it expels \u2014 is designed to expel or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by action of an explosive, and at a minimum is certainly also a frame of such a weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>Following the State\u2019s proffer, Moore\u2019s counsel offered the following additions and modifications to the agreed statement of facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">Your Honor, by way of additions or modifications, ... that would have been testified to concerning the test firing of the gun, itself, the latch, itself, was repaired, actually replaced from another gun. It was taken from another gun and placed onto that gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">Also defective in the gun was what is called a recoil cap, which is where the hammer engages the back of the shell. That was actually missing from the gun, which would cause one to fire the gun to have to clear the chamber and remove residue or bullet material that would be in there, in order to get the gun to fire again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">Also, what would have been testified to was that, when test firing the gun, the actual ammunition being used in the gun in its current state was .38 automatic ammunition, the problem being the gun, itself, was a revolver. So in order for it to test fire, the expert actually took a regular .38 Smith and Wesson casing made for the revolver and replaced it with an automatic bullet, making a new bullet to further ensure the safety of the test fire, itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">So the only addition or modification placed on the record or that I would like placed on the record is that the gun, in the condition in which it was found, was never test fired. The testimony of the expert was that he believes it would have fired in some way. Whether the bullet went sideways, forward or backward is still open to conjecture.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Following the State\u2019s recitation and the proffered additions, Moore renewed his motion regarding the operability of the firearm, again arguing that Section 5-133(c) required proof of the operability of the firearm. The judge again denied Moore\u2019s motion, adopting the reasoning set forth in his previous ruling. Moore then moved for judgment of acquittal, which the judge also denied. Thereafter, Moore was found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>guilty and sentenced to five years\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moore noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Before the Court of Special Appeals, Moore argued that, under Section 5-133(c), the State must prove operability of the firearm in order to secure a conviction. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed his conviction, however, determining that the Circuit Court Judge properly denied Moore\u2019s motion, because, based on the plain language of Section 5 \u2014 101(h), \u201cfirearm\u201d includes both operable and inoperable weapons. <em>Moore v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 90, 110, 983 A.2d 583, 595 (2009). The intermediate appellate court further determined that the legislative history of Section 5 \u2014 101(h) indicated that the Legislature clearly intended the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d to be consistent with the federal definition for \u201cfirearm,\u201d which was located in Section 921(a)(3), Title 18 of the United States Code, which also does not require operability. <em>Id. </em>at 110, 983 A.2d at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The State and Moore both agree that the crux of this case is whether a handgun must be operable to be considered a \u201cfirearm\u201d under Section 5-101(h) of the Public Safety Article; they disagree as to whether that Section requires operability. We are thus presented with an issue of statutory interpretation, the well-settled principles of which we recently observed in <em>Ray v. State, </em>410 Md. 384, 978 A.2d 736 (2009):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6\">In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules. We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. Occasionally we see fit to examine extrinsic sources of legislative intent merely as a check of our reading of a statute\u2019s plain language. In such instances, we may find useful the context of a statute, the overall statutory scheme, and archival legislative history of relevant enactments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute. When the statute is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is axiomatic that the language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation; rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 404-05, 978 A.2d at 747-48 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Section 5-101(h) of the Public Safety Article defines a \u201cfirearm\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">(h) <em>Firearm. </em>(1) \u201cFirearm\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">(i) a weapon that expels, is designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">(ii) the frame or receiver of such a weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-11\">(2) \u201cFirearm\u201d includes a starter gun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">Moore argues that Section 5-101 (h) is ambiguous and incapable of plain meaning analysis, because our jurisprudence \u201con the requirement of operability in [other] firearm offenses makes the meaning of the definition of \u2018firearm\u2019 far from \u2018plain.\u2019 \u201d Moore further contends that the legislative history of Section 5-101(h) contains no indication that the Legislature intended for the definition of firearm to include inoperable weapons. Conversely, the State argues that there is no requirement that a regulated firearm must be operable, a conclusion, according to the State, that \u201cis clearly borne out by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>both the statute\u2019s plain language, its legislative history, and the policy behind this history.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In the present case, the Court of Special Appeals consulted dictionary definitions to conduct its plain meaning analysis of Section 5-101(h), concluding that the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d includes inoperable weapons. <em>Moore, </em>189 Md.App. at 110, 983 A.2d at 595. It bolstered that analysis by delving into the legislative history of the statute and the case law interpreting its federal analogue. <em>Id. </em>at 102-05, 983 A.2d at 590-92. We shall follow a similar path in our exploration of whether plain meaning analysis controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Initially, we would observe that there is no language in Section 5 \u2014 101(h) that requires operability. Although Moore would have us insert an operability requirement in Section 5-101(h), we have frequently stated that \u201c[w]e will not ... judicially insert language [into a statute] to impose exceptions, limitations, or restrictions not set forth by the legislature.\u201d <em>Henriquez v. Henriquez, </em>413 Md. 287, 299, 992 A.2d 446, 454 (2010), quoting <em>St. Joseph Medical Center, Inc. v. Cardiac Surgery Associates, P.A., </em>392 Md. 75, 95, 896 A.2d 304, 316 (2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (alterations in original); <em>see also Nesbit v. Government Employees Insurance Co., </em>382 Md. 65, 75, 854 A.2d 879, 885 (2004) (\u201cWe will not divine a legislative intention contrary to the plain language of a statute or judicially insert language to impose exceptions, limitations or restrictions not set forth by the legislature.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 477, 842 A.2d 743, 746 (2004) (\u201c[W]e will not add or delete words from the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">When conducting a plain meaning analysis, we have observed that dictionary definitions \u201cprovide a useful starting point for discerning what the legislature could have meant in using a particular term.\u201d <em>Ishola v. State, </em>404 Md. 155, 161, 945 A.2d 1273, 1276 (2008), quoting <em>Stachowski v. Sysco Food Services of Baltimore, Inc., </em>402 Md. 506, 525-26, 937 A.2d 195, 206 (2007). Section 5-101(h)(l)(i) states that a \u201cfirearm\u201d means \u201ca weapon that expels, is designed to expel, or may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.\u201d This part of the statute contemplates three distinct levels of functionality under which a firearm may fall: the first is \u201ca weapon that expels ... a projectile by the action of an explosive.\u201d The word \u201cexpel\u201d means \u201cto force out,\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 440 (11th ed.2005) (hereinafter \u201cWebster\u2019s\u201d), or \u201cto discharge from or as if from a receptacle,\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary 625 (4th ed.2006) (hereinafter \u201cAmerican Heritage\u201d). In addition, this portion of Section 5-101(h)(l)(i) uses the word \u201cexpel\u201d in the present tense, indicating that a firearm includes a weapon that can <em>presently </em>\u201cforce out\u201d or \u201cdischarge\u201d a projectile by the action of an explosive. The plain meaning of \u201ca weapon that expels\u201d thus leads to the determination that Section 5-101(h)(l)(i) clearly includes weapons that are presently operable, a conclusion that neither party challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Secondly, the Section also provides that a firearm may be a weapon that \u201cis designed to expel ... a projectile by the action of an explosive.\u201d The word \u201cdesign\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]o create or contrive for a particular purpose or effect,\u201d American Heritage, <em>supra, </em>at 491, or \u201cto devise for a specific function or end,\u201d Webster\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at 338. In other words, a firearm may be a weapon that is \u201ccreated,\u201d \u201ccontrived\u201d or \u201cdevised\u201d for the \u201cspecific function\u201d or \u201cparticular purpose\u201d to \u201cforce out\u201d or \u201cdischarge\u201d a projectile by the action of an explosive, although not functional. This portion clearly includes inoperable, albeit designed to be operable, firearms. <em>See Neal v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 297, 308, 991 A.2d 159, 165 (2010) (\u201c[T]he design and construction of a weapon, rather than the state of its operability at the time of the crime, determines whether a weapon is or is not a \u2018firearm\u2019 for the purposes of \u00a7 5-101 and 5-133 of the Public Safety Article.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Thirdly, under Section 5 \u2014 101(h)(l)(i), a \u201cfirearm\u201d also includes a weapon that \u201cmay readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.\u201d The word \u201creadily\u201d means \u201cwithout much difficulty,\u201d Webster\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at 1035, \u201c[i]n a prompt, timely manner,\u201d or \u201c[i]n a manner indicating or connoting ease.\u201d American Heritage, <em>supra, </em>at 1455. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>word \u201cconvert,\u201d in turn, means \u201cto change from one form or function to another,\u201d \u201cto alter the physical or chemical nature or properties of,\u201d Webster\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>at 273, \u201c[t]o change (something) into another form, substance, state, or product,\u201d or \u201c[t]o change (something) from one use, function, or purpose to another.\u201d American Heritage, <em>supra, </em>at 401. A \u201cfirearm,\u201d as it is contemplated in this portion of Section 5-101(h)(l)(i), thus includes a weapon that may be \u201cchanged\u201d or \u201caltered\u201d \u201cin a prompt, timely manner,\u201d from one that cannot \u201cexpel a projectile by the action of an explosive,\u201d i.e., an inoperable weapon, to one that can \u201cexpel a projectile by the action of an explosive.\u201d This portion of the statute, thereby, also clearly contemplates that a firearm may be inoperable, although readily converted.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Our plain meaning analysis is further bolstered by the terms of the second portion of the statute in issue, Section 5-101(h)(1)(ii), which states that a \u201cfirearm\u201d may be \u201cthe frame or receiver of such a weapon.\u201d While \u201cframe or receiver\u201d is not defined, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the federal law enforcement agency tasked with investigating, <em>inter alia, </em>crimes involving the unlawful use, manufacture, and possession of firearms, defines a \u201cframe or receiver\u201d as \u201c[tjhat part of a firearm which provides housing for the hammer, bolt or breechblock, and firing mechanism, and which is usually threaded at its forward portion to receive the barrel.\u201d 27 C.F.R. \u00a7 478.11. A frame or receiver that provides housing for the internal components of the weapon is clearly not capable of \u201cexpel[ling] a projectile by the action of an explosive,\u201d absent the requisite internal components. Thus, Section 5-101(h)(1)(H), which defines \u201cfirearm\u201d as including the \u201cframe or receiver,\u201d only a component, clearly does not require operability of the weapon for its application. <em>See Hicks v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 112, 136, 984 A.2d 246, 260 (2009) (\u201cThe \u2018frame or receiver\u2019 of a firearm is not, in and of itself, an operable firearm as it is not capable of expelling a projectile by the action of an explosive. This leads to the inference that, when the General Assembly enacted the statutory predecessor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133, it did not intend to restrict the definition of the term \u2018firearm\u2019 to operable weapons.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Our interpretation of the plain meaning of the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d as including inoperable weapons finds succor in the legislative history of Section 5-101. It appears that Section 5-101 was first enacted in 1941, when the General Assembly added Section 531B to Article 27, Maryland Code (1939), under the subtitle \u201cPistols.\u201d 1941 Md. Laws, Chap. 622 (codified at Maryland Code (1939,1947 Supp.), Section 531B of Article 27). At the time, the statute did not define \u201cfirearm,\u201d only defining \u201cpistol or revolver\u201d as \u201cany firearm with barrel less than twelve inches in length.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In the 1951 Codification of the Maryland Code, Section 531B was renumbered as Section 538, without change, and then again in the 1957 Codification of the Maryland Code, as Section 441, again without change. In 1966, Section 441 was repealed and re-enacted, with amendments. 1966 Md. Laws, Chap. 502 (codified at Maryland Code (1957, 1967 Supp.), Section 441 of Article 27).

From this point until 1996, there were no substantive changes to Section 441 that pertained to pistols or revolvers.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In the 1996 Legislative Session, the General Assembly passed the Maryland Gun Violence Act of 1996. 1996 Maryland Laws, Chs. 561, 562. The Bill, which included House and Senate versions, House Bill 297 and Senate Bill 215, respectively, was summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">This bill is aimed at reducing gun-related violent crime in Maryland with a two-fold approach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">First, the bill creates several new crimes involving the use or possession of firearms, increases the penalties for several current crimes relating to the use or possession of firearms, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>and authorizes the courts and law enforcement authorities to take certain action regarding firearms in domestic violence situations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-4\">Second, the bill makes several substantive, as well as non-substantive, changes to the current law governing the sale, transfer, and possession of pistols, revolvers, and assault weapons (all included in the new term \u201cregulated firearms\u201d in the bill).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">House Judiciary Committee Bill Analysis for Senate Bill 215, at 1 (1996). The Bill substantially amended Section 441 of Article 27, removing the definition of \u201cpistol or revolver\u201d and adding several new definitions, including \u201cfirearm,\u201d \u201chandgun\u201d and \u201cregulated firearm,\u201d which the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">(viii) Firearm: This is a new term that is defined to mean any weapon which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive or the frame or receiver or any such weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">(xiii) Handgun: This term is a substitute for the terms \u201cpistol\u201d and \u201crevolver.\u201d However, the definition of this term is broader than the current definition of the terms \u201cpistol\u201d and \u201crevolver\u201d because it includes any firearm with a barrel of less than 16 inches,\u201d rather than 12 inches as specified in current law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">(xv) Regulated Firearm: This is a new term that includes; (1) handguns; (2) assault weapons; and (3) any firearm whose sale or transfer is subject to the provisions of the new subtitle governing the sale and repair of regulated firearms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Bill Analysis for Senate Bill 215, at 4 (1996). With the passage of the Maryland Gun Violence Act, the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d was eventually codified in Section 441 (i) of Article 27, Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol.), as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>(1) Any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">(2) The frame or receiver of any such weapon.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Finally, in 2003, the General Assembly repealed Section 441, recodifying it in the newly-created Public Safety Article at Section 5-101, without substantive change, where it is currently located. 2003 Md. Laws, Chap. 5 (codified at Maryland Code (2003), Section 5-101 of the Public Safety Article).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The basis for the change was to further prevent weapons from being possessed by individuals who should not hold them, pursuant to Section 5-133, which prohibits possession of firearms by felons convicted of crimes of violence or enumerated drug crimes. In so doing,, the Legislature chose to follow the federal model. According to the Senate Floor Report for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>the 1996 Bill, the definition that the General Assembly chose for \u201cfirearm\u201d was a \u201c[njew definition consistent with federal law.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Floor Report for Senate Bill 215, at 6 (1996). At the time of the 1996 enactment (and currently), the federal definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d was located in Section 921(a)(3) of Title 18, United States Code and contained nearly-identical language to the definition for \u201cfirearm\u201d located in Section 441 (i) of Article 27, Maryland Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol.), providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">The term \u201cfirearm\u201d means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device. Such term does not include an antique firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">This Section was enacted in 1968 as part of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Pub.L. No. 90-351, 82 Stat. 237 (1968). The Senate Report for the Bill iterated that inoperable firearms were swept up in the term, \u201cfirearm\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">Section 921(a)(3).-This definition of the term \u201cfirearm\u201d is a revision of the definition in the present law (15 U.S.C. 901(3)). The definition has been extended to include any weapon (including a starter gun) which will, or may be readily converted to, expel a projectile or projectiles by the action of an explosive. <em>This provision makes it clear that so-called unserviceable firearms come within the definition. </em>Under the present definition of \u201cfirearm,\u201d any part or parts of such a weapon are included. It has been found that it is impractical to have controls over each small part of a firearm. Thus, the revised definition substitutes only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>major parts of the firearm; that is, frame or receiver for the words \u201cany part or parts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">S.Rep. No. 90-1097 (1968), <em>reprinted in </em>1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2112, 2200 (emphasis added). As a result, plain meaning analysis, as well as legislative history in the State and for that of our federal analogue, leads us to conclude that a weapon does not have to be operable to come within the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d in Section 5-101(h). <em>See Nash v. State, </em>191 Md.App. 386, 405 n. 8, 991 A.2d 831, 842 n. 8 (2010) (noting that \u201cthe State is not required to demonstrate that a firearm is operable to obtain a conviction under [Section] 5-133(c)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">We would be remiss if we did not note that federal courts have overwhelmingly determined that operability is not a requirement under the similar federal statute, Section 921(a)(3) of Title 18, United States Code. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

State, </em>278 Md. 389, 364 A.2d 797 (1976), which interpreted a different handgun statute. In <em>Howell, </em>we considered whether a tear gas gun was a handgun within the meaning of Section 36F(b) of Article 27, Maryland Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol.),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> which defined a handgun as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">(b) Handgun. \u2014 \u201cHandgun\u201d means any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed on the person, including a short-barreled shotgun and a short-barreled rifle as these terms are defined below, except it does not include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>a shotgun, rifle, or antique firearm as those terms are defined below.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">This definition pertained to offenses for wearing and carrying handguns during the commission of certain crimes, which were enumerated in Section 36 of Article 27. In attempting to discern the class of weapons that qualified as handguns under Section 36, in <em>Howell, </em>we observed, in a footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">The Attorney General in 58 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 572, 576 (1973) opined that \u201c[i]t is abundantly clear that the term handgun as defined [in the Maryland statute] covers the same weapons as contemplated in the definition of firearm contained in the \u2018Gun Control Act of 1968,\u2019 codified at 18. U.S.C. 921(3),\u201d stating that the latter statute \u201cdefines a firearm as \u2018... any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device. Such term does not include an antique firearm.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">It is to be specifically noted that the Maryland statute does not define the term \u201cfirearm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-8\"><em>Howell, </em>278 Md. at 391-92 n. 1, 364 A.2d at 798-99 n. 1. Determining that a tear gas gun was not a handgun, we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-9\">[F]or this device to be a handgun it must be a firearm or it must be readily or easily convertible into a firearm. We further conclude that to be a firearm it must propel a missile by gunpowder or some such similar explosive and that the gas here involved is not a missile within the natural and ordinary signification of the term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 396, 364 A.2d at 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-11\">Our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals have apparently relied on, <em>Howell </em>as prescribing an operability requirement, not only in <em>use </em>of a handgun cases, but also in the carrying of a handgun context. In this regard, <em>York v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 222, 467 A.2d 552 (1983), involving the use of a handgun, clearly necessitated operability for a conviction after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number><em>Howell. </em>To the extent that, in <em>Brown v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 138, 167 n. 16, 957 A.2d 654, 670 n. 16 (2008), in dicta, in a footnote, our colleagues noted that operability was a requirement for carrying offenses,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we need not express any opinion, because the statutory definition of \u201chandgun\u201d is different in 4-201 of the Criminal Law Article than the definition for \u201cfirearm\u201d in Section 5-101 of the Public Safety Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Moore contends that <em>Howell </em>and, specifically, our interpretation of the meaning of \u201cfirearm\u201d as mandating some level of operability, requires us to find that a \u201cfirearm\u201d under Section 5-101(h) must also achieve that level of operability. Our discussion in <em>Howell, </em>however, does not alter our interpretation of the plain meaning of Section 5-101(h) as not requiring operability. Moore\u2019s reliance on <em>Howell </em>fails to give proper credence to the axiom that the same word or phrase in two different statutes can nonetheless contain different meanings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZv\">There is no rule of construction which requires the same meaning always to be given to the same word, when used in different connections in the same statute or in different statutes. On the contrary, such is the flexibility of language and the want of fixity in many of our commonest expressions, that a word or phrase may bear very different meanings according to the connection in which it is found. Hence the rule that the terms of a statute are always to be interpreted with references to the subject-matter of the enactment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Henry C.

In <em>York v.

After finding that \u201cin recent years [there has] been an alarming increase in the number of violent crimes perpetrated in Maryland, and a high percentage of those crimes involve the use of handguns\u201d (Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(a)(i)), the [Legislature went on to explain:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-5\">(ii) The result has been a substantial increase in the number of persons killed or injured which is traceable, in large part, to the carrying of handguns on the streets and public ways by persons inclined to use them in criminal activity....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-6\">This language demonstrates that the paramount purpose of the General Assembly in enacting \u00a7 36B was to reduce the especially high potential for death or serious injury that arises when a handgun, as distinguished from some other weapon, is used in a crime of violence. That potential for major harm exists only when the weapon, at the time of the offense, is useable as a handgun. If it is not then so useable, its likelihood of inflicting injury is no greater than that produced by a knife or a club \u2014 bad enough, but different from the special hazard to the victim that the legislature attached to the use of handguns.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 228-29, 467 A.2d at 555-56.

Moore contends that \"[i]t would be unreasonable to conclude that, when the Legislature made an <em>explicit </em>change to the existing law of operability in one statute, it also <em>implicitly </em>eliminated the requirement of operability with respect to other firearms offenses as well.\" This argument apparently focuses on the fact that, in 1996, the General Assembly also amended former Section 36B(d) of Article 27, the provision pertaining to the \"unlawful use of [a] handgun or antique firearm in [the] commission of crime,\u201d adding the following language: \"whether operable or inoperable at the time of the offense.\u201d 1996 Md. Laws, Chs. 561, 562. According to Moore, under the doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio </em>alterius, or, \"the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another,\u201d <em>Walzer v. Osborne, </em>395 Md. 563, 579, 911 A.2d 427, 436 (2006), the failure of the Legislature to add the same language to Section 441(i) indicated the intent to require operability in that statute and in its current iteration, Section 5-101(h). To apply Moore\u2019s reasoning, however, we would have to assume that the Legislature\u2019s failure to include in Section 441(i) the language, \"whether operable or inoperable,\u201d indicated its intent to exclude inoperable and operable weapons from the statute. This would leave us with an absurd result, as a weapon that is neither operable or inoperable is a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">The doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius, </em>moreover, is \"merely an auxiliary rule of statutory construction applied to assist in determining the intention of the Legislature where such intention is not manifest from the language used.\u201d <em>Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 579, 911 A.2d at 436, quoting <em>Hylton v.

The majority, in so concluding, assumes a fact that simply does not exist, that there is a uniform definition of firearm, which applies to the construction of \u00a7 5-133(c). There are, however, conflicting definitions of the term, \u201cfirearm,\u201d one of which the majority fails to address, either ignoring it or paying it short shrift. To be sure, \u201cfirearm\u201d is defined by \u00a7 5 \u2014 101(h) in a way that supports the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 5-133(c), and that would be dispositive, except that, prior to its enactment, this Court had defined firearm differently, <em>albeit </em>in construing a different statute and in a different context. Notwithstanding that one of the definitions was developed by case law in connection with a different statute and if it were confined only to that statute, the other definition, the one reflected in the statutory language, may be clear, where there is more than one definition of a term and those definitions are conflicting, an ambiguity exists, as it calls into question the Legislature\u2019s intention in enacting the statute; given the conflicting definition that the legislation contained, it is not at all clear that the General Assembly intended to overrule this Court\u2019s earlier definition of firearm. Thus, the plain language of \u00a7 5-101(h) no longer governs its meaning. For this reason, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The petitioner, Rodney Taureen Moore, was charged in Baltimore County, with, <em>inter alia, </em>two counts of the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, Maryland Code (2002) Criminal Law Article \u00a7 4-204(a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun, Criminal Law Article \u00a7 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>203(a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as well as a Maryland Code (2003) Public Safety Article, \u00a7 5-133(c) violation, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

The handgun, the forensic firearms examiner concluded, was defective. In order to safely test-fire the gun, he had to replace a latch, that was cracked, on the gun.

This definition, in its present formulation, became a part of the Maryland legislative framework in 1996, when, as part of the Maryland Gun Violence Act of 1996, \u201cSection 2, chs. 561 and 562, Acts 1996, effective Oct. 1, 1996, repealed former \u00a7 441 and enacted a new section in lieu thereof.\u201d That new \u00a7 441 contained new subsection (i), which provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">\u201cFirearm. \u2014 \u2018Firearm\u2019 means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">\u201c(1) Any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIA\">\u201c(1) The frame or receiver of any such weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">In another part of that Act, the General Assembly made a substantive change, and a significant one, to Article 27, \u00a7 36B (d). In what could only be an attempt, with respect to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>statute, to put to rest the controversy caused by certain factual scenarios involving obvious, but inoperable, handguns, the Legislature amended that section to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">\u201c(d) <em>Unlawful use of handgun or antique firearm in commission of crime; penalties. </em>\u2014 Any person who shall use a handgun or an antique firearm capable of being concealed on the person in the commission of any felony or any crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441 of this article, <em>whether operable or inoperable at the time of the offense, </em>shall be guilty of a separate misdemeanor.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">(Emphasis added).

At the same time and by the same authority, the related provisions, \u00a7 36B (a), which prohibited the wearing, carrying or transporting of a handgun, and \u00a7 36B (d), which prohibited the use of a handgun or antique firearm in commission of a crime, were also re-codified as, respectively, \u00a7 \u00a7 4-203(a)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and 4-204(a)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of the Criminal Law Article. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>About a year later, <em>see </em>Laws 2003, ch. 5, \u00a7 2, Article 27, \u00a7 445(d), to which extensive revisions had been made over the years, was re-codified as \u00a7 5-133(b) and, as we have seen, \u00a7 441 was re-codified as \u00a7 5-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Nevertheless, the term, \u201chandgun,\u201d which necessarily required interpretation of the term, \u201cfirearm,\u201d was defined by this Court in <em>Howell. </em>The definition we settled upon was one based on language similar to, if not identical to, that of the federal Gun Control Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(3) (1968). <em>See Howell, </em>278 Md. at 391 n. 1, 364 A.2d at 798 n. 1 (quoting the Attorney General that \u201c[i]t is abundantly clear that the term handgun as defined [in the Maryland statute] covers the same weapons as contemplated in the definition of firearm contained in the \u2018Gun Control Act of 1968\u2019 \u201d). The appellant in <em>Howell </em>was convicted on a number of charges, including the unlawful use of a handgun in the commission of a crime in violation of Article 27, \u00a7 36B (d) of the Maryland Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol.). <em>Id. </em>at 390, 364 A.2d at 798. Although the robbery victim thought the gun held to his head was a .22 caliber, in actuality, the appellant had been holding a tear gas gun, capable only of expelling fine particles highly irritating to the eyes. <em>Id. </em>at 390-91, 364 A.2d at 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">This Court had to decide whether a tear gas pistol was a handgun within the meaning of Maryland Code (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 36F (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol.). <em>Id. </em>at 390, 364 A.2d at 798. We held that it was not. <em>Id. </em>at 390, 364 A.2d at 797. Instead, the Court concluded that, in order to be a handgun, the weapon must be \u201ca firearm or it must be readily or easily convertible into a firearm ...

The Court clearly was cognizant of the federal definition of \u201cfirearm,\u201d and the structure of its opinion and its analysis indicate a purpose of ensuring that this definition was consistent. In a footnote, we acknowledged the federal statute and the Attorney General\u2019s arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">\u201cThe Attorney General in 58 Op.

Such term does not include an antique firearm.\u201d \u2019 The federal act says that a \u2018destructive device\u2019 is \u2018any type of weapon ... by whatever name known which will, or which may be readily converted to, expel a projectile by the action of an explosive or other propellant, and which has any barrel with a bore of more than one-half inch in diameter....\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 391, n. 1, 364 A.2d at 798, n. 1. Further, having distinguished the cases the State relied on and consulted various dictionaries for definitions of handguns, we reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU\">\u201cIf we regard the statute here as intending to define the term handgun as \u2018any pistol, revolver, or <em>other </em>firearm\u2019 (Emphasis added.) then the only way that \u2018no word, clause, sentence, or phrase [may not] be rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory,\u2019 is to conclude that the presence of the word \u2018other\u2019 before \u2018firearm\u2019 is an indication that the General Assembly intended that to be a \u2018handgun\u2019 the device under consideration must be a firearm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 394, 364 A.2d at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">After our decision in <em>Howell, </em>it was well settled that a handgun within the meaning of \u00a7 36F \u201ccover[ed] the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>weapons as contemplated in the definition of \u2018firearm\u2019 contained in the Gun Control Act, 18 U.S.C. 921 (1968).\u201d 58 Op.

Moreover, as we have seen, the General Assembly amended \u00a7 441, in effect codifying the <em>Howell </em>definition of \u201cfirearm,\u201d borrowed from federal law, by largely adopting the language from the federal Gun Control Act that <em>Howell </em>construed and which formed the basis for that definition and inserting it in subsection (n). In so doing, the Legislature was aware, and in any event, is presumed to have been aware, of this Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cfirearm\u201d in light of that federal statute. <em>Consol.

In actuality, Maryland\u2019s \u201cfirearm\u201d definition, which has also been used to define the term \u201chandgun,\u201d though originally borrowed from federal law, has a state-specific meaning as a result of court decisions and Legislative acceptance, <em>see </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.) Article 27, \u00a7 36F, and consistent amendments and enactments over the past several decades.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The majority traces the roots of \u00a7 5-101 to \u00a7 441 without acknowledging the relationship between \u00a7 445 and \u00a7\u00a7 36B and 36F and, in particular, that \u00a7 36F defined the objects whose possession, under the enumerated circumstances, \u00a7 445 proscribed. In fact, although, when <em>Howell </em>was decided, all of the statutes involved \u201cCrimes and Punishments\u201d and appeared in the same Article, the majority simply dismisses \u00a7 36F as \u201ca different handgun statute.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Moore, </em>137, 34 A.3d at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>Sections 4-201(c), 4-203(a) and 4-204(a) are a part of a single statutory scheme: they are all a part of Title 4 because each is a crime that involves a weapon and, because the common weapon is a handgun, they also share space in Subtitle 2. More specifically, critical to a prosecution under \u00a7\u00a7 4-203 and 4-204 is the definition of a handgun, a question that must be answered, as <em>Howell </em>demonstrates, by reference to \u00a7 4-201(c). Although not a part of the same Title and Subtitle, and, indeed, is in another Article entirely, \u00a7 5-133(b) is nevertheless related to, and, I submit, shares a legislative scheme with these provisions. It too is a handgun offense, to the proof of which the definition of handgun is central. As <em>Howell </em>pointed out, given the structure and wording of the reference to \u201cfirearm\u201d in the definition of handgun, a \u201c \u2018handgun\u2019 must be a firearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394, 364 A.2d at 800. Where the \u201cregulated firearm\u201d otherwise falls within the definition of handgun, the opposite is also true. Section 5 \u2014 101(h) also is related and cannot be exempted from the scheme. Although that section defines \u201cfirearm,\u201d the definition of \u201chandgun,\u201d as <em>Howell </em>made clear, <em>id., </em>necessarily encompassed, and thus required reference to and construction of that term. As a matter of fact, as we have seen, <em>id. </em>at 391 n. 1, 364 A.2d at 798 n. 1, in construing \u00a7 36B (c), the predecessor to \u00a7 4-201(c), the Court considered the very language that \u00a7 5-101 (h) uses, <em>albeit </em>it did so in the context of the federal act upon which the statute is based.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Although, as the majority emphasizes, which, by the way, I concede, <em>Howell </em>interpreted, not \u00a7 441 (i), the predecessor to \u00a7 5 \u2014 101(h), but \u00a7 36F, in which the definition of \u201chandgun,\u201d as used in \u00a7 36B (d), was set forth. There was a good reason that the Court did not interpret \u00a7 441(i): it did not then exist and no Maryland statute defined \u201cfirearm.\u201d To be sure, then present \u00a7 441(c) used the term, \u201cfirearm,\u201d in its definition of \u201chandgun,\u201d as did \u00a7 36B (b), but neither further defined or explained that term. More to the point, however, as <em>Howell </em>makes clear, the Court was aware of, and, indeed, in defining that term, considered the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d in the \u2018Gun Control Act of 1968,\u2019 codified at 18 U.S.C. 921(3), which used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>virtually the same language as the General Assembly did in enacting \u00a7 5-101 and, later, \u00a7 4-201(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The majority, after an extensive plain meaning analysis of \u00a7 5-101(h), states that the Maryland Gun Violence Act, which codified the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d in \u00a7 441(i) of Article 27, created a new definition consistent with federal law, evidenced by the nearly-identical language contained in the \u00a7 921(a)(3) of Title 18, United States Code. <em>Moore, </em>133-34, 34 A.3d at 521-22. It goes on to say, in a footnote,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">\u201cTo the extent that Moore contends that the new definition was not consistent with federal law, we find no merit in his argument. In addition to the legislative history that indicates as much, the definition that the General Assembly chose for the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d was virtually identical to language that was found in Section 921(a)(3) of Title 18, United States Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 135 n. 8, 34 A.3d at 522 n. 8. Despite the majority\u2019s pushing for such strict adherence to federal law regarding \u00a7 5-101(h), and thereafter citing a number of cases noting \u201cthat federal courts have overwhelmingly determined that operability is not a requirement under the similar federal statute,\u201d <em>id, </em>136, 34 A.3d at 523, and therefore concluding that operability is not required for a \u00a7 5-133(c) conviction, the majority quickly dismisses <em>Howell </em>and its progeny, reasoning that the definition involved there \u201cpertained to offenses for \u2018wearing and carrying handguns during the commission of certain crimes, which were enumerated in Section 36 of Article 27.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>138, 34 A.3d at 524. The majority then quotes the language of <em>Howell, </em>which states that \u201cthe term handgun as defined [in the Maryland statute] covers the same weapons as contemplated in the definition of firearm contained in the [federal statute.]\u201d <em>Moore, </em>138, 34 A.3d at 524 (internal quotation marks omitted). The majority, in interpreting \u00a7 5-101, concludes that the \u201cfirearm\u201d definition therein strictly coincides with the federal definition, in that operability is not required, while \u00a7 4-201 loosely coincides with the federal definition, and operability is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>The logic of the majority\u2019s construction escapes me. As we have seen, this Court took account of the federal statute on which \u00a7 5-101 is based when it, construing \u00a7 36B (b), defined \u201chandgun,\u201d a critical component of which is that it be a \u201cfirearm.\u201d Consequently, the Court necessarily defined \u201cfirearm.\u201d Following that decision, it has been the law of this State that, to be a handgun, the object must be a firearm, and that it be an operable firearm. <em>See Brown v. State, </em>182 Md.App. 138, 168 n. 16, 957 A.2d 654, 671 n. 16 (2008) (noting that \u201c[a] weapon must be an operable firearm to sustain a conviction for carrying a handgun\u201d); <em>Powell v.

The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">The mere subsequent adoption of pre-existing and well known federal statute language simply does not, and cannot, negate or undermine in any way the <em>Howell </em>ruling. More is required to indicate a legislative intent to reverse that decision. There is nothing more in that regard in this case. The more there is augurs against the position the majority espouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">As I have previously pointed out, concurrently with the enactment of a definition of \u201cfirearm,\u201d which largely mirrored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>the federal Gun Control Act of 1968, the General Assembly amended \u00a7 36B (d) to make clear that conviction of that offense did not depend on whether the handgun used was operable, that conviction could occur \u201cwhether the antique firearm or handgun is operable or inoperable at the time of the crime.\u201d To my mind, this indicates quite clearly that, rather than a mere presumption, <em>see Simpson, </em>372 Md. at 461, 813 A.2d at 276, the Legislature was very much aware of, and accepted, the <em>Howell </em>decision and its operability requirement, but wanted to confine its effect to crimes that did not involve the offensive use of the handgun. That certainly would address some of the concerns expressed about the operability requirement. <em>See e.g., York, </em>56 Md.App. at 230, 467 A.2d at 556 (\u201cWe do not think the legislature, in its concern for the protection of citizens against handguns used in crimes, intended a weapon to be excluded from the handgun category because of nice calculations of percentages or the relative strengths of potential users.\u201d). It also explains an interesting and significant omission: no similar amendment to the admittedly related \u201cwearing and carrying\u201d statute, \u00a7 36B (b), or to \u00a7 445, \u00a7 5-133(c)\u2019s predecessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">A rationale for removing the State\u2019s burden of proving that a handgun used in the commission of a crime was operable was clearly stated by the Governor\u2019s Commission on Gun Violence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">\u201cThe Commission heard testimony that this issue is critical in the prosecution of crimes involving the use of a handgun and [requiring operability] poses an extra element of proof for prosecutors. Moreover, some Commissioners stated that it was irrelevant to a crime victim, who believed that the handgun was capable of being fired, whether the weapon was operable or not. In other words, the impact intended by the criminal and felt by the victim is the same irrespective of whether the gun was operable. Accordingly, the Commission concluded that the proof that the handgun was operable was essentially irrelevant to the criminal act in question and voted to recommend elimination of this element of proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Report of Governor\u2019s Commission on Gun Violence at 18. To my mind, the General Assembly\u2019s action in amending \u00a7 36B (d) was consistent with the Commission\u2019s sentiments. Equally significant, none of the other handgun statutes, \u00a7 36 B(b), prohibiting wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun; \u00a7 281A (b), prohibiting possession of a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime; \u00a7 291(A)(b), prohibiting possession of a firearm after conviction of a drug offense; or \u00a7 445, prohibiting possession of a firearm by, <em>inter alia, </em>a person convicted of a disqualifying crime, were amended to include this exemption language.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">It makes sense not to require proof that a brandished handgun is operable where the charged crime is an active one, involving violence and a victim, who, as a result, is, and is intended to be, intimidated; in such circumstances, the handgun\u2019s operability simply may be deemed irrelevant. This rationale does not apply in the case of a statute that prohibits a certain class of persons from merely possessing a handgun.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Indeed, operability is more relevant in such cases, where the handgun is not actively being used to harm or intimidate, but is available should the offender decide to revert to engaging in activity harmful to society sometime in the future. Indeed, subsequent to the Gun Violence Act of 1996, this Court and the Court of Special Appeals have continued to apply the <em>Howell </em>\u201cfirearm\u201d definition in cases involving \u00a7\u00a7 4-203 and 5-133. <em>See Pye v. State, </em>397 Md. 626, 628, 919 A.2d 632, 634 (2007) (appellant was convicted of both 5-133 and 4-203, and the court noted that the gun proved to be operable); <em>Brown, </em>182 Md.App. at 168 n. 16, 957 A.2d at 671 n. 16 (noting that \u201c[a] weapon must be an operable firearm to sustain a conviction for carrying a handgun\u201d). If the majority is correct, despite the <em>Howell </em>decision and the fact that only \u00a7 4-204 was amended to delete the operability requirement, \u00a7 4-203 would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>be the only one of the three statutes referencing \u201cfirearm\u201d still to require operability. This simply is not sensible. Moreover, had the Legislature intended the same result in all cases in which handguns were involved, it certainly knew how to provide for it. <em>Balto. Harbor Charters v. Ayd, </em>365 Md. 366, 386, 780 A.2d 303, 314 (2001) (holding that \u201c[w]e have long applied the principle of statutory construction, <em>\u2018expressio unis est exdusio alterius,\u2019 </em>the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another\u201d) (internal citations omitted). It chose not to.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In 2009, thirteen years after Maryland had codified the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d borrowed from federal law, the issue of whether proof of operability was a requirement for a conviction under \u00a7 5-133 was squarely presented to the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Hicks v. State, </em>189 Md.App. 112, 984 A.2d 246 (2009). Without discussing <em>Howell, </em>or any of the \u00a7 5-133 cases referenced herein, focusing instead on the language, \u201cframe or receiver,\u201d borrowed from the federal statute, 58 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. at 576, the intermediate appellate court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">\u201cWe have found no Maryland cases that directly speak to the precise issue before us. We are persuaded, however, that a firearm need not be operable to sustain a conviction under Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133(b). As noted, \u2018firearm,\u2019 the operative term here, is defined as \u2018a weapon that expels, is designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; or the frame or receiver of such a weapon.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">\u201cSince the federal definition of \u2018firearm\u2019 is substantially the same as that in Pub. Safety, \u00a7 5-101(h), and the corresponding federal and Maryland statutes regulate essentially the same conduct, we view the federal courts\u2019 interpretation of the term \u2018firearm\u2019 as persuasive. We hold that, in order to obtain a conviction under Pub. Safety \u00a7 5-133, the State need not prove that the firearm in question was operable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 136, 139, 984 A.2d at 260, 262. I find this rationale to be the product of illogic and incomplete analysis of Maryland\u2019s statutory scheme and history and the relevant case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">To the majority, the Public Safety Article and the Criminal Law Article contain mutually exclusive definitions of the word \u201cfirearm.\u201d <em>See Moore, </em>137-39, 34 A.3d at 524-25. The majority is wrong. It is true, there is now a definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d in the Criminal Law Article, it is, however, a \u201cJohnny Come Lately,\u201d having just recently been added. When we defined \u201chandgun,\u201d and in the process, \u201cfirearm,\u201d there was no statutory definition of \u201cfirearm,\u201d although the statute we construed, \u00a7 36F, as well as several others, including the predecessor to \u00a7 5-101, \u00a7 441, referred to \u201cfirearm.\u201d The definition of which we applied to each of these statutes and the case law reflects that reality. It also makes sense, as we pointed out, our definition of \u201chandgun\u201d encompasses \u201cfirearm.\u201d Moreover, when the Court defined \u201chandgun,\u201d in the process defining \u201cfirearm,\u201d all of the statutes were a part of one statutory scheme. Although they are today spread out over two Articles, they still are intimately related and are a part of a well developed scheme to regulate and punish gun crimes. House Judiciary Committee Bill Analysis for Senate Bill 215 at *1 (Md.1996). Thus, it is an incorrect and illogical assumption to read \u201cfirearm\u201d as used in \u00a7 5-133, and defined in \u00a7 5-101(h), as completely separate and based upon a different definition than that articulated by this Court in <em>Howell, </em>admittedly applicable to \u00a7 4-203, wearing and carrying a handgun, a crime quite similar in nature, and, but for the exemption enacted in 1996, to \u00a7 4-204, use in crime. For these reasons, a plain meaning analysis is not available or appropriate in the construction of \u00a7 5-101(h). Such an analysis is possible only \u201c[i]f the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, [rendering it unnecessary to] look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions----\u201d <em>Ray v. State, </em>410 Md. 384, 978 A.2d 736 (2009). The <em>Howell </em>decision defining \u201cfirearm,\u201d being relevant to its interpretation, renders the later enacted statute, defining the same term, but not purporting to overrule the earlier one, at the least ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>But even a plain meaning analysis does not justify the result the majority strains to reach: the language of \u00a7 5-101(h) requires that the subject weapon expel; be designed to expel; may be readily converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive, or to be the frame or receiver of a weapon that expels, is designed to expel, or may readily be converted to expel a projectile. Rather than not being language \u201cthat requires operability,\u201d as the majority states, <em>Moore, </em>127, 34 A.3d at 518, I believe this language very clearly does the opposite, it requires that the weapon, designed to expel a projectile, operate or be readily converted to an operable state. Such a reading of the statute, moreover, takes account of all the words in the first clause and gives them meaning. Moreover, the statute states that a \u201cfirearm\u201d includes \u201cthe frame or receiver of any such weapon.\u201d Of course, the frame or receiver of a weapon \u2014 with nothing more \u2014 is a component of, but not a, firearm. Consequently, that provision alone introduces an ambiguity which must be resolved.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">This is in contradistinction to the majority\u2019s approach: it focuses on the phrase, \u201cis designed to,\u201d and concludes that the mere design alone makes a weapon a \u201cfirearm\u201d for purposes of the \u00a7 5-101(h) violation. <em>Id. </em>at 129-30, 34 A.3d at 519. The majority bolsters this conclusion by relying on \u00a7 5-101(h)(1)(ii), including in the definition of \u201cfirearm,\u201d \u201cthe frame or receiver of such a weapon,\u201d pointing out that \u201c[a] frame or receiver that provides housing for the internal components of the weapon is clearly not capable of \u2018expel[ling] a projectile by the action of an explosive,\u2019 absent the requisite internal components.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131, 34 A.3d at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">It is well settled that, when interpreting statutes, we seek \u201cto ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is ren<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>dered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>Ray, </em>410 Md. at 404-05, 978 A.2d at 747-48 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Applying this canon of construction, it follows that, if subsection (h)(l)(i) were interpreted to mean that a conviction for illegal possession of a prohibited firearm could be based solely on evidence that the weapon was \u201cdesigned\u201d to expel a projectile, regardless of its actual capacity to do so, the requirement that it \u201cexpel a projectile ... or may be readily converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive\u201d would be totally superfluous.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Similarly, with regard to the \u201cframe or receiver\u201d requirement, if it trumps the rest of the statute, one can only wonder why the General Assembly bothered to say anything more.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Section 5 \u2014 101(h)(1)(i) defines \u201cfirearm\u201d using a series of phrases, which, as characterized by the majority, \u201ccontemplates three distinct levels of <em>functionality </em>under which a firearm may fall[.]\u201d <em>Moore, </em>130, 34 A.3d at 519 (emphasis added). By using the term \u201cfunctionality,\u201d I believe the majority concedes that, to be a firearm, the subject weapon must have some level of operability. <em>See </em>The American Heritage Dictionary 551, 956. (3rd ed. 1997) (Defining \u201coperable\u201d as \u201c[b]eing such that operation is possible[; jpossible to put into practice; practicable\u201d and defining \u201cfunctional\u201d as \u201c[djesigned for or adapted to a particular function or use; [cjapable of performing; <em>operative.'\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). Curiously, rather than analyze the statute as a whole, which, I submit, leads inexorably to the conclusion that the statute requires the weapon, at least, to be <em>capable </em>of expulsion, and, if not capable at that exact moment in time, \u201creadily\u201d convert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>ed to do so, the majority then focuses on the literal meaning of the words \u201cdesigned to expel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The majority last argues that, because Maryland intended to model its own Act after the federal Gun Control Act of 1968, and because the federal government does not require operability, then Maryland\u2019s Act, as a whole, does not either. <em>See Moore, </em>133-36, 34 A.3d at 521-23. I simply do not find this argument convincing in light of <em>Howell, </em>Maryland\u2019s long history of requiring, <em>albeit </em>by judicial decision, that handguns be operable, and the number of differences between the federal act and our State\u2019s act.

Further, I do not believe, and there is no evidence to show, that the Legislature had an intent to create a definition of \"firearm\u201d in \u00a7 5-101(h) that was contrary to, and not harmonious with, \u00a7 4-201(c) and its Howell-based interpretation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\">.

Additionally, there would seem to be due process implications where a person in mere possession of an inoperable weapon, fundamentally a useless heap of metal, is convicted of possessing a regulated firearm. I do not believe the statute gives proper notice that any weapon, whether operable or not, could incriminate a person under \u00a7 5-133.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\">. The statute's reference to \"the frame or receiver of any <em>such </em>weapon,\u201d (emphasis added) is, I believe, a reference to a weapon that expels, is designed to expel, or is readily capable of expelling a projectile. I do not take this language to mean that the frame or receiver of an inoperable weapon suffices. Had that been the Legislature\u2019s intent, the words \u201cany such weapon,\" referring back to subsection (l)(i), would not have been used.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\">. The same logic applies to Section 4-204(a) of the Criminal Law Article, which states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-7\"><em>\"A </em>person may not use an antique firearm capable of being concealed on the person or any handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, as defined in [what is now] \u00a7 5-101 of the Public Safety Article, or any felony, whether the antique firearm or handgun is operable or inoperable at the time of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">If Section 5-101 in fact defined a firearm as being an operable or inoperable weapon, the language of Section 4-204 that states \"whether ... operable or inoperable\u201d would be superfluous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
