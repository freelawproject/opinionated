Ho one of them can modify or disturb the orders or decrees of another. And a suit brought in one court seeking to attack, set aside, or annul the orders or process of another court, is brought in the wrong forum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">The gist of this action is to annul the sale and sheriff\u2019s deed made under and by virtue of the judgment in Havarro County, on the alleged ground that said judgment was obtained by fraud, and that there were irregularities in the process under which the sale was made. This can only be done by a bill of review, filed in the same court where said judgment was rendered. Lawler v. White, 26 Texas, 250; Mitchell v. Meuley, 32 Texas, 460; Black v.

J. T. Johnson, all of which he claimed were invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Some of the facts which he alleged to show the invalidity of that judgment, execution, and sale, were such as might entitle him, by a proper proceeding, to have had them vacated, but not such as to render them void.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">The petition, however, went further, and alleged facts which, if true, would render the judgment void.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">It alleged that the plaintiff was a non-resident of this State; that he never was cited to appear, and did not appear in person or by attorney in the proceeding in which the judgment in favor of Johnson and against himself was rendered; and that appellees claim through an execution and sale made under a judgment so rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">If these averments be true the judgment was void and no one could acquire rights under it. The demurrer admits the averments to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-12\">How the facts may appear, if ajjpellant is put to the proof of his averments, is now unimportant, for the action of the court in dismissing the petition prevented any inquiry as to this.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">The petition stated that appellant owned the land in controversy at a date named, and that he continued to be the owner, but that appellees assert title to it through a judgment for money entered against him in a case in which he had not been cited to appeal', and in which he did not appear either in person or by attorney. He, in fact, alleges his entire ignorance of the pendency of such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">If this be true, the land is still his and he ought to have been given an opportunity to establish so much of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-15\">The demurrer urged was general, and while the manner in which appellant pleaded may have been subject to objections, these matters were not raised by the general demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-16\">If a judgment be void it- is not necessary that the person against whom it is entered have it set aside by a proceeding for that purpose; but in a collateral proceeding in any court he may show its nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The fact that appellant may have sought specific relief that could not be given to him by the District Court for Ellis County furnishes no reason why that court should not adjudicate the question of title to land situated in that county, without reference to the fact that the defendants were not residents of that county.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The court erred in dismissing the cause, and its judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Opinion November 23, 1888.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
