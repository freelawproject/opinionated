On the 30th day of August, 1888, four days before the court convened, appellant\u2019s counsel addressed the following letter to Ford <em>&amp; </em>Dor emus, attorneys for plaintiff:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">\u201cNavasota, Texas, August 30, 1888.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">\n<em>\u201cMessrs.

Earl Preston.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-17\">Both parties had filed their pleadings at a previous term. Appellant\u2019s pleadings if properly supported by evidence would have entitled him to recover the land in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-18\">The case, on the 10th day of September, 1888, was tried before a jury, resulting in a verdict and judgment in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-19\">Neither the defendant nor his attorney appeared at the trial. The judgment recites that the plaintiff appeared by attorney and defendant \"by his answer filed in this cause.\u201d The court charged the jury to find a verdict in favor of plaintiff for the land sued for, and further to find for plaintiff such rents if any as the evidence showed him entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-20\">The record does not contain a statement of facts. The defendant filed a motion for new trial, and affidavits for and against it were heard by the court. The above correspondence was made part of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-21\">It appears from affidavits heard by the court in connection with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>motion for new trial that when the case was called on the first day of the court, neither defendant nor his attorney being present, plaintiff\u2019s counsel called for a jury in behalf of defendant as requested; that the case was placed on the jury docket by the court, and that plaintiff\u2019s attorney requested the court to set the case for Saturday, September 15, but the judge declined to do so, stating that the jury docket would be disposed of before that time and that he did not feel authorized to hold a jury for the trial of this cause. The court set the case for September 10, and requested the attorney representing the plaintiff to notify defendant\u2019s attorney, which was done by the next mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\">It also appeared that appellant was at the place of holding the court on September 8, and was then informed by one of plaintiff\u2019s attorneys that the case was set for trial on the 10th and would no doubt be then tried, and that appellant left the place of holding the court, and on the 10th, the day of the trial, telegraphed to the judge, \u201cPlease pass my case until Preston can return from North Texas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">In connection with his motion for a new trial the defendant testified that he was sick on the day the case was tried and unable to attend the court, that his attendance at the trial was necessary and important, that he was a witness in his own behalf and the only witness within his knowledge of certain facts necessary and material to his defense, and that he was prevented from attending court and testifying in said cause by reason alone of his sickness. Ho fact sustaining defendant\u2019s pleadings or showing that he had a meritorious defense was in any manner shown in connection with the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Defendant\u2019s attorney testified that he never received the letter mailed to him informing him that the case had been set for the 10th; that at the time the letter was written he was on his way to Haskell County, and the day the case was tried he was in the town of Haskell, three hundred and fifty miles away.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">It does not appear from the record whether the case was or was not reached on regular call of the docket on or before the day on which it was tried. The defendant\u2019s attorney reached the court on the morning of the 15th of September, after the trial was over.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Appellant files eight assignments of error, substantially raising the points\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">1. That there was error in trying the case on a day set by the court</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">and plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the absence of defendant and his attorney and without notice to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">2. That there was errer in overruling defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">3. That it was error to charge the jury to find for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s attorneys in all of their communications and correspondence previous to their last letter had expressed their own willingness to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the case set with, but not without the consent of the judge. Even without this reservation all parties were charged with knowledge that it could not be set without such consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-3\">This led defendant\u2019s attorney to request those of plaintiff to see the judge and procure his permission. The reply to this letter for the first time omitted mention of the condition, and for the first time agreed to a day. The defendant\u2019s attorney was fairly justified in concluding from the correspondence that the consent of the judge had been obtained. He did in fact, it seems, give it that construction and acted on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The defendant heard of the mistake only two days before the case was tried. On the day of the trial he was unable from sickness to attend it. Under all the circumstances we do not think he ought to be prejudiced either for not procuring another attorney or applying for a continuance. When a motion for a new trial is made on the ground that the party making it was not represented at the trial, or if present in person or by attorney on the ground that he had no pleadings filed making the issues on which his rights depended, the rule seems well established in this State that in addition to excusing his absence or failure to plead the party must also show by a sufficiently circumstantial statement that he has a meritorious cause of action or defense. Stating generally that he has a meritorious cause of action or defense is not sufficient. Enough should be stated, supported by affidavit, to show at least a prima facie case. Courts ought not in such cases set aside judgments rendered except upon a showing which if true and unexplained would change the result on a subsequent trial. Cowan v. Williams, 49 Texas, 397; Montgomery v. Carlton, 56 Texas, 431; Contreras v. Haynes, 61 Texas, 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We think that in this case the absence of the defendant and his attorney from the trial was sufficiently accounted for, and if he had in support of his motion for a new trial shown facts supporting his pleadings or constituting a meritorious defense not already plead, his motion ought to have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">There being no statement of facts, and the plaintiff\u2019s petition showing a good cause of action, we can not hold that the court erred in charging the jury to find a verdict for plaintiff. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">Opinion February 1, 1889.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
