The court erred in rendering any judgment of foreclosure because the 200 acres upon which the petition alleged a lien and sought a foreclosure was nowhere therein described. The land upon which a foreclosure is sought must be described.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b660-16\">Station, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Apj\">This action was brought by C. L. Watson, surviving partner of a firm originally composed of himself and N. C. Watson. It was brought to recover a balance alleged to be due on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>promissory note for $1430, given for the purchase of two tracts of land described in the petition and together containing 703 acres. The petition alleged that $1197 had been paid on the note, and that the vendor\u2019s lien on 500 acres of the land had been relinquished, and it only prayed for a foreclosure of the lien on 200 acres of the land. Whether the relinquishment of lien was on an undivided 500 acres or upon a particular part \u2022of one of the tracts or upon particular parts of each was not averred.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">There was nothing in the petition to identify the land on which the lien had been released, nor to identify the 200 acres on which foreclosure was asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The court below rendered a judgment for the balance due on the note, and established a lien on the entire 703 acres, which it directed to be sold in satisfaction of the judgment. This is assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The petition did not state facts which identified the 200 acres on which the court was asked to establish and foreclose a lien, but upon its face did show that the plaintiff was not entitled and did not seek to have a lien foreclosed on the entire lands for which the note was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">It not furnishing a basis on which the relief sought could be granted it was error to enter a judgment enforcing a lien on any part of the lands described in it, and the judgment is oppressive in that it enforces a lien against land on which plaintiff expressly averred the lien had been extinguished and against which he sought not to enforce any claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">The judgment of the court below will be reversed,; and as there is nothing in the pleadings from which it can be here correctly entered, the cause will be remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">Opinion February 8, 1889.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
