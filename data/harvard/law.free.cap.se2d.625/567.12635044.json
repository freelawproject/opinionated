Lee (petitioner) was employed by the North Carolina Department of Transportation (respondent) as a member of the maintenance crew. On 10 September 1999 petitioner filed a petition for a contested case hearing in the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH). Subsequent to obtaining counsel, petitioner filed a prehearing statement. The petition alleged a hostile work environment and demotion with insufficient cause. The prehearing statement stated that petitioner was setting forth claims of hostile work environment and discrimination, both because of his race as an African-American.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Respondent filed a motion to dismiss the petition, and the administrative law judge (ALJ) denied this motion on 10 May 2000. The ALJ entered a recommended decision on 29 August 2001, concluding that respondent discriminated against petitioner because of his race, created a racially hostile environment, and retaliated against petitioner for his objections to respondent's attempts to terminate him. The State Personnel Commission (SPC) considered the recommended decision and found it had no jurisdiction to hear petitioner's allegations. The SPC noted that if its finding on jurisdiction were to be reversed, then it adopts the findings and conclusions of the ALJ. Petitioner filed a petition for judicial review in Wake County Superior Court. The trial court entered an order on 11 June 2004 concluding that the SPC erred when it found it lacked jurisdiction over the issues in petitioner's case. The court remanded the case to the SPC to implement the six remedies stated in the ALJ's recommended decision. From this order, respondent appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Respondent assigns error to the trial court's conclusions that: (1) the SPC had jurisdiction to hear petitioner's racial harassment and retaliation claims; and (2) the SPC had jurisdiction over a discrimination claim because petitioner alleged he was demoted and denied training. This Court reviews the trial court's order regarding an agency decision for errors of law, which involves \"(1) determining whether the trial court exercised the appropriate scope of review and, if appropriate, (2) deciding whether the court did so properly.\"\n   <em>\n    Mann Media, Inc. v. Randolph Cty. Planning Bd.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1511222\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/356/1/#p14\">\n    356 N.C. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=565%20S.E.2d%209\">\n    565 S.E.2d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18 (2002) (internal quotations omitted). Thus, we first determine whether the trial court applied the correct standard of review. Petitioner excepted to the SPC's decision that it lacked jurisdiction on the grounds that it is based on errors of law. The trial court stated that, since an error of law was raised,\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the jurisdictional issue was proper. Where the appealing party asserts that the agency's decision was based on an error of law, the trial court must apply a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    See Welter v.

Here, the trial court applied the appropriate scope of review, a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the SPC's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We next determine whether the trial court properly exercised its review. Since each type of claim that petitioner alleged against respondent has distinct jurisdictional requirements, we must review them individually. The first issue is whether the SPC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   lacked jurisdiction to hear petitioner's racial harassment claim asserted under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-34.1(a)(10). The SPC found that petitioner failed to comply with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20126-34\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 126-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which required him to submit written notice to respondent of his harassment claim prior to filing a petition for a contested case. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-34 provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Unless otherwise provided in this Chapter, any career State employee having a grievance arising out of or due to the employee's employment and who does not allege unlawful harassment or discrimination because of the employee's age, sex, race, color, national origin, religion, creed, handicapping condition as defined by G.S. 168A-3, or political affiliation shall first discuss the problem or grievance with the employee's supervisor and follow the grievance procedure established by the employee's department or agency.\n   <em>\n    Any State employee having a grievance arising out of or due to the employee's employment who alleges unlawful harassment because of the employee's age, sex, race, color, national origin, religion, creed, or handicapping condition as defined by G.S. 168A-3 shall submit a written complaint to the employee's department or agency. The department or agency shall have 60 days within which to take appropriate remedial action. If the employee is not satisfied with the department or agency's response to the complaint, the employee shall have the right to appeal directly to the State Personnel Commission.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-34 (2005) (emphasis added). A State employee having a grievance is provided with the statutory right to appeal certain claims directly to the SPC,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   without first filing an internal complaint or exhausting his employer's internal grievance procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-36 (2005). In accordance with this section, an employee may appeal a claim of discrimination directly to the SPC, but an employee alleging harassment must comply with N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-34 as a prerequisite to appealing to the SPC.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20126-34\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Here, petitioner did not have a statutory right of direct appeal to the SPC. The failure of petitioner to comply with N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-34 by submitting a written complaint to respondent and allowing 60 days for respondent to reply was jurisdictional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-37(a) (2005) (\"Appeals involving a disciplinary action, alleged discrimination or harassment, and any other contested case arising under this Chapter shall be conducted in the Office of Administrative Hearings as provided in Article 3 of Chapter 150B; provided that\n   <em>\n    no grievance may be appealed unless the employee has complied with G.S. 126-34.\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added). Accordingly, the SPC lacked jurisdiction to hear petitioner's racial harassment claim. The trial court erred in determining that the SPC had jurisdiction to hear the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Next, we address respondent's argument that the trial court incorrectly found N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-34.1(a)(3) provided another source of jurisdiction in the case. Specifically, the trial court found that N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-34.1(a)(3) provides jurisdiction for a State employee to appeal directly to the OAH when he believes he has been retaliated against for protesting alleged violations of his right to equal opportunity for employment and compensation. The trial court also found that respondent was on notice that the petition and prehearing statement alleged a retaliation claim and that respondent did not object to this basis for jurisdiction. We need not address the latter finding, that petitioner's allegations were sufficient to put respondent on notice of the nature of the claim, because we determine that petitioner did not have a right of direct appeal regarding this claim. Section 126-36 provides a State employee with the right to appeal directly to the OAH a grievance alleging discrimination as set forth in N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-34.1(a)(2); however, an appeal of a grievance alleging harassment or retaliation for opposition to harassment is subject to the requirements of N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-34. Section 126-36 is silent on a claim of retaliation for protesting alleged discrimination in violation of the employee's right to equal opportunity for employment and compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We find no other section of Chapter 126 providing a direct right of appeal to an employee\n   asserting retaliation based upon the employee's protest of an alleged violation of the right to equal opportunity for employment and compensation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-36.1 (2005) (\"Any\n   <em>\n    applicant\n   </em>\n   for State employment who has reason to believe that employment was denied in violation of G.S. 126-16 [right to equal opportunity for employment and compensation] shall have the right to appeal directly to the State Personnel Commission.\") (emphasis added). In order to trigger the jurisdiction of the SPC, petitioner was required to comply with Section 126-34 prior to filing a petition for a contested case.\n   <em>\n    See Nailing v. UNC-CH,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8525281\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/117/318/#p324\">\n    117 N.C.App. 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 324,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=451%20S.E.2d%20351\">\n    451 S.E.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 355 (1994) (petitioner must follow requirements of Chapter 126 for commencing a contested case in order for OAH to have jurisdiction),\n   <em>\n    disc. review denied,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2556193,2559269,2556240,2556593,2558195\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/339/614/\">\n    339 N.C. 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=454%20S.E.2d%20255\">\n    454 S.E.2d 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995);\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

Petitioner's failure to follow respondent's internal grievance procedure prior to appealing his retaliation claim deprived the SPC of jurisdiction. The trial court erred in concluding that the SPC had jurisdiction over a retaliation claim pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-34.1(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The final issue is whether petitioner alleged a discrimination claim under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-34.1(a)(2). The parties agree that, if alleged properly, this is a separate claim conferring subject matter jurisdiction to the SPC. Respondent contends that petitioner failed to allege discrimination in his petition because he did not allege a specific adverse employment action. Petitioner's petition did not allege racial discrimination. However, the petition stated that the grievance was based upon demotion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The prehearing statement alleged demotion due to race and stated that petitioner was transferred from a truck driving job to a flagging job requiring him to stand for long periods of time. The prehearing statement also stated that petitioner was sent to the wrong location when he applied to take a training course. The trial court concluded that petitioner sufficiently alleged a discrimination claim. Construing the pleadings liberally, including both the petition and the prehearing statement, we agree.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 8(f) (pleadings must be construed so \"as to do substantial justice\");\n   <em>\n    Winbush v.

Additionally, we note that petitioner has a direct right of appeal to the SPC where his grievance asserts discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 126-36 (2005). Thus, the trial court correctly concluded that the SPC has jurisdiction over petitioner's discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court's conclusion that the SPC has jurisdiction to hear petitioner's discrimination claim. We reverse the court's conclusions that the SPC has jurisdiction to hear petitioner's racial harassment or retaliation claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Affirmed in part; reversed in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Judge HUDSON concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Judge LEWIS concurs in part, dissents in part by separate opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1.\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Petitioner altered the form from \"demotion without just cause\" to read \"demotion without [sic] Insufficient Cause.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n  <author id=\"p-29\">\n   LEWIS, Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I agree with the majority's conclusion that the SPC lacked jurisdiction to hear petitioner's racial harassment and retaliation claims.
