Defendants argue on appeal that the trial court erred (1) in denying their motion for a directed verdict on the issue of negligence and (2) in not instructing the jury on the issue of contributory negligence. Because the evidence is undisputed that Strickland crossed the center line and Ligon offered sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable juror to find that Strickland struck Ligon, the trial court properly denied defendants' motion for a directed verdict. We agree with defendants, however, that when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to them, the record contains sufficient evidence to warrant submission of the issue of contributory negligence to the jury. Defendants are, therefore, entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the evening of 21 December 1997, Ligon went to a ball field with his friend, Charlie Hawkins, where they drank a bottle of liquor. At some point between midnight and 1:00 a.m., Ligon, who was dressed in dark clothes, left Hawkins and began to walk home along Green Valley Road in rural Buncombe County. Ligon was walking along the left hand side of the road facing the traffic. In a field next to the road, he noticed a white horse that he knew and clapped his hands to get the horse's attention. Ligon testified that he then heard a noise like a \"whoosh.\" He does not remember anything further until he woke up in the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Strickland, who was called as a witness by Ligon, testified that at approximately 12:30 or 1:00 a.m. on 21 December 1997, he was driving his father's car on Green Valley\n   Road. According to Strickland, approximately a quarter of a mile down the road, he saw an animal in the middle of the road, he swerved off to the left, and he struck a fence five to six feet off the left side of the road with sufficient force to deploy his air bag. Strickland testified that, without stopping, he \"got back control\" and returned to the road and drove to his house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   He woke his father and told him that he had hit a fence. The two Stricklands then drove back to the scene. Both testified they wanted to make sure that no livestock was escaping through the damaged fence. They found Ligon tangled up in the fence exactly where Strickland had struck the fence. Strickland's father called 911.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   James Powell, a firefighter and EMS technician, responded to the accident. Upon arrival, he found Ligon sitting in a fence five to six feet from the road. Powell described Ligon as confused, disoriented, and inebriated. Although Ligon stated that he wanted to get up and walk home, Powell could tell from his observations that Ligon had suffered a broken leg. A state highway patrol trooper, Stan Webb, also responded and, after interviewing Strickland, prepared a report of the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the hospital, Ligon was treated for a compound fracture of the right leg and multiple abrasions on the right shoulder. At that time, Ligon's blood alcohol level was .08.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ligon's treating orthopedic surgeon testified that the injuries to Ligon's right leg were consistent with a high energy impact from behind by a motor vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The case was tried in Buncombe County Superior Court beginning 6 January 2004. The trial court denied defendants' motion for a directed verdict at the close of plaintiff's evidence and at the close of all the evidence. Over defendants' objection, the court submitted only two issues to the jury: whether plaintiff was injured by defendants' negligence and, if so, the amount of damages plaintiff was entitled to recover. The jury awarded plaintiff $50,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On 2 April 2004, the trial court entered judgment against defendants for the amount awarded by the jury and for additional costs incurred by plaintiff. Defendants' motions for judgment not withstanding the verdict and for a new trial were denied in an order dated 29 April 2004. Defendants filed their notice of appeal on 4 May 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Denial of Defendants' Directed Verdict Motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants first assign error to the trial court's denial of their motion for a directed verdict at the close of plaintiff's evidence and again at the close of all the evidence. As this Court has explained, however:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When a motion is made for directed verdict at the close of the plaintiff's evidence, the trial court may either rule on the motion or reserve its ruling on the motion. By offering evidence, however, a defendant waives its motion for directed verdict made at the close of plaintiff's evidence. Accordingly, if a defendant offers evidence after making a motion for directed verdict, \"any subsequent ruling by the trial judge upon defendant's motion for directed verdict must be upon a renewal of the motion by the defendant at the close of all the evidence, and the judge's ruling must be based upon the evidence of both plaintiff and defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Stallings v.

Ligon offered evidence that he noticed the dog, but that the dog was in a yard up a hill right before the collision; no one else saw a dog in the area after the collision. Strickland's testimony was vague: he said \"something\n   came out in front of [him] in the middle of the road\"; he did not recall it darting, but rather it was simply \"in the road\"; he could only \"guess\" where he first saw the animal; and he could not recall from which direction the animal had come, although he would \"guess\" that it came from the right side. He said that his recollection was \"very vague\" and he was having a \"hard time remembering.\" Thus, there is a question for the jury as to whether an animal was in the road that caused Strickland to cross over the center line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Even if the presence of the animal were undisputed, plaintiff also offered evidence that Strickland traveled 20 feet across the center line from his legal lane of travel and continued to the fence. Further, there is no evidence suggesting that Strickland attempted to brake or slow down to avoid the animal. Strickland testified:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Q And you saw the animal in your lights and you swerved across the roadway to the left, and that you swerved all the way across the roadway to the left across this section here and hit this fence.

You said you came back to and you were on the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A I hit the fence and I must have corrected it. I don't see how it would have righted itself up on the road. The next thing I remember, I was on the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   He later confirmed that he was traveling 35 to 40 miles per hour, hit the fence with \"[m]ore of a sidewswipe and [kept] going.\" He stated: \"I never stopped.\" According to Strickland, once he \"got back control\" or \"gained control,\" he was again on the road. With respect to Ligon, he testified: \"I never saw him.\" Ligon, however, presented evidence that it was a clear, moonlit night, and he was standing next to the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As this Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Brewer:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [T]he question to be resolved by the jury is not simply whether defendants' car skidded, but whether [the] defendant [driver] was in the wrong lane, and if so, whether he was there through no fault of his own.

Plaintiff's evidence in this case, when viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, is sufficient to allow a jury to find that Strickland was negligent in failing to keep his car under control - even if he needed to avoid an animal - and in failing to keep a proper lookout.\n   <em>\n    See Troy v.

Strickland, however, admitted that Ligon was found entangled in the fence at the precise point where he struck the fence. In addition, the timing of his collision with the fence corresponds with the timing of Ligon being struck by a vehicle from behind. It is not speculation but rather a reasonable inference that only one car during the time frame of 12:30 to 1:00 a.m. ran off the road at the particular spot where Ligon was standing and struck the fence. Further, the state highway patrol trooper's report states that Strickland struck Ligon. While defendants\n   objected to the trial court's admission of the report, they have not challenged that ruling on appeal. This evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to Ligon, was sufficient to allow a reasonable juror to disbelieve defendants' two vehicle theory and find that Strickland struck Ligon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendants rely upon\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

The diagram drawn by Trooper Webb to reconstruct the accident has Ligon first being struck by Strickland's vehicle in the middle of the road and then being pushed to the fence. The narrative portion of the report states, consistent with the diagram, that \"[t]he pedestrian was struck by Vehicle 1. Vehicle 1 and the pedestrian\n   <em>\n    continued off the roadway\n   </em>\n   to the left\" before colliding with the fence. (Emphasis added.) In order to continue off the roadway after being struck, one must first be in the roadway. Although Ligon, at trial, challenged the basis for the officer's statement that Ligon was in the road, Ligon was the party who offered the officer's testimony and Ligon relied upon the report in establishing Strickland's negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The jury should have had an opportunity to decide whether Ligon was in fact in the road. When this evidence is considered in addition to evidence that Ligon was walking along a road at night in dark clothes while intoxicated, we believe that the trial court erred in failing to present the issue of contributory negligence to the jury.\n   <em>\n    Clark v.

Nevertheless, because this issue is likely to recur at the second trial, we address it briefly. We agree with defendants that, based upon the evidence offered at trial, the court properly gave an instruction regarding sudden emergency. Defendants, however, have objected to the trial court's alteration of the pattern jury instruction (N.C.P.I.-Civ. 102.15) (motor veh. vol.1996) by adding the following sentence: \"This doctrine of sudden emergency only applies when a person is apparently or actually in danger. It does not apply if only a non-human animal is in danger.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In making this alteration, the trial court explained that he wanted to make sure that the jury understood that the doctrine applied only if the driver was acting to avoid danger to himself or to another person and did not apply if the driver swerved only \"to save the life of an animal.\" Defendants do not disagree with the trial court's reasoning, but argue that a jury could misunderstand the instruction to preclude application of the doctrine if the animal in the road was in imminent danger regardless of any accompanying danger to the driver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We believe it unlikely that the jury interpreted the instruction in that fashion given that the trial court's alteration of the pattern instruction stated that the doctrine \"does not apply if\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   a non-human animal is in danger.\" (Emphasis added.) Nevertheless, on remand, we urge the trial court to take care to ensure that any sudden emergency instruction that is given focuses on whether the driver was \"suddenly and unexpectedly confronted with imminent danger to himself or others.\"\n   <em>\n    Holbrook v.
