Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 21 January 2003, plaintiff filed an application for site plan approval with defendant to construct an asphalt plant within the town limits of Hillsborough. Georgia-Pacific Corporation owned the property on which the facility was to be constructed. Plaintiff had entered into a contract to purchase the property prior to submitting his application for site plan review, and subsequently purchased the property. At the time plaintiff filed his application, an asphalt plant was a permitted use in a general industrial (GI) district subject to a site plan review. The property on which the asphalt plant was to be constructed was zoned GI. In reliance on the zoning ordinance in effect at the time of his application, plaintiff spent approximately $100,000.00 to engineer and submit a site plan to comply with the conditional use requirements set forth in the ordinance and to prepare for the required public hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Board of Adjustment held public hearings on 12 February 2003, 12 March 2003, and 9 April 2003 to review plaintiff's application. The Board received evidence in favor of and in opposition to plaintiff's site plan submission, but reached no decision. At the close of the 9 April 2003 hearing, the Board of Adjustment again continued and scheduled a fourth hearing on 30 April 2003.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On 22 April 2003, the Town of Hillsborough Board of Commissioners adopted \"An Ordinance Amending the Town of Hillsborough Zoning Ordinance to Temporarily Suspend the Review, Consideration and Issuance of Permits and Applications for Manufacturing and Processing Operations Involving Petroleum Products\" (\"the moratorium\"). The moratorium provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Notwithstanding any provision in this Zoning Ordinance to the contrary, no manufacturing and processing facility involving petroleum products as one of the materials being manufactured and/or processed (including, but not limited to, refineries for gasoline and other fuels, liquefied gas refineries,\n   <em>\n    asphalt plants,\n   </em>\n   finished petroleum products plants, plants which manufacture asphalt paving mixtures and blocks, asphalt shingles and/or coating materials, and plants manufacturing or processing petroleum lubricating oils and greases) shall be permitted, and\n   <em>\n    no application for any permit or approval to operate such facility shall be accepted, processed, reviewed or considered by the Town. This section shall apply to all applications for a permit or approval, including any application which is pending as of the effective date hereof.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Emphasis supplied). The \"moratorium\" further provides it shall be effective immediately upon adoption and shall remain in effect until 31 December 2003 unless sooner terminated by the Board of Commissioners or extended by the Board for a period of not longer than six months. Defendant issued a notice cancelling the 30 April 2003 Board of Adjustment's scheduled and continued hearing to further review plaintiff's site plan application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 24 November 2003, the Board of Commissioners amended Section 3.3 of the zoning ordinance to totally prohibit \"manufacturing and processing facilities involving the use of petroleum products, such as ... asphalt plants ... in the Town of Hillsborough and its extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction.\" The ordinance stated, \"This section shall apply to all applications for a permit or approval, including any application which is pending as of the effective date hereof.\" The ordinance's amendment became effective 1\n   March 2004. The Board of Commissioners also extended the \"moratorium\" in effect until the effective date of the permanent ban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff filed a complaint and petition for judicial review and writ of certiorari in Orange County Superior Court on 22 January 2004. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted on 28 October 2004. Plaintiff appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    II. Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff argues the trial court erred in granting defendant's motion for summary judgment because: (1) plaintiff is entitled to rely upon the language of the zoning ordinance in effect at the time he applied for the permit; (2) defendant violated N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 160A-364 (2003) by failing to give notice of a public hearing or hold a public hearing prior to its decision to extend the moratorium; and (3) defendant's decision to permanently prohibit asphalt plants was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    III.

Valid approval of a site plan is a prerequisite to the establishment of vested rights pursuant to North Carolina General Statutes, section 160A-385.1(c), and the absence of such approval is fatal to plaintiff's establishment of a statutory vested right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff concedes that he does not have a statutory vested right to approval of his site plan application, but argues that his rights did not vest statutorily due to defendant's refusal to issue a decision on his application.

The evidence in the record on appeal clearly demonstrates that the failure to reach a decision on plaintiff's application was the result of ongoing consideration of various, complicated issues regarding the project. Plaintiff's attorney did not object to the continuation of any of the Board of Adjustment meetings and even informed the Board, when the lateness of the hour was pointed out, that his cross-examination of the witness testifying at the time would be extensive. While this complicated review was proceeding, the Town of Hillsborough enacted the moratorium on the acceptance, review, or consideration of new or pending applications for approval of any manufacturing or processing facility involving petroleum products. This sequence of events necessarily ended the ongoing review of plaintiff's application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In the alternative, plaintiff argues that he is entitled to a vested right pursuant to the common law.

Plaintiff further contends that these expenditures and obligation were incurred in good faith and in reasonable reliance on the approval of his Erosion Control Plan by Orange County. The reliance on the approval of the Erosion Control Plan is not sufficient, however, to establish a common law vested right in plaintiff. The approval is not a building permit, as is required to establish common law vested rights, nor is it similar in nature to a building permit. Further, the approval was granted by a governmental agency completely\n   distinct, separate, and beyond the control of the Town of Hillsborough and was merely one step in the process of evaluation and approval of a site plan. Plaintiff did not have a valid building permit, or any permit issued by defendant whatsoever, upon which he could reasonably rely prior to the enactment of the moratorium and permanent ban. Consequently, no common law vested right arose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As defendant had neither a statutory vested right nor a common law vested right to the approval of his site plan application, I would overrule this assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The majority contends this Court previously has addressed the issue presented in the instant case in\n   <em>\n    Lambeth v.

Defendant contends that public notice and hearing, pursuant to North Carolina General Statutes, section 160A-364, were required for the valid extension of the moratorium. Defendant argues that no further notice or hearing was required as the original moratorium, the validity of which was never challenged by plaintiff, included a provision for the extension of the moratorium by the Hillsborough Town Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Pursuant to North Carolina General Statutes, section 160A-364, notice of public hearing was published on 9 April and 16 April 2003 regarding a special Joint Public Hearing of the Hillsborough Town Board and the Planning Board on 22 April 2003. In pertinent part, the notice provided:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   2. Zoning Ordinance Amendment. Amendment to establish a development moratorium on the processing, review and approval of applications for permits and approvals, including site plans, for all manufacturing and processing facilities which involve petroleum products (including asphalt) on all properties under the Town's zoning jurisdiction. The Town is currently working on amending the regulations for such facilities and desires to suspend the current permitting and approval process while modified development regulations are being considered.\n   <em>\n    The proposed development moratorium will expire on December 31, 2003, unless (1) sooner terminated by the Town Board or (II)\n   </em>\n   [sic]\n   <em>\n    extended by the Town Board, for a period not longer than six months, prior to December 31, 2003.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   (emphasis added). At the 22 April hearing, interested parties on both sides were given the opportunity to speak regarding the proposed moratorium. Three possible courses of action were presented: (1) enact no moratorium; (2) enact a moratorium on new applications; or (3) enact a moratorium on pending and future applications. During the discussion, the Chairman of the Planning Board asked how the moratorium would end and was told that it would end automatically upon the adoption of new language or on 31 December 2003 unless the Town Board took action to extend it. No exception or argument was made regarding this statement by anyone, including plaintiff. The third option was selected by unanimous vote of the Town Board. The enacted ordinance contained the exact language regarding the expiration of the ordinance that was included in the notice of hearing which was published in accordance with North Carolina General Statutes, section 160A-364.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   North Carolina General Statutes, section 160A-364 provides, in relevant part, \"[b]efore adopting or amending any ordinance authorized by this Article, the city council shall hold a public hearing on it.\" The portion of the ordinance at issue in the instant case states:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   This Ordinance shall be effective immediately upon adoption, and shall remain in effect until 11:59:59 p.m. on December 31, 2003 unless sooner terminated by the Board of Commissioners, or unless extended for a period of not longer than six months by the Board of Commissioners acting prior to expiration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the requirements of section 160A-364 must be strictly construed based upon this Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Sandy Mush Props., Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Sandy Mush,\n   </em>\n   we held that the failure of the county to run two advertisements noticing a public hearing during which a proposed temporary moratorium was to be discussed, as required pursuant to North Carolina General Statutes, section 153A-323 (a statute applicable to county governments which is analogous to section 160A-364 which applies to municipal governments) resulted in the subsequently enacted temporary moratorium being invalid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 168,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=595%20S.E.2d%20233\">\n    595 S.E.2d at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The temporary moratorium was held invalid as a result of the failure to run the two required advertisements despite the fact that the plaintiff in the case had actual notice of the hearing and had the opportunity to, and did in fact, speak at the hearing in opposition to the temporary moratorium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   I agree with plaintiff that the requirements of section 160A-364 must be strictly construed. Section 160A-364 requires the holding of a public hearing prior to the adoption or modification of any ordinance, and that notice of that hearing be given once a\n   week for two successive weeks prior to the hearing in a newspaper of general distribution in the area. N.C. Gen. Stat, \u00a7 160A-364. Plaintiff does not argue that the adoption of the ordinance originally enacting the temporary moratorium did not comply with the requirements of section 160A-364. Therefore, the validity of the temporary moratorium is not at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Instead, plaintiff argues that the extension of the temporary moratorium modified the original ordinance and, therefore, additional notice and a second public hearing, as provided in section 160A-364, were required. However, the provisions of the original ordinance explicitly authorized an extension, of no more than six months, of the temporary moratorium by action of the Board of Commissioners. The exact language of this provision as adopted was included in the public notice of the hearing regarding the adoption of the temporary moratorium. Further, that provision was discussed at the public hearing without objection or comment by any party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The provisions of the temporary moratorium ordinance specifically authorized the extension of the temporary moratorium by the Board of Commissioners. I find no authority which prohibits the inclusion of a pre-approved extension in a duly enacted ordinance. The extension of the temporary moratorium for two months on 1 December 2003 by the Board of Commissioners was, therefore, authorized pursuant to the terms of the ordinance. Accordingly, as section 160A-364 applies only to\n   <em>\n    adoption\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    modification\n   </em>\n   of ordinances, and that section must be strictly construed, I would hold that the extension of the temporary moratorium was not subject to the requirements of section 160A-364 as it did not modify the original ordinance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that the amendment to defendant's zoning ordinance banning manufacturing and processing facilities involving the use of petroleum products violated the Law of the Land Clause of Article I, section 19 of the North Carolina Constitution. The Law of the Land Clause of the North Carolina Constitution, N.C. Const. art.
