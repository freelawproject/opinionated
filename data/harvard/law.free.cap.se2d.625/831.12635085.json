Durham beckoned Rickie to come over to the house next door. The two men then argued about drugs that Defendant thought Rickie had stolen from him. When Charles heard Defendant say, \"I'll beat your ass, boy,\" he pulled Rickie back to their grandmother's front porch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Late that evening, Charles and Rickie rode to a local nightclub - Charles drove because Rickie was drunk and asleep during the drive. When Charles pulled into the parking lot of the nightclub, he saw a white Jeep belonging to Kip Hargrove, Defendant's cousin. Charles tried to turn around but the car stalled almost directly in front of Hargrove's Jeep. While Charles attempted to restart the car, Defendant reached inside the car with a revolver in his hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to Charles, Defendant put the revolver in Rickie's face, and said, \"[w]hat's up now, n-ger.\" Defendant then opened the door and got into the car. Rickie awoke, grabbed Defendant's gun and struggled over the gun with Defendant. Meanwhile, Charles opened the driver's door, rolled out of the car, ducked behind the back seat door, raised up to look into the car, and saw Defendant shooting Rickie in the chest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After the shooting, Charles got back into the car, moved Rickie's leg off the gear shift, reached over Rickie to shut the passenger side door, took a fully loaded revolver from under the passenger's seat and threw it out of the car window from the driver's side. The gun was later retrieved with no rounds fired. Charles then drove Rickie to the hospital, but Rickie died before they arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Other State witnesses included Hargrove who agreed to testify under a plea agreement\n   with the State, whereby he pled guilty to accessory after the fact to voluntary manslaughter. The State also presented expert testimony from Dr. Deborah Radisch of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Dr. Radisch testified that she was present and observed the victim's autopsy, but that the autopsy was actually performed by Dr. Karen Chancellor, a forensic pathologist who had since left North Carolina for employment elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant presented evidence at trial tending to indicate that he was standing near or inside the nightclub when the gunshots were fired and that he did not have a gun that evening. Defendant also presented expert testimony from Michael Grissom, an independent crime scene investigator. Grissom testified that he examined the car where the victim was sitting when he was shot. He observed that the right front passenger seat was reclined, but that he found no bullet holes in the seat or in the front right door. Grissom attempted to testify using a diagram that he drew to illustrate the victim's body in the car, however, the trial court excluded the diagram from evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant was convicted of one count of second degree murder and one count of discharging a weapon into occupied property. The trial court sentenced Defendant to a term of 237 to 294 months for the second degree murder conviction and thirty-six to fifty-three months for the discharging a weapon into occupied property conviction, to run consecutively. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, Defendant argues that the trial court committed plain error by allowing the prosecution to introduce evidence of an autopsy report performed by a non-testifying pathologist because the admission of that evidence violated his confrontation rights under the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Crawford,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendant contends there was evidence to show that when he allegedly shot the victim, it occurred during a struggle and after the two had been involved in a confrontation earlier that day. However, the amount of time that elapsed between the earlier confrontation and the time of the shooting does not support an argument that Defendant acted in the heat of passion upon provocation thus entitling him to a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To the contrary, the State presented evidence through Charles's testimony that Defendant initiated the confrontation with the victim. Charles testified that Defendant approached the car while the victim was asleep in the passenger's seat, reached into the car with a chrome, silver revolver, and put the revolver in the victim's face and said, \"[w]hat's up now, n-ger[.]\" After Defendant opened the passenger's car door, the victim and Defendant struggled over Defendant's gun inside the car. Charles then opened the driver's car door, rolled out of the car and ducked behind the back door. Charles further testified that he raised up to look into the car and saw Defendant shooting Rickie in the chest. Dr. Radisch, the expert forensic pathologist, testified that the victim had ten bullet wounds, and died as a result of a gunshot wound to the chest. Such evidence unequivocally tends to show an unlawful killing with malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant, on the other hand, presented testimony through several witnesses that he did not have a gun on the night of the shooting, and that he was standing in the\n   doorway of the building, not beside the car in which the victim was killed, when the gunshots were fired. \"[A] defendant is not entitled to have the jury consider a lesser offense when his sole defense is one of alibi[.]\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Corbett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2558792\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/339/313/#p335\">\n    339 N.C. 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=451%20S.E.2d%20252\">\n    451 S.E.2d 252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 264 (1994). Indeed, our Supreme Court has held:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   where a defendant's sole defense is one of alibi, he is not entitled to have the jury consider a lesser offense on the theory that jurors may take bits and pieces of the State's evidence and bits and pieces of defendant's evidence and thus find him guilty of a lesser offense not positively supported by the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Brewer,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2489106\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/325/550/#p576\">\n    325 N.C. 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 576,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=386%20S.E.2d%20569\">\n    386 S.E.2d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 584 (1989). Here, Defendant's sole defense was simply that he did not shoot the victim at all. Defendant did not concede in any way that he may have been near the car where the victim was shot, or that he shot him in a heat of passion or in self-defense. Because the evidence presented at trial would not have supported a verdict finding Defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter, and Defendant's only defense to the murder charge was that he was not present at the time of the shooting, the trial court did not err in failing to submit the lesser included offense to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant next contends the trial court improperly excluded from evidence an exhibit prepared by Defendant's expert that purported to show the trajectory of the ten bullets that hit the victim. Defendant argues that the trial court's exclusion of this evidence deprived him of his constitutional right to present evidence at his trial. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The admissibility of evidence is governed by Rule 403 of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading of the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   N.C.

First of all, the exhibit may be relevant; it may be probative; however, the exhibit is two-dimensional. The testimony of Dr. Radisch was three-dimensional. Therefore, the Court does not find that even if relevant and probative, Defendant's Exhibit 18, its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of misleading the jury in that it is a two-dimensional exhibit and does not show what Dr. Radisch testified to in three-dimensional form. So the [State's] objection is sustained on that ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In light of this explanation, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court in excluding Exhibit 18. Accordingly, Defendant's assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In his final argument on appeal, Defendant contends that the trial court erred in finding an aggravating factor and sentencing him within the aggravated range in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.\n   <em>\n    See Blakely,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    542 U.S. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868041\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/296/\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
