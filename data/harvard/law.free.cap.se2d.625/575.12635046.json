Defendant was also indicted for conspiracy to commit: first degree murder;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury; robbery with a dangerous weapon; and first degree burglary. Defendant was tried before a jury at the 3 May 2004 criminal session of the Cumberland County Superior Court, the Honorable Jack A. Thompson presiding. On 6 May 2004, the jury returned guilty verdicts for attempted first degree murder, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, attempted armed robbery, first degree burglary, conspiracy to commit robbery with a firearm and conspiracy to commit first degree burglary. Defendant appeals his convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the evening of 13 October 2002, Michael David Fields was playing video games with his friend, Michael Isreal, in his room at his home in Hope Mills, North Carolina. Fields lived in the house with his mother, Sarah McGougan, who was also home at the time. Earlier in the afternoon, Fields had been drinking beer and smoking marijuana. He had also sold marijuana from his home three or four times earlier that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Responding to a knock on his front door, Fields looked out the window, saw a car which he thought he recognized as belonging to his friend, Melvin Franklin, but could not see who was at the door. When Fields opened the inside door, three armed men were standing at the doorway, the glass storm door having already been opened. Two of the men had their faces covered such that Fields did not recognize them, but he recognized the third man, whose face was not fully covered, as defendant, whom he had known for several years. The men grabbed Fields and pulled him outside, demanding money and drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The two men whose faces were covered then entered the house and made their way to Fields' bedroom where Isreal was waiting for Fields to return. They demanded Isreal tell them where the money and the marijuana were. Isreal replied that he didn't know. The men then forced him onto the floor and took whatever was in his pockets. Isreal testified he was certain that neither of the men who came into the bedroom was the defendant. While the two men were in the bedroom with him, Isreal heard two gunshots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Fields testified that he \"tussled\" with the men holding him on the front porch, then ran away toward his neighbor's house. Fields heard a single shot and did not remember anything more from that night. Police later discovered Fields lying face down and partially conscious next to a neighbor's bush. A bullet hole was observed in his back, and the bullet was found in the front of his shirt when he was rolled over. Fields was taken to Cape Fear Valley Medical Center, where he spent nearly a month in a coma, and over eight months in the hospital. After coming out of his coma in the hospital, Fields identified the defendant as the person he recognized from the assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant was arrested and a shotgun and handgun were found in the room in which defendant was staying. Defendant did not testify, but did present the testimony of his cousin, Melvin Franklin, who testified that he asked Fields in the hospital if he knew who had shot him, and Fields appeared to shake his head indicating no. On cross-examination, Franklin was asked by the prosecutor whether he had talked with Sarah McGougan, Fields' mother, shortly after the shooting and told her that the defendant had shot her son. Franklin admitted talking with McGougan, but denied that he said defendant did the shooting. McGougan then testified in rebuttal that Franklin told her that defendant shot her son.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On appeal, defendant raises twelve issues discussed in turn below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    I\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant first argues that as North Carolina does not specifically authorize the use of a short-form indictment for the crime of attempted murder and because the indictment at issue did not sufficiently allege the offense of attempted first-degree murder, his conviction for attempted murder must be vacated. \"To be sufficient under our Constitution, an indictment `must allege lucidly and accurately all the essential elements of the offense endeavored to be charged.'\"\n   <em>\n    State v.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Hunt,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"491439\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc/357/257/#p267\">\n    357 N.C. 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=582%20S.E.2d%20593\">\n    582 S.E.2d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 600 (2003) (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Robbery with a Dangerous Weapon, ... and First Degree Burglary ... against Michael David Fields and Sarah McGougan, 4600 Rita Court, Hope Mills, North Carolina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The trial court initially instructed the jury that in order to find defendant guilty of conspiracy:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [T]he State had to prove three things beyond a reasonable doubt. First, that the defendant and two other black males entered into an agreement. Second, that the agreement was to commit first degree murder; assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury; robbery with a firearm and first degree burglary. And, third, that the defendant and two other black males intended that the agreement be carried out at the time it was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In response to questions from the jury concerning the conspiracy charge, and over defendant's objection, the trial court changed its conspiracy instruction and gave the jury an amended verdict sheet which read:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    AS TO COUNT NUMBER TWO:\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   ___ GUILTY OF CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT THE FELONIES OF (CHECK EACH OFFENSE THAT YOU FIND THE DEFENDANT CONSPIRED TO DO)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ___ FIRST DEGREE MURDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   ___ ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON WITH INTENT TO KILL INFLICTING SERIOUS INJURY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   ___ ROBBERY WITH A FIREARM\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   ___ FIRST DEGREE BURGLARY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   OR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   ___ NOT GUILTY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The trial court instructed the jury to simply \"check the space beside the offense you find the defendant has conspired to.\" The jury returned the verdict sheet finding defendant guilty of conspiracy to commit the felonies of robbery with a firearm and first degree burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A plain reading of the indictment indicates defendant was charged with one conspiracy that included the commission of multiple crimes. To convict defendant of conspiracy under the indictment at issue, the jury was not required to find that defendant agreed to commit every unlawful act alleged, only that defendant agreed to commit at least one of the unlawful acts. Furthermore, the change in the jury instructions did not constitute a material variance in the conspiracy charge, it merely established which unlawful acts were proven to the jury to support their verdict of guilty on the charge of conspiracy. The jury found defendant guilty of conspiracy to commit the felonies of robbery with a firearm and first-degree burglary and defendant was subsequently sentenced based upon a single conviction of conspiracy. This assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    V\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant next argues that his conspiracy conviction must be vacated because there is insufficient evidence he entered into an agreement to commit the offenses in this case. \"A criminal conspiracy is an agreement between two or more people to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act in an unlawful manner.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
