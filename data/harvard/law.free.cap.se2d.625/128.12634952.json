We dismiss, as interlocutory, the appeal of all defendants except Haehnel, and we reverse the trial court's denial of Haehnel's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The complaint alleged,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   18. The Plaintiff Sean Farrell began attending the public schools of Transylvania County in the fall of 1998. Sean has cerebral palsy, developmental delay, and other disabilities which qualify him as a student with special needs. Sean's condition prevents\n   him from communicating verbally. He has limited ability to use sign language. As a result of these special needs, Sean was placed in a specialized educational environment within the Defendant School Board's school system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   20. At the beginning of the 2001-2002 school year, Sean was placed in a self-contained classroom at Brevard Elementary School and Sean's classroom teacher was Defendant Garvin. In addition to Defendant Garvin, the classroom has three teacher's aides, two of which were Defendant Wohlers and Eva Grey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   21. Unlike some of the disabled students in Defendant Garvin's classroom, Sean was able to independently feed himself and enjoyed all varieties of food. He was, according to Defendants Garvin and Wohlers, a good eater, liked all kinds of foods, and would always clean his plate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   22. At the time Sean began attending school and through August, 2001, he functioned well within the program, and was a happy, healthy child, but for his special needs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   23. The Plaintiffs had noticed some occasional behavior changes in Sean the spring of 2001[.][T]hese behaviors disappeared during summer school when Defendant Wohlers was not in Sean's classroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   24. Initially during the 2001-2002 school year, Defendant Wohlers was absent due to a surgical procedure, and missed approximately the first 30 days of school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   27. Within days of Defendant Wohlers['] [return to work] in Sean's class, the Plaintiffs William and Suzanne Farrell began noticing immediate changes [in] Sean's behavior reminiscent of those which occurred in the spring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   31. . . . [S]ean became depressed, became severely withdrawn, and anxious, fearful of food. Sean would cling to his mother and cry when going to school. This behavior was unusual in that Sean had always loved and enjoyed going to school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   36. The Plaintiffs were eventually told by Eva Grey, the other teacher's aide in Sean's classroom, that Sean was being treated abusively by the Defendant Wohlers. This abuse included:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   a. being force fed by Wohlers at times to the point of choking on a regular basis;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   b. Wohlers yelling at him and using abusive language;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   c. his head being jerked back violently and hair being pulled while his face was being washed; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   d. Defendant Wohlers using a stuffed animal she knew that Sean was terrified of to intimidate him to stay on his mat for naptime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   37. Eva Grey informed the Plaintiffs that she had notified Defendant Haehnel about her disclosures to the Plaintiffs two days before[] the Plaintiffs contacted interim principal Susan Allred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   39. Defendant Haehnel and Susan Allred were assigned to the investigation and informed the Plaintiffs that they would conduct a thorough investigation of the alleged abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   40. After Defendant Haehnel investigated the allegations of Eva Grey that Defendant Wohlers abused Sean, she informed the Plaintiffs that Eva Grey had made up these allegations because she was jealous of Defendant Wohlers and wanted her job. Moreover Defendant Haehnel indicated that no other individual had substantiated Eva Grey's allegations and that Defendant Wohlers was exonerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   45. Defendant Haehnel's investigation file documented that other school personnel and outside staff had complained about Defendant Wohlers' abusive behavior towards disabled students and inappropriate conduct; that Defendant Garvin's classroom was not properly supervised; and that Defendant Wohlers based on Defendant Haehnel's own personal observations acted inappropriately towards students in Defendant Garvin's classroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   46. Teacher's aide, Roxanne Jones, who also worked in the self-contained classroom\n   witnessed Defendant Wohlers, in the presence of Defendant Garvin, and under the authority, direction or control of Defendants Garvin, Morgan, Kiviniemi, Holliday, and the School Board:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   a. yell at the children;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   b. tell them to \"shut up\";\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   c. pinch them behind their ears causing bruises;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   d. squeeze them under the arms causing bruises;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   e. stuff food into students' mouths;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   f. hold their head in a headlock, continue to stuff food into students' mouths until they gagged during which time one student projectile vomited;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   g. verbally intimidate the children by yelling at them until they broke down crying;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   h. hold their foreheads roughly and yank their heads back in order to wash their face in the bathroom; and,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   i. made inappropriate sexual and lewd comments in front of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   67. Sean's condition became so severe that he was admitted to Mission Hospital from January 16 to January 24, 2002 for IV therapy and a thorough medical workup to find a cause for his severe anxiety associated with food.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   71. These tests indicated that there was no physical reason for Sean's failure to eat and drink. The attending pediatric physician and residents from Mission Hospital, including the gastro-intestinal doctor and occupational therapists all agreed that Sean's eating problems were consistent with severe anxiety and depression due to suspected child abuse in the classroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   82. Defendant Wohlers was subsequently terminated by Transylvania County Schools in part because of more abuse allegations of another disabled student and a pattern of inappropriate conduct towards students. 83. After several months, Sean was placed back in Defendant Garvin's classroom with his familiar peers, routine, and staff. Defendant Wohlers was no longer an aide in Sean's classroom and he started eating again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   . . .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   85. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and therefore allege, that the above described ongoing pattern and practice of physical and verbal abuse, by definition, are not appropriate to achieve educational goals, and they instead result in lasting and irreparable damage to Plaintiff Sean Farrell and violated his property right to a public education as guaranteed by the North Carolina Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Based on these allegations and others, Suzanne and William Farrell (collectively \"plaintiffs\") filed suit individually and on behalf of the minor child Sean Farrell (\"Sean\") against defendants. In their complaint, plaintiffs asserted causes of action for negligent supervision, negligent hiring and retention, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and violation of substantive due process under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiffs also sought punitive damages. The Transylvania County Board of Education filed a motion to dismiss, covering all defendants sued in their \"official capacities\" and Donna Garvin (\"Garvin\"). Defendants Haehnel and Jane Wohlers (\"Wohlers\") also filed motions to dismiss claims against them in their individual capacities. The trial court granted motions to dismiss the punitive damages claims against the School Board and any defendant sued in his or her official capacity. As to all other claims, the trial court denied defendants' motions to dismiss. From the denial of these motions, defendants appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs have filed a motion to dismiss, as interlocutory, the entire appeal of the joint defendants and the appeal of Haehnel except for the issues of public official and qualified immunity. Generally, \"a denial of a motion pursuant to N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(6)[], is an interlocutory order from which no appeal may be taken immediately.\"\n   <em>\n    Bardolph v.

We now consider the issue of first impression, whether a school official serving in a supervisory role, other than a superintendent or school principal, qualifies as a public official.

The complaint in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   acknowledges that Haehnel is the Director of Federal Programs for Transylvania County schools and has the responsibilities of \"ensuring that students with disabilities in the School System are treated in compliance with the requirements of state law and the North Carolina Constitution\" and \"supervising all special education teachers, aides in special education classrooms, and related service providers in the entire special education program for Transylvania County Schools.\" Accordingly, Haehnel qualifies as a \"school administrator\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   under N.C.

The allegation stated, \"The actions of Defendants, as described above, were malicious, deliberate, intentional, and embarked upon with the knowledge of, or in conscious disregard of, the harm that would be inflicted upon Plaintiff.\" This allegation is conclusory and insufficient to overcome Haehnel's public official immunity.\n   <em>\n    See Meyer, supra.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying Haehnel's motion to dismiss the negligence claims against her in her individual capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In regard to the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claims, Haehnel argues that she is immune from suit in her individual capacity under the theory of qualified immunity. \"Qualified immunity protects public officials from personal liability for performing official, discretionary functions if the conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"\n   <em>\n    Vest v.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 1D-15(a) (2005) (\"[p]unitive damages may be awarded only if the claimant proves that the defendant is liable for compensatory damages\"). Having held that Haehnel is immune, we need not address her other argument on appeal. Moreover, since Haehnel has not argued her remaining assignments of error, we deem them abandoned pursuant to N.C. R.App. P. 28(b)(6) (2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Reversed in part; dismissed in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Judges BRYANT and SMITH concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
