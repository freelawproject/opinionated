Plaintiff argues that Defendants' telephone calls, negotiations, and document exchange of a proposed contract are sufficient to establish the required \"minimum contacts\" required by due process. As we find the quantity and quality of Defendants' contacts with North Carolina were insufficient to support the necessary due process requirements, we reverse the trial court's denial of Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Innovative Materials and Technologies, Inc. (\"IM &amp; T\"), a corporation headquartered in North Carolina, produced plastic materials for the construction of a variety of products under two operating divisions-Millennium/AR Haire located in Thomasville, North Carolina, and PEP Division located in Danbury, Connecticut. The company was forced into an involuntary bankruptcy, and an auction of its assets was scheduled to take place in July 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before the auction, A. Ralph Haire, president and chief executive officer of IM &amp; T, established A.R. Haire, Inc. in North Carolina. The officers of the new company included Haire as chief executive officer and chairman of the board of the new company, Lawrence Lansford as president and Darryl Heffline as vice president.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March 2004, the three officers of A.R. Haire, Inc. were introduced to Defendant Thomas St. Denis, a resident of Connecticut and president and secretary of Defendant Panterra Engineered Plastics, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Connecticut. The three officers also met Mark Austin who represented that he was St. Denis's business partner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   St. Denis, Haire, and Lansford communicated numerous times, primarily by telephone, from March to June 2004, regarding a joint venture or business opportunities. The primary goal of the proposed joint venture was for A.R. Haire, Inc. and St. Denis to purchase all the assets of IM &amp; T at the bankruptcy auction and split the assets. On three separate occasions, St. Denis, Haire, and Lansford met in person in Connecticut. On 30 April 2004, Haire sent St. Denis a joint venture agreement; however, the agreement was never signed and negotiations continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time of the auction on 8 July 2004, there was no joint venture agreement and no agreement to bid cooperatively. At the auction, A.R. Haire, Inc. purchased several Core formers and associated equipment, including aluminum platens that were needed to operate the Core formers. Saugatuck Land Trust Company (Defendant Panterra's predecessor-in-interest) purchased the intellectual property assets of IM &amp; T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On 12 July 2004, St. Denis informed A.R. Haire, Inc. through a conference call with its principals that its operation of the Core formers could potentially infringe Saugatuck's newly acquired patents. St. Denis suggested a license agreement between A.R. Haire, Inc. and Saugatuck. Discussions continued in another conference call between the parties on 14 July 2004. On 15 July 2004, representatives for St. Denis and A.R. Haire, Inc. began exchanging written proposals for a licensing agreement. On 20 July 2004, Saugatuck and St. Denis's attorney, Stephen Geissler, sent a letter to A.R. Haire, Inc. addressing infringement of intellectual property rights, threatened legal action, and questioned the employment by A.R. Haire, Inc. of Ralph Eighmie and Luis Soto, former employees of IM &amp; T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On 30 July 2004, A.R. Haire, Inc. brought an action in Superior Court, Guilford County seeking a declaratory judgment that it could lawfully operate the equipment purchased at the bankruptcy auction and could lawfully employ Soto and Eighmie. The action also sought damages for trespass to chattels, tortious interference with contract, and unfair or deceptive acts and practices. On 22 October 2004, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction, insufficient service of process, and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On 4 February 2005, A.R. Haire, Inc. filed a Motion for Leave to File a Second Amended Complaint to reflect A.R. Haire, Inc.'s name change to Transportation System Solutions, LLC. By order entered 15 March 2005, the trial court granted A.R. Haire, Inc.'s motion to amend the Complaint and denied Defendants' Motion\n   to Dismiss. From that order, Defendants appeal the trial court's denial of their Motion to Dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although this appeal is interlocutory, we note that it affects a substantial right which is one of the exceptions to the rule barring an immediate appeal from an interlocutory order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction affect a substantial right and are immediately appealable.

Accordingly, this appeal affects a substantial right and is immediately appealable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, Defendants argue that the trial court erred in denying their Motion to Dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction because (1) there is no statutory authority for personal jurisdiction and (2) an exercise of personal jurisdiction violates due process of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"The standard of review of an order determining personal jurisdiction is whether the findings of fact by the trial court are supported by competent evidence in the record; if so, this Court must affirm the order of the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Replacements, Ltd. v.
