In June 1989, Robert M. Stolldorf applied to appellee Crestar Bank at its Chantilly branch for a loan to purchase a used 1988 Mercedes Benz automobile owned by Chantilly Fleet Service, a sole proprietorship. On June 15, Stolldorf executed a note and security agreement for $25,649.28 in which he agreed that the loan was to be secured by the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-15\">On the same day, Crestar issued its cashier\u2019s check in the amount of $20,000 payable to the order of \u201cChantilly Fleet Service,\u201d and handed it to Stolldorf for delivery to the payee. Crestar placed the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>legend on the reverse of the check by stamp, with the italicized portions completed by hand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\">\u201cBy endorsing this check, the payee agrees to record a first lien in favor of Crestar Bank, P.O. Box 179, Alexandria, Virginia 22313</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">Security Agreement Dated <em>6-15-89</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFg\">In The Amount Of $ <em>25.649.28 </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Stolldorf handed the check to Mark R. Wines, owner of Chantilly Fleet Service. Wines also owned Atlantic Towing, Inc., which had an account with appellant Fairfax Bank &amp; Trust Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">On June 15, Wines presented the check for deposit to Fairfax Bank\u2019s Centreville branch with the following printed, stamped indorsement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">\u201cPay To The Order Of Fairfax Bank &amp; Trust Company Fairfax, Va. 22030 056004979 For Deposit Only Atlantic Towing, Inc. 05100542\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">Because of the improper indorsement, Fairfax Bank refused the deposit and returned the check to Atlantic Towing. Upon Wines\u2019s request, Fairfax Bank then opened a new account in the name of Chantilly Fleet Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">On June 15, after Wines had handwritten \u201cCFS\u201d just below Atlantic Towing\u2019s indorsement, Fairfax Bank accepted Crestar\u2019s check for deposit into the Chantilly Fleet Service account. At the same time, Wines deposited into the account another check for $100.00. Wines was allowed to draw a $20,000.00 check on that account the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-12\">Fairfax Bank placed the Crestar check into the federal reserve system. Upon presentment, Crestar paid the check and Fairfax Bank was credited with $20,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-13\">Crestar\u2019s borrower, Stolldorf, failed to make the first payment due July 30 on the loan. Crestar filed no collection action against him nor did it attempt to enforce its lien rights under the security agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>On August 14, 1989, Crestar returned its check to Fairfax Bank requesting \u201cproper\u201d indorsement of the payee \u201cor refund.\u201d Fairfax Bank then had Wines place the following handwritten indorsement on the check just below the other indorsements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">\u201cpay to the order Chantilly Fleet Service Mark R. Wines\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Fairfax Bank returned the check to Crestar.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Subsequently, Crestar returned the check to Fairfax Bank, demanding payment of $20,000.00. When this demand was refused, Crestar filed this action by motion for judgment against Fairfax Bank seeking recovery of that amount on the theories of breach of warranty, lack of consideration, and \u201cunjust enrichment.\u201d In responsive pleadings, Fairfax Bank, admitting that the legend placed by Crestar on the reverse of the cashier\u2019s check was a \u201crestrictive indorsement,\u201d denied it was indebted to Crestar.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Following a September 1991 bench trial, the court below, in a letter opinion, ruled in favor of Fairfax Bank. In the course of the opinion, the court found that Fairfax Bank \u201ceventually obtained the correct endorsement from Mark Wines, sole proprietor of Chantilly Fleet Service,\u201d and that the check\u2019s payee, Chantilly Fleet Service, \u201creceived the funds from the check.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Crestar filed a motion for reconsideration. The trial court granted the motion and, in another letter opinion, found in favor of Crestar. The court ruled that Fairfax Bank \u201cfailed to comply with the restrictive endorsement, and, thus breached its warranty of presentment.\u201d The court did not alter its previous findings on the correctness of the last indorsement or on the receipt of the funds by the payee. We awarded Fairfax Bank this appeal from the January 1993 order entering judgment in favor of Crestar for $20,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">On appeal, Fairfax Bank claims, that \u201cCrestar\u2019s loss was not occasioned by anything in the check collection process,\u201d but that \u201cCrestar simply made a bad loan, and rather than attempting to collect from its borrower,\u201d it seeks recovery from the depositary bank. Fairfax Bank argues that when the trial court ruled there had been a failure to comply with the \u201crestrictive indorsement\u201d resulting in a breach of the warranty of presentation, the court misconstrued relevant sections of the Uniform Commercial Code (U.C.C.).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">In view of the trial court\u2019s ruling that Fairfax Bank breached its warranty of title because it failed to comply with the \u201crestrictive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>indorsement,\u201d two issues arise. First, was the indorsement restrictive as to the depositary bank (Fairfax Bank) requiring the depositary bank to police a contract between the payor bank (Crestar) and the payee (Chantilly Fleet Services)? Second, did the trial court erroneously expand the warranty of title of the depositary bank beyond that contemplated by the U.C.C.?</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">On the first issue, Code \u00a7 8.3-205, dealing with restrictive indorsements, was effective at the time of this dispute. That section has been replaced by \u00a7 8.3A-206. Acts 1992, ch. 693. As pertinent, \u00a7 8.3-205 provided that an indorsement is restrictive if it is conditional, or \u201cincludes the words \u2018for collection,\u2019 \u2018for deposit,\u2019 \u2018pay any bank,\u2019 or like terms signifying a purpose of deposit or collection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Here, the indorsement stated, \u201cBy endorsing this check, the payee agrees to record a first lien in favor of Crestar Bank.\u201d This indorsement is conditional and \u201crestrictive\u201d because it imposes a limitation on the payee. The indorsement, however, is not \u201crestrictive\u201d in the context of the check collection process. Former Code \u00a7 8.3-206(1) (now \u00a7 8.3A-206) provided: \u201cNo restrictive indorsement prevents further transfer or negotiation of the instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">As related to the check collection process, the indorsement is merely a contract between Crestar and Chantilly Fleet Services, <em>see United Virginia Banker. Dick Herriman Ford, Inc., </em>215 Va. 373, 375, 210 S.E.2d 158, 160 (1974), to which Fairfax Bank was not a party. In effect, Crestar said to the payee, \u201cIf you want your money, you must record a first lien in our favor.\u201d The payee ultimately indorsed the check. There was an offer (the legend on the back of the check), acceptance of the offer (indorsement), and consideration (lien in favor of Crestar and money to the payee). <em>See Oroweat Employees Credit Union </em>v. <em>Stroupe, 269 </em>S.E.2d 211, 214-15 (N.C. Ct. App. 1980); 5 Ronald A. Anderson, <em>Uniform Commercial Code </em>\u00a7 3-205.5 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The terms of Crestar\u2019s legend, \u201cthe payee agrees to record a first lien,\u201d are not similar to the \u00a7 8.3-205 terms \u201cfor collection,\u201d \u201cfor deposit,\u201d \u201cpay any bank,\u201d or \u201clike\u201d terms relating to the function that a depositary bank performs in the check collection process. In other words, the indorsement contains no language relating to the purpose of deposit or collection so as to impose a duty on the depositary bank under the U.C.C.; the contract was wholly independent of the collection process. In essence, the trial court erroneously placed a burden on the depositary bank to assure that the payee complied with the payor bank\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">On the second issue, because of the trial court\u2019s error with regard to the first issue, it necessarily follows that the court erroneously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>expanded Fairfax Bank\u2019s warranty of title beyond that contemplated by former Code \u00a7 8.4-207. That section was repealed effective January 1, 1993; present Code \u00a7 8.4-207.1 corresponds with it. As pertinent, the former section provided that a collecting bank (Fairfax Bank) obtaining payment of an item warrants to the payor bank (Crestar), which pays in good faith, that the collecting bank \u201chas a good title to the item or is authorized to obtain payment... on behalf of one who has a good title.\u201d \u00a7 8.4-207(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">Fairfax Bank, although contending that the \u00a7 8.4-207 warranty is inapplicable because no forged or invalid indorsement is involved here, argues that even if the section applies to these facts there has been no breach of warranty. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The term \u201cgood title,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 8.4-207(l)(a), is not analogous to the concept of title in property law. Instead, the term \u201cmeans only that a collecting bank is warranting that it is presenting a check whose indorsements appear to be genuine.\u201d <em>North Carolina Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>260 S.E.2d 617, 623 (N.C. 1979). The term carries \u201ca specialized construction limiting good title to the apparent validity of the chain of indorsements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the warranty of \u201cgood title\u201d is \u201c \u2018nothing more than an assurance that no one has better title to the check than the warrantor, and therefore, that no one is in a position to claim title as against the warrantee, as the payee or other owner of a genuine check could do if his endorsement were forged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Perini Corp. </em>v. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>553 F.2d 398, 415 (5th Cir.1977) (quoting <em>Aetna Life and Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Hampton State Bank, </em>497 S.W.2d 80, 84 (Tex. Civ. App. 1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Thus, assuming the warranty of good title is applicable here, an issue we do not decide, no party in this case could claim a better title than Fairfax Bank. Chantilly Fleet Services could not; it actually received the funds, according to the trial court\u2019s finding of fact. And, there is no claim that Wines\u2019s signature as sole proprietor of Chantilly Fleet Service was forged. Accordingly, Crestar did not suffer any loss related to the indorsement of its check (even assuming, as Crestar argues, that the last indorsement was somehow defective) because Chantilly Fleet Services could not make a claim against either Crestar or Fairfax Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Consequently, the judgment in favor of Crestar will be reversed and final judgment will be entered here in favor of Fairfax Bank dismissing Crestar\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
