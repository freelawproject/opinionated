Since the court struck the employer\u2019s evidence, we will \u201cview the evidence and all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Karim v. Grover, </em>235 Va. 550, 553, 369 S.E.2d 185, 186-87 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">On September 7, 1990, Hilb, Rogal and Hamilton Company of Richmond (HRH), an insurance sales firm, bought the tangible and intangible assets of The James River Financial Group, Inc. (James River), an employee benefits business. HRH continued the operation of James River\u2019s former pension division, which administered pension plan accounts. HRH, as administrator, was compensated at a rate determined by the size of the account.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">James River had employed Timothy R. Rash as the \u201cperson in overall charge\u201d of this business, Edward Franklin DePew as the head of the pension division of the business, and Edward T. Menster as a salesman in the pension division. HRH employed Rash, DePew, and Menster in the same capacities. DePew and Menster signed employment contracts, each of which contained the following pertinent provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">5. <em>EMPLOYEE COVENANTS. </em>Employee recognizes that over a period of many years the Employer (specifically including for purposes of this paragraph 5 any predecessors of Employer or entities from which it might have acquired insurance accounts) has developed, at considerable expense, relationships with, and knowledge about, customers and prospective customers which constitute a major part of the value of the Employer. During the course of his employment by Employer, Employee will have substantial contact with these customers and prospective customers. In order to protect the value of the Employer\u2019s business, Employee covenants and agrees that, in the event of the termination of his employment,... he shall not directly or indirectly as an owner, stockholder, director, employee, partner, agent, broker, consultant or other participant, for a period of two (2) years from the date of such termination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>(a) approach, contact or solicit, or continue to allow himself to be approached or contacted by, any individual or firm, which was a Customer ... (as hereinafter defined) of the Employer ... for the purpose of offering, obtaining, selling, diverting or receiving, to or from said individual or firm, services in the field of insurance or any other business engaged in by the Employer during Employee\u2019s term of employment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-3\">As used herein, \u201cCustomers\u201d shall be limited to those for whom there is insurance coverage in force as of the date of termination of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">As the manager of HRH\u2019s pension plan division, DePew had close and almost exclusive contact with many of its customers. The customers involved in this litigation all had contracts with HRH terminable at the will of the customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">On one of their periodic visits to service an HRH pension plan customer, Womancare, P.C., DePew and Menster persuaded a principal of Womancare, Dr. Camilla M. Buchanan, to withdraw $20,000 of Womancare\u2019s pension trust and invest it in International Trading Associates (ITA), a general partnership operated by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">On March 25, 1991, DePew gave Rash the contractually required 30-day notice that he would terminate his employment in late April. Rash instructed DePew not to advise HRH\u2019s pension plan customers of his expected termination. However, during this 30-day period, DePew told one of the customers that he was leaving HRH and also told another customer that he was establishing his own pension plan business.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">DePew terminated his employment with HRH on April 24, 1991. After he left HRH, he operated his own pension trust business.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Within two years after DePew terminated his employment with HRH, he executed contracts to provide pension plan services to five companies that had been pension plan customers of HRH at the time DePew terminated his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Menster also terminated his employment with HRH at approximately the same time as DePew. Shortly thereafter, he became an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d for DePew. At the request of Technology <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Associates, Inc. (TAI), one of HRH\u2019s customers, in June 1991, Menster and DePew visited TAI in an effort \u201cto attract their business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJ1\">HRH filed a motion for judgment against DePew and Menster containing the following four counts: (I) breach of the employment contract; (II) conspiracy to interfere with HRH\u2019s contractual relations with its pension plan customers; (III) intentional interference with HRH\u2019s business relations with its pension plan customers; and (IV) breach of fiduciary duties as HRH employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\">Menster filed a petition in bankruptcy after HRH\u2019s action was filed, and the action was stayed as to him. At a bench trial, after HRH presented its case-in-chief, the court sustained DePew\u2019s motion to strike all counts but Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The court then turned its attention to Count I and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">The provisions of the contract give me some trouble.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">In paragraph (a) you say that they won\u2019t do these things and they restrict it to that which was a customer hereinafter defined. It says for obtaining, selling, diverting, receiving or from services in the field of insurance. The field of insurance is so broad that I don\u2019t have any idea what kind of insurance you\u2019re talking about, whether it\u2019s automobile insurance, homeowner\u2019s insurance, life insurance, accident insurance. In fact, I don\u2019t even know exactly what fields of insurance the plaintiff operates in or any other business engaged in by the employer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">You say the customer and you give a definition of a customer for those for whom there is insurance coverage in force at the date of termination of employment. If you read the whole contract together, what you come up with is that he could not solicit business from a customer and that is someone who has insurance coverage in force and insurance coverage in force is not defined. I don\u2019t know what kind of insurance coverage we\u2019re talking about. To say that an annuity is insurance coverage on the basis that it guarantees an interest rate, seems to me to stretch the point quite a bit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Just after the court made this statement, HRH moved to nonsuit its breach of contract claim. The court replied that it had already ruled that DePew had not violated the provisions of paragraph 5(a) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>employment contract (the noncompetition clause) because \u201che can\u2019t be guilty of soliciting the business from the plaintiff since there is no evidence that the ones who left fit the definition of a customer.\u201d Therefore, it denied the motion to nonsuit that part of Count I. However, the court granted the nonsuit as to any remaining cause of action in Count I arising from a breach of any other provision of DePew\u2019s employment contract. HRH appeals these adverse rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\">The nonsuit issue is controlled by Code \u00a7 8.01-380(A), which provides in pertinent part that a \u201cparty shall not be allowed to suffer a nonsuit as to any cause of action or claim . . . unless he does so <em>before a motion to strike the evidence has been </em>sustained.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This Court has repeatedly held that Code \u00a7 8.01-380(A) permits a plaintiff to take a nonsuit during the course of the court\u2019s explanation of its proposed ruling. <em>Homeowners Warehouse, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rawlins, </em>242 Va. xiii, xiii, 409 S.E.2d 115, 115 (1991); <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Veney, </em>220 Va. 947, 952-53, 265 S.E.2d 707, 710-11 (1980); <em>Berryman </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>205 Va. 516, 518-19, 137 S.E.2d 900, 901-902 (1964) (applying predecessor statute, Code \u00a7 8-220). In <em>Newton, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\">The construction we give the statute is necessary because of the varying practices followed by trial courts, and to avoid confusion and uncertainty. Some judges rule on a motion to strike without explanation or comment. Some rule and then explicate. And some analyze the motion, summarize and discuss the evidence, and then rule. When this last practice is followed a plaintiff is free to suffer a nonsuit at any time prior to a ruling by the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">220 Va. at 952,265 S.E.2d at 711.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In this case, as in <em>Rawlins, Newton, </em>and <em>Berryman, </em>HRH moved to nonsuit during the court\u2019s discussion of its proposed ruling, but before it had ruled. Hence, the motion was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Next, in deciding whether the court correctly struck the evidence supporting the remaining counts, we review the following general principles that affect these three causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">One principle is that a tort action exists against \u201cone who intentionally interferes with another\u2019s contractual rights.\u201d <em>Duggin v. Adams, </em>234 Va. 221, 225-26, 360 S.E.2d 832, 835 (1987). As pertinent to the at-will contracts involved here, the elements of that cause of action are (1) a valid contractual relationship, (2) the interferer\u2019s knowledge of that relationship, (3) the use of <em>\u201cimproper </em>methods\u201d in the inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>tional interference causing a termination of the contract, and (4) resultant damage to the party whose contract has been disrupted. <em>Duggin, </em>234 Va. at 226-28,360 S.E.2d at 835-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\">Also pertinent to this case is the principle that an employee\u2019s fiduciary duty to his employer prohibits the employee from acting in a manner adverse to his employer\u2019s interest. <em>Greenspan v. Osheroff, </em>232 Va. 388, 400, 351 S.E.2d 28, 37 (1986); <em>Horne </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>167 Va. 234, 241, 188 S.E. 169, 172 (1936). We applied these principles in <em>Duggin, </em>holding that the breach of a fiduciary relationship is evidence of the required improper method. <em>Duggin, </em>234 Va. at 227, 360 S.E.2d at 836. As a logical extension of <em>Duggin, </em>we hold that, under certain circumstances, an employee\u2019s breach of his/her contractual duties may constitute the \u201cimproper method\u201d necessary to sustain a cause of action for intentional interference with an employer\u2019s at-will contract and for a conspiracy to interfere with that contract. <em>See Hechler Chevrolet, Inc. v. General Motors Corp., </em>230 Va. 396, 402, 337 S.E.2d 744, 748 (1985) (defendant may be liable for conspiring to interfere with at-will contract if improper methods used in doing so).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Applying those principles to this case, we consider the sufficiency of HRH\u2019Sj evidence in support of Counts II, III, and IV.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, we consider the evidence in support of Count II, alleging DePew\u2019s conspiracy to interfere with HRH\u2019s at-will contracts with Womancare and TAI. In our opinion, the evidence is sufficient to support the inference: (1) that the contacts DePew and Menster had with Womancare and TAI indicate that DePew and Menster had planned to interfere with HRH\u2019s contracts with those parties; (2) that these contacts were in breach either of their fiduciary duties to HRH during employment or their noncompetition clause after employment terminated;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (3) that these activities constituted an \u201cimproper method.\u201d Hence, the trial court erred in striking the evidence of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">We turn next to the claims of intentional interference made in Count III. The trial court concluded that the evidence of the Womancare transaction was insufficient to support a claim under this count because Womancare could withdraw its pension funds \u201cat will.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>However, the evidence was sufficient to suggest that DePew intentionally interfered with the Womancare contract by the use of an improper method, <em>viz, </em>the breach of his fiduciary duty to HRH, thereby damaging HRH. Thus, the court erred in striking this evidence in support of Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\">This brings us to consideration of DePew\u2019s post-termination activities in alleged violation of the noncompetition clause of his employment agreement. As pertinent, the noncompetition clause provides that DePew will not</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\">approach, contact, or solicit, or continue to allow himself to be approached or contacted by, any . . . firm, which was a Customer [of HRH when DePew terminates his employment].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The term \u201cCustomer\u201d is defined and limited to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">those for whom there is insurance coverage in force as of the date of termination of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">DePew argues that the noncompetition clause is inapplicable for two reasons. First, since he did not \u201capproach, contact, or solicit\u201d those former HRH pension trust customers who contracted with him after he left HRH, DePew maintains that he did not violate the non-competition provision of paragraph 5(a) of his employment agreement. However, the remaining language in that paragraph prohibited DePew from contracting with HRH\u2019s customers during the proscribed period, even though the customers themselves solicited the new contracts. Thus, we find no merit in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Second, DePew contends that the noncompetition clause does not apply to three of the HRH customers because HRH did not have insurance coverage for them when DePew left HRH. DePew recognizes that these customers had annuity contracts with\u2019Nationwide Life Insurance Company (the insurance company) that were administered by HRH. Nevertheless, DePew contends that the annuity contracts were not \u201cinsurance coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">We must decide whether, in the context of this case, these annuity contracts provided insurance coverage. In Virginia, the General Assembly has classified annuities of this type as \u201cinsurance.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-101 provides: \u201cInsurance is classified and defined as set out in subsequent sections of this article.\u201d And, within that article, Code \u00a7 38.2-106 states: \u201c <em>\u2018Annuities\u2019\u2019 </em>means all agreements to make periodic payments in fixed dollar amounts pursuant to the terms of a contract for a stated period of time or for the life of a person or persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>specified in the contract.\u201d Code \u00a7 38.2-1800 provides: \u201c <em>iLife and health insurance </em>agent\u2019 means an agent licensed in this Commonwealth to solicit, negotiate, procure, or effect life insurance, annuity contracts, and accident and sickness insurance as defined in [the relevant code sections].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\">We note that DePew held state life and health insurance licenses. And we also note that Rash, DePew, and Menster described these annuity contracts as \u201cinsurance contracts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The annuity contracts all contained similar pertinent provisions for employer contributions through the trustee of its 401(k) pension plan to a \u201cGuaranteed Fund\u201d administered by the insurance company.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Upon the direction of the pension plan\u2019s trustee, the insurance company was required to provide annuities to the individual employees of HRH\u2019s pensiop plan customer. Generally, these annuities provided pension payments to a retired employee for the balance of his life, the amount of which would be determined by the use of a mortality table and the employee\u2019s age upon retirement. Thus, the risk of an individual employee\u2019s mortality passed to the insurance company; if the employee outlived his or her life expectancy, the insurance company was required to continue the pension payments. Such shifting of the risk is the essence of insurance. <em>Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>998 F.2d 1295, 1301 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Hence, in the context of this case, we conclude that the annuity contracts were insurance contracts which provided for coverage against the risk that a retired employee would live beyond his life expectancy. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to indicate that DePew violated the noncompetition clause in executing pension plan contracts with three of HRH\u2019s former customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">The evidence also indicated that, as a result of losing these customers, HRH was forced to close its pension plan operation as unprofitable, thereby sustaining an additional loss of income when its remaining two pension plan customers could no longer be serviced. Those customers were \u201ccustomers\u201d as defined in the noncompetition clause since they held property and casualty insurance issued through HRH.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">And, we conclude that proof of DePew\u2019s violation of the non-competition clause was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of his use of an improper method of interfering with HRH\u2019s contracts. Since DePew\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>knowledge of these contracts and the damage to HRH was also shown, the court erred in striking this evidence in support of the claim in Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\">Turning to the claim of breach of fiduciary duty in Count IV, we note that HRH cites no authority supporting its claim that DePew\u2019s post-termination conduct was in violation of his fiduciary duty, and we find none. An employee\u2019s duty to his employer not to compete arises out of his relationship to his employer. <em>Restatement (Second) of Agency </em>\u00a7 393 (1958). Thus, upon the termination of the relationship, the employee may compete with his employer. <em>Peace </em>v. <em>Conway, </em>246 Va. 278, 281-82, 435 S.E.2d 133, 135 (1993). Accordingly, although we conclude that DePew may have violated the noncompetition clause, and he also may have tortiously interfered with HRH\u2019s contracts, his post-termination activities were not a violation of a fiduciary duty to HRH. Therefore, the trial court correctly struck the evidence as to his post-termination conduct as it related to Count IV</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">For all these reasons, we will reverse the judgment of the court in refusing to grant a nonsuit as to Count I and remand that claim to the trial court with directions to grant a nonsuit. We will reverse the judgment of the court in striking the evidence as to Counts II and III and remand the case for a new trial. We will affirm the judgment of the trial court in granting the motion to strike Count IV</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">JUSTICE LACY concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b261-9\"> DePew operated his pension trust business as a corporation, MidAtlantic 401(K) Services, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b262-11\"> The claim for breach of fiduciary duty was in the last count, which was unnumbered. It was, however, the fourth count and both parties have described it as \u201cCount IV.\u201d We will also do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b264-6\"> Because of HRH\u2019s nonsuit, it cannot recover damages for breach of contract here. Nevertheless, DePew\u2019s employment contract should be considered in deciding whether HRH has introduced evidence sufficient to make a <em>prima facie </em>case with respect to the remaining counts of its motion for judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b264-7\"> Since DePew and Menster contacted TAI after their employment with HRH had terminated, a finding of DePew\u2019s use of an improper method is dependent upon evidence that DePew violated the noncompetition clause of his employment agreement. Later in this opinion, we conclude that sufficient evidence was introduced from which such a violation might be inferred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b266-8\"> In general, 401(k) pension plans benefit employees of a business and qualify for favorable tax treatment to both the employer and the employees under the provisions of Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 401 (k).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
