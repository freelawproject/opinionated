To resolve this issue, we must determine whether the plaintiff alleges an injury arising out of her employment, within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.2-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">Texanna Middlekauff filed her motion for judgment against Tony Richards and Allstate Insurance Company, alleging that Richards, who was her supervisor during a portion of her employment with Allstate, intentionally \u201cbegan singling [her] out for harassment and verbal abuse.\u201d Middlekauff states that Richards intentionally sought to humiliate her in front of other employees by making derisive comments concerning the fact that she was overweight, as well as sexist and other belittling remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">This conduct allegedly began shortly after Richards became Middlekauff\u2019s supervisor and continued for an extended period of time, culminating in Middlekauff\u2019s departure from her employment. Middlekauff alleges that \u201c[s]uch harassment and humiliation was outrageous and intentional and without justification, and for the purpose of inflicting emotional distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>After Richards refused Middlekauff\u2019s requests that he cease this conduct, she sought the assistance of Richards\u2019 supervisor. When Richards\u2019 supervisor refused to intervene, Middlekauff brought the matter to the attention of the next higher level of management, where she also was refused any assistance. Middlekauff alleges that \u201c[t]he actions by the supervisors of defendant Richards in refusing to stop the harassment and abuse after they had been apprised of it, amounted to a ratification of such behavior by defendant Allstate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Middlekauff\u2019s health allegedly deteriorated as a result of this situation, and she has required continuing medical care for the emotional problems she suffered as a result of Richards\u2019 conduct. Middlekauff states that, as a further result of Richards\u2019 actions, she \u201cwas forced for medical reasons to leave her job and has suffered and will continue to suffer enormous pain, humiliation, embarrassment, and loss of income and benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The trial court sustained the defendants\u2019 plea in bar to the motion for judgment, ruling that Middlekauff\u2019s action is barred by the Act, because it \u201calleges facts which, if true, establish that the injury complained of was an injury, by accident, arising out of and in the course of her employment with Allstate.\u201d The trial court therefore dismissed the case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Middlekauff asserts that her tort action is not barred by the exclusivity provision of the Act, because she does not allege an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d \u201carising out of\u201d her employment, as those terms in the Act are construed by this Court. Middlekauff contends that the definition of \u201cinjury by accident\u201d set forth in <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>238 Va. 578, 584, 385 S.E.2d 858, 862 (1989), places her claim outside the purview of the Act. In addition, citing <em>City of Richmond v. Braxton, </em>230 Va. 161, 164, 335 S.E.2d 259, 261-62 (1985), Middlekauff argues that, since there is no causal connection between her injury and the conditions under which her employer required her work to be performed, her injury is not one \u201carising out of\u201d her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">In response, the defendants assert that Middlekauff\u2019s action is governed by <em>Haddon v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>239 Va. 397, 389 S.E.2d 712 (1990), in which this Court held that the Act provided the exclusive remedy for a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress based on a continuing pattern of sexual harassment. The defendants-argue that their position is supported further by the order of this Court in <em>Kelly v. First Virginia Bank-Southwest, </em>241 Va. ix, 404 S.E.2d 723 (1991). <em>Kelly </em>relied exclusively on <em>Haddon </em>in affirming the trial court\u2019s ruling that the plaintiff\u2019s claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress based on cumulative acts of sexual harassment was subject to the exclusivity provision of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>In considering these arguments advanced by the litigants, we look first to the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.2-101, which provides that <em>\u201c/ijnjury </em>means only injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment or occupational disease as defined [in] this title.\u201d Since Middlekauff does not assert that she has contracted an occupational disease, and because the defendants do not dispute that the acts complained of occurred in the course of her employment, we are left to consider only whether Middlekauff alleges an injury that, under the Act, constitutes (1) an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d (2) \u201carising out of\u201d her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">As this Court stated in <em>Snead v. </em>Harbaugh, 241 Va. 524, 404 S.E.2d 53 (1991), \u201c[w]e have repeatedly held that failure to establish any one of these criteria\u2014\u2018injury,\u2019 \u2018accident,\u2019 \u2018arising out of,\u2019 \u2018in the course of,\u2019 and \u2018employment\u2019\u2014defeats coverage under the Act.\u201d Id. at 526, 404 S.E.2d at 54. The comprehensive term \u201cinjury by accident\u201d is defined in <em>Morris </em>as an <em>\u201cidentifiable incident or sudden precipitating event </em>[that results] in an <em>obvious sudden mechanical or structural change in the body.\u201d </em>238 Va. at 589, 385 S.E.2d at 865 (citation omitted). Applying the above definition, this Court held in <em>Morris </em>that injuries resulting from repetitive trauma, continuing mental or physical stress, or other cumulative events, are not \u201cinjuries by accident\u201d within the meaning of the Act. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Here, Middlekauff alleges a gradually incurred injury caused by cumulative events. Specifically, she alleges a \u201cpattern of abusive behavior,\u201d continuing over an extended period of time, and she states that this conduct caused her severe emotional distress. Further, Middlekauff\u2019s pleadings do not allege an injury that can be construed as resulting from an obvious sudden mechanical or structural change in her body. Therefore, applying the <em>Morris </em>definition of \u201cinjury by accident,\u201d we conclude that Middlekauff has not alleged such an injury within the purview of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">The defendants, however, relying on <em>Haddon, </em>contend that Middlekauff\u2019s action is barred by the Act. Initially, we note that <em>Haddon </em>does not contain any reference to <em>Morris. </em>The decision in <em>Haddon </em>focused on whether an injury caused by an intentional tort committed by a fellow employee can be an \u201caccident\u201d under the Act. This Court concluded that the willful and intentional nature of an injury does not prevent it from being \u201caccidental\u201d within the meaning of the Act. <em>Haddon, </em>239 Va. at 399, 389 S.E.2d at 713-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">In <em>Haddon, </em>the issue whether the gradually incurred nature of the injury alleged excluded it from the purview of the Act was not raised by assignment of error or directly addressed by this Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Nevertheless, since the jurisdictional requirement of \u201cinjury by accident,\u201d if lacking, places a claim outside the subject matter of the Act, we must determine whether the result reached in <em>Haddon, </em>that a pattern of sexual harassment can be an \u201cinjury by accident,\u201d can be reconciled with the clear dictate of <em>Morris </em>excluding gradually incurred injuries from that definition. We conclude that these principles are irreconcilable.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The rule excluding gradually incurred injuries from the definition of \u201cinjury by accident\u201d was first articulated by this Court in <em>Aistrop </em>v. <em>Blue Diamond Coal Co., </em>181 Va. 287, 293, 24 S.E.2d 546, 548 (1943). Until <em>Haddon, </em>our decisions uniformly followed this rule. <em>See, e.g., Kraft Dairy Group, Inc. v. Bernardini, 229 </em>Va. 253, 256, 329 S.E.2d 46, 48 (1985); <em>The Lane Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Saunders, 229 </em>Va. 196, 199, 326 S.E.2d 702, 703-04 (1985); <em>Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Cogbill, </em>223 Va. 354, 357-58, 288 S.E.2d 485, 487 (1982); <em>Badische Corp. </em>v. <em>Starks, </em>221 Va. 910, 912-13, 275 S.E.2d 605, 606-07 (1981); <em>Tomko </em>v. <em>Michael\u2019s Plastering Co., </em>210 Va. 697, 699, 173 S.E.2d 833, 835 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In the only case involving gradually incurred injury that has been decided by this Court since <em>Haddon </em>and <em>Kelly, </em>we again recognized the principle excluding injuries of this kind from coverage under the Act. In <em>Merillat Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parks, </em>246 Va. 429, 436 S.E.2d 600, 602 (1993), we quoted <em>Morris, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-7\">\u201c[The] General Assembly, despite repeated invitations to do so, has made no change in the . : ..rule with respect to injuries gradually incurred, notwithstanding the passage of 47 years [since the rule was first articulated].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 433,436 S.E.2d at 602 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Our decision today affirms this long-standing rule. A gradually incurred injury is not an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d within the meaning of the Act. <em>Morris, </em>238 Va. at 589, 385 S.E.2d at 865. This principle cannot be reconciled with <em>Haddon, </em>which placed a gradually incurred injury caused by cumulative events within the Act\u2019s purview. Therefore, we overrule <em>Haddon </em>to the extent that it placed gradually incurred injuries within the definition of \u201cinjury by accident.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>For these reasons, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-10\"> We also note that, in <em>Snead </em>v. <em>Harbaugh, supra, </em>we cited with approval the requirement under the Act that an \u201cinjury\u201d be accompanied by a \u201csudden obvious mechanical or structural change\u201d in the body. 241 Va. at 528, 404 S.E.2d at 55.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b172-11\"> Since this Court\u2019s order in <em>Kelly </em>relied solely on <em>Haddon, </em>we do not address <em>Kelly </em>separately, but state that our ruling with regard to <em>Haddon </em>applies equally to <em>Kelly.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b173-13\"> Based on our holding, we do not reach the issue whether Middlekauff has alleged injuries \u201carising out of\u2019 her employment within the meaning of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b173-6\">SENIOR JUSTICE POFF, with whom JUSTICE STEPHENSON joins,</author>\n<p id=\"ATQ\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Because the decision in this case is controlled by the rule consistently applied in <em>Aistrop </em>and its progeny, <em>viz., </em>that injuries gradually incurred as the result of repetitive trauma are not compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, I concur in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">With respect to <em>Haddon, </em>however, I would simply eschew any construction that is irreconcilable with those precedents and reaffirm the rule applied in adjudicating the only question litigated in <em>Haddon, </em>viz., whether the fact that a tort committed by a fellow employee was intentional rather than negligent prevents an injury caused thereby from being an \u201cinjury by accident\u201d within the coverage of the Act.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b173-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE CARRICO, with whom JUSTICE COMPTON joins,</author>\n<p id=\"ATJ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">In reversing the judgment of the trial court, a majority of this Court refuses to follow <em>Haddon v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., </em>239 Va. 397, 389 S.E.2d 712 (1990), and holds, instead, that the outcome of the case is controlled by <em>Aistrop v. Blue Diamond Coal Co., </em>181 Va. 287, 24 S.E.2d 546 (1943), and its progeny, including <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>238 Va. 578, 385 S.E.2d 858 (1989). Indeed, three members of the majority would go so far as to overrule <em>Haddon, </em>which was decided less than four years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">I thought the doctrine of stare decisis was \u201cmore than a mere cliche\u201d in Virginia. <em>Selected Risks Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>233 Va. 260, 265, 355 S.E.2d 579, 581 (1987). But, as a result of the majority\u2019s action today, the doctrine will not even occupy the status of a cliche in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">In <em>Morris, </em>we held that an injury is not an injury by accident within the meaning of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act if it results from \u201crepetitive trauma, continuing mental or physical stress, or other cumulative events.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 589, 385 S.E.2d at 865. Today\u2019s plurality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>opinion states that, in <em>Haddon, </em>\u201cthe issue whether the gradually incurred nature of the injury . . . excluded it from the purview of the Act was not raised by assignment of error or directly addressed by this Court.\u201d The plurality opinion also states that the <em>Haddon </em>opinion did not make \u201cany reference to Morris.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">But even a casual reading of the <em>Haddon </em>opinion will reveal why the Court did not refer to <em>Morris </em>and why the issue of the \u201cgradually incurred nature of the injury\u201d was not assigned as error or addressed by the Court. <em>Haddon </em>simply was not, as the present matter is not, a case controlled by the rule applicable to gradually incurred injury. Rather, <em>Haddon </em>was, as the present matter is, a case controlled by the rule applicable to injury resulting from an <em>intentional tort </em>occurring in the workplace. And, as the doctrine of stare decisis required us to do, we gave effect to precedent, established in our earlier decisions, \u201cwhich places an injury caused by the intentional tort of an employer or fellow employee within the definition of injury by accident under the Act.\u201d <em>Haddon, </em>239 Va. at 399, 389 S.E.2d at 714. <em>See Hopson </em>v. <em>Hungerford Coal Co., Inc., </em>187 Va. 299, 46 S.E.2d 392 (1948); <em>A. N. Campbell &amp; Co. v. Messenger, </em>171 Va. 374, 199 S.E. 511 (1938); <em>Continental Life Insurance Co. v. Gough, </em>161 Va. 755, 172 S.E. 264 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In this case, I would apply the doctrine of stare decisis and give effect to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Haddon </em>as well as the earlier cases upon which it was based. As a result, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\"> It should be emphasized that, while five justices vote to reverse the judgment of the trial court, only three vote to overrule <em>Haddon. </em>Hence, <em>Haddon </em>remains intact.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
