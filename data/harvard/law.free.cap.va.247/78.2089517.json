Henley was riding in an automobile driven by Mary Ann Forsyth. Forsyth collided with a vehicle driven by Martin W. Jones. Both Forsyth and Henley died as a result of the injuries they sustained in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-17\">Richard Hill, as guardian of the estate of Rebecca Henley, an incompetent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a motion for judgment against Jones and Nicholas Themides, administrator of the estate of Mary Ann Forsyth (Them-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>ides), alleging that Henley\u2019s injuries were caused by the joint negligence of Jones and Forsyth. The jury returned a verdict against both Jones and Themides, for $12,000,000. The verdict was reduced to $1,000,000, the amount of the <em>ad damnum </em>clause, and, on October 18, 1991, the trial court entered judgment against Jones and Themides jointly and severally in that amount. That judgment is final.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">At the time of the accident, the vehicle driven by Forsyth was owned by Paul J. Stafford and was insured under an automobile liability policy issued by Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (Nationwide) to Stafford. Forsyth was driving the vehicle with Stafford\u2019s permission. Forsyth herself was an insured under an automobile liability policy issued by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm). Neither Jones nor the vehicle he was driving was insured. Both State Farm and Nationwide paid the policy limits for liability coverage, $100,000 and $50,000, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">In April 1992, Richard Hill, as administrator of the estate of Rebecca H. Henley, deceased (Hill), instituted the instant declaratory judgment action against Themides, State Farm, and Nationwide. Hill asked the court to declare that Henley was an insured under the uninsured motorist (UM) endorsements of both the State Farm and Nationwide policies and, therefore, was entitled to additional recovery under those policy provisions. The trial court granted Hill\u2019s motion for summary judgment, holding that Henley was an insured under the UM endorsement of the State Farm policy and that the set-off provisions of the Nationwide UM endorsement violated Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 and were void as against public policy. The final order, entered September 4, 1992, required State Farm and Nationwide to pay Hill $100,000 and $50,000, respectively, the policy limits for the UM coverages. We awarded both State Farm and Nationwide an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">I. State Farm</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The UM endorsement of the State Farm policy defines an insured as \u201cany other person while occupying an insured motor vehicle.\u201d An \u201cinsured motor vehicle\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">a motor vehicle registered in Virginia with respect to which the bodily injury and property damage liability coverage of the policy applies but shall not include a vehicle while being used without the permission of the owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">Hill\u2019s position at trial, and here, is that the vehicle in which Henley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>was riding qualified as an \u201cinsured motor vehicle\u201d because it was registered in Virginia, Forsyth was driving it with Stafford\u2019s permission, and the liability portion of the policy applied to it as shown by State Farm\u2019s payment of the policy limits for liability coverage. Applying the plain language of the policy, the trial court agreed with Hill and concluded that Henley was occupying an insured vehicle as defined in the policy and, therefore, qualified as an insured under the UM endorsement of the State Farm policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">State Farm asserts that the trial court erred because this Court, in <em>Bayer v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>221 Va. 5, 267 S.E.2d 91 (1980), considered a UM endorsement containing the same language and determined that UM coverage was not available. State Farm\u2019s contention that the decision in <em>Bayer </em>controls the result here is correct only if all relevant policy provisions in both cases and the factual circumstances of both cases are substantially similar. As discussed below, while there are similarities, the facts and the policies are not identical and the distinctions between them make the holding in <em>Bayer </em>inapposite to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">In <em>Bayer, </em>Whitaker was driving Bayer\u2019s vehicle as part of a road test. Bayer was a passenger in the car. An uninsured motorist collided with Bayer\u2019s vehicle, which was also uninsured, injuring Bayer. Bayer sought coverage as an insured under the UM endorsement of Whitaker\u2019s liability policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The UM endorsement definitions considered in <em>Bayer </em>are identical to the definitions contained in the State Farm policy here. <em>Id. </em>at 8, 267 S.E.2d at 92. However, to determine whether these definitions were satisfied, providing UM coverage for Bayer, the Court in <em>Bayer </em>looked to other relevant portions of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">The Court in <em>Bayer </em>held that at least two portions of the policy\u2019s provisions precluded coverage from Bayer under the UM endorsement. First, the Court concluded that only <em>owned </em>vehicles were covered by the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 8, 267 S.E.2d at 93. Although specific policy provisions were not recited in the opinion, the basis for this holding is clear from the record on file with the Court. The declarations page of Whitaker\u2019s policy contained a specific section addressing vehicles included for the purpose of the UM coverage. Only \u201cautomobiles owned by the Named Insured\u201d were designated for insurance coverage under the UM endorsement and, therefore, the policy did not cover a vehicle owned by Bayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">The Court in <em>Bayer </em>declined UM coverage for Bayer based on another portion of the policy\u2019s provisions. The UM endorsement in Whitaker\u2019s policy stated that it was subject to the insuring agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>That agreement provided liability coverage for use of a <em>non-owned </em>vehicle only when the insured, Whitaker, was legally obligated to pay damages. Whitaker was neither alleged nor found to be liable for Bayer\u2019s injuries. Therefore, the liability coverage relating to non-owned vehicles was not invoked, and Bayer\u2019s vehicle could not come within the definition of an insured vehicle. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In this case, the State Farm policy did not limit the definition of the vehicle to one owned by the named insured, as the policy did in <em>Bayer; </em>nor did it include any language which would restrict the definition of \u201cinsured vehicle\u201d to a vehicle identified or described in the policy provisions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This basis for the result in <em>Bayer, </em>therefore, cannot support a similar result in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">As for policy coverage of non-owned vehicles, the provisions of the State Farm policy, like Whitaker\u2019s policy, provide liability coverage when an insured is a permissive user of a non-owned vehicle and is legally required to pay damages resulting from the use of the non-owned vehicle. However, unlike Whitaker, Forsyth was legally obligated to pay damages resulting from her use of that vehicle. This factual difference is a significant distinction between the two cases. Again, the basis for the conclusion reached in <em>Bayer </em>is inapposite here.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">State Farm\u2019s sole basis for seeking a reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment is its theory that the result in this case is dictated by <em>Bayer. </em>As demonstrated above, not only is <em>Bayer </em>inapposite here, applying the plain language of the policy to the facts of this case requires the conclusion reached by the trial court. Indeed, to hold otherwise would require us to rewrite the policy provisions. Accordingly, we will affirm that portion of the trial court\u2019s judgment holding that Henley was an insured under the UM endorsement of the State Farm policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">II. Nationwide</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Nationwide does not dispute that Henley qualified as an insured for coverage under its UM endorsement. However, its UM endorsement includes provisions that require a set-off of payments received under liability coverage against recovery payable under UM coverage. Nationwide contends that if the set-off provisions are applied here it would have no further liability to Hill because the UM coverage limit is $50,000 and Hill has already received that amount under the liability coverage portion of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>In resolving issues of UM coverage, we apply the well-established principles that the legislation mandating UM coverage is remedial in nature, is to be liberally construed, and that, in the case of conflict between the provisions of the insurance policy and the statutory requirements, the statute controls. <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>205 Va. 897, 900, 140 S.E.2d 817, 819 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Nationwide concedes that the net effect of the set-off requirement is to limit the coverage under the policy to a total of $50,000 per person, regardless of whether the insured is recovering under the liability provision, the UM endorsement, or both. Nationwide asserts that this limitation does not violate Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 and is not void as against public policy, as the trial court held, because (1) Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 allows insurers to place limits on their liability for UM coverage, and (2) this Court has recognized the validity of contractual limitations restricting mandatory statutory insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">[N]o policy or contract of bodily injury or property damage liability insurance relating to the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be issued . . . unless it contains an endorsement or provisions undertaking to pay the insured all sums that he is legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle, <em>within limits </em>not less than the requirements of \u00a7 46.2-100. Those limits shall equal but not exceed the limits of the liability insurance provided by the policy, unless the insured rejects the additional uninsured motorist insurance coverage. . . . (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Nationwide contends that the words \u201cwithin limits,\u201d emphasized above, specifically authorize an insurer to limit the amount it must pay under UM coverage, as long as those limits do not fall below the $25,000 minimum amount required. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-100, -472. Nationwide\u2019s policy limitation of $50,000 is in excess of the minimum amount required and equals the limits of the liability insurance provided by the policy. Therefore, Nationwide concludes, the limitation is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">Nationwide is correct in its reading of the statute, but incorrect in the conclusion it reaches about the impact of the statute upon the policy provisions at issue here. The statutory language requires that limitations on the amount of the payment made under the UM endorsement fall between a floor of $25,000 and a ceiling of the amount of the liability coverage. But allowing a limitation on <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number><em>amount </em>paid, presumes that <em>some amount </em>will be paid. Nationwide\u2019s UM endorsement set-off requirement entirely eliminates payment under the UM portion of the policy. The language in Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 cannot be construed to permit elimination of UM coverage in this manner. We conclude that the reference to establishing limits on UM payments in Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 simply does not permit the imposition of the set-off provisions found in Nationwide\u2019s UM endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Nationwide next argues that the policy\u2019s set-off provisions nevertheless do not. violate Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 or public policy because they are merely contractual limitations, like others relating to mandatory statutory insurance coverage, which this Court has upheld. The cases relied on by Nationwide in support of this position are inapposite. Each involves contract provisions relating to actions required of the insured to qualify for coverage under the policy: <em>e.g., </em>cooperating with the insurer, <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Davies, </em>226 Va. 310, 314, 310 S.E.2d 167, 169 (1983); providing timely notice to the insurer, <em>Lord v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>224 Va. 283, 288, 295 S.E.2d 796, 799 (1982); and obtaining consent when settling with third parties, <em>Virginia Farm Bureau Mutual Ins. Co. v. Gibson, </em>236 Va. 433, 437, 374 S.E.2d 58, 61 (1988). Here, there were no actions or omissions by the insured which, under the terms of the policy, abrogated recovery under the UM endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Nor does the rationale allowing policy provisions to limit the stacking of UM coverage support the set-off provisions, as Nationwide asserts. <em>See, e.g., Goodville Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Borror, </em>221 Va. 967, 275 S.E.2d 625 (1981). Prohibiting stacking of UM coverage does not eliminate all payment under the UM coverage as Nationwide\u2019s set-off provisions do here.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">While we have not had the occasion to consider the precise set-off provisions at issue here, an analogous situation was presented in <em>Biyant, </em>205 Va. 897, 140 S.E.2d 817. In that case, Bryant obtained an $85,000 judgment against an uninsured motorist. Bryant received $10,059 under the UM endorsement of a policy covering the vehicle he was driving. Bryant then sought to recover under the UM endorsement of his own automobile liability insurance policy. The insurer, State Farm, denied coverage based on the policy\u2019s provisions limiting recovery under the UM endorsement to amounts exceeding those available from \u201cother insurance.\u201d Since the limit of Bryant\u2019s own UM coverage was $10,000 and Bryant had received that amount from \u201cother insurance,\u201d State Farm argued it had no further liability under the UM endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>In rejecting this argument, the Court in <em>Bryant </em>observed that the \u201cother insurance\u201d limitations in the State Farm policy obligates the insurer to pay the insured only sums that exceed other available insurance; but the UM statute requires payment of all the sums the insured is legally entitled to recover as damages. <em>Id. </em>at 901, 140 S.E.2d at 820. Accordingly, the <em>Bryant </em>Court held that the \u201cother insurance\u201d provision restricted the operation of the statute and conflicted with its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The only difference between the <em>Bryant </em>case and the instant case is that here the \u201cother insurance\u201d is not another policy, but a separate part of a single policy. We find no meaningful difference between a policy provision that eliminates the mandatory UM coverage by virtue of payments emanating from \u201cother insurance\u201d or by virtue of a separate portion of the same policy providing coverage for a different risk. Nationwide\u2019s set-off requirement in the UM endorsement, just as the \u201cother insurance\u201d in <em>Bryant, </em>\u201cplaces a limitation upon the requirement of the statute and conflicts with the plain terms of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we will affirm that portion of the judgment of the trial court which held that the set-off provisions of Nationwide\u2019s UM endorsement are void as against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Record No. 921827 <em>- Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Record No. 921836 <em>-Affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-18\"> As a result of the accident, Henley suffered permanent brain damage and was sustained by a life support system for several years. She died in November 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-10\"> The declaration sheet was not part of the record in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b104-8\">JUSTICE COMPTON, with whom JUSTICE WHITING and JUSTICE HASSELL join,</author>\n<p id=\"AIJ\">dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">In deciding the <em>State Farm </em>case, the majority has misinterpreted the applicable statute, misread the pertinent case law, and misconstrued the relevant provisions of State Farm\u2019s insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">Mary Ann Forsyth was operating a Buick automobile owned by Paul J. Stafford, in which Rebecca Henley was a passenger. Stafford\u2019s vehicle collided with a vehicle operated by Martin W. Jones, an uninsured motorist. Forsyth died as a result of the accident. Henley was seriously injured in the collision and later died from tho:&gt;e injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">The Buick was covered by an automobile liability policy issued by Nationwide to Stafford as the named insured. At the time of the accident, Forsyth was the granddaughter of Wesley M. Forsyth and living in his household. State Farm had issued an automobile liability policy to Wesley M. Forsyth as the named insured covering a Comet automobile. Henley, the passenger, was neither a relative of, nor a resident of, the same household as Wesley M. Forsyth and, of course, the Comet \u2022was in no way involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>After the judgment was obtained in behalf of Henley against both the estate of Mary Ann Forsyth and the uninsured motorist, State Farm paid its bodily injury liability limits on account of the judgment against Forsyth\u2019s estate. This payment was made because Forsyth\u2019s status at the time of the accident was that of a permissive user of a non-owned automobile (Stafford\u2019s Buick) as defined in the \u201cPart I-Liability\u201d portion of State Farm\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Henley\u2019s administrator contends that because Mary Ann Forsyth, the Buick\u2019s operator, was a State Farm insured at the time of the accident, Rebecca H. Henley, solely by reason of her occupancy of the Buick, was also a State Farm insured, and thereby entitled to an additional payment under the uninsured motorist provisions of State Farm\u2019s policy. To permit such payment involves an unwarranted leap of logic that converts State Farm\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage to accident insurance, a result never intended by the uninsured motorist statute, Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, never authorized by the case law, <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Harleysville Mut. Casualty Co., </em>203 Va. 600, 603, 125 S.E.2d 840, 843 (1962), and never contemplated by State Farm\u2019s contract with its named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The General Assembly, in enacting the uninsured motorist statute, \u201cintended to create two classes of insured persons, with different benefits accruing to each class.\u201d <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am. </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>204 Va. 833, 836, 134 S.E.2d 418, 420 (1964). \u201cThe first class includes the named insured and, while resident of the same household, the spouse of any such named insured, and relatives of either.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The second class is composed of any other person who is \u201coccupying\u201d an insured motor vehicle. <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>213 Va. 72, 77, 189 S.E.2d 832, 835 (1972). These two classes are set forth in State Farm\u2019s uninsured motorist coverage in this case under \u201cUninsured Motorists Insurance (Virginia)...II. Persons Insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Rebecca H. Henley, as I have said, was not a resident relative of Wesley M. Forsyth\u2019s household. Thus, she does not become an insured under the State Farm uninsured motorist coverage as a member of the first class; the only potential avenue for coverage for Henley would be through coverage as a member of the second class.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">The majority contends that Forsyth\u2019s operation of the Nationwide insured vehicle as a permissive user entitled her to <em>liability </em>coverage under Wesley M. Forsyth\u2019s State Farm policy, and therefore made the vehicle operated by Forsyth an insured motor vehicle under the State Farm policy, and made Henley, as an occupant of the vehicle, a person insured under State Farm\u2019s <em>uninsured motorist </em>coverage. That contention was specifically rejected in <em>Bayer </em>v. <em>Travelers Indem. Co., </em>221 Va. 5, 267 S.E.2d 91 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>In <em>Bayer, </em>we construed policy language identical to that appearing in State Farm\u2019s policy. There, a claimant was a passenger in his own uninsured automobile during a collision with another uninsured vehicle. The claimant sought to recover under the uninsured endorsement of a liability policy written on other vehicles owned by the person driving the claimant\u2019s vehicle at the time of the accident. There, as here, the claimant sought to use the basic <em>liability </em>coverage protecting his driver individually during the operation of a non-owned automobile as a means of cloaking the claimant\u2019s vehicle with <em>uninsured motorist </em>coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Affirming the trial court, we said in <em>Bayer </em>that the only coverage applying to the claimant\u2019s vehicle was that afforded the operator in the event he was legally liable for damages while driving the automobile and that the <em>liability </em>coverages did not extend to the <em>uninsured motorist </em>coverage. Consequently, we held, the claimant \u201cwas not an \u2018Insured\u2019 and his motor vehicle was not an \u2018Insured automobile\u2019 within the meaning of the uninsured motorist endorsement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8-9,267 S.E.2d at 92-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Thus, in the present case, under <em>Bayer, </em>the Buick operated by Forsyth was not an insured motor vehicle under State Farm\u2019s <em>uninsured motorist </em>endorsement. Henley, as neither a resident relative of Wesley M. Forsyth\u2019s household nor an occupant of an insured motor vehicle as intended in the State Farm uninsured motorist endorsement, was not a person insured under State Farm\u2019s policy. Hence, her administrator is not entitled to recover under State Farm\u2019s uninsured motorist endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Consequently, I would reverse the judgment of the trial court in the <em>State Farm </em>case and enter final judgment in favor of that insurer.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
