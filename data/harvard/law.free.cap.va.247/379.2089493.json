In so ruling, the trial court concluded, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe Virginia Constitution does not now mandate equality of funding for school districts in Virginia, except for meeting minimum educational standards.\u201d The trial court gave the Students the option of filing an amended bill of complaint. The Students, however, elected to stand on their original bill, and the trial court entered a final judgment of dismissal. We awarded the Students an appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The facts we consider are those alleged in the bill of complaint. The two major components of the funding system for the Commonwealth\u2019s public elementary and secondary schools are (1) state and local funds mandated by the state aid system, and (2) local funds that are not mandated by the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state and local funds mandated by the state aid system consist primarily of the instructional and support costs required by the standards of quality, which are the minimum state-wide educational standards every local school division must meet. Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.1-253.13:1 to -253.13:8. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>Board of Education determines and prescribes the standards of quality, subject to revision by the General Assembly. Va. Const, art. VIII, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">For the latest school year that data is available,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> total per pupil funding for general education in the Commonwealth\u2019s school divisions ranged from $2,895 to $7,268. Thus, the Commonwealth and its subdivisions spent 2.5 times more money per child on some of its school children than on other school children.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">School divisions with low fiscal capacities paid teachers, on average, much lower salaries than divisions with high fiscal capacities. The average salaries for classroom teachers were 39% higher in certain localities than in others and ranged from $27,471 in the ten poorest school divisions to $38,095 in the ten wealthiest school divisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">There was also a great disparity in instructional personnel/pupil ratio between the ten wealthiest and the ten poorest school divisions. The ten wealthiest divisions had an average instructional personnel/pupil ratio of 81.8/1,000, and the ten poorest divisions had an average instructional personnel/pupil ratio of 66.2/1,000. Thus, the wealthiest divisions had an average ratio 24% higher than that in the poorest divisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Spending for instructional materials was nearly 12 times greater in certain school divisions than in others and ranged from $17.52 per pupil to almost $208 per pupil. Spending for library books and supplies was more than 22 times greater in certain divisions than in others and ranged from $2.22 per pupil to almost $50 per pupil.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">The disparity in State and local funding between the highest-funded and the lowest-funded school divisions continues to increase. Indeed, the disparity has increased from $3,844 per pupil to $4,372 per pupil between the 1987-88 and the 1989-90 school years, an increase of approximately 14%.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Furthermore, school divisions with high fiscal capacities have instructional programs with greater breadth and depth in, among other areas, mathematics, science, social studies, languages, art, and music. Public high schools in divisions with low fiscal capacities have fewer course electives, fewer advanced placement courses, fewer foreign language courses, and a more narrow range of science and mathematics offerings.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">In the prayer of their bill of complaint, the Students requested, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court enter a judgment declaring:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>(i) that the current system of funding public elementary and secondary schools within the Commonwealth of Virginia violates Article VIII, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution of Virginia; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">(ii) that the current system of funding public elementary and secondary schools within the Commonwealth of Virginia violates Article I, \u00a7 15, paragraph 2 of the Constitution of Virginia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The trial court, in its memorandum opinion, concluded that, although public education is a \u201cfundamental right,\u201d the Constitution \u201cdoes not. . . make equalized funding [by] the Commonwealth a constitutional right.\u201d Instead, the Constitution \u201cguarantees only that the Standards of Quality be met.\u201d The trial court noted that the Students \u201cdo not allege that the present funding system has failed to reach the Standards of Quality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">The Students contend that education is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution and, therefore, that the Commonwealth\u2019s statutory funding scheme is subject to strict judicial scrutiny. They point out that Article I, \u00a7 15 of the Constitution speaks of \u201can effective system of education throughout the Commonwealth\u201d and Article VIII, \u00a7 1 prescribes \u201ca system of free public elementary and secondary schools for all children of school age throughout the Commonwealth.\u201d The term \u201csystem,\u201d they assert, means an arrangement of things so related or connected as to form a unity, and the facts, they allege, demonstrate that the schools throughout the Commonwealth do not constitute an \u201ceffective system\u201d because of the great disparity between the wealthiest and the poorest school divisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">The Students further argue that the current formula for funding the standards of quality violates their fundamental right to education. They assert that, unless the formula is changed to eliminate the substantial disparity between the school divisions, the Commonwealth \u201cwill never have an \u2018effective\u2019 system of education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">The Commonwealth contends, on the other hand, that, although the framers of the Constitution \u201crecogniz[ed] the importance of education by devoting an entire article to it,\u201d nowhere in Article VIII \u201cis there <em>any </em>expressed mandate for \u2018substantial equality\u2019 in spending or pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>grams among or within school divisions.\u201d According to the Commonwealth, Article VIII, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution only requires that \u201c[standards of quality for the several school divisions shall be determined and prescribed from time to time by the Board of Education, subject to revision only by the General Assembly.\u201d The Commonwealth notes, as did the trial court, that the Students do not claim that they are being denied an educational program that meets the prescribed standards of quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">When constitutional language is clear and unambiguous, a court must give the language its plain meaning and is not allowed to resort to legislative history or other extrinsic evidence. <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>Robb, 229 </em>Va. 233, 239, 328 S.E.2d 136, 139 (1985); <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Day, </em>200 Va. 439, 448, 106 S.E.2d 636, 644 (1959). In the present case, we think the language in the constitutional provisions under consideration is clear and unambiguous. Therefore, we will give the language its plain meaning and not resort to extrinsic evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Article VIII, the \u201cEducation Article,\u201d sets forth the constitutional framework for the Commonwealth\u2019s public school system. The article contains eleven sections, but those most pertinent in the present case are \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">\u00a7 1. Public schools of high quality to be maintained.\u2014The General Assembly shall provide for a system of free public elementary and secondary schools for all children of school age throughout the Commonwealth, and shall seek to ensure that an educational program of high quality is established and continually maintained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">\u00a7 2. Standards of quality; State and local support of public schools.\u2014Standards of quality for the several school divisions shall be determined and prescribed from time to time by the Board of Education, subject to revision only by the General Assembly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">The General Assembly shall determine the manner in which funds are to be provided for the cost of maintaining an educational program meeting the prescribed standards of quality, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>shall provide for the apportionment of the cost of such program between the Commonwealth and the local units of government comprising such school divisions. Each unit of local government shall provide its portion of such cost by local taxes or from other available funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Section 1 speaks in both mandatory and advisory language. The first clause is mandatory and imposes upon the General Assembly a constitutional duty to create and maintain a system of schools throughout the Commonwealth. The language \"in the second clause is merely aspirational, stating a goal that the General Assembly is admonished and encouraged to attain.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Section 2 addresses the two essential elements of quality education: standards and funding. By the terms of \u00a7 2, the General Assembly is empowered to make the final decision about both standards of quality and funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Clearly, nowhere in Article VIII, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 is there any requirement for \u201csubstantial equality\u201d in spending or programs among or within the school divisions in the Commonwealth. Instead, the provisions of Article VIII plainly mandate that each school division provide an educational program meeting standards of quality as determined and prescribed by the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The only other reference to education in the Constitution is found in Article I, \u00a7 15, a part of the Bill of Rights, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\">\u00a7 15. Qualities necessary to preservation of free government.\u2014That no free government, nor the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people, but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue; by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles; and by the recognition by all citizens that they have duties as well as rights, and that such rights cannot be enjoyed save in a society where law is respected and due process is observed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\">That free government rests, as does all progress, upon the broadest possible diffusion of knowledge, and that the Commonwealth should avail itself of those talents which nature has sown so liberally among its people by assuring the opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>nity for their fullest development by an effective system of education throughout the Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Section 15 of Article I also is clear and unambiguous. The second paragraph of \u00a7 15 recognizes that \u201cfree government rests . . . upon the broadest possible diffusion of knowledge.\u201d It also admonishes that the Commonwealth <em>\u201cshould </em>avail itself\u201d of its peoples\u2019 talents \u201cby assuring the opportunity for [the peoples\u2019] fullest development by an effective system of education throughout the Commonwealth.\u201d (Emphasis added.) While \u00a7 15 of Article I clearly emphasizes the importance of education generally, its language also is aspirational and not mandatory. Section 15 does not impose a mandate upon the General Assembly with respect to a system of free public schools. Unquestionably, the language in \u00a7 15 cannot be read to impose a requirement of uniformity in spending and programs among and within the Commonwealth\u2019s school divisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">In sum, we agree with the trial court that education is a fundamental right under the Constitution. Even applying a strict scrutiny test, as urged by the Students, however, we hold that nowhere does the Constitution require equal, or substantially equal, funding or programs among and within the Commonwealth\u2019s school divisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The Constitution does mandate that the General Assembly provide for a system of free public schools throughout the Commonwealth, and the General Assembly has provided for such a system. Code \u00a7 22.1-2. The Constitution also accords the General Assembly the ultimate authority for determining and prescribing the standards of quality for the school divisions, which authority the General Assembly has discharged. Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.1-253.13:1 to -253.13:8. Finally, the Constitution requires the General Assembly to determine the manner of funding to provide the cost of maintaining an educational program that meets the prescribed standards of quality and how the cost shall be apportioned between the Commonwealth and the localities. The General Assembly has enacted legislation carrying out these requirements, Code \u00a7\u00a7 22.1-88, -94, and -95, and the Students do not contend that the manner of funding prevents their schools from meeting the standards of quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">Therefore, while the elimination of substantial disparity between school divisions may be a worthy goal, it simply is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>required by the Constitution. Consequently, any relief to which the Students may be entitled must come from the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"AY9\">Accordingly, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-9\"> The students, infants who sued by their next friends, are: Reid Scott, Morgan Scott, Erin Scott, Justin Carr, Bradley Talley, Kathryn Talley, Joseph Davis, Milton Richardson, Jr., Mary Wright, Amy Wright, and Scott Raab.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b399-10\"> The local school boards are: Buchanan County School Board, Halifax County School Board, Pulaski County School Board, Russell County School Board, Petersburg City School Board, Radford City School Board, and South Boston City School Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b399-11\"> The defendants are: Commonwealth of Virginia; Board of Education of the Commonwealth of Virginia; James W.
