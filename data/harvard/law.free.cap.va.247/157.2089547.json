Doles, Jr.\u201d By order dated April 29, 1993, the Court of Appeals refused Smith\u2019s petition for appeal of the judgment entered June 30, 1992 confirming the grand larceny conviction. We awarded an appeal from that order to consider whether the courts below erred in holding that the evidence of Smith\u2019s possession of articles stolen from an unlocked truck was sufficient to support the conviction of grand larceny of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the only evidence introduced at trial, showed that Doles parked his truck at 3:15 p.m. on December 17, 1991 at a street intersection near his place of employment. The truck, an older model, could not be locked. When Doles returned from work at midnight, the truck was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">The next day, Smith attempted to cash a check at a Portsmouth bank. The check bore Doles\u2019s name as maker and the name \u201cBernard R. Johnson\u201d as payee and endorser. As identification, Smith produced a driver\u2019s license issued to \u201cBernard Raymond Johnson\u201d. Because the license appeared to the teller to be \u201cnew, only a few days old\u201d and Smith seemed to be \u201cnervous,\u201d she placed a telephone call to Doles. When Doles told her that he had not executed the check she described, she and the bank\u2019s manager called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">In a pat-down search conducted incident to Smith\u2019s arrest at the bank, police officers seized two knives, one of which was etched with Doles\u2019s name, and what proved to be Doles\u2019s checkbook. At trial, Doles testified that he had placed \u201ca brand new checkbook\u201d under the seat of the truck \u201cmaybe six or seven months ago\u201d. He said that he also kept two knives under that seat. Asked how \u201con the day in ques\u2022tion\u201d he knew that \u201cthe checkbook and the knife were under the seat\u201d, Doles replied that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t swear to it\u201d. He- added that he was \u201calways rambling through [his] truck\u201d and that \u201cevery time [he] ever looked under there, it was there.\u201d He acknowledged, however, that he \u201chadn\u2019t used any checks out of [the checkbook]\u201d and that he \u201chadn\u2019t seen the knife for ... a month prior to that\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the defendant rested, and the trial court entered judgment orders convicting Smith of the several charges against him and imposing sentences totalling seven years\u2019 confinement in the penitentiary. On appeal, Smith challenges only the grand-larceny conviction and the three-year sentence imposed upon that conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">In response to Smith\u2019s contention that the evidence was insufficient to support that conviction, the Attorney General invokes what we have called the \u201cwell-settled principle that the unexplained possession of recently stolen goods raises an inference that the possessor is the thief.\u201d <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 188, 190, 269 S.E.2d 352, 353 (1980). Reaffirming that principle in the abstract, we note that the record before us is devoid of any direct evidence that Smith ever had possession of the stolen truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Nevertheless, the Attorney General, citing <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>188 Va. 583, 597, 50 S.E.2d 407, 414 (1948), argues on brief that \u201cthe recent and exclusive possession of part of the stolen property, and the defendant\u2019s failure to make any reasonable explanation for it, warrants the inference that he stole all of the property provided all the property was stolen at the same time.\u201d We think that the proviso attached to that argument is crucial to the reasonableness of such an inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The arresting officer testified that the checks and the knives were found on Smith\u2019s person less than 24 hours after the truck was stolen. The Attorney General contends that this raises \u201can entirely reasonable inference that the checkbook and knives were still in the truck when it was stolen\u201d. The Attorney General relies upon a trio of sequential inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">\u201cIn order for inferences to amount to evidence they must be inferences based on facts that are proved, and not inferences based on other inferences.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>185 Va. 800, 819, 40 S.E.2d 273, 282 (1946). The only <em>facts </em>proved at trial relevant to the question whether the goods found on Smith\u2019s person were stolen at the same time the truck was stolen were adduced by Doles\u2019s testimony that he had never used the checkbook during the six or seven months since he placed it under the seat and that he had not seen the knife there for a month prior to the theft of the truck. Hence, the Commonwealth\u2019s own evidence raises a reasonable doubt as to when and by whom the goods found in Smith\u2019s possession were stolen from the unlocked truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>We hold that the evidence was insufficient to support the judgment convicting Smith of grand larceny of the truck. We will reverse that judgment and the order entered by the Court of Appeals and dismiss the underlying indictment. <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 1 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
