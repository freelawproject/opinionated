Kennon, Sheriff of Louisa County, was riding in a vehicle owned by Louisa County when that vehicle was involved in an acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>dent with a vehicle driven by Thomas L. Armstrong, Jr. Kennon sued Armstrong to recover damages for injuries he sustained in the accident and was awarded $250,000. State Farm Insurance Company, Armstrong\u2019s liability carrier, paid Kennon $25,000, the policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Kennon sought recovery of the unpaid balance of his damage award under the UM provisions of his own automobile liability policy and under the UM coverage applicable to the Louisa County vehicle in which he was riding. Kennon\u2019s policy, issued by Nationwide Insurance Company, had a $50,000 UM coverage limit. Louisa County insured its vehicle through VMLP and that contract of insurance set the UM coverage limit at $25,000. Kennon received $33,500 from Nationwide and $16,500 from VMLP, leaving $175,000 of the damage award still unsatisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Kennon filed a motion for judgment against VMLP seeking satisfaction of the unpaid amount of the damage award.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kennon alleged that, as a matter of law, the limit of the UM coverage provided by VMLP was $1,000,000, not $25,000 as VMLP claimed. The trial court agreed and entered a final order requiring VMLP to pay Kennon $175,000, less a credit for previously made payments. We awarded VMLP an appeal. We also awarded Kennon an appeal on his assignments of cross-error to the trial court\u2019s denial of additional interest and its holding regarding the authority of the administrator of Louisa County.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">VMLP assigned error to a number of the trial court\u2019s rulings. VMLP first contends that the trial court erred in finding that the provisions of Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 applied to the UM coverage offered by VMLP. Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 requires that automobile liability insurance policies contain UM coverage in an amount equal to the liability coverage limits unless those limits are rejected, but in no case less than a prescribed minimum level. Under the circumstances of this case, the available UM coverage would be $1,000,000, if VMLP is subject to \u00a7 38.2-2206, and if the liability limits were not effectively rejected for UM coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">VMLP is neither a commercial insurer nor a self-insurer, but a governmental self-insurance pool created pursuant to legislation enacted by the General Assembly in 1986. This legislation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>adopted because local governments were burdened by the high cost of liability coverage and the frequent inability to provide insurance through standard carriers. Such pools allow local governments to spread the risk of liability insurance. Code \u00a7 15.1-503.4:1. The General Assembly put a statutory scheme in place that prescribed the categories of insurance which the pools could offer, the authority, operation, and the regulation of the pools. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-503.4:1. through -503.4:9. The legislation specifically provided that the pools were not insurance companies or insurers, Code \u00a7 15.1-503.4:9, but \u201cdeemed\u201d the pools to be self-insurers for motor vehicle security under \u00a7 46.2-368 (formerly Code \u00a7 46.1-395). Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-503.4:9, -503.4:4. Although \u00a7 46.2-368 requires self-insurers to provide UM coverage in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 38.2-2206, the General Assembly specifically excluded the pools from that mandate. Code \u00a7 15.1-503.4:4 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-3\">Additionally, a group self-insurance pool shall not be subject to the provisions of \u00a7 38.2-2206 relating to uninsured motorist coverage unless it elects by resolution of its governing authority to provide such coverage to its pool members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Accordingly, the provisions of \u00a7 38.2-2206 are applicable to the UM coverage provided by VMLP only if VMLP has complied with the requirements of Code \u00a7 15.1-503.4:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">VMLP argues that \u00a7 15.1-503.4:4 establishes the adoption of a resolution as a prerequisite to application of the provisions of \u00a7 38.2-2206. VMLP has not adopted such a resolution and, therefore, VMLP contends that it is not subject to \u00a7 38.2-2206. The trial court rejected this contention, concluding that \u201c[hjaving decided to provide uninsured motorist coverage to its members, VMLP elected to be \u2018subject to\u2019 the provisions of \u00a7 38.2-2206 relating to uninsured motorist coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">This conclusion, however, disregards the plain language of the statute. The word \u201cresolution\u201d is a term of art and denotes a specific type of affirmative act by a governing body. In light of the reasons for authorizing the creation of these pools, it is entirely reasonable and consistent for the General Assembly to require a specific, affirmative act as a prerequisite to subjecting a pool to additional statutory responsibilities and liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In reaching its decision, the trial court relied on VMLP\u2019s admission that its governing body made the decision to provide UM coverage and on a renewal letter sent by VMLP\u2019s administrator to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>members in which the administrator stated that, by offering UM coverage, VMLP was required to comply with \u00a7 38.2-2206. Neither the admission nor the administrator\u2019s letter constitutes an admission that the governing body of VMLP passed a resolution qualifying under \u00a7 15.1-503.4:4. Neither is an adequate substitute for the existence of such a resolution. The record does not contain any resolution passed by VMLP regarding UM coverage. Furthermore, all documents issued by VMLP regarding the terms of the UM coverage in the record, primarily the contract of coverage itself and renewal correspondence, limit UM coverage to $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\">In the absence of a resolution adopted by VMLP, as required by Code \u00a7 15.1-503.4:4, the trial court erred in holding that the UM coverage offered by VMLP was subject to the provisions of \u00a7 38.2-2206. Accordingly, we will reverse that portion of the trial court order and enter judgment in favor of VMLP.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Record No. 930260 - <em>Reversed andfinal judgment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Record No. <em>930266 </em>- <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\"> Kennon also sued Nationwide.
