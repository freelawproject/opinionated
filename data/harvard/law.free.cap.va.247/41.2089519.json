Hackett, an Arlington County police officer, observed Jose E. Leonzo commit a traffic violation. Leonzo fled when Hackett attempted to stop him. After a short, high-speed pursuit, Hackett and Leonzo came upon a residential cul-de-sac. Leonzo made a U-turn in the cul-de-sac, and, while proceeding in the opposite direction, Leonzo\u2019s vehicle collided with Hackett\u2019s police vehicle. As a result of the collision, Hackett sustained injuries and incurred lost wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Arlington County, Hackett\u2019s employer, indemnified Hackett for his medical expenses and lost wages under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, former Code \u00a7 65.1-1 <em>et seq. </em>Thereafter, Hackett sued Leonzo and recovered a judgment for compensatory damages of $60,000 and punitive damages of $70,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">At the time of the collision, Leonzo\u2019s automobile liability insurance policy provided coverage of $100,000. Hackett was operating a motor vehicle owned by Arlington County and covered under a certificate of self-insurance issued under the authority of the Department of Motor Vehicles pursuant to Code \u00a7 46.2-368(B) (formerly Code \u00a7 46.1-395(b)). Hackett also was insured under a personal automobile liability policy providing $100,000 in coverage, including uninsured and underinsured indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">Hackett sought to impose liability upon Arlington County as a self-insured excess insurer for the underinsured portion of the judgment, <em>i.e., </em>$30,000. The trial court refused to impose liability upon the County for the deficiency, holding that the County was not required to provide underinsurance protection under Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-368 and 38.2-2206. Hackett appeals from the judgment entered in favor of the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">Hackett contends that a self-insured entity, such as Arlington County, is required to provide protection not only against an <em>uninsured </em>motorist but also against an <em>underinsured </em>motorist. Thus, he asserts, the trial court erred in denying his claim for the $30,000 deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Arlington County, on the other hand, contends that Code \u00a7 46.2-368(B), the self-insurance statute, only requires that the certificate of self-insurance provide protection against an uninsured motorist. We do not agree with the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Code \u00a7 46.2-368(B)(ii) provides that a certificate of self-insurance may be issued when \u201cthe certificate provides for protection against the uninsured motorist to the extent required by [Code] \u00a7 38.2-2206.\u201d While it is true that Code \u00a7 46.2-368(B)(ii) only mentions protection against an \u201cuninsured\u201d motorist, that section must be read in conjunction with Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, the statute dealing with uninsured motorist insurance coverage. Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, in subsection B, defines an \u201cunderinsured\u201d motor vehicle within the definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-6\">A motor vehicle is \u201cunderinsured\u201d when, and to the extent that, the total amount of bodily injury and property damage coverage applicable to the operation or use of the motor vehicle and available for payment for such bodily injury or property damage ... is less than the total amount of uninsured motorist coverage afforded any person injured as a result of the operation or use of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">We think that, in requiring a self-insurer to provide uninsured motorist insurance coverage, Code \u00a7 46.2-368(B), when read with Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, also requires a self-insurer to provide underinsurance coverage. Coverage against underinsured motorists is included in uninsured motorist coverage. Indeed, in a commercial setting, neither coverage can be purchased independently of the other; rather, when an insured purchases uninsured motorist insurance coverage, he also obtains coverage against underinsured motorists. Therefore, the County is liable for the underinsured portion of the judgment, <em>i.e., </em>$30,000.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s judgment will be reversed, and the case will be remanded with direction that the trial court enter a judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b61-10\"> Prior to its amendment in 1991, Code \u00a7 46.2-368(B) provided for unlimited protection against uninsured motorists. <em>Dale </em>v. <em>City of Newport News, </em>243 Va. 48, 50, 412 S.E.2d 701, 702 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>JUSTICE COMPTON,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqm\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">This is another episode of judicial legislation, but it carries on the tradition in this area of insurance law established by <em>William </em>v. <em>City of Newport News, </em>240 Va. 425, 397 S.E.2d 813 (1990), in which I dissented, and compounded by <em>Dale </em>v. <em>City of Newport News, </em>243 Va. 48, 412 S.E.2d 701 (1992), in which I concurred because I felt bound by the precedent of <em>William.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Code \u00a7 46.2-368(B) speaks of \u201cprotection against the uninsured motorist to the extent required\u201d by the uninsured motorist statute, Code \u00a7 38.2-2206. Today, the majority legislates a change in the foregoing statutory language so that it now reads \u201cprotection against the uninsured motorist, including underinsurance coverage, to the extent required by\u201d the uninsured motorist statute. I think that if language is to be added to \u00a7 46.2-368(B), it should be added by the General Assembly, not this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">I must concede, however, that this further legislative step is consistent with the steps taken in <em>William </em>and <em>Dale. </em>Therefore, although-1 continue to object, I am bound by the former cases and must concur in the present decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
