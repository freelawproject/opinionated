The truck came with an express \u201cbumper to bumper\u201d warranty that, in pertinent part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">Authorized Ford Motor Company dealers will repair, replace or adjust all parts on your vehicle (except tires) that are defective in factory-supplied materials on workmanship for 3 years or 36,000 miles (whichever occurs first).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">This express warranty, however, was limited by its terms: It stated that Ford would not be responsible for damage caused by \u201calteration, misuse, or damage caused by accident,\u201d or for any consequential damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">On May 16, 1995, Elzenheimer Chevrolet, located in New York, purchased the truck from Homer Skelton Ford and converted it into a tow truck. To do so, Elzenheimer added many parts including a towing apparatus and strobe lights. On August 4,1995, International Motors t/a Montrose Towing (\u201cMontrose\u201d) purchased the truck from Elzenheimer, and insured it with General. On August 19,1997, the truck caught fire while its operator was preparing to tow another vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After determining that the truck was a total loss and paying Montrose for its value, General sued Ford for 1) breach of express warranty, 2) breach of implied warranties of fitness and merchantability, 3) negligence and 4) \u201cdesign defect\u201d strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">At the close of General\u2019s case, the circuit court granted Ford\u2019s motion for judgment with respect to the express warranty and strict liability claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the close of all of the evidence, the circuit court found in favor of Ford on the remaining claims, stating that (1) it was persuaded that the fire originated under the hood of the truck, but (2) it was not persuaded by a preponderance of the evidence that the fire was caused by a defect in the truck. General\u2019s post-trial motions were denied and this appeal followed, in which General presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">I. Was the trial court clearly erroneous when it granted judgment in favor of Ford on the grounds that the express warranty did not apply as a matter of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">II. Was the trial court clearly erroneous when it found in favor of General on the implied warranty claims?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">III. Whether the trial court abused its discretion in granting defendant\u2019s motion for protective order where plaintiff had voluntarily made its vehicle available for inspection and where Ford\u2019s expert admitted at trial that he used undisclosed photographs?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">For the reasons that follow, we shall vacate the judgments entered on appellant\u2019s implied warranty claims, and remand for reconsideration of those claims in proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">Express Warranty Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">As to the express warranty claim, in which General sought the stipulated value of $23,880.21 (the value of the truck as modified), the circuit court concluded that (1) General\u2019s request for money damages was outside the scope of relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>permitted by the express warranty,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which did not provide for payment of cash; and (2) General failed to prove that the fire was caused by a design defect in the truck. We agree with the circuit court\u2019s resolution of the express warranty claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">The express \u201cbumper to bumper\u201d warranty was a valid agreement entered into by sophisticated parties who knew and understood its contents. Both the buyer and the seller of the truck were \u201cmerchants\u201d under the Commercial Code. Thus, both parties are charged with knowledge of the provisions of the contract, and equal bargaining power to arrive at mutually agreeable terms.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An express warranty is breached when \u201ca product fails to exhibit the properties, characteristics, or qualities specifically attributed to it by its warrantor, and therefore fails to conform to the warrantor\u2019s representations.\u201d <em>McCarty v. E.J. Korvette, Inc., </em>28 Md.App. 421, 437, 347 A.2d 253 (1975) (internal citations omitted). The test of defectiveness in a breach of express warranty action is \u201cwhether the product performs in accordance with the express warranty given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The terms of the express warranty required that General prove a defect in the materials and/or workmanship upon leaving Ford\u2019s control. <em>See McCarty, supra </em>at 437, 347 A.2d 253 (where the court held that \u201chad the tire here involved been warranted only against defects in material and workmanship, the consumers, in order to establish a breach of warranty, would have had to show that the blowout was caused by such a defect existing at the time the tire left the warrantor\u2019s control.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The express warranty at issue in this case only protects against \u201cparts ... that are defective in factory-supplied mate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>rials and workmanship.\u201d Thus, in order for General to succeed on a breach of the express warranty claim, General had to prove that a particular part in the chassis cab was \u201cdefective.\u201d The circuit court found that General was unable to prove that the fire was caused by a defective part. Because the circuit court was not clearly erroneous in concluding that General was unable to prove a defect, we affirm the judgment entered in favor of Ford on General\u2019s negligence, strict liability, and express warranty claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Implied Warranty Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Ford presented expert testimony that \u201cthe fire which resulted in the damage to the 1995 Ford truck on or about August 19th, 1997, was the result of an electrical malfunction within the heating and air-conditioning plenum at the right rear comer of the engine compartment.\u201d The circuit court rejected that testimony, finding instead that \u201cthis fire did originate under the hood area,\u201d rather than in the \u201ccab area.\u201d On the basis of that not clearly erroneous factual finding, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>are persuaded that the circuit court should not have entered judgments in favor of Ford on the implied warranties of fitness and merchantability claims. The circuit court did so on the ground that General did not prove \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that it was either a defect or negligence by the\u2014 by the defendant.\u201d It is not necessary, however, to prove a particular (manufacturing or design) defect to prevail on an implied warranty claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">The warranty of merchantability imposes upon sellers the obligation to warrant that the goods are \u201cmerchantable,\u201d i.e., \u201cfit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Commercial Law \u00a7 2-314(2)(c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The words \u201cdefect\u201d or \u201cdefective condition\u201d do not appear anywhere in this section of the code, and Maryland case law does not require such proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">General was also provided protection under the implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose, defined as follows in Md.Code Ann., Commercial Law, \u00a7 2-315:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller\u2019s skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is unless excluded or modified.. .an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The words \u201cdefect\u201d or \u201cdefective conditions\u201d do not appear in this section of the code, and Maryland case law does not require such proof. Ford manufactures chassis cabs with knowledge that they will be modified in some form or another. Ford was aware that Elzenheimer had, in the past, purchased Ford chassis cabs for the purpose of turning them into tow trucks. Thus, Ford impliedly warranted that the truck would be fit for usage as a tow truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Here, the evidence showed that Ford breached its implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose when (1) General\u2019s insured was using the truck as a tow truck, and (2) the truck unexpectedly caught on fire. The circuit court was persuaded that the fire started in the engine compartment of the truck while the truck was idling. The truck was being used \u201cnormally\u201d at that time, and trucks do not normally catch on fire while idling.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Implied warranties exist so consumers can recover in cases like this one without having to prove the particular defect that caused the problem. The circuit court was entitled to reject Ford\u2019s explanation of how the accident occurred. It was not, however, entitled to impose upon General the burden of proving the particular manufacture or design defeet that caused the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Ford alleges that it is relieved from liability because the fire was caused by modifications made to the truck after leaving its hands. While a post-sale modification may constitute a valid defense to a warranty claim, Ford\u2014not General\u2014 has the burden of persuasion on this issue. Ford did present evidence of post-sale modifications and alterations to the truck.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The reeord, however, does not indicate that the circuit court resolved the issue of whether the fire was caused by alterations or modifications after Ford had sold the truck. It is therefore necessary for the circuit court to determine whether the fire was caused by post-sale modifications to the truck. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">On remand the circuit court must decide whether Ford has an alteration or modification defense specific to the area where the fire originated; i.e. \u201cunder the hood area.\u201d Any other modifications or alterations are not relevant. This determination must be made on the evidence already present<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>ed to the circuit court. Neither party is entitled to a second \u201cbite at the apple\u201d on this issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Unless persuaded that the fire started because of alterations to the truck after it left Ford\u2019s control, the circuit court shall enter judgment in favor of General on the implied warranty claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The Protective Order</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">After the accident, while the truck was in General\u2019s possession, Ford hired an expert to examine it. When General sought to depose the expert, Ford objected on the ground that he had been hired \u201cin anticipation of litigation,\u201d and was not going to testify as an expert witness at trial. Ford\u2019s Motion for Protective Order was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">General argues that Ford\u2019s expert was not actually hired \u201cin anticipation of litigation,\u201d and that even if he was, there is a \u201csubstantial need\u201d to discover his findings. There is no merit in these arguments. Md. Rule 2-402(e)(2) restricts discovery of \u201cthe identify, findings and opinions\u201d of experts that are not expected to. testify. This rule required that General comply with the requirements of Md.Rule 2-402(c), and prove (1) that the information sought was discoverable under Rule 2-402(a), and (2) \u201cthat the party seeking discovery has <em>substantial need for the materials in the preparation of the case and is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means\" </em>(Emphasis added). Even then, General would not be entitled to \u201cdisclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories ... concerning the litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The trial judge\u2019s decision on whether to grant a protective order is \u201cvested with a reasonable, sound discretion\u201d and will not be disturbed on appeal without a showing of an abuse of that discretion. <em>Baltimore Transit Co. v. Mezzanotti, </em>227 Md. 8, 13-14, 174 A.2d 768 (1961). We agree with the circuit court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>that General could not prove a substantial need to depose the expert who would not be called at trial. The truck was at all times in General\u2019s possession and control. The expert investigated that vehicle while in appellant\u2019s possession. Thus, General\u2019s experts are in actual possession of more than the \u201csubstantial equivalent\u201d of the materials considered by Ford\u2019s expert. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in granting the protective order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Axb\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED IN PART AND VACATED IN PART; CASE REMANDED FOR RESOLUTION OF IMPLIED WARRANTY CLAIMS IN PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION; EACH PARTY TO PAY 50% OF THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b293-13\">.

At the time of the fire, the truck had been driven approximately 27,600 miles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b295-12\">. As to the strict liability claim, the circuit court stated that General failed to produce evidence that there existed a more appropriate alternative design.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b296-6\">. The express warranty did not obligate Ford to pay the value of whatever post-sale modifications were made to the chassis cab.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\">. \"Merchant\" is defined as \"a person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practice or goods involved in the transaction or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed by his employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation holds himself out as having such knowledge or skill.\u201d Md.Code Ann., Commercial Law,-\u00a7 2-104(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\">. There is no merit in Ford\u2019s argument that the express warranty was not applicable because the fire was a result of an accident. The express warranty stated that Ford will not be liable for damages caused by \"alteration, misuse, or damage caused by accident.\u201d Ford relies on <em>Jensen </em>v. <em>American Motors Corporation, </em>50 Md.App. 226, 232, 437 A.2d 242 (1981), in arguing that \"proof of a defect must arise above surmise, conjecture and speculation, and one\u2019s right to recovery may not rest on any presumption from the happening of an accident.\" The facts of <em>Jensen, </em>however, are distinguishable from the facts of the instant case. In that case, a teenage boy flipped a jeep while driving. It was reasonable for the trial court to determine that the jeep flipped because of human error, or \"accidental\u201d driving, rather than a manufacturing or design defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">The facts of this case are quite different. There is nothing in the record to suggest that this fire was caused by an \"accident.\u201d Rather, a fire started in the engine compartment under the hood at a time when the truck was idling with the engine running. Meanwhile (l)the hood was closed, \u00a9nobody was under the truck, \u00a9nobody was sitting inside the passenger compartment, \u00a9nobody was close enough to where the fire started to have caused it \"accidentally,\u201d and \u00a9there was no evidence in the record to suggest that something on the ground under the truck could have caused the fire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">. Applied to vehicles, this warranty requires that the vehicle be reasonably safe when used in its normal manner. <em>Mercedes-Benz of N. Am., Inc. v. Garten, </em>94 Md.App. 547, 562, 618 A.2d 233 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b299-9\">. The evidence was sufficient to support a finding. The record also contains ample evidence that Elzenheimer did not modify the blower plenum assembly, and that Montrose did not make any inappropriate alterations to the truck's wiring.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b300-10\">. The circuit court may, of course, require additional written and/or oral argument of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b301-11\">. Even though neither Ford's expert nor any other witnesses will be testifying on remand, this issue is not moot because the protective order denied General\u2019s request for discovery of information that might have turned up evidence it could have presented during the trial that has resulted in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
