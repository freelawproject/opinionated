Ruth, III, and co-defendant Christopher L. Brown were tried by a jury in the Circuit Court for Washington County for crimes relating to the theft of a vehicle. Both appellant and Mr. Brown were represented by the same attorney at trial. Appellant was convicted of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>spiracy to commit theft of property valued at more than $300 and subsequently sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Brown was convicted of conspiracy to commit theft of property valued at more than $300, four counts of theft of property valued at less than $300, and malicious destruction of property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Appellant asks two questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-6\">I. Was the evidence sufficient to sustain his conviction for conspiracy to commit theft of property valued at more than $300?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">II. Did the trial court err in denying his motion for a new trial claiming 1) ineffective assistance of counsel, and 2) juror misconduct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Finding no error, we shall affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Sometime during the late evening of September 15, 1997, and the early morning of September 16, 1997, Julie and Tom Easterday\u2019s 1996 red Jeep Cherokee was stolen from their home in Hagerstown, Maryland. The couple bought the Jeep new in 1996 and paid approximately $22,000 for it. The Jeep was found the next day on cement blocks in a com field near Hagerstown, stripped of its rims, tires, and radio. Missing from inside the Jeep were, among other things, two baby strollers and a crib.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">Jeannie Stangle, who was eighteen years old at the time of trial, was the State\u2019s principal witness. She testified that on the night of September 15 and the early morning hours of September 16, she was \u201changing out\u201d with appellant, who was her friend. At some point, they drove to Christopher Brown\u2019s home and picked up Mr. Brown and Eric Seal. The four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>decided to drive around in appellant\u2019s Chevy Blazer. Because appellant was drunk, he asked Ms. Stangle to drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Ms. Stangle testified that, as she drove, the three men started talking about stealing a Jeep Cherokee. Appellant asked her to drive down a side street where they spotted a red Jeep Cherokee parked in the driveway of a house. She stopped the car and Mr. Brown and Mr. Seal exited the car with socks on their hands. About ten minutes later, Mr. Brown and Mr. Seal \u201c[c]ame screaming around the corner with the Cherokee.\u201d Appellant directed her to drive behind the Jeep.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Ms. Stangle testified that over the next several hours she followed the Jeep to various locations. At one point, the Jeep stopped in a field. Appellant exited his car and walked over to the Jeep. Appellant took a stroller from the Jeep and threw it in a creek. While appellant took another stroller and portable crib from the Jeep and put it in the trunk of his car, Mr. Brown and Mr. Seal attempted to remove the stereo from the Jeep. Appellant then returned to his Blazer and Mr. Brown and Mr. Seal to the Jeep. They then drove to a tree nursery, retrieved some cement blocks, and put the Jeep on the blocks in a field. When the Jeep was up on the blocks, appellant and Mr. Brown removed the rims and tires from the Jeep. The three men then piled into the Blazer and left the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Five weeks after the theft of the Jeep, Ms. Stangle telephoned the Washington County Sheriffs Department and told the police about the theft. On December 9, a police investigator went to Mr. Seal\u2019s house and removed a stereo from his stepmother\u2019s car. Although the stereo\u2019s serial number and manufacturer number had been destroyed, the stereo was the same model as that taken from the Easterday\u2019s Jeep. Mr. Seal\u2019s stepmother testified that Chris Brown installed the stereo and had told her that he had bought the stereo at a flea market.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">The essence of the defense was that Ms. Stangle was not a credible witness. Joseph Feizer, a friend of appellant\u2019s, testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>f\u00eded that, about eight months after the Jeep was stolen, Ms. Stangle told him that she was trying to get both appellant and Mr. Brown in trouble. She explained to Mr. Feizer that she was mad at appellant and Mr. Brown because appellant told Mr. Brown that she had a venereal disease and Mr. Brown \u201cwouldn\u2019t talk to her after that.\u201d Mr. Feizer testified that, in his opinion, Ms. Stangle was not a truthful person. Felicia Ann Sheridan testified that she and Ms. Stangle were friends. Ms. Sheridan testified that, about seven months after the Jeep was stolen, Ms. Stangle told her that she was mad at appellant for telling Mr. Brown that she had a venereal disease. Ms. Sheridan testified that Ms. Stangle told her that she was \u201cgoing to set [appellant] and his two other friends up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction for conspiracy to commit theft of property valued at $300 or more because Ms. Stangle\u2019s testimony was not credible. Appellant has failed to preserve this argument for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Maryland Rule 4-324(a) provides, \u201cA defendant may move for judgment of acquittal ... at the close of the evidence offered by the State and in a jury trial, at the close of all the evidence.\u201d A failure to move for judgment of acquittal at both the end of the State\u2019s case and, after presenting evidence, the end of the defense\u2019s case, results in a failure to preserve the issue for appellate review. <em>Ennis v. State, </em>306 Md. 579, 583-87, 510 A.2d 573 (1986) (holding that although defendant moved for judgment of acquittal at the end of the State\u2019s case, he failed to move for judgment of acquittal after presenting his defense; thus, he failed to preserve his argument for appellate review); <em>Dumornay v. State, </em>106 Md.App. 361, 375, 664 A.2d 469 (1995) (defendant failed to move for judgment of acquittal at close of all the evidence; therefore, the issue of sufficiency of the evidence was not properly before the appellate court); <em>Briggs v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 60, 66, 599 A.2d 1221 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>(1992) (failure to renew motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the defendant\u2019s case waives claim of legal insufficiency).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">Here, appellant moved for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case, but appellant did not renew his motion after he presented his defense. Accordingly, by failing to move for judgment of acquittal after presenting his defense, appellant has failed to preserve his sufficiency argument for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Even if he had preserved his argument for our review, we would find it without merit. Appellant\u2019s argument that Ms. Stangle was not a credible witness goes to the weight of the evidence, rather than its sufficiency. <em>See Binnie v. State, </em>321 Md. 572, 580, 583 A.2d 1037 (1991). The jury was free to believe her testimony, believe only parts of her testimony, or disbelieve all of her testimony. <em>See Muir v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 648, 654, 498 A.2d 666 (1985), <em>aff'd, </em>308 Md. 208, 517 A.2d 1105 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Appellant also argues that the lower court erred in denying his motion for a new trial. The basis of appellant\u2019s motion was twofold: 1) that his attorney was inadequate because his attorney represented both appellant and his co-defendant, Mr. Brown, and 2) juror misconduct. Neither claim has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Within ten days of a verdict, a defendant may file a motion for a new trial and \u201cthe court, in the interest of justice, may order a new trial.\u201d Maryland Rule 4-331(a). A trial court has wide latitude in considering a motion for a new trial and may consider many factors, including the weighing of evidence and the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Argyrou v. State, </em>349 Md. 587, 599-600, 709 A.2d 1194 (1998). As the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">[T]he breadth of the trial court\u2019s discretion to grant or deny a new trial is not fixed or immutable; it will expand and contract depending upon the nature of the factors being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>considered, and the extent to which its exercise depends upon the opportunity the trial judge had to feel the pulse of the trial, and to rely on his or her own impression in determining the questions of fairness and justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\"><em>Argyrou, </em>349 Md. at 600, 709 A.2d 1194. <em>See Wiggins v. State, </em>324 Md. 551, 570, 597 A.2d 1359 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 1007, 112 S.Ct 1765, 118 L.Ed.2d 427 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Ordinarily, a trial judge\u2019s granting or refusing to grant a new trial is not reviewable by this Court except under the most extraordinary or compelling of circumstances. <em>Marks v. State, </em>84 Md.App. 269, 290, 578 A.2d 828 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 502, 583 A.2d 275 (1991).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\">This is true even though the trial judge\u2019s decision is based on mistake or erroneous conclusions of law or fact. Our adherence to this rule is unwavering and we do not find any extraordinary or compelling circumstances in the present case which would permit a review. In fact, this Court in its long history, has never found such circumstances to exist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-8\"><em>Love v. State, </em>95 Md.App. 420, 426, 621 A.2d 910, <em>cert. denied, </em>331 Md. 480, 628 A.2d 1067 (1993). Recently, this Court has questioned whether a trial court\u2019s actual exercise of discretion in denying a motion for new trial is reviewable at all. <em>See Isley v. State, </em>129 Md.App. 611, 743 A.2d 772 (2000). Assuming for the purposes of this opinion that it is, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">Appellant argues that he was inadequately represented by Mr. Hannigan, his trial counsel, because Mr. Hannigan\u2019s \u201csimultaneous representation of both [appellant] and [his co-defendant] constituted an inherent and unavoidable conflict of interest that was prejudicial to [appellant].\u201d Appellant argues that, at his new trial hearing, the contradictory testimony of Mr. Hannigan and a possible witness \u201cindicated that Mr. Hannigan may not have competently evaluated whether [that] witness should be called as a defense witness at trial.\u201d Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>lant argues that, because of this contradiction, the court erred in rejecting his new trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Normally, appellate review of a trial attorney\u2019s conduct is best done in post-conviction proceedings, rather than on direct appeal, where a trial-like setting will \u201cprovide[ ] the opportunity to develop a full record concerning relevant factual issues, particularly the basis for the challenged conduct by counsel.\u201d <em>Walker v. State, </em>338 Md. 253, 262, 658 A.2d 239, <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 898, 116 S.Ct. 254, 133 L.Ed.2d 179 (1995). At appellant\u2019s new trial hearing, however, the court heard testimony and accepted evidence regarding appellant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Because we are presented with a full record, we shall entertain the question posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The right to assistance of an attorney in a criminal trial is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. <em>See State v. Renshaw, </em>276 Md. 259, 264, 347 A.2d 219 (1975). \u201cThe right to counsel is the right to effective assistance of counsel, the benchmark of which is whether counsel\u2019s advocacy was sufficient to maintain confidence that the adversarial process was capable of producing a just result.\u201d <em>Cirincione v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 471, 484, 705 A.2d 96, <em>cert. denied, </em>350 Md. 275, 711 A.2d 868 (1998). When reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we apply the test outlined by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>Wiggins v. State, </em>352 Md. 580, 724 A.2d 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 120 S.Ct. 90, 145 L.Ed.2d 76 (1999). That test provides that to establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim appellant must demonstrate both that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052; <em>Wiggins, </em>352 Md. at 602, 724 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">\u201cTo demonstrate deficient performance, appellant must prove \u2018that his counsel\u2019s acts or omissions were the result of unreasonable professional judgment and that counsel\u2019s performance, given all the circumstances, fell below an objective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>standard of reasonableness considering prevailing professional norms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cirincione, </em>119 Md.App. at 484, 705 A.2d 96 <em>(quoting Oken v. State, </em>343 Md. 256, 283, 681 A.2d 30 (1996), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 1079, 117 S.Ct. 742, 136 L.Ed.2d 681 (1997)). The specific burden of prejudice appellant must show is \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. We have said that \u201c[a] reasonable probability of a different outcome is, consistent with the purposes of the guarantee of counsel at trial, \u2018a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cirincione, </em>119 Md.App. at 485, 705 A.2d 96 <em>(quoting Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">An attorney\u2019s dual representation of clients is not <em>;per se </em>violative of the constitutional guarantee to effective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Holloway v. Arkansas, </em>435 U.S. 475, 482, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978); <em>Pugh v. State, </em>103 Md.App. 624, 654 A.2d 888, cert. denied, 339 Md. 355, 663 A.2d 73 (1995). Moreover, the \u201cmere possibility\u201d of conflict is insufficient to impugn a criminal conviction. <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). Rather, \u201c[i]n order to demonstrate a violation of his Sixth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Amendment rights, a defendant must establish [that] an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">At appellant\u2019s new trial hearing, Mr. Hannigan, appellant\u2019s trial attorney, testified that while representing appellant, Mr. Brown also asked him for representation. Mr. Hannigan testified that he told appellant of Mr. Brown\u2019s request and explained to appellant the advantages and disadvantages of such a representation. Appellant agreed to co-representation. Mr. Hannigan testified that he perceived no conflict because neither defendant was accusing the other of the crime and the best defense for both cases was the same, i.e., Ms. Stangle's lack of credibility. Mr. Hannigan testified that he spoke to Heather Fiorita, the mother of appellant\u2019s child, about testifying as a possible witness but decided not to call her because she would not be a helpful witness for appellant. In addition, Mr. Hannigan testified that when the defendants\u2019 case was called for trial, both appellant and Mr. Brown agreed, on the record, to joint representation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Ms. Fiorita testified at appellant\u2019s new trial hearing. She testified that Mr. Hannigan never contacted her about being a witness. There was no proffer of what she would have said, if she had been called to testify at appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Appellant argued to the court that his new trial motion should be granted on the grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel for two reasons: 1) that joint representation is inher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>entiy prejudicial and 2) the discrepancy between Ms. Fiorita\u2019s and Mr. Hannigan\u2019s testimony indicated that Mr. Hannigan had not acted in his best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">After taking evidence and hearing argument, the court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">I find, based on my recollection of the trial, the manner in which Mr. Hannigan conducted himself on cross[-]examining witnesses, the argument produced by Mr. Hannigan, the tactics utilized that indeed there was no deficiency in his actions, even if he was representing both Defendants at the same time. He also testified that he discussed the joint representation of [appellant] and Mr. Brown, discussed it in detail, went into the pros and cons of such representation, and that [appellant] agreed nevertheless. Once again, based on everything that I recall about the trial and the manner in which Mr. Hannigan tactically worked on the case, ... there is neither deficiency nor certainly prejudice to [appellant] himself as a result of the representation of Mr. Brown jointly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">We find that the trial court thoroughly considered appellant\u2019s arguments, and we find no error in the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">As stated above, joint representation is not <em>per se </em>unconstitutional. Moreover, appellant has failed to show how the inconsistent testimony of Ms. Fiorita and Mr. Hannigan rose to the level of ineffective assistance of counsel. A review of the trial strategies, the theory of the case, and Mr. Hannigan\u2019s defense of both appellant and Mr. Brown leads us to conclude that no actual conflict arose, and Mr. Hannigan\u2019s representation was adequate. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Appellant also argued at his new trial hearing that, because a juror engaged in improper conduct, he was entitled to a new trial. Because appellant created the improper conduct and apparently benefitted from the conduct, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>court denied appellant\u2019s motion. Appellant argues that the ruling was in error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">To fully appreciate the chutzpah of appellant\u2019s argument, a brief synopsis of the jury empaneling process is needed. The court asked the prospective jurors whether they were acquainted with, alnong others, appellant. Although one of the jurors, Shelley Robertson, had known appellant since childhood and was a roommate of Ms. Fiorita, the mother of appellant\u2019s child, Ms. Robertson did not inform the court of her knowledge. She was ultimately chosen as a juror and sat on appellant\u2019s jury. Other than appellant and Ms. Robertson, no one was aware of this situation at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Mr. Hannigan testified at appellant\u2019s new trial hearing that he was unaware of the situation until near the end of trial. He testified that when he was notified that the jury had reached a verdict, he told appellant, \u201cWe may have some trouble with this verdict.\u201d Appellant responded, \u201cI have nothing to worry about. I\u2019m in with one of the jurors.\u201d Both Mr. Hannigan and Mr. Brown were taken aback by appellant\u2019s response. Although appellant and Mr. Brown were each charged with conspiracy to commit theft of property valued at more than $300, four counts of theft of property valued at $300 or less, and malicious destruction of property, the jury found appellant guilty only of conspiracy to commit felony theft but found Mr. Brown guilty of each crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">Mr. Hannigan testified that, several days after the trial, Ms. Robertson approached him and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">indicated it was her intent to have [appellant] found guilty of nothing and that it was only when the Foreman told her that the worst he\u2019d get is probation, he was in court two days earlier and that\u2019s all that happened. Judge McDowell was going to keep them through the holiday weekend they\u2019d hate her if she\u2014if she didn\u2019t, and they\u2019d make her life hell if she didn\u2019t go along with something.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">Ms. Robertson told Mr. Hannigan that she sat down with appellant the night before trial and discussed his case. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>speaking with Ms. Robertson, Mr. Hannigan withdrew his representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">During his new trial hearing, appellant argued that contrary to the evidence that he benefitted from Ms. Robertson\u2019s presence on the jury he was actually prejudiced. He argued that because he and Ms. Fiorita were on the \u201couts\u201d during his trial, and because Ms. Fiorita and Ms. Robertson were roommates during this time, it was likely that Ms. Robertson had \u201cevil in her heart\u201d while deliberating on his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">After hearing argument and taking evidence, the court made the following findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">It\u2019s obvious that [appellant] sought to benefit from this Juror that he knew being on the Jury Panel. And it\u2019s obvious to the Court that the same implicit understanding was held by the Juror. It\u2019s obvious as well to this Court that to call that Juror into court at this time, with a potential of an obstruction of justice charge being lodged against her, even if we would find her to come in to testify, may be useless. But it\u2019s obvious to the Court that there was some misconduct of a Juror that was known by [appellant] to which he sought to benefit, that he assumed he was going to benefit and apparently he did benefit from the Jury verdict. And the Court believes, under the circumstances of this case, that he indeed invited this error and benefitted from the error and the State has met its burden to indicate that [appellant] benefitting from the error from the Juror misconduct and from his knowledge of the Juror misconduct throughout the trial cannot now complain that the Jury returned a verdict that it did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The court then denied appellant\u2019s new trial motion based on jury misconduct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We again find no error in the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>\u201cThe potency of the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial relies on the premise that a defendant\u2019s fate will be determined by an impartial fact finder who depends solely on the evidence and argument introduced in open court.\u201d <em>Allen v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 25, 42, 597 A.2d 489 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>325 Md. 396, 601 A.2d 129 (1992) (citations omitted). The term \u201cinvited error\u201d is a concept that a defendant who himself invites or creates error cannot obtain a benefit\u2014mistrial or reversal\u2014from that error. <em>Allen, </em>89 Md.App. at 43, 597 A.2d 489 (citations omitted). In <em>Allen, </em>we cited several cases with fact patterns similar to our case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">[In <em>State v. Bonaparte, </em>222 Neb. 469, 384 N.W.2d 304 (1986) ], the Supreme Court of Nebraska declined to grant a new trial to a defendant who approached a juror during his trial, offered her a ride home, then drove her by the scene of his arrest and discussed the case with the juror. The court held that the defendant\u2019s call for a new trial out of concern for the integrity of the judicial system represented the \u201cheight of \u2018chutzpah.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>384 N.W.2d at 305. \u201cIt would be a strange, if not ridiculous, rule of law which would hold that a criminal defendant may be entitled to a new trial based upon jury misconduct when such misconduct is initiated by the defendant himself.\u201d <em>Id., </em>384 N.W.2d at 306. Similarly, in <em>Phillips v. State, </em>443 So.2d 1328 (Ala.Crim.App. 1983) the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals refused to grant a new trial to a defendant who, prior to and during the trial, contacted a nonjuror friend and persuaded the fiiend to contact a juror. While the contents of the discussions between the defendant\u2019s friend and the juror were disputed, the court refused to grant a new trial because the defendant \u201ccertainly cannot be allowed to benefit by his own misconduct.\u201d <em>Id., </em>443 So.2d at 1331. \u201cTo allow such,\u201d it said, \u201cwould be absurd.\u201d <em>Id. </em>[Footnote omitted which cites several other cases with the same result].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The evidence in the record indicates that appellant participated or, at the very least, acquiesced in the juror misconduct. Moreover, despite appellant\u2019s protestations to the contrary, there was no evidence that appellant was harmed. Rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>appellant .apparently benefited by the misconduct, being found guilty on only one count whereas his co-defendant was found guilty on six. Appellant\u2019s plea for a fair and impartial fact finder rings hollow, as he now seeks an impartial jury as a last resort. To grant appellant a new trial under such circumstances would reward him for manipulating, albeit not to his complete satisfaction, the jury in his first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-12\">.

Rule 1.7 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">(a) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client will be directly adverse to another client, unless:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">(1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the relationship with the other client; and</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">(2) each client consents after consultation.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">(b) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to another client ..., unless:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">(1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected; and</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">(2) the client consents after consultation.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">(c) The consultation required by paragraphs (a) and (b) shall include explanation of the implications of the common representation and any limitations resulting from the lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to another, ... as well as the advantages and risks involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-14\"><em>See also </em>Rule 1.16(a) (\"a lawyer shall withdraw from the representation of a client if ... the representation will result in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct ...\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b391-8\">. A review of the record shows that when appellant\u2019s case was called for trial, the following colloquy occurred in court:</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">THE COURT: Alright. Do we now have Mr. Brown and [appellant] here? Mr. Hannigan, once again, you\u2019re representing both Defendants in this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">[MR. HANNIGAN]: Yes sir. It's my intention to represent both Mr. Brown and [appellant]. Each has indicated to me, in their belief, that that\u2019s in their joint best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">THE COURT: Is that correct, [appellant], you desire Mr. Hannigan to represent you and Mr. Brown together?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">DEFENDANT RUTH: Yes sir.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">THE COURT: And how about you, Mr. Brown?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">DEFENDANT BROWN: Yes sir.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\">. Appellant filed his motion for a new trial jointly with Mr. Brown. The court granted the motion as to Mr. Brown on the basis of juror misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
