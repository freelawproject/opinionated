Donna Gestl, appellant, argues that the Circuit Court for Baltimore City erred in dismissing her child custody dispute against Lisa Frederick, appellee. Appellant raises two issues on appeal, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">I. Whether the trial court erred in declining jurisdiction because Maryland was an inconvenient forum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">II. Whether the trial court erred in dismissing the case rather than staying the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">FACTS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Appellee is the biological mother of a child with many special needs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to appellee, the child \u201chas been evaluated, as developmentally delayed, speech and learning disabled, Attention Deficient Hyperactivity disorder and autistic like disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">While pregnant with the child in November 1992, appellee moved from the state of Tennessee to the State of Maryland. The child was born in Maryland on March 13,1993. At some point, the parties became involved in an intimate relationship and appellee and the child moved into appellant\u2019s home in July 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>The parties dispute what occurred during the course of their relationship. Appellant alleges that while she was not the child\u2019s \u201cbiological mother, [she has] been his parent since birth.\u201d She asserts that she was appellee\u2019s \u201cbirthing coach\u201d and was present at the child\u2019s birth. She claims she shared parenting responsibilities with appellee and that the two \u201cgenerally held themselves out to the world as a family unit.\u201d Moreover, she alleges that her family saw the child on a regular basis and treated him as a member of their family. She further asserts that appellee \u201cchose a name for [the child] to call [appellant]: \u2018Mim\u2019, a derivative of mom.\u201d Finally, she claims that she assumed primaiy financial responsibility for appellee and the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Appellee, on the other hand, alleges that appellant\u2019s \u201crole regarding the child was one of recreation and entertainment.\u201d She asserts that the parties never discussed a joint parenting arrangement regarding the child and that appellant never suggested that she would assume financial responsibility for the child. Additionally, appellee claims that she received governmental assistance to meet the child\u2019s needs and that appellant insisted she obtain employment, which she did in March 1997. Appellee also asserts that appellant has a violent temper and would argue with her in front of the child and that appellant threatened \u201cto take [the child] away from [appellee] by going to court and alleging she was an unfit mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Appellee moved out of appellant\u2019s residence in August 1998 and returned to Tennessee. Appellee claims that since moving to Tennessee, she has become employed as a substitute teacher, and \u201cobtained the services of a pediatrician and enrolled the child in a local elementary school which was equipped and staffed to meet [his] special educational needs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">In November 1998, the Tennessee Department of Children\u2019s Services (\u201cDepartment\u201d) filed an action against appellee in the Juvenile Court for Anderson County, Tennessee (\u201cJuvenile Court\u201d), seeking custody of the child.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>filed in the Juvenile Court a petition to establish paternity against Spam in May 1999.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">On December 3,1998, appellant filed a \u201cComplaint for Joint Legal Custody, Pendente Lite and Permanently, and Visitation and Other Relief\u2019 in the circuit court. On March 9,1999, appellee filed a motion to dismiss asserting, <em>inter alia: </em>(1) the court should decline jurisdiction because there was a pending proceeding in Tennessee involving the child and that Maryland was an inconvenient forum; and (2) that appellant lacked standing to pursue the action because appellee \u201cis neither an unfit parent nor do exceptional circumstances exist to overcome the presumption that is it [sic] in the child\u2019s best interest to remain with ... his biological parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">A hearing on appellee\u2019s motion was held on May 27, 1999. At the hearing, the court was presented with evidence of the consent judgment appellee entered with the Department and the petition filed in the Juvenile Court by appellee against Spam to establish paternity. After the hearing, the trial judge contacted a judge in the Juvenile Court, who indicated that two files existed regarding the child: the custody case filed by the Department on November 18, 1998, and the paternity action that was filed on May 19,1999. The Tennessee judge indicated that the custody case was closed and the paternity case was pending. Additionally, when asked by the trial judge about what a Tennessee court \u201cmight do with a non-blood-related person,\u201d the Tennessee judge indicated that \u201cin her view, in Tennessee a non-blood-related person is never given custody unless ... there could be proof of \u2018dependency or neglect.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">On June 21, 1999, the trial court issued a written opinion granting appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court found that Maryland did have jurisdiction pursu\u00e1nt to Md.Code (1984, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>1999 RepLVol.), \u00a7 9-204(a)(l) of the Family Law Article (\u201cFL\u201d). Nevertheless, the court held that Tennessee was the appropriate forum to hear the dispute because Tennessee was the more convenient and appropriate forum. In so doing, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">[T]he great bulk of the contacts, information and expertise concerning the best interest of the child, both presently and in the future, exist in the state of Tennessee. This [c]ourt believes, in accordance with [FL s]ection 9-207(c), that Tennessee has a closer connection with the parties and the child\u2019s family, and that virtually all of the personal and professional evidence concerning the child\u2019s present and future best interest is in Tennessee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Additional facts will be added as necessary to supplement the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in declining jurisdiction. She argues that \u201calthough [s]ection 9-207 permits a court to decline jurisdiction if it finds that it is an inconvenient forum, both Maryland case law and the plain language of the [Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act] prohibit a court from doing so where the proposed alternative forum is only theoretically available and will not actually hear the ease.\u201d She contends that Tennessee is not an available alternative forum because Tennessee only recognizes a third party\u2019s claim to custody in instances of abuse and neglect. According to her, at the very least, the trial court should have stayed the Maryland proceedings under FL section 9-206(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">All fifty states and the District of Columbia have adopted the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (\u201cUCCJA\u201d). Maryland adopted the UCCJA in 1975, and it is codified as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Maryland Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (\u201cAct\u201d). <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 9-201 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In <em>Olson v. Olson, </em>64 Md.App. 154, 494 A.2d 737 (1985), Judge Rosalyn Bell explained that the Act is in response to a</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\">\u2018growing public concern over the fact that thousands of children are shifted from state to state and from one family to another every year while their parents or other persons battle over their custody in the courts of several states ... It is well known that those who lose a court battle over custody are often unwilling to accept the judgment of the court. They will remove the child in an unguarded moment or fail to return him after a visit and will seek their luck in the court of a distant state where they hope to find\u2014and often do find\u2014a more sympathetic ear for their plea for custody. The party deprived of the child may then resort to similar tactics to recover the child and this \u2018game\u2019 may continue for years, with the child thrown back and forth from state to state, never coming to rest in one single home and in one community.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 160, 494 A2d 737 (quoting UCCJA, 9 U.L.A Commissioners\u2019 Prefatory Note at 111-12 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The UCCJA controls which state has subject-matter jurisdiction over child custody cases. <em>See Harris v. Simmons, </em>110 Md.App. 95, 102, 676 A.2d 944, <em>cert. denied, </em>343 Md. 680, 684 A.2d 454 (1996). The General Assembly has recognized that the purposes of the Act include avoiding jurisdictional competition and conflict with courts of other states in matters of child custody, promoting cooperation with the courts of other states \u201cto the end that a custody decree is rendered in that state which can best decide the case in the interest of the child,\u201d assuring that litigation concerning the custody of a child takes place ordinarily in the state with which the child and the child\u2019s family have the closest connection and where significant evidence concerning the child is available, and discouraging continuing controversies over child custody. FL \u00a7 9-202; <em>see also </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 36-6-202.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>FL section 9-204 sets forth the grounds when Maryland courts may exercise jurisdiction. It provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">(a) A court of this State which is competent to decide child custody matters has jurisdiction to make a child custody determination by initial decree or modification decree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">(1) this State (i) is the home state of the child at the time of commencement of the proceeding, or (ii) had been the child\u2019s home state within 6 months before commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from this State because of the child\u2019s removal or retention by a person claiming custody or for other reasons, and a parent or person acting as parent continues to live in this State[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANi\">FL \u00a7 9-204. Tennessee has similar jurisdictional requirements. <em>See </em>TenmCode Ann. \u00a7 36-6-216.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Home state is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">the state in which the child, immediately preceding the time involved, lived with the child\u2019s parents, a parent, or a person acting as parent, for at least 6 consecutive months, and in the case of a child less than 6 months old, the state in which the child lived from birth with any of the persons mentioned. Periods of temporary absence of any of the named persons are counted as part of the 6-month or other period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQT\">FL \u00a7 &amp;\u2014201(f). Generally, a \u201chome state\u201d should be the jurisdiction to hear and decide custody disputes. <em>See Olson, </em>64 Md.App. at 162, 494 A.2d 737. \u201cIf, however, \u2018there is no home state or the child and his family have equal or stronger ties with another state, a court in that state has jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162-63, 494 A.2d 737 (quoting 9 U.LA,. Commissioners\u2019 Note \u00a7 3 at 123).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">We agree with the trial court that Maryland was the home state of the child and that Maryland has jurisdiction. The undisputed evidence indicates that the child lived in Maryland since his birth and that appellee removed him from Maryland in August 1998. Appellant\u2019s petition was filed on December 3,1998. The child had been absent from Maryland for less than six months at the time the petition was filed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>Therefore, Maryland courts do have jurisdiction under the Act as the child\u2019s home state. Nevertheless, \u201c[o]ur inquiry does not end here ... because we must further determine whether Maryland is precluded from exercising jurisdiction\u201d under FL sections 9-206 or 9-207. <em>Id. </em>at 163, 494 A.2d 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">FL section 9-206</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">FL section 9-206(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\"><em>When other state more </em>appropriate.\u2014... a court of this State shall not exercise its jurisdiction under this subtitle if, at the time of filing the petition, a proceeding concerning the custody of the child was pending in a court of another state exercising jurisdiction substantially in conformity with this subtitle, unless the proceeding is stayed by the court of the other state because this State is a more appropriate forum or for other reasons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">FL \u00a7 9-206(a). A court in this State is required to \u201cexamine the question of the pendency of proceedings elsewhere in Maryland or in other jurisdictions and should do so of its own motion even if the issue is not raised by the parties themselves.\u201d <em>Paltrow v. Paltrow, </em>37 Md.App. 191, 197, 376 A.2d 1134 (1977), <em>aff'd, </em>283 Md. 291, 388 A.2d 547 (1978); <em>see </em>FL \u00a7 9-206(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">If a proceeding is pending in another jurisdiction, a Maryland court usually must decline to exercise its jurisdiction. <em>See Malik v. Malik, </em>99 Md.App. 521, 526, 638 A.2d 1184 (1994). \u201c \u2018Pending\u2019 means that a case has been filed and is not concluded.\u201d John F. Fader II &amp; Richard P. Gilbert, <em>Maryland Family Law, </em>\u00a7 9-4(c) at 416 (2d ed.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">Pursuant to FL section 9-206(b), the trial judge examined the information provided by the parties and contacted a judge in Tennessee to inquire about the pendency of any proceedings. In doing so, the trial judge discovered that the Department\u2019s custody case against appellee was filed on November 18, 1998. Based on this finding the court held it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>\u201cshould decline jurisdiction based on there being a prior, then open case in the state of Tennessee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The trial court, however, failed to take into account that the Tennessee custody case had been closed by the time of the hearing on appellee\u2019s motion. Because the Tennessee custody action was closed, there was no custody dispute \u201cpending\u201d in another jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">FL section 9-207</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The trial court ultimately based its decision that Tennessee was the more appropriate forum to hear this custody dispute because \u201cthe great bulk of contacts, information and expertise concerning the best interest of this child both presently and in the future, exist in the state of Tennessee.\u201d Appellant contends that the trial court erred because, as a third party, she does not have standing to seek custody in Tennessee. She argues that, at the very least, the trial court should have stayed the Maryland proceedings instead of dismissing the case outright.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">FL section 9-207(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\"><em>Action if this State is inconvenient </em>forum.\u2014A court which has jurisdiction under this subtitle to make an initial decree or modification decree may decline to exercise its jurisdiction any time before making a decree if it finds that it is an inconvenient forum to make a custody determination under the circumstances of the case and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">Factors a trial court should consider in determining whether it is an inconvenient forum include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>(1) if another state is or recently was the child\u2019s home state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">(2) if another state has a closer connection with the child and the child\u2019s family or with the child and 1 or more of the contestants;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">(3) if substantial evidence concerning the child\u2019s present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships is more readily available in another state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">(4) if the parties have agreed on another forum that is no less appropriate; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">(5) if the exercise of jurisdiction by a court of this State would contravene any of the purposes stated in [FL section 9-202].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">FL \u00a7 9-207(c). Additionally, if a trial court finds that it is an inconvenient forum, \u201cit may stay the proceedings on condition that a custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another named state or on any other conditions which may be just and proper____\u201d FL \u00a7 9-207(e). We will not disturb a trial court\u2019s decision whether or not to exercise jurisdiction unless the trial court abuses its discretion. <em>See Harris v. Melnick, </em>314 Md. 539, 557, 552 A.2d 38 (1989) (affirming the circuit court\u2019s decision to exercise jurisdiction even though Colorado was child\u2019s home state when the father continued to reside in Maryland, original custody decree was entered in Maryland, and there was no indication that Colorado would exercise its jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">This Court has addressed the application of FL section 9-207 in a number of cases. In <em>Cronin v. Camilleri, </em>101 Md.App. 699, 648 A.2d 694 (1994), the wife moved with her children to Hawaii after her daughter complained of sexual abuse by her father, the wife\u2019s husband. In a Hawaii court, she filed an \u201cEx Parte Petition for a Temporary Restraining Order for Protection and Statement\u201d against the husband. <em>Id. </em>at 701, 648 A.2d 694. The husband thereafter filed a complaint for a limited divorce and custody in a Maryland circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-13\">The circuit court declined to exercise jurisdiction on the grounds that the Hawaii proceeding was the initial proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>under FL section 9-206 and that Maryland was an inconvenient forum under FL section 9-207. In affirming the trial court\u2019s decision that Maryland was an inconvenient forum, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">The record fully supports each of the following findings of fact announced by [the trial court]: (1) the children had a substantial number of relatives in\u2014and a closer connection to\u2014Hawaii, (2) the initial custody proceeding was filed in Hawaii, (3) [the wife] had the ability to earn a living in Hawaii, but not in Maryland, and (4) significant evidence concerning the child\u2019s care, protection, training, and personal relationships is readily available in b.oth states.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 708, 648 A.2d 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">We reached a similar result in <em>Solomon v. Solomon, </em>118 Md.App. 96, 701 A.2d 1199 (1997). The parties in <em>Solomon </em>resided in Maryland during their marriage and their child was bom in Maryland. The family moved to New York so that the husband could \u201ccomplete a one-year fellowship at a hospital in Manhattan\u201d and then moved to Switzerland. <em>Id. </em>at 100, 701 A.2d 1199. While living in Switzerland, the mother and child returned to New York and the mother filed an action for divorce that was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The husband subsequently filed an action for divorce in the Maryland circuit court, which was granted. By agreement, the mother, who continued to reside in New York, maintained physical custody, while the father, who had returned to Maryland, was granted visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">After the divorce, the parties appeared in a Maryland circuit court on a number of occasions and eventually the father filed a request to modify visitation. The wife responded by filing an action in a New York court to modify the divorce judgment and to dismiss the circuit court action filed by the father, claiming that the Maryland court \u201cwas an inconvenient forum to make custody and visitation determinations and that ... New York is a more appropriate forum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102, 701 A.2d 1199. The New York court stayed its proceedings pending the result of the wife\u2019s motion in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>We held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that, although Maryland had jurisdiction,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Maryland was an inconvenient forum because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAL\">the most convenient forum is New York____ [The child\u2019s] home state is New York and ... New York has a closer connection with [the child] than Maryland---- [T]here is substantial evidence concerning [the child\u2019s] \u2018present or future care, protection, training, and personal relationships\u2019 in New York____ [The child\u2019s] rabbi, guidance counselor, doctors, teachers, dentist, and maternal relatives are located in New York. The court observed that [the child] interacts with classmates and Mends, attends camp, and sees his maternal grandmother three to four times a week.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 108, 701 A.2d 1199.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">Based on the factors outlined in the above cited cases and considering the facts developed in this case, we find that the trial court was not clearly erroneous in its determination that Tennessee was the more convenient forum. Appellee currently resides with the child in Tennessee. She has found gainful employment in Tennessee. Moreover, the trial court correctly noted \u201cit appears that the professionals who are now involved in his present care ... are physically present in the state of Tennessee, including his present doctor, teachers and pediatrician.\u201d Finally, the natural father resides in Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">Lack of an available alternative forum</p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\">Appellant claims that even if Tennessee is the more appropriate forum, the Mai court erred in dismissing the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>case because Tennessee is not available to her as an alternative forum because in a contest between a parent and non-parent, a parent cannot be deprived of custody absent a finding of substantial harm to the child. <em>See Bond v. McKenzie, </em>896 S.W.2d 546, 548 (Tenn.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The Court of Appeals has recognized that a Maryland court should not dismiss an action under the doctrine of forum non conveniens when an alternative forum is not available. In <em>Johnson v. G.D. Searle Co., </em>314 Md. 521, 552 A.2d 29 (1989), plaintiffs, who were residents of Illinois, instituted a products liability action against a corporation whose \u201cprincipal office is in Skokie, Illinois ... [and] maintain[ed] no office in Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 524, 552 A.2d 29. The trial court dismissed the action because Illinois was the more convenient forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Although the Court of Appeals held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Illinois was the more convenient forum, it found that the trial court erred in dismissing the action because \u201climitations have probably ran against the [plaintiffs\u2019] claims under Illinois law____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529, 552 A.2d 29. Quoting from the Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws (1971), the Court explained that a case should not be dismissed \u201cunless a suitable alternative forum is available to the plaintiff---- [T]he suit will be entertained, no matter how inappropriate the forum may be, if the defendant cannot be subjected to jurisdiction in other states.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 530, 552 A.2d 29 (quoting Restatement, \u00a7 84, cmt. c).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">Maryland courts have not addressed the interplay between FL section 9-207 and the requirement that an alternative forum exist. In support of her position, appellant has cited cases in which other states under the UCCJA have exercised jurisdiction based on the lack of an available alternate forum. In <em>Priscilla S. v. Albert B., </em>102 Misc.2d 650, 424 N.Y.S.2d 613 (1980), a child\u2019s second cousin filed an action in a New York court, seeking custody from the child\u2019s adoptive father. The child\u2019s home state was Vermont, but at the time, the child resided with the cousin in New York. The adoptive father subsequently sought and obtained an order from a Vermont court granting him custody. In addressing a claim that New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>York was an inconvenient forum, the New York judge contacted the Vermont court, which \u201cindicate[d] that this petitioner, as the child\u2019s second cousin, ha[d] no standing to petition any of the Vermont Courts for her custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619. \u201cThe only procedure which appeared] to be available [in Vermont was] a proceeding in the District Court based upon the abuse, neglect or delinquency of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Conversely, the cousin would have standing to pursue the claim under New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Based on this finding, the court held that an available alternative forum did not exist and refused to dismiss the case based on Vermont being a more convenient, forum. In so doing, the court reasoned that it \u201cwill not exercise its discretion to defer to the jurisdiction of the Vermont Court on the basis of forum non conveniens, as the proposed procedure does not assure \u2018that jurisdiction will be exercised by the most appropriate court and that a forum will be available to the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting New York Domestic Relations Law 75-H(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Relying on <em>Priscilla S., </em>the Court of Appeals of New Mexico held that the trial court did not err in retaining jurisdiction in a custody dispute between a biological mother and a former domestic partner. <em>See Barnae v.

In <em>Bamae, </em>a biological mother, her two children, and her former domestic partner resided together in California for a number of years. After the relationship with the partner ended, the biological mother moved with the children to New Mexico. The partner then filed an action in New Mexico seeking custody. In response, the biological mother returned to California and initiated a proceeding \u201cseeking a determination of parental relationship and child custody there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1038. At the time, California did not grant standing to domestic partners who are not biological parents to claim parental rights, <em>see id. </em>at 1038-39 (citing <em>Nancy S. v.

The Court of Appeals explained in <em>Hoffman:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-8\">[T]he best interest of the child standard is always determinative in child custody disputes. When the dispute is between a biological parent and a third party, it is presumed that the child\u2019s best interest is subserved by custody in the parent. That presumption is overcome and such custody will be denied if (a) the parent is unfit to have custody, or (b) if there are such exceptional circumstances as make such custody detrimental to the best interest of the child. Therefore, in parent-third party disputes over custody,' it is only upon a determination ... that the parent is unfit or that there are exceptional circumstances which make custody in the parent detrimental to the best interest of the child, that the court need inquire into the best interest of the child in order to make a proper custodial disposition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 178-79, 372 A2d 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The laws of Maryland and Tennessee are similar in that they give a preference to the natural parent over a third party in a custody dispute. Moreover, the laws are similar in that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>both Maryland and Tennessee, a third party may be awarded custody under the best interest of the child standard if the natural parent is \u201cunfit\u201d or upon a showing of \u201csubstantial harm.\u201d <em>Id; see Bond, </em>896 S.W.2d at 548. Both Maryland and Tennessee would be available as a forum to hear a dispute on this issue and a Maryland court would not be required to exercise jurisdiction in such an instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Unlike Tennessee courts, however, Maryland courts have awarded custody to third parties upon a showing of exceptional circumstances. <em>See, e.g., Pick, </em>199 Md. at 351-52, 86 A.2d 463 (awarding custody of child to third party over natural mother when third party had raised child for ten years after mother abandoned child); <em>Dietrich v.

During this period, the mother visited the child irregularly and made no effort to reclaim the child. Eight years later, the mother attempted to regain custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>The Court of Appeals held that exceptional circumstances existed which justified the trial court\u2019s decision to award custody to the Hoffmans. In so doing, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">The factors which emerge from our prior decisions which may be of probative value in determining the existence of exceptional circumstances include the length of time the child has been away from the biological parent, the age of the child when care was assumed by the third party, the possible emotional effect on the child of a change of custody, the period of time which elapsed before the parent sought to reclaim the child, the nature and strength of the ties between the child and the third party custodian, the intensity and genuineness of the parent\u2019s desire to have the child, the stability and certainty as to the child\u2019s future in the custody of the parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 191, 372 A2d 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">The above cited cases all dealt with situations in which the child had been in the sole physical custody of a third party and not the natural parent. Maryland courts have been far less willing to find exceptional circumstances in situations when a child has lived in the same household as a natural parent and a third party. Indeed, \u201c[wjhatever the law may be elsewhere, Maryland does not recognize a natural mother\u2019s long-time, live-in male companion as the \u2018father\u2019 of the mother\u2019s children, at least when they were not sired by the male companion.\u201d <em>In re Erica S., </em>71 Md.App. 148, 151-52, 524 A.2d 108 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">In <em>Lipiano v.

Moreover, although there was evidence that Dr. Liss knew he was the child\u2019s father, he had. no involvement with the child until 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Sharron and Dr. Liss eventually left together, taking the child, and a divorce and custody proceeding between the parties commenced. Jim contended that he was \u201cthe natural father of [the child] under the equitable parent doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 598 A.2d 854. This Court disagreed and held that the trial court was not clearly erroneous in awarding custody of the child to Sharron and Dr. Liss. In rejecting the doctrine of \u201cequitable parent\u201d as a basis for gaining custody, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">The language used by the <em>Ross [v. Hoffman </em>] Court is clear and precise. It does not envisage there being degrees of third parties\u2014\u2018natural\u2019 parents who are not biological parents, \u2018equitable\u2019 parents, and others. Certainly, the closeness of the relationship between the child and the non-biological parent is of considerable importance, but that importance relates to whether there are exceptional circumstances which would make an award of custody to the biological parent detrimental to the best interest of the child. It does not, under the <em>Ross </em>standards, elevate the third party to initial parity with the biological parent____ [A] person in [the non-biological parent\u2019s] position stands as a third party with respect to the child and thus must ... overcome the presumption created by the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 577-78, 598 A.2d 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">We reached a similar result in <em>Tedesco v.

In <em>Tedesco, </em>the child\u2019s biological father was killed while the mother was pregnant with the child. Shortly after the child was bom, the parties began dating and were eventually married. Two years later, the parties separated and the wife filed for divorce and custody. We upheld the trial court\u2019s decision to award custody to the mother because the non-biological parent was \u201cin fact, a \u2018third party\u2019 in relation to [the child\u2019s] custody, and he cannot avoid being so characterized merely by virtue of his close relationship with the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659, 683 A.2d 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>While not awarding custody to a non-biological parent, the Court of Appeals has recognized that exceptional circumstances may arise where it is appropriate to award custody to a third party who resided with the child and the natural mother. <em>See Monroe v. Monroe, </em>329 Md. 758, 772, 621 A.2d 898 (1993). In <em>Monroe, </em>the biological mother was granted a court order requiring her husband to submit to a blood test which established he was not the child\u2019s biological father. The mother made no attempt to establish paternity in another party. The Court held that the trial court erred in ordering the blood test and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">Significant to the best interest determination is the desirability, from the child\u2019s perspective, of establishing that the man that is the only father the child has ever known, the husband of the child\u2019s mother, and who has acknowledged the child, is, in fact, not the child\u2019s father. The effect of that determination is not only to establish that the person who the child regarded as her father, is, in fact, not her father, but also to establish that she has no known father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqL\"><em>Id. </em>at 772-73, 621 A.2d 898. The Court further ruled that.on remand, the trial court should inquire whether any exceptional circumstances exist that would necessitate an award of custody to the non-biological parent. While the Court explained that it did not intend to \u201csuggest that simply by living with and treating a minor child as his own, that a non-biological \u2018father\u2019\u201d automatically acquires rights equal to those of a biological parent, <em>id. </em>at 776 n. 8, 621 A.2d 898, it recognized that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 775-76, 621 A.2d 898 (footnote omitted).

That the relationship, one with a known biological parent and the other with an acknowledged, though, in fact, non-biological, parent, progress at the same time, does not render either less viable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>We do not, of course, express any opinion as to the outcome of this custody matter---- We simply wish to provide guidance for the trial court in addressing the issue of permanent custody. We want to make clear that, using its independent judgment, the court has to determine whether the circumstances of this case are sufficiently exceptional as to rebut the presumption that custody should be awarded to the [biological mother].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 777, 621 A.2d 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">The above cited cases indicate that appellant is afforded rights under Maryland law that are not guaranteed in Tennessee because under Tennessee law, a third party may only gain custody if there is a finding that parental custody would result in substantial harm to the child. The Tennessee courts will not \u201cengage in a general \u2018best interest of the child\u2019 evaluation unless there has been a finding ... of substantial harm to the child.\u201d <em>Bond, supra, </em>896 S.W.2d at 548. Maryland, however, recognizes a third party\u2019s right to custody' over a natural parent if exceptional circumstances exist which make it in the best interests of the child to award custody to the third party. The Maryland standard creates a substantial category of cases where a third party could obtain custody not permitted under Tennessee law. <em>See, e.g., Pick, </em>199 Md. at 351-52, 86 A.2d 463; <em>Newkirk, </em>73 Md.App. at 593, 535 A.2d 947. Maryland accords standing to the group of persons who can establish exceptional circumstances which relate to the child\u2019s best interests, but who could not establish injury to the child from awarding parental custody.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>WMe the present decision was pending, the Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of a non-parental visitation statute in the state of Washington, and held invalid, on substantive due process grounds, a Washington state court decision applying the statute as impermissibly interfering with the \u201cfundamental right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.\u201d <em>Troxel v. Granville, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 120 S.Ct. 2054, 2060, 147 L.Ed.2d 49 (2000). The Supreme Court\u2019s reasons for finding the Washington state court\u2019s intervention to be unconstitutional included the state court\u2019s failure to give any special weight to the parent\u2019s determination of the child\u2019s best interests; that the decision placed the burden on the parent to prove that grandparent visitation was not in the child\u2019s best interest; and that there was no requirement that the parent be shown to be unfit. The Court expressly declined, however, to reach the question of whether parental unfitness was always a prerequisite in order to justify intervention in decisions concerning custody and visitation. It also suggested that intervention in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>custody and visitation decisions might be justified, when the intervention was \u201cfounded ... on special factors,\u201d rather than merely a generalized best interest analysis. <em>Id. </em>at-, 120 S.Ct. at 2061. We do not read <em>Troxel </em>to be inconsistent with existing Maryland law allowing custody in a non-parent upon a showing of exceptional circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Under Tennessee law, appellant, as a non-biological parent claiming to be a de facto parent, would have no standing to bring her claim. We hold, therefore, that Tennessee does not provide an available alternative forum for appellant to bring her claim, and accordingly, the trial court erred in dismissing the case without considering appellant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">On remand, appellant must prove that exceptional circumstances exist that would necessitate the award of custody of the child to her. To be sure, her task is a difficult one. A natural parent has a fundamental right relating to the care and custody of his or her child. <em>See Boswell v. Boswell, </em>352 Md. 204, 217, 721 A.2d 662 (1998); <em>see also Troxel, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 120 S.Ct. at 2060. As indicated by our holdings in <em>Tedeseo </em>and <em>Lipiano, </em>a non-biological parent who resides with a child and a biological parent is at a considerable disadvantage in a custody proceeding. Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Troxel </em>requires that the court take extra care to apply the exceptional circumstances standard in a manner that protects the fundamental interests of the parent to make custody decisions. <em>See id. </em>at-, 120 S.Ct. at 2063.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Maryland\u2019s version of the UCCJA, the Act, gives a party \u201cacting as a parent\u201d the right to bring a custody suit in Maryland if the child \u201cimmediately preceding the time involved, lived ... for at least 6 consecutive months\u201d with that person. FL \u00a7 9-201(f). The Act defines a person acting as a parent as \u201ca person, other than a parent, who has physical custody of a child and who has either been awarded custody by a court or claims a right to custody.\u201d FL \u00a7 9\u2014201(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">\u201cPhysical custody\u201d means \u201cactual possession and control of a child.\u201d FL \u00a7 9-201(i). We interpret subsection (i) of section 9-201 as including a non-biological parent who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>has had joint custody of a child with the biological parent. It is necessary, however, that the non-biological parent plead and prove facts that would establish his or her status as a \u201cperson acting as a parent.\u201d In the present case, appellant filed an affidavit stating that she has had joint custody of the child, with appellee, all of his life until appellee took the child to Tennessee. She supports this assertion by detailing how: (1) she and appellee \u201cheld themselves out to friends, family and service providers\u201d as the child\u2019s parents; (2) appellee has, throughout the relationship, referred to the child as having the last names of both appellant and appellee, and as \u201cour son,\u201d and referred to appellant as \u201cMim,\u201d which appellant characterizes as a derivative of \u201cmom;\u201d (3) appellant consistently and for several years provided daily care for the child, including feeding him meals, reading to him, bathing him, and putting-him to bed, and had a loving relationship with him; (4) appellant was the \u201cbirthing coach\u201d at the child\u2019s birth; <em>(5)\u25a0\u25a0 </em>appellant would take the child to doctors\u2019 appointments; (6) appellee has referred to appellant\u2019s parents as the child\u2019s \u201cgrandmom\u201d and \u201cgrandpop;\u201d (7) appellant and appellee joined \u201cParents with Pride,\u201d a homosexual parenting group; (8) appellee assured appellant that she \u201cwould never stand in the way of [appellant\u2019s] relationship with the child,\u201d (9) appellant has provided significant monetary support for the child. These facts, if proven, are sufficient to show that appellant was a \u201cperson acting as parent\u201d within the meaning of section 9-201. Therefore, appellant should be given the opportunity to establish that exceptional circumstances exist that would make it in the child\u2019s best interest to grant her custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Visitation</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In addition, we find that the difference between Maryland and Tennessee law regarding visitation requires the trial court to exercise jurisdiction. Tennessee courts will not grant visitation to a non-biological parent in appellant\u2019s position. <em>See In re Thompson, </em>11 S.W.3d at 923. Conversely, Maryland courts have allowed visitation to a third party when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>it is in the best interest of the child. <em>See Evans v.

The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Troxel </em>may require some modification of Maryland\u2019s standards respecting visitation by third parties, but <em>Troxel </em>does not prohibit courts from ordering third-party visitation, so long as the decision-making process affords adequate protection to the parent\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See Troxel, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 120 S.Ct. at 2063-64.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Because appellant has the right to seek visitation under Maryland law and not under Tennessee law, there is no available alternative forum for appellant\u2019s claim for. visitation other than Maryland, and the circuit court must exercise its jurisdiction to hear appellant\u2019s visitation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-12\">.

Further, we note that the action against Spam to establish paternity was not filed until May 19, 1999, after the initiation of proceedings in the circuit court. In any event, an action to establish paternity is not an action for custody as contemplated by the UCCJA. <em>See </em>FL \u00a7 9-206(a) (Maryland courts should not exercise jurisdiction when \"a proceeding concerning the <em>custody </em>of the child [is] pending in a court of another state.\u201d) (Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b253-16\">.

Were this case to be heard originally by a Tennessee court, it would likely not apply Maryland law because Maryland law is contrary to the policy of Tennessee with respect to the rights of parents to be protected from interference with their right to raise their children by the claims of third parties. <em>See Hyde v. Hyde, </em>562 S.W.2d 194, 196 (Tenn. 1978)(\u201c[W]here the law of another jurisdiction is applicable, Tennessee will enforce the substantive rights which litigants have under the laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>of the other jurisdiction if such rights are not contrary to the policy of Tennessee.\u201d). Once a Maryland decision has issued, however, Tennessee will abide by such decision under its version of the Act. <em>See </em>Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7 36-6-202; <em>see also Paltrow v. Paltrow, </em>283 Md. 291, 293, 388 A.2d 547 (1978) (stated purpose of Act is to \u201cavoid jurisdictional competition and conflict with courts of other states\u201d requires that \"child custody decrees rendered in other states [be] accorded full faith and credit in Maryland.\u201d); <em>In re Marriage of Dagan, </em>103 Or.App. 453, 798 P.2d 253, 255 (1990) (\"One of the stated purposes of [the Act] is to \u2018facilitate the enforcement of custody decrees of other states.' ...

We do not decide what laws would apply if, after a decision on remand of this case, there is a change in circumstances that would justify a modification of the Maryland decision, and the child is domiciled in Tennessee. <em>Cf.
