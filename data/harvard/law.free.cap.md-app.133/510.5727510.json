On appeal, we are presented with a single issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-14\">Does the Baltimore County Board of Appeals have jurisdiction to hear an appeal of an administrative order and decision made by the Director of the Department of Permits and Development Management exempting the developer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>from review under current development regulations and permitting the developer to proceed with its proposal under the former County Review Group process?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Foxleigh Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cFoxleigh\u201d), appellee, is the owner and developer of property located at Greenspring Station in Baltimore County. On April 15,1998, Foxleigh filed a request with the Baltimore County Development Review Committee (\u201cDRC\u201d), pursuant to the Baltimore County Code (B.C.C.) \u00a7 26-169, \u201cseeking the concurrence of the DRC that the [proposed] plan constitutes a refinement to a previously approved CRG [County Review Group] plan.\u201d Foxleigh proposed to develop an eight-story, 160,000 square foot building, which would include offices, retail space, and a five-story parking structure. Foxleigh\u2019s previous plan was approved by the County Review Group (\u201cCRG\u201d) on April 28, 1988. Appellants, Mullan Greenspring Limited Partnership; Mullan Pavilions Limited Partnership; Johns Hopkins Suburban Health Center, LP; Valleys Planning Council, Inc.; The Meadows of Greenspring Homeowners Association, Inc.; and Norman Wilder, own properly adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of, or have an interest in, the property at issue. Appellants objected to the development and contended that it is not a \u201crefinement\u201d of the previous plan and, consequently, should be processed under the current development regulations by DRC review, not CRG review. Appellants contended that, under the previous CRG regulations, B.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 22-37, <em>et seq. </em>(1978), appellants\u2019 involvement and ability to be heard in the development process is significantly curtailed. However, in 1990, Baltimore County rewrote its development regulations and replaced the CRG development review process with the current DRC review process. Appellants argue that under the new DRC regulations, B.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 26-166, <em>et seq., </em>a public hearing is required and appellants are afforded mandatory notice, disclosures, and an opportunity for input at every critical stage of the development review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>The DRC held an open meeting on April 27,1998, in which appellants participated. On May 12, 1998, Arnold Jablon, the Director of the Baltimore County Department of Permits and Development Management, responded to Foxleigh\u2019s request by a letter, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\"><em>Pursuant to Article 25A, Section 5(U) of the Annotated Code of Maryland, and as provided in Section 602(d) of the Baltimore County Charter, and Section 26-132 of the Baltimore County Code, this letter constitutes an administrative order and decision </em>on the request for issuance, renewal, or modification of a license, permit, approval, exemption, waiver or other form of permission you filed with this department____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">The DRC has, in fact, met in an open meeting on April 27, 1998, and determined that your project is a material change to the CRG. Please submit new plans, so a new CRG can be scheduled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">(Emphasis added). Foxleigh contends that appellants prevailed in that the building was not a refinement but, rather, a material change. Appellants contend, however, that although Jablon\u2019s letter determined that the proposed development was a material change, in effect it granted Foxleigh an exemption by determining that the CRG process applied, as opposed to the more thorough DRC review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Three separate appeals were filed on June 9, 10, and 11, 1998, by Mullan Greenspring Limited Partnership, <em>et al; </em>Johns Hopkins Suburban Health Center, LP; and Valleys Planning Council, Inc., to the Board of Appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Foxleigh filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that Jablon\u2019s letter was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>a final administrative action from which an appeal may be taken and, therefore, the Board of Appeals lacked subject matter jurisdiction. In its Opinion entered on September 16, 1998, the Board of Appeals cited <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 650 A.2d 226 (1994), and found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">... the May 12, 1998 letter describes a CRG plan as opposed to a DRC plan. As a result, it is not governed by the DRC but the CRG per Sections 26-169 and 26-211 of the [Maryland Annotated] Code. As such, Mr. Jablon\u2019s role differs from that which he arguably may exercise under the DRC. The CRG process provides for an appeal at the time the plan is approved, not at the juncture at which Developer [Foxleigh] is advised to submit a plan. That time had not yet occurred at the time of the instant appeal. The instant appeal thus is not ripe and does not constitute a final act from which an appeal lies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Appellants filed Petitions for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The circuit court consolidated the Petitions and a hearing was held on May 25, 1999. The court\u2019s Opinion and Order, filed on June 15,1999, affirmed the Board of Appeals\u2019s decision and held that Jablon\u2019s letter was not a final action appealable to the Board of Appeals under relevant statute. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Judicial review of an administrative agency\u2019s action is narrow. <em>United Parcel, </em>336 Md. at 576, 650 A.2d 226. The circuit court\u2019s standard of review is limited to whether or not it is \u201cin accordance with law.\u201d Md.Code (1999 Supp.), art. 25A, \u00a7 5(U). A reviewing court is confined to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine whether the agency\u2019s decision is premised on an erroneous conclusion of law. <em>United Parcel, </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d 226. As such, a reviewing court is limited to the findings of fact and conclusions of law actually made by the agency. <em>Id. </em>at 585, 650 A.2d 226. An appellate court must essentially repeat the circuit court\u2019s review of an agency\u2019s decision. <em>Art Wood v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number><em>Wiseburg, </em>88 Md.App. 723, 728, 596 A.2d 712 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>325 Md. 397, 601 A.2d 130 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">We find that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Board of Appeals\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Board of Appeals\u2019s decision relied on <em>United Parcel v. People's Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 650 A.2d 226 (1994), and B.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 26-169 and 26-211. B.C.C. \u00a7 26-169 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">These regulations shall apply to all development except ... such development as has received a CRG approval, reclamation plan approval, any other project vested by law or such development for which a CRG plan has been accepted for filing by the department of public works prior to the date of adoption of Bill 1-92, all of which development <em>shall be governed by the subdivision regulations in effect at the time of said approval or acceptance for filing, </em>as the case may be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">(Emphasis added). B.C.C. \u00a7 26-211 states, \u201cAny material amendment to an approved plan shall be reviewed and approved in the same manner as the original plan____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">It is undisputed that Foxleigh had an approved plan by the CRG on April 28,1983. Sections 26-169 and 26-211 unambiguously state that there is no discretion involved in deciding which review process is applicable. A previously approved plan by the CRG must be reviewed by the CRG process for any material amendments. Therefore, these statutes are the bases for Jablon\u2019s letter and for the Board of Appeals\u2019s dismissal of appellants\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">In <em>United Parcel, </em>the Court of Appeals held that a letter from the Zoning Commissioner, written in response to a citizen complaint dated more than two months after a building permit was issued to UPS, was not an appealable decision. <em>United Parcel, </em>336 Md. at 581-85, 650 A.2d 226. Evaluating Maryland Annotated Code, Article 25A, \u00a7 5(U), upon which appellants in this case rely, the Court of Appeals found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>The \u201capproval\u201d or \u201cother form of permission\u201d in this case, and the \u201cdecision\u201d of the Baltimore County officials, occurred in 1986 when the Zoning Commissioner and other officials approved UPS\u2019s application for a building permit and the Building Engineer issued a building permit---[Article 25A, \u00a7 5(U)\u2019s] words \u201cissuance, renewal, denial, revocation, suspension, annulment, or modification\u201d obviously refer to an operative event which determines whether the applicant will have a license or permit, and the conditions or scope of that license or permit____ [The] appealable event occurred in 1986 when the application for [the] permit was approved and ... issued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 583-84, 650 A.2d 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">We find this case sufficiently analogous to <em>United, Parcel. </em>Jablon\u2019s letter was not an \u201coperative event\u201d that determined that Foxleigh\u2019s proposed plan will be granted a license or permit, and did not determine the conditions or scope of that license or permit. Rather, Jablon\u2019s letter merely informed Foxleigh that the proposed plan must be reviewed by the CRG.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">We also find <em>Art Wood v. Wiseburg, </em>88 Md.App. 723, 596 A.2d 712 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>325 Md. 397, 601 A.2d 130 (1992), instructive. In <em>Art Wood, </em>the CRG made comments on a proposed plan, which essentially directed the developer to amend details of the proposed plan in specific ways. <em>Art Wood, </em>88 Md.App. at 733, 596 A.2d 712. This Court held that the CRG\u2019s action was an appealable final action because the CRG \u201cwas not waiting for or seeking any \u2018additional information\u2019 before approving the plan.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 733, 596 A.2d 712. Instead, \u201c[a]ll that remained for the CRG to do ... was to review the amended Plan to make certain that [the developer] had indeed complied with the agencies\u2019 and the CRG\u2019s directives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 733-34, 596 A.2d 712. In contrast to <em>Art Wood, </em>in this case, the CRG needs additional information to begin the approval process. Accordingly, there is not yet a final action that can be appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Appellants rely on Maryland Annotated Code, Article 25A, \u00a7 5(U), Baltimore County Charter \u00a7 602(d), and B.C.C. \u00a7 26-132 for their argument that Jablon\u2019s letter is appealable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Maryland Annotated Code, Article 25A, \u00a7 5, describes the express powers granted and conferred upon chartered counties in Maryland. Md.Code (1999 Supp.), art. 25A, \u00a7 5. Subsection (U) governs County Boards of Appeal and states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">To enact local laws providing (1) for the establishment of a county board of appeals whose members shall be appointed by the county council; ... and (4) for the decision by the board on petition by any interested person and after notice and opportunity for hearing ... of such of the following matters arising (either originally or on review of the action of an administrative officer or agency) under any law, ordinance, or regulation of, or subject to amendment or repeal by, the county council, as shall be specified from time to time by such local laws enacted under this subsection: <em>An application for a zoning variation or exception or amendment of a zoning ordinance map; the issuance, renewal, denial, revocation, suspension, annulment, or modification of any license, permit, approval, exemption, waiver, certificate, registration, or other form of permission or of any adjudicatory order. ...</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">(Emphasis added). Pursuant to this grant of authority, \u00a7 601 of the Baltimore County Charter created a county board of appeals, and \u00a7 602 established procedures for administering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the functions of the Board of Appeals. Section 602 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\">The county board of appeals shall have and may exercise the following functions and powers:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">(d) <em>Appeals from executive, administrative and adjudicatory orders. </em>The county board of appeals shall hear and decide appeals from all other administrative and adjudicatory orders as may from t\u00edme to time be provided by Article 25A of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1957 Edition), as amended, or by legislative act of the county council not inconsistent therewith.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">B.C.C. \u00a7 26-132 states, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">(a) Any person ... aggrieved or feeling aggrieved by any decision or order of the zoning commissioner or the director of zoning administration and development management shall have the right to appeal therefrom to the county board of appeals____ Notice of such appeals shall be filed, in writing, with the director within thirty (30) days from the date of any final order appealed----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">Appellants\u2019 argument fails to recognize that Jablon\u2019s letter does not make any decision and is not an order. It does not issue or modify any license, permit, or approval. Jablon\u2019s letter only informs Foxleigh that the proposed plan is a material change from the previously approved plan and that, in order to be approved, new plans must be submitted for consideration. At the time of Jablon\u2019s letter and at the time this appeal was filed with the Board of Appeals, Foxleigh could have decided not to submit new plans. Or, if it submitted new plans, the CRG could have approved or disapproved them. Therefore, as the Board of Appeals concluded, the appeal was not ripe.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Furthermore, that Jablon\u2019s letter stated that it was an administrative order and decision does not automatically make it an appealable decision. As this Court stated in <em>Art Wood:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Whether the CRG\u2019s action was authorized by the B.C.C. must be determined by the content or effect of that action rather than by the name or description given it by the CRG---- [The] question [of] whether a judgment, order, or decree is final and appealable is not determined by the name or description which the court below gives it, but is to be decided by the appellate court on a consideration of the essence of what is done thereby.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">88 Md.App. at 732-33, 596 A.2d 712 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">We note that appellants have not been left without remedy. In response to Jablon\u2019s May 12, 1988 letter, Foxleigh submitted a plan for CRG review. Appellants participated in a subsequent CRG public meeting. On August 13, 1998, the CRG approved Foxleigh\u2019s plan. Appellants are appealing the CRG\u2019s approval in a separate appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">APPELLANTS TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-9\">.
