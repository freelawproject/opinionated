Appellant presents the following issues for review, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\">1. Whether the trial court erred in failing to take remedial action when the prosecutor purportedly made a threatening remark to a State witness before that witness testified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">2.

Whether the trial court erred \u201cin refusing to instruct the jury that a driver, not involved in a collision with the victim, is guilty of manslaughter by automobile only if the nonstriking driver is involved in a race or speed contest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">4. Whether the evidence was legally sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s convictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">At approximately 9:30 p.m. on June 1, 1998, three automobiles sped out of the parking lot of a Burger King restaurant and headed east on Route 140, between Finksburg and Westminster. The drivers were appellant, Mark Eppig, and, appellant\u2019s codefendant, Scott Drysdale Broadfoot, Sr. Traveling at speeds that substantially exceeded the speed limit, the three drivers weaved in and out of traffic as they played a deadly game of follow-the-leader. Five miles later, Eppig\u2019s vehicle spun out of control, crossed the median strip, and collided with a car traveling in the opposite direction, killing its driver, Geraldine Wu, and seriously injuring her daughter, a passenger in that car.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Before trial, Eppig pled guilty to manslaughter by automobile. He received a sentence of 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, with all but three years suspended, and work release in exchange for testifying against appellant and Broadfoot. At trial, Eppig testified that he, Broadfoot, and appellant drove out of the Burger King parking lot and quickly accelerated their vehicles to a speed of 80 miles per hour. He and Broadfoot were in the lead; appellant followed behind. About a half mile later, Eppig entered a U-turn lane to allow appellant and Broadfoot to pass him. He then sped after them at a speed of 80 to 90 miles per hour. He caught up with them at Sandymount Road, where all three stopped for a red light. When the light turned green, they \u201ctook off,\u201d accelerating to a speed of 80 to 90 miles per hour. After crossing Suffolk Road, Eppig\u2019s vehicle reached a speed of 100 miles per hour, passing appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>lant and Broadfoot. Pulling in front of Broadfoot, however, he lost control of his vehicle, crossed the grassy median and collided with Mrs. Wu\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Jeffrey Lauer, a Baltimore County Police Officer, was traveling east on Route 140 when he observed three automobiles, moving \u201cat extreme high rates of speed,\u201d traveling \u201cextremely close\u201d together and weaving in and out of traffic. He identified, from photographs, Eppig\u2019s car and Broadfoot\u2019s car and stated that appellant\u2019s vehicle \u201cresemble[d]\u201d and was \u201csimilar\u201d to the third of the three vehicles. \u201cThey stayed, more or less, as a pack-pack of three vehicles pretty much the entire time I saw them\u201d up to the moment of the collision, he stated. He further testified that the maximum speed reached by the vehicles, before the collision, was \u201cin excess of 90 miles an hour easy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Trooper First Class John Rose of the Maryland State Police testified that the speed limit on Route 140 was 50 miles per hour at the Burger King and 55 miles per hour at the site of the collision. Qualified as an expert in accident reconstruction, Trooper Rose testified that Eppig was driving between 102 and 120 miles per hour when he lost control of his car, and was traveling at 82 miles per hour when he struck Mrs. Wu\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Traveling eastbound on Route 140, Beth O\u2019Connell observed three vehicles pass her shortly before the accident. The first two were traveling one behind the other at such an extreme rate of speed that it caused her to scream. The third vehicle was only a couple of seconds behind. It \u201ccame up on [me] so fast,\u201d she said. The vehicles passed her somewhere between Sandymount and Suffolk Roads. Two other motorists, James King and James Reiter, as well as Reiter\u2019s wife, Pamela, all of whom were traveling on Route 140 at the time of the collision, gave similar testimony as to the speed of the vehicles and their proximity to one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Angel Rivera, a passenger in appellant\u2019s car at the time of the accident, testified that, after leaving the Burger King, the three drivers were playing follow-the-leader, switching lanes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>and positions, and jumping in front of other cars. He stated, however, that, at the time of the accident, appellant\u2019s vehicle was going only 65 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Appellant testified that he never reached a speed in excess of 75 miles per hour; that Broadfoot and Eppig were racing each other, but he was not involved; and that he was not \u201cleapfrogging\u201d other vehicles. Appellant further stated that his car vibrated at high speeds because of damage to his wheel, and that his car was performing sluggishly because of a timing problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Charles Pembleton, an expert in accident reconstruction and automotive systems analysis, was called by appellant to testify. He stated that the condition of appellant\u2019s car would not have permitted him to drive for five miles at a speed of over 85 miles per hour. He further stated that, based on appellant\u2019s testimony that he was traveling only 75 miles per hour and Trooper Rose\u2019s testimony that Eppig was traveling between 102 and 120 miles per hour, appellant\u2019s car was between .18 and .23 miles behind Eppig when Eppig lost control of his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Wendell Cover, also an expert in accident reconstruction, was called by codefendant Broadfoot to testify. He challenged the methodology used by the State police in calculating the speed of the three vehicles. He stated that Eppig was traveling at a speed of 77 miles per hour immediately preceding the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to take the remedial action requested by appellant when evidence that the prosecutor may have threatened a State witness came to light. Specifically, appellant argues that the trial court should have granted either appellant\u2019s motion to disqualify the threatened witness from testifying or codefendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Before Angel Rivera, a passenger in appellant\u2019s car at the time of the collision, took the stand to testify for the State, the trial court conducted a hearing outside of the presence of the jury on the question of whether Rivera had been improperly threatened by the prosecutor. At that hearing, Rivera testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-4\">Q: [BY THE COURT:] What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">A: He said, \u201cif you get on the stand and if \u2019 ... Can I say this word?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">Q: You\u2014you[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">A: ...\u2014if I fuck him over on the stand, that I\u2019ll pay for</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">something\u2014or, I don\u2019t know, something along those terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">Q: So, you don\u2019t remember exactly what he said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-10\">A: No, but it sounded like a threat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-11\">Q: \u201cIf you get on the stand ... and you fuck with me[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-12\">A: That\u2019s what he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-13\">Q: [W]hat\u2014-what next[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-14\">A: I wasn\u2019t even trying to even listen to the rest, I was walkin\u2019 away as he was saying that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-15\">Q: And, what did he say about going on the stand and telling the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-16\">A: Nothing. That\u2019s all he said was that comment, and then, as he was walking away, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-17\">Q: [BY DEFENSE COUNSEL:] Mr. Rivera, did you feel threatened by this remark?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-18\">A: Only about the aspect that he\u2019s way higher authority than I am in his position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-19\">Q: Do you feel that if you testify in this case, you will be testifying, at least partly out of concern for whether you will be prosecuted for anything that you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-20\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Q: Based upon what\u2019s been said to you, do you believe that your ability to testify as a witness fairly and impartially and based solely on the facts as you know them, has been harmed or injured or impaired in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-5\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">The prosecutor then addressed the court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">THE PROSECUTOR: I would like to clarify what I said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZm\">DEFENSE COUNSEL: I have no objection to a proffer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVA\">THE COURT: Pie\u2014please clarify what you\u2014you said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac8\">THE PROSECUTOR: What I said\u2014my exact words to him was, \u201cMr. Rivera, if you fuck with me, you\u2019ll be sorry. All I want is the truth.\u201d And, he said, \u2018You\u2019ll get the truth,\u201d and then we both walked away, and I asked for the truth, and that\u2019s all, and that\u2019s the extent of it, and he was walking\u2014 and he walked away and I walked away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">THE COURT: Do you recall whether you said a second time, \u201cDon\u2019t f_with me,\u201d or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">THE PROSECUTOR: I\u2014I might have said it a second time, it\u2019s very possible, but it wasn\u2019t\u2014we were parting, we were walking separate ways.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">After defense counsel declined the court\u2019s invitation to question the prosecutor further, the court denied defense counsel\u2019s motion to disqualify Rivera as a prosecution witness, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\">[Bjased upon the inquiry that I have made, the fact that all of this has taken place out of the presence of the Jury, persuades me that this will have no bearing on the process and based upon what Mr. Rivera has testified under oath and what [the prosecutor], as an officer of the Court has stated to me, I see no basis to, quote, \u201cdisqualify him as a witness,\u201d so the Motion to Disqualify him as a witness is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">However raw, crude, and unfortunate the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, they appear to have been intended to warn Rivera to tell the truth or face unspecified consequences. Admonitions to witnesses to tell the truth do not necessarily violate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>defendant\u2019s right to due process of law. Indeed, \u201cthe determination of whether prosecutorial admonitions violated the defendant\u2019s due process will depend on the facts in each case.\u201d <em>State v. Stanley, </em>351 Md. 733, 747-48, 720 A.2d 323 (1998). As Rivera was not a defense witness but a State\u2019s witness, the prosecutor\u2019s threat was clearly not intended to \u201cdirectly intimidate or coerce a witness into silence,\u201d a factor that the Court of Appeals, in <em>Stanley, </em>stressed was important in determining the propriety of such prosecutorial admonitions. <em>Id. </em>at 748, 720 A.2d 323. Indeed, there is no evidence that it was anything other than an unnecessarily crude warning to tell the truth. Moreover, Rivera testified that he did not feel any pressure to testify, that he did not fear prosecution based on his testimony, and that he believed that the prosecutor\u2019s statement had not affected his ability to testify fairly and impartially. The trial court thereupon concluded that there was \u201cno basis to ... disqualify him as a witness\u201d and properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to disqualify and codefendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Parenthetically, we note that the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion for mistrial is not properly before us because appellant neither moved for a mistrial himself nor joined in Broadfoot\u2019s motion for a mistrial. <em>See Erman v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 605, 612, 434 A.2d 1030 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Because of the amount of pretrial publicity that attended this case, appellant requested that the trial court ask prospective jurors \u201cwhether anyone knows anything about this case and, if so, what?\u201d While declining to ask that specific question on voir dire, the trial court propounded the following question regarding pretrial publicity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">Have any of you members of the jury, based on any discussions you\u2019ve had around the-the dining room table or kitchen table, based upon any discussions you\u2019ve had at work, based upon watching any television programs which may have reported about this case, or read any articles in the local or Baltimore paper about this case, formed an opinion which would affect your ability to sit as a juror, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>recognizing that your duty as a juror is to be fair and impartial and to decide the case on the evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">Appellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to ask the question requested and by propounding a question which was, according to appellant, both \u201ccompound\u201d and \u201ccomplicated.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Initially, we note that \u201cthe scope of <em>voir dire </em>and the form of the questions propounded rests firmly within the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 34, 633 A.2d 867 (1993) (citing <em>Casey v. Roman Catholic Archbishop, </em>217 Md. 595, 605, 143 A.2d 627 (1958)). Moreover, \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s discretion regarding the scope of a proposed avenue of <em>voir dire </em>is governed by one primary principle: the purpose of \u2018the inquiry is to ascertain \u201cthe existence of cause for disqualification and for no other purpose.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Davis, </em>333 Md. at 34, 633 A.2d 867, (quoting <em>McGee v. State, </em>219 Md. 53, 58, 146 A.2d 194 (1959)) (quoting <em>Adams v. State, </em>200 Md. 133, 140, 88 A.2d 556 (1952) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">In the instant case, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion. The question propounded by the court was neither \u201ccompound\u201d nor \u201ccomplicated\u201d and its purpose was \u201cto ascertain the existence of cause for disqualification,\u201d namely, any bias generated by pretrial publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">It was not a compound question as it did not contain two distinct questions. On the other hand, interestingly enough, appellant\u2019s proposed voir dire question, which the court declined to ask, did contain distinct questions, leaving this Court more than a little curious as to why appellant raised this issue in the first place. Moreover, there is nothing inherently wrong with asking a compound question on voir dire. Appellant\u2019s reliance on Judge MeAuliffe\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Davis </em>for the contrary proposition is baffling. In that opinion, Judge McAuliffe declared: \u201cThe benefit of a compound question ... is to focus the prospective juror\u2019s attention on a specific circumstance that experience has shown is sometimes a disqualifying factor for a juror, without taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the time to hear from each juror about his or her uncle, aunt, or sister____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 54, 633 A.2d 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Nor was there anything complicated about the question propounded by the court. It was a straightforward question as to whether any of the prospective jurors had heard, read, or watched anything on television that had led them to form an opinion affecting their ability to be fair and impartial. And it appears from the record that they had no trouble in understanding the import of that question. Thirteen prospective jurors indicated that they had been affected by newspaper or other media coverage of the case and were thereupon excused from service on that jury. Finally, after interviewing each juror, the trial court asked: \u201cIs there anybody who has some opinion or preconceived notion which would make it\u2014 make you unable to\u2014to follow that instruction on the law if you\u2019re selected as a juror to sit as a juror in this case?\u201d The trial court thus took extra precautions to insure that anyone who had been influenced by media coverage would be excluded from jury service in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Citing <em>Bowie v. State, </em>324 Md. 1, 595 A.2d 448 (1991), appellant contends that the trial court erred in failing to ask the follow-up questions requested by appellant because it left prospective jurors with the task of assessing their own ability to serve. Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Bowie, </em>however, is misplaced. There, the State indicated that it would seek the death penalty if the accused was convicted of first degree murder. During the voir dire examination, the trial court asked potential jurors whether any one \u201chas any feelings whatsoever about such a request [for the death penalty], and I don\u2019t care which way you feel about it, that it would interfere with your ability to fairly and truly judge this matter based only on the evidence before the court?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 595 A.2d 448. Prospective jurors who responded affirmatively to this question were then excluded. On appeal, however, the Court of Appeals held that by failing to inquire further as to the reasons underlying each juror\u2019s response, the trial court had abdicated its responsibility \u201cto make the ultimate decision as to [each juror\u2019s] ability to serve on a capital sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>jury____\u201d 324 Md. at 23, 595 A.2d 448. But the <em>Bowie </em>Court specifically limited the applicability of that holding, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">In the usual case, questions designed to elicit bottom line juror conclusions are often used in the <em>voir dire </em>process and actions taken by the court in response are appropriately upheld. In a death case, however, when they concern juror attitudes about the death penalty and whether a juror, because of those attitudes, will be able to serve, such questions are ordinarily inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 24 n. 10, 595 A.2d 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">As this is not a \u201cdeath case\u201d to anyone but the unfortunate victim, \u201cquestions designed to elicit bottom line juror conclusions,\u201d like the one at issue here, are appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred \u201cin refusing to instruct the jury that a driver, who was not involved in a collision with the victim, is guilty of manslaughter by automobile only if the nonstriking driver is involved in a race or speed contest.\u201d In other words, according to appellant, unless the nonstriking driver is involved in a race or speed contest, his conduct, no matter how negligent, does not rise to the level of \u201cgross negligence,\u201d an essential element of manslaughter by automobile. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">Maryland law defines the crime of manslaughter by automobile as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-12\">Every person causing the death of another as the result of the driving, operation or control of an automobile ... in a grossly negligent manner, shall be guilty of a felony----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">Maryland Code (1996 Repl.Vol., 1999 Supp.), Article 27, \u00a7 388.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">\u201cGross negligence\u201d is the \u201cwanton or reckless disregard for human life in the operation of an automobile.\u201d <em>Goldring v. State, </em>103 Md.App. 728, 733, 654 A.2d 939 (1995); <em>Coates v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 105, 113, 600 A.2d 856 (1992) (citing <em>State v. Kramer, </em>318 Md. 576, 590, 569 A.2d 674 (1990)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>The trial court instructed the jury on the element of gross negligence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\">The second element the State must prove is gross negligence; that is, that the Defendant had a wanton or reckless disregard for human life in the operation of his automobile. The object for disregard must be human life and not merely safety\u2014human safety or\u2014or property. Speed alone is ordinarily insufficient, and the care required must be proportioned to the danger. This deals with his\u2014his state of mind, and his conduct has to have been of such an extraordinary or outrageous character to imply that state of mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">Only conduct that is of extraordinary or outrageous character will be sufficient to imply the state of mind of gross negligence. Simple negligence would not be enough.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">Now, simple negligence is carelessness. It\u2019s defined in the law as the doing of some act that a person using ordinary care would not do, or not doing some act that a person using ordinary care would do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">Even reckless driving may not be enough to imply the state of mind of gross negligence. Reckless driving may be a strong indication, but unless it is of extraordinary or outrageous character, it ordinarily will not be sufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">Speed alone is ordinarily insufficient to prove gross negligence. Speed cannot be looked upon in a vacuum, but must be looked upon in light of all of the other factors and circumstances of the case. Let me illustrate the point with a hypothetical example which is totally unrelated to the evidence in this case. Speeding through a school zone in excess of the speed limit on a rural highway at 2:00 a.m. ordinarily would be insufficient to prove gross negligence. Speeding through the same school zone, however, in excess of the speed limit in the afternoon as school was letting out may be of such an extraordinary or outrageous character as to be sufficient to imply the state of mind of gross negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">You may consider the following factors in determining whether the Defendant\u2019s conduct rose to the level of gross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>negligence: (a) racing or speed contest; (b) failing to keep a proper lookout; (c) failure to maintain proper control of the vehicle; (d) excessive speed under the circumstances; (e) flight from [the] scene without effort to ascertain extent of injuries; (f) failure and force of impact; (g) unusual or erratic driving prior to impact; (h) presence or absence of skid or yaw marks; (i) the injuries sustained and the damage to the vehicles; (j) the nature of the neighborhood environment and the type of highway where the accident occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Appellant objected to that instruction, claiming that the instruction\u2019s definition of \u201cgross negligence\u201d was overbroad and that a nonstriking driver is guilty of manslaughter by automobile only if he was involved in a race or speed contest with the driver who actually struck the victim. Appellant\u2019s claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The factors enumerated in the trial court\u2019s instruction for the jury to consider in determining whether appellant\u2019s conduct rose to the level of gross negligence have been repeatedly approved by this Court. <em>See, e.g., Plummer v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 244, 256, 702 A.2d 453 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>349 Md. 104, 707 A.2d 90 (1998); <em>Boyd v. State, </em>22 Md.App. 539, 550-51, 323 A.2d 684 (1974). The trial court\u2019s instruction was correct as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">On the other hand, appellant\u2019s proposed instruction was an incorrect statement of the law. Racing is not and has never been a necessary element of gross negligence in a manslaughter by automobile case. The trial court was therefore under no obligation to give that instruction to the jury. <em>See Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 479 A.2d 1344 (1984)(explain-ing that in determining whether the trial court should have given a requested jury instruction, an appellate court must determine whether the instruction is an accurate statement of the law).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Finally, appellant contends that \u201cthe evidence adduced below failed to prove that [he] caused the death of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Geraldine Wu or the injuries to\u201d her daughter. He argues that \u201cthere is no evidence in the record demonstrating that any action by [him] caused Eppig to lose control of his vehicle and cross the median\u201d because \u201cthere was no explicit agreement among anyone involved to engage in a race\u201d and, at the time of the collision, appellant \u201chad actually fallen back.\u201d The race, if there was one, was then between Eppig and Broadfoot, he contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The standard for determining whether there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction is \u2018\u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Rusk, </em>289 Md. 230, 240, 424 A.2d 720 (1981) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). Applying that standard, we find that the evidence was sufficient to support appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">It is well settled in Maryland that one who participates in a drag race may be convicted of manslaughter by automobile for the death of a third party, \u201cregardless of which driver actually collided with the victim or the victim\u2019s vehicle.\u201d <em>Pineta v. State, </em>98 Md.App. 614, 626, 634 A.2d 982 (1993); <em>see also Goldring v. State, </em>103 Md.App. 728, 731-32, 654 A.2d 939 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Putting aside for the moment that, as noted earlier, one need not prove that a nonstriking driver was involved in a race to establish the gross negligence element of manslaughter by automobile, there is sufficient evidence that appellant was an active participant in an automobile race and that that race cost Mrs. Wu her life. Without recounting in detail the evidence adduced at trial, as that was done in an earlier part of this opinion, suffice it to say that five eyewitnesses testified that, immediately preceding the collision of Eppig\u2019s vehicle with Mrs. Wu\u2019s, the vehicles of Eppig, Broadfoot, and appellant were traveling at exceptionally high rates of speed, in proximity with each other, and weaving in and out of traffic. There was thus sufficient evidence from which the jury could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>reasonably conclude that appellant was .involved in a race that resulted in Eppig losing control of his vehicle and colliding with Mrs. Wu\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention that there was no evidence of an \u201cexplicit agreement\u201d among the parties to race is puzzling. We assume that by \u201cexplicit\u201d appellant meant \u201cexpressed\u201d and, if so, we agree that no agreement to race was put into words. If, on the other hand, by \u201cexplicit\u201d appellant meant \u201cclear\u201d or \u201cdefinite,\u201d we disagree, as there was ample evidence that all three parties had agreed, albeit by conduct, to race each other only minutes before the fatal collision with Mrs. Wu\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In any event, even if the evidence fell short of establishing that a race had occurred, there was considerable eyewitness testimony that, immediately preceding the collision, appellant, Broadfoot, and Eppig were traveling at extremely high rates of speed, playing follow-the-leader, leapfrogging traffic, and jumping in front of other cars. As the Court of Appeals observed in <em>Palmer v. State, </em>223 Md. 341, 353, 164 A.2d 467 (1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">It is not essential to the existence of a causal relationship that the ultimate harm which has resulted was foreseen or intended by the actor. It is sufficient that the ultimate harm is one which a reasonable man would foresee as being reasonably related to the acts of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">In the instant case, the death of Mrs. Wu and the serious injuries suffered by her daughter, though not intended by appellant, were reasonably foreseeable consequences of the acts of appellant and his friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
