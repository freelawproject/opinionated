His strategy is unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">The issues that Husband presents to this Court arise from the denial of his motion to vacate a default judgment of absolute divorce entered against him and in favor of his Wife in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Husband, who now sojourns in India after spiriting away one of the couple\u2019s minor children, filed a subsequent motion to strike this order and requested a hearing. The court addressed his motion by advising counsel that a hearing would be scheduled \u201con condition that Mr. Das and the minor child, Radha, are present.\u201d Husband appeals and asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-9\">1. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in denying Husband\u2019s motion to vacate the order of default?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-10\">2. Did the trial court abuse its discretion or deny Husband due process by not granting a continuance of the divorce hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-11\">8. Did the trial court err or abuse its discretion in granting Wife an absolute divorce?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-12\">We answer \u201cNo\u201d to these questions and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-13\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b28-14\">The parties were married on August 13,1978, in New Dehli, India. Two children were bom of the marriage: Radha, on October 7,1983, and Jaya, on October 3,1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>The parties separated in January 1998, following entry of a domestic violence protective order granted to Wife by the District Court of Montgomery County. The order granted Wife custody of the children, who are minors. Because the order was set to expire on January 10, 1999, the parties entered into an \u201cInterim Agreement,\u201d reached during voluntary mediation and designed to preserve the <em>status quo </em>for custody and living arrangements, on December 14,1998. The agreement provided that Husband would not \u201cresume residence in the family home\u201d for three months from December 10, 1998, and would \u201cdeliver the children\u2019s passports to David S. Goldberg, mediator, for safekeeping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">On January 19, 1999, Wife filed an Emergency Complaint for Custody, which alleged that Husband had undermined her custody of and relationship with Radha in violation of the Interim Agreement and that he had \u201cabused the process to gain possession of his daughter.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court denied this complaint on January 20, after it conferred with counsel. At this time, the parties agreed through counsel that Wife would retain custody of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">Notwithstanding the Interim Agreement and subsequent oral custody agreement, Husband fled the country, taking Radha with him, on or about April 16, and went to Japan, following personal service of the Amended Complaint for Absolute Divorce on March 8.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Wife neither knew of nor consented to Husband\u2019s plans to remove the child from Maryland. In response, Wife filed a second Emergency Complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>for Custody. The Emergency Complaint stated that \u201cDefendant [fled] to Japan with the minor child on or about April 16, 1999, where he arid the child remain at this time.\u201d Husband did not oppose this complaint, because, he alleges, neither he nor his attorney were served. The court granted Wife legal and physical custody of the children by an order issued April 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Cheryl P. Vural entered an appearance as counsel on Husband\u2019s behalf on March 25 and moved to strike Wife\u2019s divorce complaint. Neither Husband nor his lawyer, however, appeared for the scheduling conference on April 28, despite the court\u2019s notice to husband mailed on March 19. The court denied Husband\u2019s Motion to Strike on June 1. Before the period for filing an Answer began, Vural moved to strike her own appearance on May 12, and the court granted her motion without a hearing on June 3. The court immediately mailed Husband Notice to Employ New Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Husband\u2019s residential address before he left the country\u2014 and the address used by the court for the divorce proceedings\u2014was 5104 White Flint Drive, Kensington, Maryland 20985. Wife alleges in her opposition to the motion on appeal that Husband continued to pay rent for this apartment home at the time of the post-judgment motions. He used this address on the mediation agreement executed on December 4, 1998, and his own attorney certified in her Motion to Strike Appearance that this address was Husband\u2019s \u201clast known mailing address,\u201d but she also explained that her \u201cvarious efforts\u201d to contact her client had been unsuccessful and she had not heard from him since April 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Husband was thus without representation at the June 30 hearing on <em>pendente lite </em>child support, and Wife testified there that Husband was \u201cto the best of [her] knowledge\u201d in India.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The master filed a partial transcript as a report and recommendation, which was sent to Husband at the Kensing<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>ton address. Moreover, because Husband did not file an Answer to Wife\u2019s Amended Complaint, Wife requested an Order of Default on June 21, which was entered on June 30.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Clerk mailed Husband a Notice of Default Order at the Kensington address.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">Concurrent to the custody and divorce actions, a child in need of assistance (CINA) action for Radha was wending its way through the District Court. On May 25, Nancy Karkowsky, Radha\u2019s court-appointed attorney, filed a Praecipe notifying that court and the circuit court that, after first being taken to Japan, Radha was now \u201cstaying with the father and the family of the father\u2019s cousin ... in Chandigarh, India.\u201d On June 2, Karkowsky notified the courts in a Second Praecipe of what she believed to be Radha\u2019s exact address in New Delhi, India.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Information in both notices as to the whereabouts of Husband and Radha came from Husband\u2019s father. Copies of these notices were sent to counsel of record for both Husband, <em>i.e., </em>Vural, and Wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">When the divorce trial began on August 11, Gary Segal, Husband\u2019s attorney for employment matters, attended the hearing. He explained that he was \u201chere for Dr. Das,\u201d but because he received little notice he was ill-prepared to enter an appearance and undertake full representation. Segal ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>vised the court that, if he were to enter an appearance, he would petition the court for a continuance; however, at the present time, he \u201c[did] not feel that [he] would be capable of properly defending Dr. Das in this matter.\u201d The court excused Segal, noting that any request for continuance would be denied, which \u201cis pretty typical in our process today. Under the best of circumstances, cases are not continued____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">At trial, Wife testified that she had been subject to repeated acts of physical and mental cruelty during the marriage. Her brother corroborated this testimony. Husband\u2019s father, Badri Das, who had been given power of attorney for Husband\u2019s affairs in the United States, sought to give testimony and present documents to the court. The court allowed him to testify as to Husband\u2019s and Radha\u2019s current locale, which was different from the address Karkowsky provided.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The elder Das could not, however, recall their exact address. The court did not allow the father to speak otherwise on behalf of his son,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the testimony of Wife and her brother went untested by cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">On August 19, the court granted Wife an absolute divorce on the grounds of cruelty and excessively vicious conduct, legal and residential custody of the parties\u2019 minor children, child support, use and possession of the family home and family-use personalty, a monetary award, and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Husband quickly retained new counsel; however, on October 19, the court denied his Motion to Vacate Order of Default, Stay Entry of Judgment, Permit Filing of Responsive Pleadings, Grant a New Trial and/or Reconsider Award of Custody, and Certain Other Relief. Husband then, on October 26, filed a pleading styled Defendant\u2019s Unopposed Motion to Strike Order Dated October 19, 1999, and Set Hearing in Open Court, to which Wife filed opposition. By letter dated November 16,1999, the court addressed this motion by advising counsel: \u201cI do not believe that there is any requirement that I schedule a hearing on Defendant\u2019s Motion to Vacate Order---- However, I will agree to schedule a hearing on the condition that Mr. Das and the minor child, Radha, ar\u00e9 present.\u201d Husband noted a timely appeal on November 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">The question of whether this appeal is ripe for our review has troubled us, and we flirted with dismissing it entirely. Husband appeals a judgment that appears not to be final, yet the trial court\u2019s response to his most recent motion and ministerial failure to deny this motion leave the parties in a deadlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">Husband\u2019s Motion to Vacate Order of Default was filed eleven days after the Judgment of Absolute Divorce was docketed. Husband\u2019s motion was thus a request to revise a final judgment, filed pursuant to the limitations of Maryland Rule 2-535,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> rather than a motion to alter or amend a non-final judgment filed under the more generous standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Maryland Rule 2-534.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The instant appeal, at least as framed by the parties, is from the trial court\u2019s denial of that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The problem lies with Husband\u2019s Unopposed [sic ] Motion to Strike Order Dated October 19, 1999, and Set Hearing in Open Court, filed but a single day after the docketing of the court\u2019s order denying Husband\u2019s Motion to Vacate Order of Default. Under Rule 2-534, Husband\u2019s diligence in filing this motion within 10 days of judgment stayed the entry of the court\u2019s order and this appeal. <em>Unnamed Atty. v. Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n, </em>303 Md. 473, 486, 494 A.2d 940 (1985) (\u201c[W]hen a motion to alter or amend an otherwise final judgment is filed within ten days after the judgment\u2019s entry, the judgment loses its finality for purposes of appeal.\u201d); <em>see also Popham v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., </em>333 Md. 136, 634 A.2d 28 (1993). If the trial court had denied this motion when it replied, Husband could have refiled his notice of appeal, and we would now unhesitatingly address the merits. <em>Unnamed Atty., </em>303 Md. at 486, 494 A.2d 940 (if judgment loses finality under revisory motion, \u201can order of appeal ... becomes ineffective, and a new order of appeal must be filed after the circuit court disposes of the motion\u201d). The court, however, neither granted nor denied Husband\u2019s motion. Instead, it sent by letter the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">I have reviewed Defendant\u2019s Motion to Strike Order of Court____ I do not believe that there is any requirement that I schedule a hearing on Defendant\u2019s Motion to Vacate Order of Default, Stay Entry of Judgment---- However, I will agree to schedule a hearing on the condition that Mr. Das and the minor child, Radha, are present.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>In reply, counsel wrote the chancellor, declining to present Husband and his daughter in court because \u201c[t]he issues raised in the motion can be considered in large part on the record =.. and involve primarily legal grounds on which Vincent and his daughter are not necessarily witnesses,\u201d travel from India \u201cis an expensive proposition,\u201d and \u201cRadha is in school, so a trip here could be very disruptive to her education.\u201d He also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-5\">Your order dated October 19, 1999, and filed October 26, 1999, denied our motion without a hearing. Unless that order is rescinded, and a hearing on the original motion set, our client must appeal the judgment in this case immediately-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Husband\u2019s counsel asked the court below to docket this correspondence and proceeded with this appeal, informing us at oral argument that he considered the Motion to Strike to have been denied. The docket, however, shows Husband\u2019s motion as open.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">Although Wife does not challenge our jurisdiction, we nevertheless address this point. <em>Popham, </em>333 Md. at 142, 634 A.2d 28 (\u201cUnless an appeal is from a final judgment, the appellate court does not acquire subject matter jurisdiction to review it\u201d). We believe, however, that the motion remains open due to ministerial error rather than efforts by the trial court to retain jurisdiction. Correspondence from Husband\u2019s counsel indicated his intent to move forward with this appeal. The court\u2019s denial of the Motion to Vacate Order of Default had previously settled the rights of the parties and concluded the cause of action. <em>Davis v. Davis, </em>97 Md.App. 1, 10, 627 A.2d 17 (1993) (holding that final judgment must (1) be intended as an unqualified, final disposition of the matter in controversy, (2) adjudicate or complete adjudication of all claims against all parties, and (3) be recorded by the clerk pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-601) (citing <em>Rohrbeck v. Rohrbeck, </em>318 Md. 28, 41, 566 A.2d 767 (1989), <em>aff'd, </em>335 Md. 699, 646 A.2d 365 (1994)). The court itself acknowledged in correspondence that it owed Husband nothing more on the Motion to Vacate Order of Default. Patently, its offer was an effort to secure the return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>of the minor child to Maryland, rather than one to delay finality or appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Considerations of judicial efficiency also constrain us to entertain this appeal. Between counsel\u2019s attempt to cow the trial court into restoring to Husband that which he forfeited and the court\u2019s reply, this matter is frozen in time. Husband is unlikely to return to Maryland, for he reasonably believes that he would incur significant liability. <em>Cf. Popham, </em>333 Md. at 142, 634 A.2d 28 (\u201cA judgment is final if it is \u2018so far final as ... to deny to the party seeking redress by the appeal the means of further prosecuting or defending his rights and interests in the subject matter of the proceeding.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>In re Buckler Trusts, </em>144 Md. 424, 427, 125 A. 177 (1924)). If we were to remand so that Husband could withdraw his Motion to Strike, he would also take action that is arguably contrary to his interests. <em>Franzen v. Dubinok, </em>290 Md. 65, 427 A2d 1002 (1981) (\u201cThe law of this State is clear that the \u2018right to an appeal may be lost by acquiescence in, or recognition of, the validity of the decision below from which the appeal is taken or by otherwise taking a position which is inconsistent with the right of appeal.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>Rocks v. Brosius, </em>241 Md. 612, 630, 217 A.2d 531, 541 (1966)). He is thus unlikely to do so. If we remanded suggesting that the court below deny his motion, we would be shortly faced with the significant family law issues addressed <em>infra </em>and, meanwhile, the parties, including Wife, would continue'to bear the significant cost of litigation. Our rules and policy, however, disfavor piecemeal appeals. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md. Rule 8-131(a) (\u201cOrdinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\u201d); <em>State v. Zimmerman, </em>261 Md. 11, 25, 273 A2d 156 (1971) (\u201cThe interest of justice is best served if there are not piecemeal appeals.\u201d). By addressing the merits issues now, we encourage their rapid resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>That the court below failed in its ministerial duties under Maryland Rule 2-601 (requiring entry, recording, and indexing of judgment) is troubling, but need not be fatal in the circumstances of this case. <em>Cf. Davis, </em>97 Md.App. at 10-11, 627 A.2d 17 (no final judgment existed where clerk entered judgment pursuant to Rule 2-601, but court had not directed such entry of a judgment as defined by Maryland Rule 1-202(n)). Maryland Rule 8-414(a) allows us to correct errors and omissions in the record, and we hereby order pursuant to Rule 8-414(c) that Husband\u2019s Motion to Strike be deemed denied as of November 23, 1999, the date that Husband\u2019s counsel replied to the court\u2019s offer of a hearing. <em>See Davis, </em>97 Md.App. at 12, 627 A.2d 17 (ordering correction of docket entries).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Husband\u2019s appeal is from the denial of his Motion to Vacate Order of Default, filed under Maryland Rule 2-535, not from the underlying Judgment of Divorce itself. <em>In Re: Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055/CAD, </em>344 Md. 458, 475, 687 A.2d 681, <em>cert. denied sub nom., Clemy P. v. Montgomery Dept. of Soc. Serv., </em>520 U.S. 1267, 117 S.Ct. 2439, 138 L.Ed.2d 199 (1997). Our standard of review here is thus abuse of discretion. <em>See Wormwood v. Batching Systems, Inc., </em>124 Md.App. 695, 700, 723 A.2d 568 (citing <em>New Freedom Corp. v. Brown, </em>260 Md. 383, 386, 272 A.2d 401 (1971)), <em>cert. denied, </em>354 Md. 113, 729 A.2d 405 (1999). The abuse of discretion standard makes generous allowances for the trial court\u2019s reasoning. Abuse of discretion occurs</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAQ\">\u201cwhere no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u201d or when the court acts \u201cwithout reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u201d It has also been said to exist when the ruling under consideration \u201cappears to have been made on untenable grounds,\u201d when the ruling is \u201cclearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court,\u201d when the ruling is \u201cclearly untenable, unfairly depriving a litigant of a substantial right and denying a just result,\u201d when the ruling is \u2018Violative of fact and logic,\u201d or when it constitutes an \u201cuntenable judicial act that defies reason and works an injustice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number><em>North v. North, 102 </em>Md.App. 1, 13-14, 648 A.2d 1025 (1994) (citations omitted). We will not reverse a ruling we review under the abuse of discretion standard simply because we would have made a different ruling had we been sitting as trial judges. Instead, \u201c[t]he real question is whether justice has not been done,\u201d and the judgment will be reversed only if \u201cthere is a grave reason for doing so.\u201d <em>Wormwood, </em>124 Md.App. at 700, 723 A.2d 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Motion to Vacate Order of Default</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Husband\u2019s motion. Marching behind the banner of Maryland Rule 2-535(b) (\u201cOn motion of any party filed at any time, the court may exercise revisory power and control over the judgment in case of fraud, mistake, or irregularity.\u201d), Husband attacks the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion on three fronts. First, he argues that the judgment should be vacated because Wife\u2019s counsel engaged in extrinsic fraud when she requested an Order of Default Judgment using Husband\u2019s Kensington address. Second, he claims that the court acted with irregularity when it granted Vural\u2019s Motion to Strike Appearance without allowing adequate time for response, as required by Maryland Rule 2-311(b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Third, Husband asserts that he acted with due diligence and good faith in moving to set aside the court\u2019s judgment. \u201cA court ... will only exercise its revisory powers if, in addition to a finding of fraud, mistake, or irregularity, the party moving to set aside the enrolled judgment has acted with ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>diligence, in good faith, and has a meritorious defense or cause of action.\u201d <em>Tandra S. v. Tyrone </em>W., 336 Md. 303, 314, 648 A.2d 439 (1994). We shall parry each prong of Husband\u2019s thrust in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Extrinsic Fraud</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Husband argues that the default judgment was procured by extrinsic fraud because Wife\u2019s attorney filed both her first and second Requests for Order of Default supplying the court with Husband\u2019s Kensington address as his \u201clast known address.\u201d In doing so, he argues, she perpetrated fraud on the court, because she had actual knowledge of Husband\u2019s address in India, and she thus perpetrated a fraud on the court and prevented Husband from presenting his own favorable evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Fraud, however, must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, and, under the instant facts, Husband has not done so. Furthermore, Husband\u2019s own actions to evade the reach of the court and eloign his minor child in another land\u2014including his failure to apprise the court of his change of address once this action began\u2014were, in our view, the predominant causes of his inability to put on his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">The trial court can disturb an enrolled judgment after the thirty-day revisory period only upon a showing of fraud, mistake, irregularity, or the failure of the court to perform a duty required by statute or rule. Md.Code (1974, 1998 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 6-408 of the Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article; <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 2-535(b). This rule exists to ensure the finality of judgments, <em>see Tandra S., </em>336 Md. at 314, 648 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>439 (citing <em>Andresen v. Andresen, </em>317 Md. 380, 387-88, 564 A.2d 399 (1989)), and it applies to all final judgments, including those entered by default. <em>See Maggin v. Stevens, </em>266 Md. 14, 16, 291 A.2d 440 (1972) (citing <em>Berwyn Fuel &amp; Feed Co. v. Kolb, </em>249 Md. 475, 477, 240 A.2d 239 (1968)). The term \u201cfraud\u201d as used in Rule 2-535(b) is \u201cnarrowly defined and strictly applied.\u201d <em>Tandra S., </em>336 Md. at 315, 648 A.2d. 439. To prevail on a motion to set aside an enrolled judgment, the moving party must show fraud, mistake, or irregularity by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 314, 648 A.2d 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Maryland courts may vacate an enrolled judgment for extrinsic, but not for intrinsic, fraud. In <em>Hresko v. Hresko, </em>83 Md.App. 228, 574 A.2d 24 (1990), we differentiated between these two forms of fraud:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">Intrinsic fraud is defined as \u201c[t]hat \u201cwhich pertains to issues involved in the original action or where acts constituting fraud were, or could have been, litigated therein.\u201d Extrinsic fraud, on the other hand, is \u201c[f]raud which is collateral to the issues tried in the case where the judgment is rendered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">Fraud is extrinsic when it actually prevents an adversarial trial. In determining whether or not extrinsic fraud exists, the question is not whether the fraud operated to cause the trier of fact to reach an unjust conclusion, but whether the fraud prevented the actual dispute from being submitted to the fact finder at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 232, 574 A.2d 24 (citations omitted) (quoting in part <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(5th ed.1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">Intrinsic fraud occurs within the ease itself when, for example, a witness perjures himself or a party offers a forged instrument into evidence. <em>Tandra S., </em>336 Md. at 316, 648 A,2d 439 (citing <em>Schwartz v. Merchants Mort. Co., </em>272 Md. 305, 308, 322 A.2d 544 (1974)). Even if a perpetrator of intrinsic fraud occasionally succeeds in distorting the truth, our adversarial system is the best hope for ferreting out such deception. On the other hand, extrinsic fraud prevents the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>adversarial system from working at all. It involves infirmities such as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-4\">\u201ca false promise of a compromise; or where the defendant never had knowledge of the suit, being kept in ignorance by the acts of the plaintiff; or where an attorney fraudulently or without authority assumes to represent a party and connives at his defeat; or where the attorney regularly employed corruptly sells out his client\u2019s interest to the other side,\u2014these, and similar cases which show that there has never been a real contest in the trial or hearing of the case, are reasons for which a new suit may be sustained to set aside and annul the former judgment or decree, and open the case for a new and a fair hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-5\"><em>Id., </em>336 Md. at 316-17, 648 A.2d 439 (quoting <em>Schwartz, </em>272 Md. at 309, 322 A.2d 544) (quoting <em>United States v. Throckmorton, </em>98 U.S. 61, 65-66, 25 L.Ed. 93 (1878)).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Here, Husband fails to establish extrinsic fraud by clear and convincing evidence; instead, the evidence shows that Husband\u2019s own failure to keep the court enlightened of his address and his actions to evade the custody orders of the court below caused his misfortunes. To be sure, Wife\u2019s attorney had at least some notice, from the Second Praecipe filed by Karkowsky on June 2, of Husband\u2019s most recent address before he filed the second Request for Order of Default on June 21. Whether by continuing to use Husband\u2019s old address Wife\u2019s counsel \u201cset forth that type of intentionally deceptive artifice\u201d calculated to keep him away fi*om court, made a mere record-keeping error, or acted with the understanding that Husband had access to mail sent to his Kensington address is rather nebulous from the facts presented. <em>See Schwartz, </em>272 Md. at 308, 322 A.2d 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">What is patent, however, is that Husband withdrew from the country\u2014in an apparent attempt to remove a minor child from the jurisdiction of Maryland courts\u2014during ongoing litigation. Our rules on a litigant\u2019s duties in the midst of litigation are clear. First, a litigant has a duty to keep himself informed as to the progress of a pending case. <em>See Penn </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>Cent. Co. v. Buffalo Spring &amp; Equip. Co., </em>260 Md. 576, 581, 273 A.2d 97 (1971); <em>Tasea Inv. Corp. v. Dale, </em>222 Md. 474, 478, 160 A.2d 920 (1960). Second, a litigant has \u201ca continuing obligation to furnish the court with [his] most recent address.\u201d <em>Grass v. Grass, </em>123 Md.App. 311, 320, 718 A.2d 622 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">It was thus no abuse of discretion for the trial court to find that Husband\u2019s wounds were self-inflicted, rather than caused by Wife\u2019s alleged artifice. His assertions to the contrary, Husband was well aware that the case was at issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He was served in Arlington, Virginia, with the Amended Complaint for Absolute Divorce on March 8.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He also was notified on March 19 of the Scheduling Conference that he and his attorney later missed. In response to the Amended Complaint, Husband filed a preliminary Motion to Strike under Maryland Rule 2-322(e), because Wife had failed to attach a financial statement to her pleadings. He filed this motion on March 25, within the 60-day period for timely filing his answer or other responsive pleading. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-321(b)(l) (\u201cA defendant who is served with an original pleading outside of the State but within the United States shall file an answer within 60 days after being served.\u201d); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 2-322(e). Husband left the country on or about April 15. Because \u201c[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with a court,\u201d Md. Rule 2-101(a), Husband clearly removed himself from the jurisdiction of the court during an ongoing action of which he was duty-bound to stay apprised. Furthermore, he breached his duty to inform the court of his new address, even though he was warned by the court at least once to do so.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Unlike the defendant in <em>Grass, </em>which Husband cites with approval, no pleading or paper filed by Husband gives any address other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>than the one in Kensington. 123 Md.App. at 320, 718 A2d 622.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">It was reasonable, moreover, for Wife and her attorney to rely on the fact that Husband\u2019s Kensington address was the correct one. At the time of service, his address of record was that address. Husband\u2019s preliminary Motion to Strike used that address. The letter from Vural to Husband, advising him of her intention to withdraw, and her subsequent Motion to Strike Appearance used that address. Despite Karkowsky\u2019s Second Praecipe, docketed on June 2, which inferred that Husband had settled in a family-owned house in New Delhi, the court itself mailed Husband\u2019s Notice to Employ New Counsel to that address. Husband might argue with scant credibility that the Clerk\u2019s Office should have changed the address of record based on Karkowsky\u2019s praecipe, but we think that receiving such third-hand notice did not obligate the court to change a local address of record, where the litigant seemed to be receiving mail, to a rumored address in a remote land. The facts, moreover, in no way support Husband\u2019s assertion that, by continuing to use the Kensington address, Wife and her attorney deliberately deceived the court and denied Husband the opportunity to present his case. If Husband could not keep his own father, who held power of attorney, informed of his exact address, how can he reasonably expect his estranged wife to have knowledge of the same?</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Neither did the court err when it entered the Order of Default. On June 1, the court denied Husband\u2019s Motion to Strike. Under Maryland Rule 2-321(c),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Husband\u2019s Answer to the Amended Complaint was thus due on June 16, although the court allowed him until June 19. When no Answer was forthcoming, Wife filed a Request for Order of Default on June 21, giving as Husband\u2019s \u201clast known address\u201d the Kensington location. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-613(b). The time for plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ing having expired, and upon written request of the plaintiff, the court entered its Order of Default as Rule 2-613(b) requires.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See Carter v. Harris, </em>312 Md. 371, 539 A.2d 1127 (1988) (for Rule 2-613, \u201cthe word \u2018shall\u2019 is presumed to have a mandatory meaning inconsistent with the exercise of discretion\u201d unless the context indicates otherwise). When Husband failed to move timely for vacation of that order, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 2-613(d),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the court held a hearing as required by Maryland Rule 9-204<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and entered its Judgment of Absolute Divorce on August 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The court below, moreover, properly denied Husband\u2019s motion to stay that judgment,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> even though his motion was filed on August 30, within thirty days after its entry. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-535(a) (\u201cOn motion of any party filed within 30 days after entry of judgment, the court may exercise revisory power and control over the judgment and, if the action was tried before the court, may take any action that it could have taken under Rule 2-534.\u201d). Rule 2-613(g) expressly provides that default judgments are not subject to the broad revisory powers of Rules 2-534 and 2-535(a) except as to the relief granted. The judge\u2019s powers are thus constrained, even during the first thirty days, and the court below did not'abuse its discretion by refusing to stay the judgment or revise the relief granted. <em>See also Banegura v. Taylor, </em>312 Md. 609, 619-21, 541 A.2d 969 (1988). Instead, Rule 2-535(b), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>covers motions to vacate for fraud, mistake, and irregularity made after thirty days have passed, provides Husband\u2019s only legitimate basis for argument. He has failed to establish at the threshold that Wife and her attorney had defrauded the court below. Rather, it appears that Husband, contrary to his mediation agreement with Wife and in violation of the court\u2019s later custody order, scurried from the court\u2019s jurisdiction with his minor daughter and played three-card monte with respect to his whereabouts. When it refused to reward such chicanery, the eourt below exercised sound discretion. We uphold its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Motion to Strike Appearance</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Husband\u2019s second claim is that the court acted with irregularity when it granted the Motion to Strike Appearance filed by Vural. Husband argues that the court failed to allow adequate time for response, as required by Maryland Rule 2-311(b).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Because the court file contained information indicating that he was out of the country, Husband contends, and no Answer had been filed, the court should have held a hearing prior to granting Vural\u2019s Motion to Strike Appearance, presumably so that he would not have been left without counsel as the deadline for filing the Answer approached. Just as Husband cannot prove extrinsic fraud, he cannot prove irregularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">Irregularity, like fraud, provides very narrow grounds for revising a final judgment under Rule 2-535(b). <em>Tandra S., </em>336 Md. at 318, 648 A.2d 439.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Irregularity, as used in Rule 2\u2014535(b), has been defined as \u201cthe doing or not doing of that, in the conduct of a suit at law, which, conformable to the practice of the court, ought or ought not to be done.\u201d ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-5\">\u201c[I]rregularity, in the contemplation of the Rule, usually means irregularity of process or procedure ... and not an error, which in legal parlance, generally connotes a departure from truth or accuracy of which a defendant had notice and could have challenged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Weitz v. MacKenzie, </em>273 Md. 628, 631, 331 A.2d 291 (1975) (citations omitted)); <em>see also Hughes v. Beltway Homes, </em>276 Md. 382, 388-89, 347 A.2d 837 (1975); <em>Berwyn Fuel &amp; Feed Co., </em>249 Md. at 479, 240 A.2d 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Here, we find no error in the process and procedure of the instant case when the court decided to accept counsel\u2019s Motion to Strike Appearance. Maryland Rule 2-132(b) requires that motions for withdrawal that are not made in open court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap\">be accompanied by the client\u2019s written consent to the withdrawal or the moving attorney\u2019s certificate that notice has been mailed to the client at least five days prior to the filing of the motion, informing the client of the attorney\u2019s intention to move for withdrawal and advising the client to have another attorney enter an appearance or to notify the clerk in writing of the client\u2019s intention to proceed in proper person. Unless the motion is granted in open court, the court may not order the appearance stricken before the expiration of the time prescribed by Rule 2-311 for responding. The court may deny the motion if withdrawal of the appearance would cause undue delay, prejudice, or injustice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHi\">Under Maryland Rule 2-311(b), the litigant who is served with such a motion \u201cshall file a response within 15 days after being served ... or within the time allowed for a party\u2019s original pleading pursuant to Rule 2-321(a), whichever is later.\u201d As required by Rule 2-132(b), Vural sent notice to Husband of her impending withdrawal by letter on April 28, advising him to \u201cimmediately obtain alternative counsel and have them enter their appearance on your behalf.\u201d After waiting consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>erably more than five days thereafter, and hearing nothing from Husband, Vural moved the court on May 12, attaching a copy of this letter to her papers to support her statement certifying she had notified him of her withdrawal. The court granted her motion on June 3, more than 18 days after its filing and service.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Husband cites with approval <em>Ritter v. Danbury, </em>15 Md.App. 309, 290 A.2d 173 (1972), in which, he claims, we vacated the judgment of the trial court for refusing to consider a party\u2019s request not to permit her counsel to withdraw. <em>Ritter </em>is inapposite, however, because Husband misrepresents what transpired in that case. In <em>Ritter, </em>Danbury\u2019s counsel moved to strike appearance by petition, and his motion had been granted \u201cimmediately following the filing of their petition <em>and consent thereto,\u201d i.e., </em>the client gave his permission to withdraw. <em>Id. </em>at 313, 290 A.2d 173 (emphasis added). Ritter appealed and complained that <em>he </em>had not been served with notice of the withdrawal of Danbury\u2019s counsel. We agreed. In <em>Ritter, </em>as here, client consent was a non-issue, because the withdrawing attorney followed the rule for client notification or consent. Moreover, <em>Ritter\u2019s </em>analysis clarifies the rationale behind the service requirement of Rule 2-132(b) for motions not made in open court: It protects parties to the case <em>other than </em>the withdrawing counselor\u2019s client. \u201c[E]xcept where a motion to withdraw or strike an appearance is made in open court <em>in the presence of the other party or his attorney ... </em>such motion shall be served upon the other party or his attorney\u2014\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313-14, 290 A.2d 173. Thus, once the client has granted consent or the five-day notification period passes, the protective force of Rule 2-132(b) shifts to shield from disadvantage the <em>other </em>parties in the case. By not responding to Vural\u2019s letter within five days or, as a practical matter, before Vural could file her motion, Husband slept on his rights and lost the opportunity to protest her withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">For the same reason, Husband was not entitled to a hearing on counsel\u2019s attempts to locate him before the court allowed her to withdraw. Rule 2-132 imposes no hearing requirement for motions made by petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Moreover, Husband\u2019s present contention that he lacked the notice he needed to retain new counsel strains credibility. In the very motion on appeal, Husband claimed to have dismissed Vural:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-5\">During this same time period, Defendant became dissatisfied with the services of Ms. Vural, and sought new counsel. Defendant paid a retainer to Edouard Bouquet, Esquire, and signed pleadings, including \u00bfn answer to the amended complaint, but was faxing these pleadings from overseas, and did not know why they were never filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">If his allegations are true, Vural\u2019s withdrawal and the court\u2019s subsequent Notice to Employ New Counsel were no surprise. In his own words, he \u201cdid expect to be represented by new counsel in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Whether or not Vural\u2019s withdrawal was expected, however, the duty to stay informed and file pleadings in timely fashion ultimately lay with Husband, and not with his attorney, incumbent or newly retained. In <em>Banegura, </em>312 Md. at 609, 541 A.2d 969, the court refused to find an irregularity when appellant\u2019s personal attorney failed to file responsive pleadings because he had not been retained for that particular action, concluding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-8\">[t]he irregularity suggested by Banegura was the discrepancy that existed between his version of why Burke did not file an answer or timely motion, and the version given by Burke. This is clearly not the type of irregularity contemplated by Rule 2-535(b)----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 621, 541 A.2d 969. Likewise, in the case <em>sub judice, any </em>misunderstandings between Husband and Vural or Husband and Bouquet about the filing of the Answer are his responsibility and need not have been considered by the court. <em>See also Wooddy v. Wooddy, </em>256 Md. 440, 454, 261 A.2d 486 (1970) (negligence or mistake of agents or counsel is insufficient to justify striking out an enrolled judgment for fraud or irregularity; party has duty to stay informed). We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Diligence and Good Faith</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Husband next asserts that he acted with ordinary diligence and good faith in moving to set aside the court\u2019s judgment, the second element that he would have proved had the court exercised its revisory power under Rule 2-535(b).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We find no fault with Husband\u2019s exercise of diligence. Husband filed his initial Motion to Vacate within two weeks after the final judgment, an impressive feat for a litigant half a world away.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">On the side of the equation pertaining to good faith, however, we offer no praise. \u201cThe power to set aside a judgment upon motion has been variously described as a power \u2018incident to all courts of record,\u2019 as a power based on \u2018equitable grounds\u2019 and as the exercise of a <em>\u2018quasi </em>equitable power.\u2019\u201d <em>Tasea, </em>222 Md. at 478, 160 A.2d 920. Yet, he who comes into equity (or <em>quasi </em>equity) must have clean hands, and Husband\u2019s actions are the mud on his hands that belies any protestations of good faith. He refused to relinquish his minor children\u2019s passports, despite his agreement to do so. He fled the jurisdiction of the court to a foreign land, taking with him one of the parties\u2019 minor children, of whom he is not the custodial parent. Once abroad, he played a shell game regarding his whereabouts, failing to notify the court, his domestic counsel, and perhaps even his own father of his exact address. Finally, he rejected overtures from the court to entertain oral arguments on his most recent Unopposed [sic ] Motion to Strike Order of Court Dated October 19,1999, And Set Hearing in Open Court. In response to Husband\u2019s motion, the trial judge\u2014who was under no duty to do so\u2014agreed to schedule a hearing on the condition that Husband and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Radha attend. In reply, Husband\u2019s present counsel merely reworked arguments from this appeal, demanded a hearing, and offered tenuous pretexts as to why the two could not be present. As long as Husband remains in India and continues to violate the court\u2019s custody order, we shall find no good faith. We affirm the ruling on the trial court on the motion <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">The Continuance</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Husband\u2019s next two issues on appeal pertain to the Judgment of Absolute Divorce, and not to the post-trial motions. Husband first argues that the trial court abused its discretion and denied him due process by not granting him a continuance at the divorce hearing. Citing <em>Rutherford v. Rutherford, </em>296 Md. 347, 363, 464 A.2d 228 (1983), Husband argues that, because he could have been held in contempt and thereby incarcerated for spiriting Radha away to India, due process requires that he have representation at the divorce hearing. <em>Rutherford </em>holds that, under Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which guarantees due process, a right to counsel exists that is broader than that specifically guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Thus, an indigent defendant in a civil contempt proceeding arising from child support arrearages cannot be sentenced to actual incarceration unless counsel has been appointed to represent him or he has waived the right to counsel.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>See also Jones v. Johnson, </em>73 Md.App. 663, 536 A.2d 116 (1988) (same). Husband also complains that the court abused its discretion when it refused to recognize a general appearance of his counsel for other matters, who attended court on his behalf at the August 11 hearing. Hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>band claims the court denied him due process by \u201cimpermissibly ... assuming and concluding on elements of the attorney/elient relationship that were outside the scope of its authority and that had not been alleged by Appellant or his counsel.\u201d It also, Husband claims, summarily denied him a continuance when Segal and, later, Husband\u2019s father requested one. We think Husband pursues the will o\u2019 the wisp.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">First, the proceeding in question was a divorce action and nothing more. Had collateral civil contempt proceedings arisen\u2014and the docket shows that they did not\u2014the court would have had opportunity to appoint counsel for Husband if he could not provide his own. To date, however, the threat of incarceration dwells only in Husband\u2019s imagination. The right to counsel does not apply to a simple action for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Second, as for the court\u2019s alleged refusal to recognize counsel\u2019s appearance, our examination of the transcript shows that it simply did not occur. The transcript does not show that the court tried to prevent attorney Segal from entering an appearance in this matter. It does not show that the court \u201cassumed and concluded\u201d anything beyond that which Segal actually said. Neither does it show that the court summarily denied a continuance; in fact, none was requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Instead, Segal\u2014who acknowledged freely that he had been retained primarily for employment matters\u2014voluntarily declined to enter an appearance. He did so because he had been unable to prepare for trial, after he learned that the court would likely deny any continuance he might request. The transcript reveals that Segal was unable to prepare because Husband did not communicate his requirements for representation in a timely fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">SEGAL: I am here in a rather strange position in that Dr. Das ... had hired me to handle some other matters pertaining to employment. That was back in March.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-9\">We did talk about the fact that there were marital difficulties, but he had indicated to me at that time that things had proceeded smoothly, and nothing was needed of me at that time____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>I did not hear from Dr. Das for another month. At that time it was again with regard solely to employment matters. I then heard sometime later that Dr. Das was in Japan. <em>And yesterday afternoon I received a fax\u2014in the mid-afternoon I received a fax ostensibly from, Dr. Das in India asking that I represent him as\u2014to review the </em>file____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">I attempted to contact other attorneys who were listed on the fax, and each one advised me that or the one that I had spoken to said that he had had contact with Dr. Das, but that he had not entered his appearance in this matter____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\"><em>I am reluctant </em>... <em>to formally enter my appearance </em>because, as I mentioned to Judge Turner earlier today, in for a dime, in for a dollar, and unfortunately, <em>I do not feel that I would be capable of properly defending Dr. Das in this matter.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\"><em>I have not seen the file. ... </em>[T]he file was in Judge Turner\u2019s chambers, which was locked---- [Y]esterday afternoon I found out a default was entered, and then speaking with plaintiffs counsel, I found out a few more facts, but <em>I really do not have everything at hand.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-9\">And again, Your Honor, <em>if I enter my appearance, it would be to ask this Court to continue the matter. </em>I realize that puts me in an awkward position and perhaps it puts the Court in an awkward position, but I did want to make it know [sic] that I am here for Dr. Das, but have not yet entered my appearance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-10\">THE COURT: Okay, sir. Thank you. Mr. Segal, based on what you have represented on the record, it would appear to me that you have fulfilled any obligation you had to Dr. Das.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-11\">And you certainly have fulfilled your obligation professionally to the system and to the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-12\">And <em>if you were to enter your appearance </em>and to request a continuance, the request for continuance would be denied, and that is pretty typical in our process today. Under the best of circumstances, cases are not continued, but in this case a default was entered against the plaintiff, Dr. Das, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>this Court on June 30,1999, because he had not participated in or answered an amended complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">And certainly your dealings with him as you have represented indicate clearly that he did not keep you informed and did not give you all the information you, as a professional, would need to know to represent a client. So you are excused, and I appreciate what you have represented on the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">As for a request for continuance from Husband\u2019s father, the transcript shows that none was made. Instead, the court denied the elder Das the right to represent his son because he was not an attorney. The father served only as a witness who addressed Husband\u2019s whereabouts.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Even if Segal or Badri Das had requested a continuance, and the court had summarily denied it, such denial would have been proper. \u201c[W]hether to grant a continuance is in the sound discretion of the trial court, and unless [the court] acts arbitrarily in the exercise of that discretion, his action will not be reviewed on appeal.\u201d <em>Thanos v. Mitchell, </em>220 Md. 389, 392, 152 A.2d 833 (1959); <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 2-508(a) (\u201cOn motion of any party or on its own initiative, the court may continue a trial or other proceeding as justice may require.\u201d). \u201cUnder Rule 2-508, the trial court has wide latitude in determining whether to grant a continuance.\u201d <em>Shpak v. Schertle, </em>97 Md.App. 207, 225, 629 A.2d 763 (1993). Reversal on appeal thus occurs only in \u201cexceptional instances where there was prejudicial error.\u201d <em>Thanos, </em>220 Md. at 392, 152 A.2d 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The case <em>sub judice </em>is not one of those exceptional instances. Husband was already in default. He had not taken timely steps to vacate the Order of Default. As the court indicated, Segal\u2019s attendance and remarks gave the court no basis sufficient for staying the course of events already proceeding in orderly fashion. Indeed, Segal\u2019s personal account of Husband\u2019s case management brought to light again the extent of Husband\u2019s nonfeasance, providing additional justification for the Order of Default. Our reading of <em>Abrams v. Gay Investment Co., </em>253 Md. 121, 251 A.2d 876 (1969), even though it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>not precisely on point, reinforces our view that Husband\u2019s request for continuance, even if made, would lack the gravity to merit appellate review. In <em>Abrams, </em>the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of a tidal court not to set aside default judgment in an action during which appellant had sought a continuance. Appellant had dismissed her counsel, and she subsequently failed to follow the proper procedure in requesting a continuance from the court, even though court personnel advised her of that procedure. <em>Id. </em>at 123-24, 251 A.2d 876. Likewise, at the August 11 hearing, neither Segal nor Badri Das made a proper motion for continuance pursuant to Rule 2-508(a). If they had, the court would not have abused its broad discretion by denying such motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The Divorce</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Finally, Husband asks if the trial court erred or abused its discretion in granting Wife an absolute divorce. He argues that the facts alleged by Wife at the August 11 hearing do not support grounds for divorce based on either cruelty or excessively vicious conduct because they lack sufficient specificity and fail to reach the level of egregiousness described in some of our older cases. He also claims that Wife\u2019s testimony was uncorroborated. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Whether the events that bring a divorce complainant to court constitute cruelty or excessively vicious conduct has never been the stuff of which bright line rules are made, and even now our standards are shifting. Only recently, in 1998, did the legislature make cruelty and excessively vicious conduct grounds for absolute divorce in Maryland. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 7-103(a)(7) &amp; (8) of the Family Law Article (codifying 1998 Md. Laws 349 &amp; 350). Before that time, cruelty of treatment gave grounds for limited divorce only, a rule that originated in English ecclesiastical courts. Because divorce itself was disfavored by the church, the rule existed only to protect the victim-party from further and more serious physical harm. \u201cThe cruelty which entitles the injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>party to a divorce ... consists in that sort of conduct which endangers the life or health of the complainant, and renders cohabitation unsafe.\u201d <em>Harris v. Harris, </em>161 Eng. Rep. 697 (1813). Maryland adopted this English rule, as the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Scheinin v. Scheinin, </em>200 Md. 282, 288, 89 A.2d 609 (1952) (\u201cIn 1851 Chancellor Johnson announced in the High Court of Chancery that the words \u2018cruelty of treatment\u2019 as contained in the Maryland divorce statute would be given the same interpretation as given to them by the English Ecclesiastical Courts.\u201d) (citations omitted). The English rule, as articulated in <em>Scheinin </em>and older eases, was for many years our gold standard, setting the parameters for what constituted cruelty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">Ordinarily a single act of violence slight in character does not constitute cruelty of treatment as a cause for divorce. But it is now accepted in Maryland, as well as generally throughout the country, that a single act may be sufficient to constitute the basis for a divorce on the ground of cruelty, if it indicates an intention to do serious bodily harm or is of such a character as to threaten serious danger in the future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 288-89,89 A2d 609 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">The Court in <em>Scheinin, </em>however, went on to point out that the original definition of \u201ccruelty\u201d had grown more broad, to encompass mental as well as physical abuse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">It is now accepted that cruelty as a cause for divorce includes any conduct on the part of the husband or wife which is calculated to seriously impair the health or permanently destroy the happiness of the other. Thus any misconduct of a husband that endangers, or creates a reasonable apprehension that it will endanger, the wife\u2019s safety or health to a degree rendering it physically or mentally impracticable for her to properly discharge the marital duties constitutes cruelty within the meaning of the divorce statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 289-90, 89 A.2d 609 (citations omitted). Even under this more modem definition, the cases for limited divorce on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>grounds of cruelty and excessively vicious conduct\u2014there are no reported cases for absolute divorce on these grounds\u2014 show remarkable tolerance for abusive behavior. \u201c[A] divorce cannot be granted on the ground of cruelty of treatment merely because the parties have lived together unhappily as a result of unruly tempers and marital wranglings____ Marital neglect, rudeness of manner, and the use of profane and abusive language do not constitute cruelty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288, 89 A.2d 609 (citations omitted); <em>see also Harrison v. Harrison, </em>223 Md. 422, 426, 164 A.2d 901 (1960) (where husband struck wife and gave her a black eye, a \u201csingle act of violence complained of by appellee does not measure up to what the law of this State requires for a showing of cruelty ... [or justify] the wife\u2019s living apart from her husband\u201d); <em>Bonwit v. Bonwit, </em>169 Md. 189, 193, 181 A. 237 (1935) (husband\u2019s \u201cviolent outbursts of temper, accompanied in some instances by ... slapping\u201d wife did not constitute cruelty); <em>McKane v. McKane, </em>152 Md. 515, 519-20, 137 A. 288 (1927) (husband\u2019s \u201cspells,\u201d caused by drinking, during which he called wife vile names, implied unchastity on her part, cursed her, pouted, and refused to eat did not constitute cruelty); <em>Short v. Short, </em>151 Md. 444, 446, 135 A. 176 (1926) (\u201cMarital neglect, indifference, a failure to provide as freely as the wife may desire in dress or in conveniences, sallies of passion, harshness, rudeness, and the use of profane and abusive language towards her are not sufficient, if not in manner and degree endangering her personal security or health.\u201d) (eiting <em>Childs v. Childs, </em>49 Md. 509, 514 (1878)); <em>Neff v. Neff, </em>13 Md.App. 128, 132, 281 A.2d 556 (1971) (single incident of violence and continued verbal abuse insufficient grounds for divorce because \u201c[i]t does not appear from the evidence presented that appellant was in such fear for her health and safety\u201d); <em>Galvagna v. Galvagna, </em>10 Md. App. 697, 702, 272 A.2d 89 (1971) (where husband struck wife once, and used an open hand rather than his fist, there was insufficient evidence of cruelty). On the other hand, the Court of Appeals upheld a limited divorce on grounds of cruelty where it appeared that one party had been in significant peril, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number><em>e.g., </em>incidents of drunken rage and physical abuse that required the wife to seek police intervention and seek refuge with relatives. <em>See Hilbert v. Hilbert, </em>168 Md. 364, 370-75, 177 A. 914 (1935).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">In reviewing these oft-cited eases on cruelty and excessively vicious conduct, we note that most are quite old and give victims little relief from their aggressive partners by modem standards. In part, we believe, the courts\u2019 reluctance to grant relief stems from the fact that cruelty and excessively vicious conduct were grounds for limited and not for absolute divorce, and Maryland courts have historically disfavored divorce from bed and board. <em>See, e.g., Bonwit, </em>169 Md. at 194, 181 A. 237 (\u201c[T]he policy of the law of this state looks with disfavor upon divorces <em>a mensa et </em>thoro____ \u2018It is not the function of the courts ... to arbitrate family quarrels, but to determine upon the evidence whether either of the parties has been guilty of such conduct as would make a continuance of the marital relation inconsistent with the health, self-respect, and reasonable comfort of the other.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Singewald v. Singewald, </em>165 Md. 136, 146, 166 A. 441 (1933)); <em>Porter v. Porter, </em>168 Md. 296, 305, 177 A. 464 (1935) (\u201c[T]he law of this state is not favorable to divorces <em>a mensa et thoro, </em>and they will not be granted except for grave and weighty causes, and even then the evidence must be clear and the corroboration satisfactory and in accordance with the law____ \u2018Parties to the marriage must realize that the relationship is seldom perfect, and that it is essential to the happiness and contentment of the parties, as well as for the benefit of society, that each tolerate inconveniences, annoyances, even hardships, and make sacrifices for the common welfare.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>McClees v. McClees, </em>160 Md. 115, 120, 152 A. 901 (1931)). Disapproval of limited divorce likely colored past analysis in the cases where cruelty or excessively vicious conduct was alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">In more recent years, however, a greater awareness and intolerance of domestic violence has shifted our public policy toward allowing the dissolution of marriages with a violence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>element.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In the courts, we have responded to this trend by permitting absolute divorce on grounds of constructive desertion, a doctrine far friendlier to victims of violence in terms of the quality of proof required to grant freedom from the shackles of an abusive spouse.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Likewise, the General Assembly responded in 1980 by enacting the domestic violence statute, Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl-Vol., 1999 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 4-501 through 4-516 of the Family Law Article, which grants Maryland courts the power to issue civil protective orders and offers various forms of relief to victims. In 1998, as part of its continuing modernization of our family law, the legislature acknowledged that persons subject to domestic abuse should be entitled to seek absolute divorce immediately without a waiting period prior to the filing of a complaint. It thus expanded the grounds for absolute divorce to include cruelty and excessively vicious conduct. John F. Fader II &amp; Richard J. Gilbert, <em>Maryland Family Law </em>\u00a7 3-2(a) (2d ed. 1999 Cum.Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>In the courts, we are now left holding a stack of cases\u2014all \u201cgood law\u201d\u2014dating from the 1920\u2019s that no longer square with our modem understanding of appropriate family interaction. Verbal and physical abuse may have been tolerated in another era, and our predecessors at bar may have placed the continuity of the marital bond above the well-being of individual participants, but our values are different today. Indeed, in the 1999 supplement to their classic treatise on Maryland Family Law, authors John F. Fader II and Richard J. Gilbert correctly opine that we \u201care probably going to have a difficult time reconciling the statutory mandate to give relief to the abused individual with some of the case decisions of the past.\u201d <em>See </em>Fader <em>&amp; </em>Gilbert, <em>supra \u00a7 </em>3-2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Against this background, we turn to the instant case. Husband claims that his conduct toward Wife never \u201cendangered her life, person, or health, or would have otherwise caused her to feel apprehension of bodily suffering,\u201d and, to be sure, during her brief time on the witness stand on August 11, Wife did not account for the particulars of specific violent incidents. Nevertheless, from Wife\u2019s direct testimony and in the pleadings, the court below learned that the history of violence between Husband and Wife justified entry of a one-year protective order in January 1998, after a particularly violent incident that was \u201cone in several cases of domestic violence.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Wife went on to testify that the parties\u2019 marriage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>was an arranged marriage, which \u201cin our culture ... the way it is conducted is basically subservience.\u201d She spoke of ongoing cruelty, including \u201cmaking me stay up all night in order to listen to him, isolating me from my friends and from my family, and not allowing contact as much as possible____ [H]itting, pinching, pulling hair, etc.\u201d Wife testified in some detail how husband\u2019s controlling behavior harmed her previously close relationship with her family.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> She told the court how she has continuing health problems, including cardiac arrhythmia brought on by the \u201cstress of the marriage and the tensions at home.\u201d Wife also spoke with fear of Husband\u2019s taunting questions about what she might do when the protective order expired. Although Wife\u2019s testimony did not track Husband\u2019s mistreatment of her in minute detail, it is clear from that testimony and the very existence of a protective order that Husband\u2019s conduct far exceeded mere \u201csallies of passion, harshness, [and] rudeness,\u201d <em>Short, </em>151 Md. at 446, 135 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>A. 176, and in fact threatened Wife\u2019s physical and emotional well-being. \u201c[W]here violence has been inflicted and threats have been made,\u201d as in the instant case, \u201ca Court of Equity should not hesitate to grant relief, especially where the facts indicate a probability that violence might be repeated.\u201d <em>Timanus v.

Patterson, </em>125 Md. 695, 96 A. 398 (1915)).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Husband also claims that Wife\u2019s testimony was largely uncorroborated. If true, Husband\u2019s assertion would be fatal to the final judgment, for \u201c[a] court may not enter a decree of divorce on the uncorroborated testimony of the party who is seeking the divorce.\u201d Md.Code (1984, 1999 RepLVol.), \u00a7 7-101(b) of the Family Law Article; <em>see also Dicus v. Dicus, </em>131 Md. 87, 88, 101 A. 697 (1917) (corroboration required for charges of cruelty). We require corroboration to prevent collusion. <em>Heinmuller v.

The corroboration required varies with the circumstances of each case; as the likelihood of collusion decreases, so does the degree of corroboration needed. For this reason, if the case precludes the possibility of collusion, only slight corroboration is required. <em>Heinmuller, </em>133 Md. at 495, 105 A. 745; <em>Timanus, </em>177 Md. at 687, 10 A.2d 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Here, despite the quality of proof needed to prove cruelty and excessively vicious behavior, Wife needed only slight corroboration for her testimony, for there was almost no likelihood of collusion. The problems between the parties had long been known to the courts. Domestic violence proceedings had taken place the prior year, culminating in the entry of a one-year protective order. CINA proceedings against Husband were ongoing, because he had allowed Radha to skip school. Husband had fled the jurisdiction of the court, taking Radha with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Wife\u2019s brother, Arjun Duggal, corroborated her testimony and, in our view, his testimony was sufficient to establish Wife\u2019s entitlement to an absolute divorce. Duggal told the court that Wife had sought refuge in his home in January 1998 after Husband assaulted her. He further testified that he had \u201cobserved a pattern of stress, tension in her life since 1986,\u201d when he first immigrated to the United States. He also addressed Husband\u2019s efforts to isolate Wife from her family,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> corroborating his sister\u2019s testimony in that regard. Duggal\u2019s testimony tracked with all major tenets of Wife\u2019s testimony, empowering the trial judge to find that Wife told the truth.

Painter, </em>113 Md.App. 504, 529, 688 A.2d 479 (1997) (\"Due to the seriousness of the problem of domestic violence in our society and the extreme example of domestic violence contained in this case, we commit this case to the reporter in order that the facts contained herein' may be preserved as examples of the seriousness of this, all too frequent, recurring problem and to again emphasize that a woman is not required to be a homicide victim in order to establish the elements of constructive desertion.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b59-6\">. Wife testified that she filed for the order</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">because my husband assaulted me on the night of January the 5 th, and as a result, the police came to the house. And at that point, the officer taking the report advised me as to how I could proceed because he could see that the situation was not good, and I had been hit, and he advised me how to go to District Court or Circuit Court in order to get an ex parte order which was then subsequently followed by a protective order for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">We note that Husband is highly critical of Wife\u2019s account of this event, because Wife \"never testified [he] actually struck her.... [Wife\u2019s] testimony about what the officer saw is hearsay ... [and t]he record gives absolutely no indication of where said incident allegedly occurred .... where on her body she was allegedly struck ... [and] whether [Husband] allegedly used a hand, foot, or anything else.\u201d Husband\u2019s contentions defy reason. For the District Court to have granted a one-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>year protective order\u2014which, we note, is the m\u00e1ximum duration for an initial order, <em>see </em>Md.Code (1984, 1999 Repl.Vol., 1999 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 4\u2014506(b)(2)(iii) of the Family Law Article\u2014it must have found by clear and convincing evidence that abuse occurred or Husband must have consented to its entry, \u00a7 5-506(c)(l)(ii), as he did here. By giving such consent, Husband as much as admitted that marital violence occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b60-8\">. Wife testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">And my parents also took care of my children for several years while my husband went to school and I worked full-time. And at that time my relationship with my family got strained. Because of the stresses in the marriage, I could not relate to them properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">I would drop the children off there in the morning, and then all I had to do was pick them up in the afternoon and come right back because I was not allowed to stay, and I was fearful of staying.</p>\n<p id=\"AxO\">Q: Why were you afraid to stay?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-11\">A: Because I was made to account for my time, and there was a point where I was made to account for my time for a whole week in half-an-hour increments. And that became very difficult because when you have two small toddlers and you\u2019re working, it becomes very hard to account for time like that.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">And basically it becomes a form of cruelty, a form of bullying, a form of intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-13\">Q: Did you tell your family about this?</p>\n<p id=\"b60-14\">A: I did not tell them anything for several years, but I think it was quite evident to them that I was under a lot of stress and tension....</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b62-8\">. Duggal testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">On the occasions that we did have to meet my sister, she was always very tense when she came to pick up the kids. I was in the house also, and she was always in a hurry to get back just based on the fact that he would question her on every second that she spent. He tried to keep her away from her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">He also had\u2014I\u2019ve overheard telephone conversations that he had with her in which they argued and\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">Q: Did he make threats in those conversations?</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">A: He made threats of divorce and then turned around and called my mom and told her that my sister was asking for the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"AW\">Q: And in your culture, what does a threat of a divorce mean from a man?</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">A: It is a very serious, very serious matter, and it\u2019s not to be taken lightly.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
