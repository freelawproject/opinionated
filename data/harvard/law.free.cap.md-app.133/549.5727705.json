Montgomery Co. Personnel Bd., </em>37 Md.App. 48, 375 A.2d 1149 (1977), \u201cthe injury in this case is without [the] remedy [that appellees have sought].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 375 A.2d 1149. Appellees argue that we should affirm the circuit court because (1) the Personnel Board of Prince George\u2019s County has declared that it does have the authority to order back pay and promotions, and (2) in <em>Montgomery County v. Anastasi, </em>77 Md.App. 126, 549 A.2d 753 (1988), this Court \u201cordered the Personnel Board [of Montgomery County] to grant back pay and promotions where consistent with its own regulations.\u201d Although we agree with the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the promotional process was indeed flawed and should have been \u201credone,\u201d for the reasons that follow, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">In 1995, appellees (and 13 other police officers) filed grievances with the Prince George\u2019s County Personnel Board. That agency\u2019s March 24, 1997 DECISION AND ORDER included the following statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>In each instance, the [appellees] claimed that the promotion process administered by the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department in the Spring of 1994, was fraught with improprieties, violations.of laws and procedural flaws which compromised the integrity of the entire examination. They claim that these improprieties denied them the opportunity to compete fairly for promotion. As remedy, they ask for retroactive promotions with back pay and the award of attorney fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">The consolidated cases were assigned to a Hearing Examiner on October 23, 1995 in accordance with the provisions of Section 16-203(a)9(C) of the Personnel Law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">... the Hearing Examiner\u2019s opinion and conclusion section clearly show that he finds the [appellees\u2019] initial grievance claims meritorious. This Board fully concurs with the finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">Accordingly, in view of the foregoing, this Board finds that the manner in which the 1994 Police Promotion Examination was administered was inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-10\">Having found the promotion process to be flawed, we now turn to the question of remedy. The Hearing Examiner properly pointed out that this Board has no authority to award the remedy being sought by the [appellees].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\">Here, the [appellees] have clearly cited several instances of poor judgment on the part of the Appointing Authority which cast a shadow on the integrity of the process. They failed to show, however, a nexus between their own promotability and the errors in the judgment of the Appointing Authority to the point whereby they could be characterized as a substantial factor in the [appellees] not being promoted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Whether or not <em>Reiner [Reiner v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an unreported opinion by the Honorable June L. Green of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, filed in Civil Action # 78-0616 on April 30,1979] is operative here has no substantive impact on the Board\u2019s ultimate decision in this case. The Board finds that the Appointing Authority committed several errors in judgment in the administration of the 1994 promotion process, but there is nothing in the record to support a finding that these judgmental errors were substantial enough to adversely effect [sic] the promotability of the [appellees]. The [appellees] have not met their burden of proof in this regard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Appellees petitioned for judicial review of that decision. The circuit court\u2019s OPINION AND ORDER included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">This Court finds that the promotional process was flawed, as found by the Police Department\u2019s own consultant. The decision of the Personnel Board that the flaw was not a substantial factor in the failure to promote the [appellees], however, was a clear abuse of discretion and in error, and the Court hereby finds that the flaw was a substantial factor in the failure to promote the [appellees]. The Court also finds that the Police Department is unable to show that the [appellees] would not have been promoted even if the flaw had been corrected, and therefore, this Court enters the following order:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>It is this 19th day of <em>October, </em>1999 by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\">ORDERED, that the decision of the Personnel Board be, and hereby is, REVERSED AND REMANDED for appropriate action, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0q\">ORDERED, that the [appellees] be, and hereby are, awarded the costs of this action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">This appeal followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">Appellees\u2019 position is best summarized by the following argument presented to the circuit court during the hearing on appellees\u2019 petition for judicial review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">[APPELLEES\u2019 COUNSEL] Your Honor, it\u2019s our contention, quite simply, that there were substantial flaws in the promotional process identified by their validator, Dr. Harver, accepted by their chief of police, Chief Mitchell at the time, that those errors, those flaws were a substantial factor in the failure of the four to be promoted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">Therefore, as the agency cannot prove that they would not have been promoted even if this error had not been made\u2014in other words, they can\u2019t prove what would happen if the oral board would have been readministered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-11\">We don\u2019t know what the scores would have been, we don\u2019t know where these gentlemen would have ranked, and so we don\u2019t know if they would have been promoted had their test been readministered. But we do know that their failure to .be promoted was caused in part, a substantial factor of the failure was that failure to readminister the exam.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-12\">So the relief we would be requesting of the court is that each of the grievants be ordered to be promoted to the rank of sergeant effective February of 1996, which was when they completed the promotions for [sic] based upon the 1994 sergeant\u2019s exam, that they be awarded back pay for that period from that date for\u2014to either to the present or to when they, in fact, were promoted as sergeant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>In <em>Andre, supra, </em>this Court held that (1) \u201cthe Board erred in concluding that the appellants\u2019 \u2018rights\u2019 were not violated,\u201d but (2) because the relief requested by appellants was an award of money damages from the county, \u201cthe injury in this case is without remedy.\u201d Chief Judge Gilbert explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXT\">The potential for promotion is what was wronged, not a right to promotion. The appellants\u2019 actual promotions are at best tenuous because, as we have seen, there were other applicants for the same positions, and those applicants also had their potential for appointment or promotion eradicated by the action of the Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">The relief sought from the Board, by the appellants, was not in the best interest of the County service. Patently the Board could not order the promotion of the appellants over the other persons who were on the eligible lists. It could not create a similar promotion for each person in the eligible list. The persons appointed to the vacancies were seemingly eligible therefor and, in any event, were not parties to the proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">37 Md.App. at 62-63, 375 A.2d 1149. Chief Judge Gilbert\u2019s analysis is equally applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">According to appellees, <em>Andre </em>has been overruled by <em>Anastasi </em>There is simply no merit in that argument. In <em>Anastasi, </em>after concluding that the Board erred in upholding a promotion process that violated both the letter and the spirit of the county\u2019s Charter and Code, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">Fashioning the appropriate remedy in this case is a difficult task. This Court faced a similar situation in <em>Andre v. Montgomery County Personnel Board, </em>37 Md.App. 48, 375 A.2d 1149 (1977) where the Montgomery County Personnel Board found the complainants to have been wronged by the hiring practices of the county\u2019s Department of Recreation. The Board in <em>Andre </em>ordered the Department to institute remedial procedures but declined the complainant\u2019s requests for back pay and retroactive appointments ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>... Whether appellees here should receive some redress from the County, in the nature of back pay, promotion when openings occur or both, or something other than either of these, we are not in a position to say.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">77 Md.App. at 139, 549 A.2d 753. <em>Anastasi </em>did not overrule <em>Andre </em>and does not support appellees\u2019 contention that they are entitled to retroactive promotion and back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">We quote with approval the following comments made by the circuit court during the hearing that preceded the ruling at issue in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">THE COURT: Why is it that\u2014what I don\u2019t understand is since the person who developed the system said that this part of the promotions system is invalid, fatally flawed, and should therefore be redone, and that\u2019s the system upon which you base your promotions, why would you refuse to redo it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">* # *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">THE COURT: So how can you then base your promotions on something that is flawed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, it was flawed because of the resulting\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-12\">THE COURT: We don\u2019t really care why. It\u2019s flawed, so why not redo it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-14\">THE COURT: ... you send them through a promotion procedure, we find out it\u2019s flawed, the chief says redo it, and I know the chief said later on okay, you didn\u2019t redo it, all right, we won\u2019t do it, but he said redo it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-15\">That was his first decision, and his first decision was right because statistically we know it was flawed, and that\u2019s how we test these things. That\u2019s how it\u2019s done, and then we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>ignore the statistics when the guy who designed it said it\u2019s wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\">I think that\u2019s wrong. I think we\u2019re treating these people inequitably. Yeah, we want them to go right back out there and be subjected to the hazards of the job. I think that\u2019s wrong, sir. I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">I think it is flat out wrong. It\u2019s not fair. It just isn\u2019t fair, and I just hate to see bureaucracies just decide well, it came out this way. We\u2019ll fix it next time around, but these guys, they\u2019ll just have to suffer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">I don\u2019t look at it that way. That\u2019s not right. If it\u2019s inconvenient to do it over again, so it\u2019s inconvenient. But when you\u2019re dealing with people\u2019s careers you subject yourself to the inconvenience. You have to be fair to people, and we\u2019re not being fair in this thing, sir. I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019re not being fair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">We again emphasize our agreement with the circuit court\u2019s factual finding that appellees were not treated fairly by the Police Department. Like all other police officers who are potential victims of a promotional process proven to be flawed, appellees were entitled to a ruling by the Personnel Board\u2014or by the circuit court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the event that the Personnel Board failed or refused to take appropriate action\u2014that would (1) require that the promotional process be corrected so that no candidate for promotion would have an unfair advantage over any other candidate, and (2) prohibit the appointing authority from promoting (appellees or) any (other) candidate until a fair promotional process has been conducted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>sons stated in <em>Andre, </em>however, we cannot affirm the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that appellees were entitled to promotion and back pay. <em>That </em>is why we must reverse the judgment and remand for entry of an order affirming the decision of the Personnel Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">As we did in <em>Andre, supra, </em>37 Md.App. at 48, 375 A.2d 1149, we shall make an exception to the general rule that costs be assessed against the losing party. We are persuaded that \u201cthe County\u2019s neglect, in supervising its personnel so as to avoid the type of inadvisable [promotional] practices utilized in this case, requires that it shoulder the costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT AFFIRMING THE DECISION OF THE PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY PERSONNEL BOARD; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-7\">. <em>Reiner </em>involved a \"retroactive promotion\u201d claim asserted by a federal employee who had been an unsuccessful candidate for promotion in a promotional process that was flawed by administrative error. According to Judge Green, once the employee proved (1) the process was flawed by administrative error, and (2) the error was a \u201csubstantial factor in [the employee\u2019s] failure to be promoted,\u201d the employee was entitled to a retroactive promotion unless the agency proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee would not have been promoted even if no error had occurred. In light of our conclusion that appellees are not entitled to promotion and back pay, whether the Board correctly applied <em>Reiner's </em>\"burden shifting\u201d rule is of no consequence to the outcome of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b579-8\">.
