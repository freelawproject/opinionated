Logan, <em>Liberty Interests in the Preventive State: Procedural Due Process and Sex Offender Community Notification Laws, </em>89 J.Crim.L. <em>&amp; </em>Criminology 1167, 1167 (1999) (footnotes omitted). Thus, we have the backdrop for this appeal, wherein a Maryland appellate court, for the first time, reviews a determination of a \u201csexually violent predator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AEG\">Appellant, Garnell Graves, was charged with child abuse, second degree rape, and third degree sexual offense. Before the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (Mason, J.), he entered an <em>Alford</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>plea to the charge of third degree sexual offense. Appellant was sentenced to ten-years incarceration with all but seven years suspended. Appellant was granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">On appeal, appellant presents two questions, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">1. Did the court violate due process of law in considering certain matters at sentencing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">2. Did the court err in determining that appellant was a sexually violent predator?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">When appellant\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea was accepted, the State\u2019s Attorney proffered that the evidence presented at trial would have demonstrated that from January 1, 1997, through December 31, 1997, there were several instances when appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>touched Brittany R., an eight-year-old girl, with his penis in her vaginal and buttocks areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the State\u2019s Attorney first established that in 1992, in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, appellant was convicted of indecent acts with a minor child. The State\u2019s Attorney also presented a copy of the applicable statute to the sentencing court. The State\u2019s Attorney then commented that \u201caccording to the reporting person, the complainant\u2019s father approached the complainant who was his ten year old natural daughter at night while\u2014.\u201d Defense counsel objected and argued that the report from which the State\u2019s Attorney was reading included charges for which appellant had not been tried or convicted, but that the State\u2019s Attorney wanted the court to believe that the allegations were true. Counsel further stated that the State was \u201cunfairly shedding an unfair light on my client to bring up previous allegations.\u201d After further discussions, the court stated, \u201cAll right, counsel, I think I will be able to separate out [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The State\u2019s Attorney then informed the court that the report from the prior case indicated that the complainant was appellant\u2019s ten-year-old daughter, that he had sex with her, and that appellant held his hand over her mouth so that no one would hear her cry out. The abuse was discovered when the child began wetting the bed. A physician examined the child and found signs of sexual abuse. The child told the physician that her father had been placing his penis in her vagina while the grandmother was asleep in the next room.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In the prior case, a motion for reconsideration was filed. Attached to the motion was a letter from appellant in which he wrote: \u201cI am regretting what I did, Your Honor, and will be regretting it for the rest of my life. I feel a great deal of sorrow towards myself for what I have put my child and her mother through.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The State\u2019s Attorney also proffered that a psycho-sexual examination had been performed on appellant in connection with the prior case. The State\u2019s Attorney stated that appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>lant had informed the consulting social worker \u201cthat he thinks he became sexually involved with his daughter as a way of getting closer, that is expressing love. The statement indicates confusion with love, affection, and sex.\u201d Appellant had denied having intercourse with his daughter, but when questioned directly, stated, \u201cI am so against it and I don\u2019t know why I did it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The State\u2019s Attorney further commented that in the prior case, it was recommended that appellant enter an intensive, community based sexual offender treatment program under the direct care of a psychiatrist, and appellant was not permitted to align himself with any woman with minor children without the prior approval of his therapist and the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The State\u2019s Attorney suggested that the circumstances of the present case and the prior case were similar, <em>Le., </em>that a decision was made \u201cto drop the charges down to spare the child\u201d the trauma of testifying in court. The State\u2019s Attorney then stated, \u201cI think that it is very important for the Court to take into consideration and to give extra weight to his prior criminal convictions.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Following further argument from defense counsel, the State\u2019s Attorney, and allocution from appellant, the court imposed sentence, stating in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-8\">Mr. Graves I don\u2019t think there is anything that society rejects more than people who pr[e]y on children. You know that, I believe, even in prison. People who pr[e]y on children have a very low place in esteem of the other prisoners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-9\">It\u2019s\u2014this is the second time that you have been before a Court for this offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">One of the things that I think that causes besides just the very nature of the act itself is we don\u2019t know what to do with sex offenders, predators who pr[e]y on small children. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>We have had very little success with counseling and treatment. They tend to repeat it and repeat it and repeat it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">And if anything, you are just living proof of that, because here after serving time in Lorton and getting counseling, you are back before the Court again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">And even in the presentence report, they talk about the likelihood that counseling is going to help you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">In imposing the sentence, I haven\u2019t [sic] sentenced you beyond what the guidelines recommend, and I have written in the following reasons for that. Lack of remorse, and that\u2019s explained by your maintaining of your innocence, repeat of similar offense, and little likely or strong likelihood of repeated offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">A. Propriety of Considerations at Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">On appeal, appellant claims that the court violated due process in sentencing him as it relied on information only identified as coming from the investigation in the prior case. He alleges that there was no indication that those allegations and reports were reliable. Appellant contends that the court\u2019s comments at sentencing indicate that it took these unsubstantiated allegations into consideration when it imposed sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">The State argues that this question is not properly preserved as appellant failed to argue below that the information was unreliable. We disagree. Defense counsel\u2019s argument that the state was attempting to have the court accept the allegations as true was sufficient to preserve this question. In any event, appellant\u2019s claim is without merit. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">Pursuant to Article 27, \u00a7 792(b) of the Maryland Code, the procedures for determining whether an individual can be classified as a \u201csexually violent predator\u201d are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-14\"><em>Determination; </em>procedure.\u2014(1) Subject to paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection, if a person is convicted of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>second or subsequent sexually violent offense, the State\u2019s Attorney may request the court to determine before sentencing whether the person is a sexually violent predator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-5\">\u2022 (2) If the State\u2019s Attorney makes a request under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court shall determine before or at sentencing whether the person is a sexually violent predator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-6\">(3) In making a determination under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court shall consider:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-7\">(i) Any evidence that the court considers appropriate to the determination of whether the individual is a sexually violent predator, including the presenteneing investigation and sexually violent offender\u2019s inmate record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\">(ii) Any evidence introduced by the person convicted; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">(in) At the request of the State\u2019s Attorney, any evidence presented by a victim of the sexually violent offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">\u201cIn Maryland, a judge is vested with \u201cvirtually boundless discretion\u2019 in deciding what factors to consider on the issue of punishment.\u201d <em>Harrod v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 128, 140, 499 A.2d 959 (1985) (quoting <em>Logan v. State, </em>289 Md. 460, 480, 425 A.2d 632 (1981)). \u201c[T]he primary objectives of sentencing are punishment, deterrence, and rehabilitation.\u201d <em>Jennings v. State, </em>339 Md. 675, 682, 664 A.2d 903 (1995). \u201cBecause the task of a court, \u201cwithin fixed statutory or constitutional limits is to determine the type and extent of punishment after the issue of guilt has been determined,\u2019 trial courts are given very broad latitude in the kinds of information they may consider in pursuing those goals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 683, 664 A.2d 903 (quoting <em>Williams v. New York, </em>337 U.S. 241, 247, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949)). The sentencing court may properly consider uncharged or untried offenses, <em>Smith v. State, </em>308 Md. 162, 172-75, 517 A.2d 1081 (1986), \u201creliable evidence of conduct which may be opprobrious although not criminal, as well as details and circumstances of criminal conduct for which the person has not been tried,\u201d <em>Logan v. State, </em>289 Md. 460, 481, 425 A.2d 632 (1981) (quoting <em>Henry v. State, </em>273 Md. 131, 147-48, 328 A.2d 293 (1974)), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u201ca defendant\u2019s prospects for rehabilitation, the defendant\u2019s lack of remorse,\u201d <em>Jennings, </em>339 Md. at 688, 664 A.2d 903, and \u201cthe convicted person\u2019s reputation, ... health habits, mental and moral propensities, [and] social background,\u201d <em>Baker v. State, </em>3 Md.App. 251, 257, 238 A.2d 561 (1968). In addition, it is \u201cperfectly acceptable\u201d for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">the trial court to base its sentence on \u201cperceptions ... derived from the evidence presented at trial, the demeanor and veracity of the defendant gleaned from his various court appearances, as well as the data acquired from such other sources as the presentenee investigation or any personal knowledge the judge may have gained from living in the same community as the offender[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-6\"><em>Jennings, </em>339 Md. at 684-85, 664 A.2d 903 (quoting <em>Johnson v. State, </em>274 Md. 536, 540, 336 A.2d 113 (1975)).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">In the present case, although the court heard argument from the State\u2019s Attorney regarding the report filed in the prior case, upon objection from defense counsel, the court stated that it would be able to separate out the information. The court was thoroughly qualified to perform such a function. <em>See, e.g., Graves v. State, </em>298 Md. 542, 546, 471 A.2d 701 (1984) (noting that a judge\u2019s legal training enables him or her to \u201cdistinguish the nuances of the law\u201d); <em>State v. Babb, </em>258 Md. 547, 549-52, 267 A.2d 190 (1970) (finding harmless error in admission of prior conviction evidence in a non-jury case where record revealed ample evidence of accused\u2019s guilt and trial court, by reason of its wisdom and experience, is expected to be beyond the influence of such evidence). Moreover, the comments by the court demonstrate that it imposed sentence based on appellant\u2019s lack of remorse, that he was a repeat offender, that he preyed upon children, and that there was a strong likelihood that he would again commit such an offense. There is no indication that the court considered any unreliable allegations when it imposed sentence. <em>See Bangs v. Bangs, </em>59 Md.App. 350, 370, 475 A.2d 1214 (1984) (\u201cA judge is presumed to know the law and to properly apply it. That presumption is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>not rebutted by mere silence.\u201d); <em>Hebb v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 493, 499, 356 A.2d 583 (1976) (\u201cJudges are presumed to know the law. Absent an indication to the contrary, we must presume that judges apply the law correctly to the case before them.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">It is implicit in the trial judge\u2019s remarks that he relied in part on the presentence investigation<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in complying with the procedural dictates of the subject statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">B. Determination of Sexually Violent Predator</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Pursuant to Art. 27, \u00a7 792(b)(4) of the Maryland Code,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the State filed a notice of intent to request the sentencing court to determine whether appellant is a sexually violent predator by virtue of his prior conviction. At the sentencing hearing, the court found appellant to be a sexually violent predator.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Appellant raises two challenges to the sentencing court\u2019s determination that he is a sexually violent predator. First, he alleges that the statute makes no provision for the consideration of an out-of-state conviction; therefore, his prior conviction under the laws of the District of Columbia could not be considered. Second, appellant contends that the court failed to make a determination that he was \u201cat risk of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense,\u201d as required under Art. 27, \u00a7 792(a)(ll)(ii) of the Maryland Code. Appellant contends that the simple fact of a prior conviction cannot substitute for such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u201cThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448 (1994). \u201cThe starting point in statutory interpretation is with an examination of the language of the statute. If the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994) (citations omitted). In addition, \u201ccourts must read all parts of a statute together, with a view toward harmonizing the various parts and avoiding both inconsistencies and senseless results that could not reasonably have been intended by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Barr v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 681, 687, 647 A.2d 1293 (1994). \u201c[Construction of a statute which is unreasonable, illogical, unjust, or inconsistent with common sense should be avoided.\u201d <em>D &amp; Y, Inc. v. Winston, </em>320 Md. 534, 538, 578 A.2d 1177 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">Because this is an issue of first impression in Maryland, we briefly examine the legislative framework of the sexual offender notification and registration laws. In 1994, the United States Congress enacted the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Program (the Act). <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14071 (1994). This Act established guidelines for sexual offender registration and notification for sexually violent predators and individuals who have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>convicted of either a sexually violent offense or a criminal offense against a minor. <em>See id.; see also </em>Caroline Louise Lewis, <em>The Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act: An Unconstitutional Deprivation of the Right to Privacy and Substantive Due Process, </em>31 Harv.L.Rev. 89, 94-95 (1996) (discussing the history and structure of the Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Federal law specifies heightened requirements for offenders deemed \u201csexually violent predators.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14071(a)(1)(B),(a)(2). A \u201csexual predator\u201d is \u201ca person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in predatory sexually violent offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 14071(a)(3)(C). Unlike all other potential registrants, federal law makes such offenders alone subject to a judicial determination of their eligibility for registration and notification. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 14071(a)(2)(A). The determination is to be \u201cmade by a court after considering the recommendation of a board composed of experts in the behavior and treatment of sex offenders, victims\u2019 rights advocates, and representatives of law enforcement agencies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the offender is categorized a \u201csexually violent predator,\u201d the state must also obtain \u201cidentifying factors, anticipated future residence, offense history, and documentation of any treatment received for the mental abnormality or personality disorder of the person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 14071(b)(1)(B). \u201cPredators\u201d must also provide quarterly address verification, as opposed to the annual verification required of registrants more generally. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 14071(b)(3)(B). Finally, \u201cpredators\u201d are subject to mandatory lifetime registration. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 14071(b)(6)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">As part of the Act, Congress provided pecuniary incentives to the states to adopt laws providing for registration of sex offenders within three years of its enactment. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14071(f)(1) (Supp. Ill 1997). Consequently, all fifty-states have adopted some form of sexual offender registration and notification provision for sexually violent predators and indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>viduals who have been convicted of either a sexually violent offense or a criminal offense against a minor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Significantly, the Federal Guidelines defer to the states to formulate how and when such a determination will be sought as to a particular offender. <em>See </em>Final Guidelines for the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, as Amended, 64 Fed.Reg. 572, 583 (1999). Given the latitude afforded by Congress, the state enactments vary widely in methods of notification, procedures, and risk deter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>ruination. For a cogent discussion of the various state approaches, see Logan, <em>swpra, </em>at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Most states have a general sex offender registry, and notification applies uniformly to all sex offenders. Some states employ a tiered risk scaled which ranks offenders on the basis of recidivism risk and releases differing degrees of information based on the ranking.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Others states do not make a differentiation based on risk, but instead require offenders that satisfy statutory, offense-related criteria to be subject to registration and notification.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A third approach leaves the determination of which offenders should be subject to registration to the discretion of local law enforcement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">States also vary in the procedure for determining whether an offender is a sexually violent predator. In Maryland, the determination is made by the court on the request of the State\u2019s Attorney. <em>See </em>Md.Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 792(b). In other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>states, the determination of classification is made by: a special board, a judicial officer, a clinical professional, or a combination of these methods.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In terms of the quantum and type of evidence sufficient to establish that an offender is a sexually violent predator, each state varies. Some states have promulgated specific factors for consideration.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At least eighteen states require the diagnosis of an anti-social personality disorder or mental abnormality that makes the offender likely to commit another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>sexually violent crime in order to be labeled a \u201csexually violent predator,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> however, Maryland does not have this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Article 27, \u00a7 792(a)(ll) of the Maryland Code defines \u201csexually violent predator\u201d and states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">(11) \u201cSexually violent predator\u201d means a person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">(i) Is convicted of a second or subsequent sexually violent offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">(ii) Has been determined in accordance with this section to be at risk of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">A \u201csexually violent offense\u201d is defined in Article 27, \u00a7 792(a)(9) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">(i) A violation of any of the provisions of \u00a7 462, \u00a7 463, \u00a7 464, \u00a7 464A, \u00a7 464B, \u00a7 464F of this article; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">(ii) Assault with intent to commit rape in the first or second degree or a sexual offense in the first or second degree as previously proscribed under former \u00a7 12 of this article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-12\">Thus, a third degree sexual offense under Article 27, \u00a7 464B of the Maryland Code qualifies as a sexually violent offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">The definitions for \u201cchild sexual offender\u201d and \u201coffender\u201d include an individual who has been convicted in another state of an offense that, if committed in Maryland, would constitute one of the listed offenses. Md.Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 792(a)(2)(iv) &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>(a)(6)(x). In addition, a \u201csexually violent offender\u201d is defined as an individual who:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\">(i) has been convicted of a sexually violent offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">(ii) has been convicted of an attempt to commit a sexually violent offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">(iii) has been convicted in another state of an offense that, if committed in this State, would constitute a sexually violent offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Md.Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 792(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">A \u201csexually violent predator\u201d must register every 90 days until the person is determined not to be a sexually violent predator. Md.Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 792(h)(4). The individual may not file a petition seeking that determination for ten years. Md.Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 792(k). In contrast, a \u201cchild sexual offender,\u201d an \u201coffender,\u201d and a \u201csexually violent offender\u201d must register annually for ten years. Md.Code, Art. 27 \u00a7 792(h).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">With regard to appellant\u2019s first challenge to the sentencing court\u2019s determination, we conclude that out-of-state convictions may be considered in determining whether an individual is a sexually violent predator. As the offenses become more serious and the offenders repeat their behavior, the registration requirements become more onerous. An individual who has been convicted of a second or subsequent offense and is at risk of committing a subsequent sexually' violent offense is considered the most serious offender by the legislature, <em>i.e, </em>a sexually violent predator. Yet, it is only the subsection that addresses sexually violent predators that excludes the express statement that out-of-state convictions may be considered in the sentencing court\u2019s analysis. It is clear that the legislature intended a broad and sweeping registration of sexual offenders. In addition, a sexually violent predator is, in essence, a sexually violent offender who has committed a second sexually violent offense and who has been determined to be at risk of committing a subsequent sexually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>violent offense. Accordingly, we decline to read the statute as prohibiting a sentencing court from considering out-of-state convictions when it determines if an individual is a sexually violent predator. The sentencing court committed no error in relying on appellant\u2019s prior conviction in the District of Columbia in determining if he was a sexually violent predator.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We find appellant\u2019s second challenge to the sentencing court\u2019s determination\u2014that the court failed to determine that he was at risk of committing a subsequent sexually violent offense\u2014to be without merit. Indeed, the record belies appellant\u2019s contention. When imposing sentence, the court expressly stated that there has been little success with counseling and treatment of sexual offenders and that there was a strong likelihood that appellant would again be a repeat offender. Although these statements were not made precisely when the court determined that appellant was a sexually violent predator, the statements clearly reflect the court\u2019s determination that appellant would again commit a sexually violent offense. There was sufficient information in the presentence report in general and the investigator\u2019s comments specifically to support the trial judge\u2019s determination that the public would be at risk, i.e., that appellant might again commit a sexually violent offense. The court complied with the requirements of Article 27, \u00a7 792(a)(ll).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-12\">. <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-11\">. Appellant also had a prior conviction for attempted unauthorized use in 1986 and received probation before judgment for possession of PCP in 1988.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\">. The pre-sentence investigation provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">The Defendant appeared before the Court for an offense of an extremely serious nature involving the sexual abuse of a nine year old victim. It is well known that offenses of this nature can have severe, long term effects on victims and can [affect] their lives for years to come. Sadly, this is not the Defendant\u2019s first contact with the sexual abuse of young victims in the community, noting that he was convicted of a similar offense in the District of Columbia in 1992 and in fact served a period of incarceration from 1992 through his parole in 1996. Despite that experience with incarceration as well as the counseling he claims to have received during that time, the Defendant \u2022has returned to the community to once again victimize an innocent young child and in turn cause her years of psychological difficulties and anguish. It is additionally noted that Mr. Graves denies his behavior in this offense and, as a result, not even any remorse is forthcoming. Based on all information available to this Agent, a period of incarceration is recommended, although it is felt that any release to the community in the future should include participation in a sexual offender\u2019s program, it is noted that counseling in the past has failed to deter this individual\u2019s behavior and further programming in this regard may simply be an effort in futility and wasted resources. Consideration should be given to treatment at Patuxent Institution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b129-10\">.
