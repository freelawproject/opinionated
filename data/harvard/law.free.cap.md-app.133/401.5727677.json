Appellant timely noted her appeal and poses one question for our consideration, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">Was the evidence legally sufficient to terminate the parental rights of the natural mother?[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Jimetra was born in Baltimore on May 26,1994, to appellant and Jimmy D. Jimetra\u2019s father is not a party to this appeal, however. Appellant also has an older daughter, India. The record does not disclose India\u2019s date of birth or age, or whether Jimmy D. is her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">Several months before Jimetra\u2019s seeond birthday, on February 27,1996, appellant\u2019s mother (the \u201cGrandmother\u201d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> went to appellant\u2019s residence to visit and discovered that appellant had left Jimetra alone in the residence. Because the Grandmother heard Jimetra crying but could not gain access into the home, she contacted a Baltimore City police officer, who made a forced entry. The incident of suspected neglect was reported to the Department, and Jimetra was immediately placed in the care of her Grandmother, who had apparently cared for Jimetra previously, when appellant was incarcerated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, in 1991, appellant had voluntarily placed India in the care of the Grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>On February 28,1996, the Department filed a petition in the circuit court alleging that Jimetra was a \u201cchild in need of assistance\u201d (\u201cCINA\u201d), pursuant to Md.Code (1974, 1998 Rep. Vol., 1999 Supp.), \u00a7 3-801(e) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cC.J.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, the circuit court issued a shelter care order and the Department placed Jimetra in her Grandmother\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">An uncontested adjudicatory hearing was held on March 27, 1996, at which appellant, who was present and represented by counsel, entered into a stipulation with the Department. Although that stipulation is not included in the record, counsel for the Department addressed the terms of that stipulation at the October 1999 termination hearing, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">[Tjhat. the mother was in a\u2014was currently in a drug treatment program, that she had been attending since June of 1995, and that she was in that program four days a week to address substance abuse issues, and that at that time Mother indicated that she had been drug-free for 18 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">The stipulation also indicated that the daycare\u2014the drug treatment program prohibited the Mother from bringing her children to the drug treatment program with her and that on the occasion of February 27th, 1995, Mother did not have anyone to care for ... Jimetra____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-9\">The stipulation further indicates, Your Honor, that the Mother was currently on parole and that she was being closely supervised by her parole officer and that the, the Mother had been attending drug treatment regularly and undergoing random drug tests and that all those tests had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>been negative for illicit substances, that the father of the child did not participate in the child\u2019s care and that his whereabouts remained unknown, and that the [Grandmother] was willing to continue to care for this child while the Mother continued her drug treatment and worked toward reunification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-4\">... [T]he stipulation ... indicated that the Mother was to have liberal visitation with the child, as arranged by [the Grandmother] and herself; that the Mother was to cooperate with the Department; and that the Department agreed to refer the Mother for parenting classes; and that the Mother agreed to continue in substance abuse treatment, including urinalysis and recommended aftercare services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Following the hearing in March 1996, the Department evidently had difficulty in arranging meetings with appellant. Appellant also failed to provide the Department with confirmation of her continued participation in a drug treatment program. Moreover, between the adjudicatory hearing on March 27, 1996, and the disposition hearing on May 22, 1996, Donna W. only visited Jimetra on one occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">A disposition hearing was held on May 23, 1996, at which appellant appeared with counsel. Again, the parties proceeded by stipulation, agreeing that Jimetra was a child in need of assistance and to commitment to the Department for continued relative placement. At the October 1999 termination hearing, the Department\u2019s attorney reviewed the stipulation from the disposition hearing, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">[T]he Department had attempted to meet with the Mother to discuss plans for reunification but had been unable to do so; ... the Mother had had one visit with [Jimetra] since the March 26th, 1996, hearing; and ... the Department had received no information from the Mother as to her continued participation in drug treatment or her random urinalysis testing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-8\">At that time, the child had no special needs, and the parties agreed to a finding of CI\u00d1A and commitment to the Department ... for relative placement and that further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>disposition orders were that the Mother was to participate in substance abuse treatment, including random urinalysis and recommended aftercare. Mother was to maintain regular visitation with the child as arranged by the caretaker. Mother was to complete parenting classes and cooperate with the Department; that the Mother was to maintain regular contact with the Department and enter into a Service agreement with the Department and Mother was to provide the Court and the Department with documentation of her participation in [a] drug treatment program and release the results of her random urinalysis to the Department____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Subsequently, the Department drafted several service agreements. Nevertheless, appellant never agreed to the terms of a service agreement. Moreover, the Department claimed that appellant\u2019s visits with Jimetra after May 1996 were \u201csomewhat sporadic,\u201d interrupted in part by an additional period of incarceration for a violation of probation. Additionally, appellant did not provide the Department with documentation concerning: (1) participation in a drug treatment program; (2) participation in a parenting class; or (3) the results of random urinalysis tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Jimetra did very well in her Grandmother\u2019s home.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Both Jimetra and India were in their Grandmother\u2019s care until January 1999, when the Grandmother unexpectedly died from a stroke. Thereafter, both girls were placed with Sherine G., a maternal relative. At that time, appellant had not yet secured full-time employment, and she had only lived in her home for about a month. According to the Department\u2019s proffer at the termination hearing, Jimetra \u201cmade an appropriate adjustment to the maternal aunt\u2019s home.\u201d Appellant did not visit Jimetra in Sherine\u2019s home, however, because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>\u201cconflict\u201d and \u201ctension between the Mother and the caretaker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">On December 14, 1998, the Department filed its petition to terminate appellant\u2019s parental rights,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to which appellant timely objected. Because the Department was unable to locate Jimmy D., the Department successfully moved to waive notice to Jimmy D., pursuant to Md.Code (1999,1999 Supp.), \u00a7 5-822 of the Family Law Article (\u201cF.L.\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the father was deemed to have consented to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">As noted, the parties proceeded by proffer at the termination hearing on October 26, 1999. Although appellant did not attend that hearing, she was represented by counsel. A footnote in appellant\u2019s brief explains that appellant was \u201cdetained\u201d at the t\u00edme and was therefore unable to attend. No other information has been provided as to how or why appellant was detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Most of the facts set forth above were derived from the proffer made by the Department\u2019s counsel at the termination hearing. At the close of the proffer by the Department\u2019s attorney, Linda Davis, the supervisor of the worker assigned to Jimetra\u2019s case, verified the accuracy of the proffer. Counsel for Jimetra and counsel for appellant declined the opportunity to cross-examine Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The Department also offered its record into evidence as an exhibit. Although Jimetra\u2019s counsel did not object, the mother\u2019s attorney noted a \u201cstanding objection to the Department\u2019s record,\u201d stating: \u201cI do not believe it\u2019s a business record and some of the items that are contained therein are not kept in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the ordinary course of business. They are not items that the social worker herself would have prepared.\u201d The court said it \u201cwill sustain in part and overruled in part.\u201d It then \u201cadmit[ted] [only] those portions of the record that do not contain inappropriate hearsay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Following the Department\u2019s case, Jimetra\u2019s counsel informed the court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">Your Honor, I am also asking this Court to grant the Petition of the Department. The child, Jemitra [sic], is doing very well with the relative who she calls Renny. And, of course, she has had a very tragic incident when the grandmother, with whom she was for most of her life, died very suddenly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">She is going to kindergarten. She says that she would like to stay with Renny and talked [sic] with mommy on the phone. And her sister, India, who is also in the system now and adjudication is coming up next week, lives with her in the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">We looked at the house, we spoke to the caretaker. We are satisfied that the child would be in a stable environment if staying there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Appellant\u2019s attorney then made a proffer on behalf of her client. Appellant\u2019s counsel explained that Jimetra had lived with the maternal Grandmother with appellant\u2019s consent. Indeed, appellant had agreed with the Grandmother \u201cthat [Jimetra] should remain there and should grow up in [the Grandmother\u2019s] home.\u201d According to appellant\u2019s counsel, when Jimetra lived with the Grandmother, appellant \u201cmaintained contact with her mother and her child through telephone contact, as well as visits.\u201d After Jimetra was placed with a relative following the Grandmother\u2019s tragic and unexpected death, appellant did \u201cnot have an opportunity to see her child.\u201d Appellant\u2019s attorney explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-10\">The relative is a maternal cousin to my client who she does not have a relationship with, and the relationship, as such has deteriorated since the passing of the [Grandmother. There is some family tension as to what was the cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>of the [Grandmother's passing, which was a massive stroke; but that because of that tension between her and the cousin who is now caring for her children she does not have an opportunity to see her children. The only time she really sees the children are [sic] when they\u2019re in court. And when we were last in court, there was a very nasty exchange between the caretaker and the Mother. And so, that is one of the main reasons why she has not been able to maintain contact with her children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Appellant\u2019s attorney also elaborated upon the situation that led appellant to leave Jimetra home alone on February 27, 1996. Appellant\u2019s lawyer explained that after Ms. W. was released from incarceration, she was enrolled in a drug treatment program as a condition of her probation. Initially, the program allowed its enrollees to bring their children. That policy was subsequently changed, however, and Ms. W. was faced with the dilemma of either leaving Jimetra alone in the house or violating her probation. Regrettably, Ms. W. made a decision to leave Jimetra at home, because \u201cshe didn\u2019t think she would be gone very long\u201d and she felt that Jimetra \u201cwould be safe while she was gone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">According to appellant\u2019s lawyer, by the time of the termination hearing, appellant had maintained a stable home for approximately ten months and had been employed, full-time, for nine months. Therefore, she was in a position to care for Jimetra. Further, counsel said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">[T]hroughout the time [appellant\u2019s] child was placed with her mother she was wrestling with the decision about whether or not to let her mother raise her child. She had come to the conclusion to let her mother raise her child, but then her mother passed away, and she thought that would be an opportunity that she should step forward and regain custody of her children. That did not take place, and she has sought for her children to be returned to her since that time, that she\u2019s in a position to care for them, and that would be her testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">It is well settled that a parent has a fundamental, constitutional right to raise his or her own child. <em>See In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 112, 642 A.2d 201 (1994); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. J970013, </em>128 Md.App. 242, 247, 737 A.2d 604 (1999); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 94339058/CAD, </em>120 Md.App. 88, 97, 706 A.2d 144 (1998); <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 95195062/CAD, </em>116 Md.App. 443, 454, 696 A.2d 1102 (1997); <em>see also Santosky v.

Thus, cases involving termination of parental rights are often particularly difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In <em>Santosky, </em>455 U.S. at 759, 102 S.Ct. 1388, the Supreme Court said: \u201cWhen the State initiates a parental rights termination proceeding, it seeks not merely to infringe that fundamental liberty interest, but to end it.\u201d The Court of Appeals similarly recognized the seriousness of such a proceeding in <em>Walker v. Gardner, </em>221 Md. 280, 157 A.2d 273 (1960), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq_5\">[A]doption decrees cut the child off from the natural parent, who is made a legal stranger to his offspring. The consequences of this drastic and permanent severing of the strongest and basic natural ties and relationships has led the Legislature and this Court to make sure, as far as possible, that adoption shall not be granted over parental objection unless that course clearly is justified. The welfare and best interests of the child must be weighed with great care against every just claim of an objecting parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 284, 157 A.2d 273; <em>accord Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. at 113, 642 A.2d 201; <em>Adoption/Guardianship No. 94339058/CAD, </em>120 Md.App. at 97-98, 706 A.2d 144; <em>Adoption/Guardianship No. 95195062/CAD, </em>116 Md.App. at 454, 696 A.2d 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>In a termination case, the burden falls upon the State to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the termination of a parent\u2019s rights serves the best interest of the child. <em>.See Adoption/Guardianship 95195062/CAD, </em>116 Md.

Rather, it is to decide only whether there was sufficient evidence\u2014by a dear and convincing standard\u2014to support the chancellor\u2019s determination that it would be in the best interest of [the child] to terminate the parental rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>[the] natural [parent]. In making this decision, we must assume the truth of all the evidence, and of all the favorable inferences fairly deducible therefrom, tending to support the factual conclusion of the trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Thus, on appeal, \u201cwe must ascertain whether the trial court considered the statutory criteria, whether its factual determinations were clearly erroneous, whether the court properly applied the law, and whether it abused its discretion in making its determination.\u201d <em>Adoption/Guardianship No. 94339058/ CAD, </em>120 Md.App. at 101, 706 A.2d 144; <em>see In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 311, 701 A.2d 110 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Before reviewing the court\u2019s findings, we shall first address two preliminary concerns raised by appellant in her brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Appellant argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the court\u2019s decision to terminate her parental rights. Although not raised by appellant as a separate issue, she bases her position, in part, on her claim that the court erred by admitting the Department\u2019s records. Appellant thus urges us to \u201cdecline to entertain considering any part of [the Department\u2019s] purported \u2018business record.\u2019 \u201d Our answer to that is rather simple: we will not consider the Department\u2019s record in deciding this appeal, because that record was not included either in the record extract or in the record itself. In any event, appellant\u2019s position is without merit. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">As we noted, the circuit court sustained the objection of the mother\u2019s attorney as to the admission of those parts of the Department\u2019s record that contained hearsay. Moreover,, prior to rendering its oral opinion in this case, the court said: \u201c[H]aving considered the evidence that was presented by way of proffer and the Court\u2019s very, very cursory review of the record, the Court makes the following findings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Appellant maintains that it is nearly impossible to discern what parts of the Department\u2019s record the court may have considered. Nothing in the court\u2019s opinion suggests that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>relied on any evidence other than what was properly presented at the hearing. Moreover, appellant has not referred us to any item contained in that record that might have prejudiced her position.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Appellant\u2019s second concern appears in a footnote of her brief. There, she points out that F.L. \u00a7 5-313 was amended between the time Jimetra was placed with the Department in 1996 and the time of the Grandmother\u2019s death in January 1999. Further, she suggests that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 5-313(c) in its current form may have been misplaced.\u201d In light of \u201cthe procedural posture of this case,\u201d she seems to question whether the court should have considered the statute as it read when Jimetra came into care, rather than as it now appears. But, she does not provide us with any legal authority or analysis to establish that the court erred. Nor does she establish how or why the outcome would have been different even if the court relied on the earlier version of the statute. Because the amendments are relatively recent, and we have not been referred to any published opinion discussing them, we will address appellant\u2019s concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In early 1998, the Legislature repealed and reenacted F.L. \u00a7 5-313 through House Bill 1093. 1998 Md. Laws, Chap. 539. Effective July 1, 1998, former F.L. \u00a7 5-313 was amended to add current subsections (c)(1), (d)(l)(v), (d)(4), and (d)(5). House Bill 1093 created two substantive additions to F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c), now found in F.L. \u00a7 5-313(e)(l) and F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(v). Although no substantive deletions were made, other changes were made to conform the statute to the new provisions. Consequently, former F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(l) through (e)(6) was redesignated as F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(i) through (e)(2)(vi).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">F.L. \u00a7 5-313(e)(l) requires the court to give \u201cprimary consideration\u201d in a termination case \u201cto the safety and health of the child.\u201d In our assessment of this recent amendment, we begin with well-established principles of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>The fundamental rule of statutory interpretation is the determination and effectuation of the intent of the Legislature. <em>See State v. Bell, </em>351 Md. 709, 717, 720 A.2d 311 (1998); <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423 (1995). To ascertain that intent, we first look to the actual language of the statute. <em>See Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 444-45, 697 A.2d 455 (1997); <em>Coburn v. Coburn, </em>342 Md. 244, 256, 674 A.2d 951 (1996). If the statute\u2019s language is plain and its meaning clear, we ordinarily do not look beyond the words of the statute itself. <em>Read v. Supervisor of Assessments, </em>354 Md. 383, 393, 731 A.2d 868 (1999); <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor and City Council of of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 515, 525 A.2d 628 (1987). Nevertheless, \u201c[w]e may always consider evidence of legislative intent beyond the plain language of the statute.\u201d <em>State v. Pagano, </em>341 Md. 129, 133, 669 A.2d 1339 (1996); <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 514-15, 525 A.2d 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In deciding the plain meaning of a term, we may consult the dictionary. <em>State Dep\u2019t of Assessments &amp; Taxation v. Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>348 Md. 2, 14, 702 A.2d 690 (1997); <em>Rouse-Fairwood Ltd. Partnership v. Supervisor of Assessments, </em>120 Md.App. 667, 687, 708 A.2d 19 (1998). Of course, \u201c[t]he \u2018meaning of the plainest language\u2019 is controlled by the context in which it appears.\u201d <em>Kaczorowski, </em>309 Md. at 514, 525 A.2d 628 (quoting <em>Guardian Life Ins.

First in order of time, or development, or in intention.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>925 (10th ed. 1997) <em>(\u201cMerriam-Webster\u2019s </em>\u201d), as relevant to this case, defines \u201cprimary\u201d as \u201cof first rank, importance, or value.\u201d \u201cConsider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>ation\u201d is defined, in part, as: \u201c1: continuous and careful thought ... 2 a: a matter weighed or taken into account when formulating an opinion or plan ... b: a taking into account ... 4: an opinion obtained by reflection.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s, </em>at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The plain meaning of the statute thus requires that when a trial court takes into account the factors enumerated in F.L. \u00a7 5-313(e) in order to determine the best interests of the child, the matter of the safety and health of the child is the overriding consideration. This interpretation is in accord with the legislative intent evidenced by the history of House Bill 1093 and related statutory enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">At its first reading, the bill contained a preamble that said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azv\">WHEREAS, The goal of Maryland\u2019s child welfare system is safety and permanency for children; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmL\">WHEREAS, The State\u2019s child welfare system is committed to preserve families when possible and to reunify children with parents when safe to do so; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYy\">WHEREAS, The State recognizes that in some circumstances it is not possible or in the best interest of the child to return the child to the child\u2019s parents; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Abf\">WHEREAS, The State\u2019s child welfare system is committed to making reasonable efforts to ensure prompt permanency for children....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Although the preamble was subsequently deleted, its overarching principles appear to be embodied in the current version of F.L. \u00a7 5-303, which contains express legislative \u201cfindings.\u201d F.L. \u00a7 5-303, like F.L. \u00a7 5-313, was repealed and reenacted pursuant to 1998 Md. Laws, Chap. 539. Significantly, the reenactment added current F.L. \u00a7 5\u2014303(b)(1). F.L. \u00a7 5-303 now provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014The General Assembly finds that the policies and procedures of this subtitle[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] that concern adoption are socially necessary and desirable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>(b) <em>Purposes of subtitle\u2014The </em>purposes of this subtitle are to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">(1) provide children with stable homes that protect their safety and health;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">(2) protect children from unnecessary separation from their natural parents; .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">(3) permit adoption only by individuals who are fit for the responsibility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">(4) protect natural parents from making a hurried or ill-considered decision to give up a child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">(5) protect adoptive parents:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">(i) by providing them information about the child and the child\u2019s background; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">(ii) from a future disturbance of their relationship with the child by a natural parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">Thus, pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 5-303(b)(l), a purpose of the subtitle is to \u201cprovide children with stable homes that protect their <em>safety and health.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Similarly, current F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(l) requires the court to give \u201cprimary consideration to the <em>safety and health </em>of the child.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">As we see it, these legislative amendments reflect the unassailable tenet that \u201cthe \u2018golden rule\u2019 has always been the best interest of the child.\u2019\u201d <em>Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. at 323, 701 A.2d 110; <em>see Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. at 113, 642 A.2d 201. As the Court of Appeals said in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. A91-71A, </em>334 Md. 538, 561, 640 A.2d 1085 (1994):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-13\">[W]e have ... made clear that the controlling factor, or guiding principle, in adoption and custody cases is not the natural parent\u2019s interest in raising the child, but rather what best serves the interests of the child. We have said that in all cases where the interests of a child are in jeopardy the paramount consideration is what will best promote the child\u2019s welfare, a consideration that is of \u201ctranscendant importance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Moreover, the obvious breadth of F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(l) suggests that it is a kind of \u201ccatchall\u201d provision encompassing the specific criteria enumerated in F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2). Indeed, it would seem impossible to give \u201cprimary consideration\u201d to the child\u2019s health and safety without analyzing the other factors set forth in the statute. Thus, notwithstanding the Legislature\u2019s recent addition of a \u201cprimary\u201d consideration to the analysis required under F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(l), \u201cthe court must review all relevant factors [contained in \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)] and consider them together,\u201d <em>Adoption/Guardianship No. 94339058/CAD, </em>120 Md.App. at 105, 706 A.2d 144, just as it always has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">With the foregoing in mind, we turn to consider the second substantive addition to F.L. \u00a7 5-313(e), in what is now codified at F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(v). There, the Legislature modified what was formerly F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(5) by inserting the phrase \u201cthe result of\u2019 at the beginning of the text. Thus, F.L. \u00a7 5-313(e)(2)(v) now provides that the court must give consideration to <em>\u201cthe result of </em>the effort the natural parent has made to adjust the natural parent\u2019s circumstances, conduct, or conditions to make it in the best interest of the child to be returned to the natural parent\u2019s home.\u201d (Emphasis added); <em>see </em>1998 Md. Laws, Chap. 539, \u00a7 1. In calling attention in her brief to the textual change to former F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(5), appellant implies that the insertion of the phrase \u201cthe result of\u2019 has placed a greater burden on a natural parent confronted with a termination proceeding. Yet, she does not advance any sound argument that the court\u2019s finding pursuant to current F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(v) would have been different had it relied on former F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Again, consulting dictionaries for assistance, we see that <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s, supra, </em>at 999, defines a \u201cresult,\u201d in part, as \u201csomething that results as a consequence, issue, or conclusion; <em>also </em>: beneficial or tangible effect.\u201d According to <em>Black\u2019s, supra, </em>at 356, an \u201ceffort\u201d is \u201c[a]n attempt; an endeav- or; a struggle directed to the accomplishment of an object.\u201d Thus, prior to the enactment of House Bill 1093, in determining whether it was in a child\u2019s best interest to terminate a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>natural parent\u2019s rights, the court was required to consider attempts made or struggles undertaken to make it in the child\u2019s best .interest to return the child to the parent\u2019s home. Now, in rendering that same determination, the court must consider the effect of any attempts or struggles.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">It appears to us myopic to think that, before the amendment, a court considering a parent\u2019s effort would not also, at least implicitly, consider the result of the parental effort. Moreover, we find it significant that, in amending former F.L. \u00a7 5\u2014313(c)(5), the Legislature chose not to modify any of the subfactors formerly contained in F.L. \u00a7 5\u2014313(c)(5)(i) to (c)(5)(iv). As we observed earlier, House Bill 1093 simply renumbered those subfactors as F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(v)(l) to (c)(2)(v)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">In light of the foregoing, and even assuming that the court in this case should have applied former F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c), we are confident that the end result would have been the same. Accordingly, we turn to the statutory factors as considered by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Our view of the record reveals that the trial court addressed each, factor in F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c) and (d), applied the statutory requirements to the facts, and found by clear and convincing evidence that it was in the best interest of Jimetra to terminate appellant\u2019s parental rights. Nonetheless, appellant argues that the Department failed to meet its burden. She specifically challenges the court\u2019s findings in connection with F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(iii), (c)(2)(iv), and (e)(2)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">As discussed above, F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(l) requires the trial court to give \u201cprimary consideration to the safety and health of the child\u201d in determining whether it is in the child\u2019s best interest to terminate parental rights. As to this factor, the court found, and appellant does not challenge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-10\">[T]hat the Department ... has met and is meeting the safety and health needs of this child. The Court finds, conversely, that Mother has not and is not currently meeting the safety and health needs of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Appellant has not raised an objection to the findings under F.L. \u00a7 5\u2014313(e)(2)(i). Under that subsection, the court must consider \u201cthe timeliness, nature, and extent of the services offered by the child placement agency to facilitate reunion of the child with the natural parent.\u201d In this regard, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-4\">The Court notes that this case came in for\u2014as a result of a neglect report in March of 1996\u2014actually, February of 1996, and exactly one month later there was a stipulation entered into between the Department, the Court, and the Mother, and child\u2019s counsel, but in that stipulation the Mother was referred to drug treatment and parenting classes. So the Court does find that there were early and appropriate services offered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">And then almost two months later when the case finally went to disposition, there was another stipulation and this stipulation required Mother to enter into drug treatment and complete parenting classes. The Court also notes that the Department did obtain relative resources, so the Court does find the Department did offer timely and appropriate services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Under F.L. \u00a7 5\u2014313(c)(2)(ii), the court must consider \u201cany social service agreement between the natural parent and the child placement agency, and the extent to which all parties have fulfilled their obligations under the agreement.\u201d Here, the court observed that no social service agreement existed, despite \u201cthe fact that the May 23rd, 1996, stipulation required the Mother to enter into a[n agreement].\u201d The court then found that appellant \u201cdid not make herself available\u201d so that an agreement could be executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">F.L. \u00a7 5\u2014313(c)(2)(iii) requires the court to consider \u201cthe child\u2019s feelings toward and emotional ties with the child\u2019s natural parents, the child\u2019s siblings, and any other individuals who may significantly affect the child\u2019s best interest.\u201d The court found a bond between Jimetra and Sherine, as well as a bond between Jimetra and India. The court acknowledged that \u201c[t]here is a bond of sorts between [Donna W.] and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>[Jimetra], but the Court does not find that to be the same as a parental bond.\u201d With the exception of the court\u2019s finding that her daughters had a bond with each other, appellant alleges that the proffers did not support these findings. As to the bond between Jimetra and Sherine, appellant seemingly ignores the Department\u2019s proffer that Jimetra \u201cmade an appropriate adjustment\u201d to Sherine\u2019s home. Perhaps more significant were statements made by Jimetra\u2019s counsel that Jimetra was doing well and wanted to stay with Renny.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Appellant also challenges the court\u2019s finding under F.L. \u00a7 5\u2014313(e)(2)(iv). Under that subsection, the court must review \u201cthe child\u2019s adjustment to home, school, and community.\u201d The court found that Jimetra had \u201cadjusted quite well in, in her home, school, and community.\u201d Appellant maintains that the court\u2019s finding was not supported by the proffers. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Jimetra\u2019s counsel stated that Jimetra \u201cis going to kindergarten\u201d and, as noted in connection with F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(iii), appeared content with Sherine and in Sherine\u2019s home. Nevertheless, even if this determination were erroneous or the record were inadequately developed to support the court\u2019s finding, there is ample other evidence in the record to uphold the court\u2019s finding that it was in Jimetra\u2019s best interest to terminate Donna W.\u2019s parental rights. As we said in <em>Adoption/Guardianship No. 94339058, </em>120 Md.App. at 105, 706 A.2d 144: \u201cF.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)[ (2) ] does not require a trial court to weigh any one statutory factor above all others. Rather, the court must review all relevant factors and consider them together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">As discussed, <em>supra, </em>F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(v) requires the court to consider \u201cthe result of the effort the natural parent has made to adjust the natural parent\u2019s circumstances, conduct; or conditions to make it in the best interest of the child to be returned to the natural parent\u2019s home,\u201d including those factors set forth in F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(v)(l) and (c)(2)(v)(3).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>ant to F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(v)(l), the court observed that appellant \u201cmaintained, at best, sporadic visits, even fewer visits now that the child is with a different relative.\u201d Consequently, the court found that appellant\u2019s visits with Jimetra were \u201cincidental.\u201d As to this finding, appellant contends that the record does not support the court\u2019s conclusion, in view of the conflicting proffers.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">In support of her position, appellant has referred us to two transcript pages. The first contains the following proffer by the Department\u2019s counsel at the termination hearing: \u201c[S]ince 1996, ... Mother\u2019s visits to the child have been somewhat sporadic, although they have been interrupted by a period of time when Mother was incarcerated again after 1996.\u201d The second reference is to the proffer of appellant\u2019s attorney that appellant \u201cmaintained contact with her mother and her child through telephone contact, as well as visits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">To be sure, a court cannot resolve evidentiary disputes on the basis of conflicting proffers. This is because \u201cthere is no proper way to resolve the evidentiary conflicts in order to determine ultimate facts which would be sufficient in law....\u201d <em>Polk v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 648, 656-57, 584 A.2d 1274 (1991); <em>see also Barnes v. State, </em>31 Md.App. 25, 34-35, 354 A.2d 499 (1976). Any issue concerning alleged variances in the proffers could have been easily avoided by the presentation of testimony. We do not agree, though, that the proffers were truly conflicting, or that the court resolved any conflicts that did exist. In the case at bar, the trial court properly based its verdict on the facts before it that were undisputed. To the extent proffers conflicted, the conflicts were not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(v)(l) requires the court to consider \u201cthe extent to which the natural parent has maintained regular contact with the child under a plan to reunite the child with the natural parent.\u201d But, that subsection precludes the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>from giving \u201csignificant weight to any incidental visit, communication, or contribution.\u201d The proffers did not indicate that appellant was, at any time prior to January 1999, working toward reunification with her daughter. Moreover, there was nothing specific in the proffer of appellant\u2019s counsel to show regular contact. Appellant\u2019s proffer, to the effect that she maintained telephone contact with her child and had \u201cvisits\u201d with her child while the child resided with the Grandmother, did not contradict the Department\u2019s position that her contact was sporadic. Instead, without reference to duration or frequency, the statement alleged, generally, that the mother had contact with her child when the child resided with the Grandmother. Appellant\u2019s attorney essentially conceded that the mother had almost no contact with Jimetra once the child began to live with the maternal relative, because of tension in that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">With respect to F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(v)(3), the court stated that there was no evidence to suggest appellant maintained regular contact with the Department, as Jimetra\u2019s legal custodian, but noted that there was evidence to suggest that appellant maintained some contact with the Grandmother \u201cas the de facto custodian\u201d when Jimetra was in her care. Appellant does not dispute that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">F.L. \u00a7 5-313(c)(2)(vi) requires consideration of \u201call services offered to the natural parent before the placement of the child.\u201d The court noted that Donna W. \u201cwas on parole and, as a result of that parole, earlier parole, she was receiving drug treatment when the case came into the Department\u2019s attention back in February of 1996.\u201d Although no further references to services were made, appellant has not contested the court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The court also reviewed those factors contained in F.L. \u00a7 5-313(d). Although appellant has not challenged any of the court\u2019s findings under F.L. \u00a7 5-313(d), we will briefly highlight the determinations made as to the relevant subsections, because of the importance of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Under F.L. \u00a7 5-313(d)(l)(i), the court is required to consider whether \u201cthe natural parent has a disability that renders the natural parent consistently unable to care for the immediate and ongoing physical or psychological needs of the child for long periods of time.\u201d Here, the court found no such disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">F.L. \u00a7 5-313(d)(l)(ii) requires the court to determine whether \u201cthe natural parent has committed acts of abuse or neglect toward any child in the family.\u201d The court stated that it \u201cbelievefd] that the Mother having left this child and a sibling[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>] home alone in February of 1997 to be neglect, indica of neglect, but the Court, I guess, should possibly weigh that with the fact that Mother was ... going to drug treatment during that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The court found no evidence of the conditions contained in F.L. \u00a7 5-313(d)(l)(iii), (d)(l)(iv), or (d)(l)(v). Additionally, it found no evidence that would invoke subsection (d)(2) and, pursuant to (d)(3), it declined to waive the Department\u2019s obligations under F.L. \u00a7 S-SlSic).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">We applaud appellant for her efforts to maintain a stable home and obtain gainful employment for a period of months. Nevertheless, we are satisfied from our review of the record that the court did not err or abuse its discretion in concluding that the Department met its burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that termination of appellant\u2019s parental rights was in Jimetra\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">JUDGMENT OP THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

The Department discussed a plan of adoption with the Grandmother in September 1997.
