Greise (collectively referred to in this opinion as \u201cGreise\u201d), and the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund (\u201cthe Fund\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellee is the employee, Kevin Pennel. Appellants present for our review the following questions, which we have reordered in the interest of efficiency.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">1. Did the Circuit Court err in finding that the value of breakfast prepared by the farmer\u2019s wife must be considered in calculating \u201cpayroll\u201d for the purpose of determining whether the farm worker is a covered employee under Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, Maryland Labor and Employment Annotated Code, \u00a7 9\u2014210(b)(2)(ii)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-10\">2.

Did the Circuit Court err in affirming the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission based on a motion for summary judgment when the Claimant gave varying statements under oath as to his belief regarding whether he considered breakfast as part of his compensation or as an entitlement in connection with his employment?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>We hold that the court properly found that the breakfasts prepared for appellee constituted \u201cpayroll\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and that the court applied the correct standard of review in arriving at its decision. We further find that the court did not err in affirming the Commission\u2019s order on the basis of a summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">In his brief to this Court, appellee cross-appeals and presents the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">Did the Circuit Court err in granting the motion of Greise to be joined as a party plaintiff?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">We answer \u201cno\u201d to this question and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Robert and Betty Greise, husband and wife, operated a 205 acre dairy farm called the Greise Dairy Farm (\u201cthe Farm\u201d) in Cumberland, Maryland. Kevin Pennel was the sole employee on the farm. Pennel\u2019s gross pay was $279.89 per week. After various tax deductions, he received $236.00 by check or in cash for every week that he worked. During his vacation week, he received $150.00, either by check or in cash, instead of his regular pay. For the year before August 14, 1997, the date Pennel was injured, his weekly payments by check and in cash totaled $14,424.39.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Pennel worked at the farm for sixteen years. For twelve years, he worked seven days per week, fourteen hours per day, except Sundays, when he worked six hours. Pennel was off one week per year during deer hunting season. Mrs. Greise prepared breakfast for Pennel consisting of eggs, bacon or sausage, and milk every morning except Fridays when she had her hair appointments. By written stipulation, the parties agreed that for the year before August 14, 1997, the meals provided to Pennel had a value of $918.00. Therefore, the stipulated value of the meals added to the weekly cash and check payments totaled $15,342.39.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">On August 14,1997, Pennel sustained a work-related injury to his right eye. On September 2, 1997, he filed a claim with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, alleging that he was working as a dairy farmer on the Farm on the date of his injury. The Commission held a hearing on July 27, 1998. Pennel claimed that, as a result of the injury, he was temporarily and totally disabled from August 14,1997, through April 28,1998. The parties did not dispute the nature and cause of the injury, the reasonableness and necessity of the related medical treatment, or the claimed lost time from work. Rather, the sole issue in dispute was whether the breakfasts prepared by Mrs. Greise were included in the meaning of the word \u201cpayroll\u201d as used in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d). If the meals were part of the Greise \u201cpayroll,\u201d then Pennel was a \u201ccovered employee\u201d under the Act and was eligible to receive compensation for his injury. The Commission found that Pennel was a covered employee and entered an award of compensation on August 4,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Mr. and Mrs. Greise appealed the Commission\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court for Allegany County. Pennel and the Fund noted their intent to participate in the appeal. The parties stipulated as to the facts and agreed that Greise and the Fund would seek a legal interpretation of the term \u201cpayroll\u201d by filing a motion for summary judgment solely as to that issue. The court denied the motion and affirmed the decision of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The Fund filed a timely appeal to this Court; Greise did not. After the time for appeal expired, Greise filed a motion to join the appeal as a party plaintiff. The court granted the motion and denied Pennel\u2019s request for reconsideration. Pennel\u2019s cross-appeal concerns the order joining Greise as a party plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A_i\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">In reviewing administrative agency decisions, this Court\u2019s function is \u201cprecisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u201d <em>Department of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 303-04, 641 A.2d 899 (1994). Like the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>circuit court, we \u201cmust determine whether the agency\u2019s decision is \u2018in accordance with the law or whether it is arbitrary, illegal, and capricious.\u2019\u201d <em>Curry v. Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, </em>102 Md.App. 620, 626-27, 651 A.2d 390 (1994), <em>cert. dismissed as improvidently granted, </em>340 Md. 175, 665 A.2d 1038 (1995) (quoting <em>Moseman v. County Council, </em>99 Md.App. 258, 262, 636 A.2d 499, <em>cert. denied, </em>335 Md. 229, 643 A.2d 383 (1994)). When the agency\u2019s factual, findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and the decision is legally correct, we must affirm the agency\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Carriage Hill v. Maryland Health Resources Planning Comm'n </em>125 Md.App. 183, 212, 724 A.2d 745 (1999) (and cases cited therein). As this Court recognized in <em>Department of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Riverview Nursing Centre, Inc., </em>\u201c[t]o the extent the issues on appeal turn on the correctness of an agency\u2019s findings of fact, such findings must be reviewed under the substantial evidence test.\u201d 104 Md.App. 593, 602, 657 A.2d 372, <em>cert. denied, </em>340 Md. 215, 665 A.2d 1058 (1995). Our task is to determine \u201cwhether there was substantial evidence before the administrative agency on the record as a whole to support its conclusions,\u201d without substituting our judgment for that of the agency. <em>Maryland Commission on Human Relations v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>86 Md.App. 167, 173, 586 A.2d 37, <em>cert. denied, </em>323 Md. 309, 593 A.2d 668 (1991). When an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute or regulation is at issue, however, the substituted judgment standard applies and we will substitute our judgment for that of the agency. <em>See Carriage Hill, </em>125 Md.App. at 212, 724 A.2d 745; <em>see also Curry, </em>102 Md.App. at 627, 651 A.2d 390 (\u201cWhen reviewing issues of law ... the court\u2019s review is expansive and it may substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">In particular, when reviewing a decision by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, \u201cthe standard to be employed by the circuit court, as well as the appellate court, is limited to determining whether the Commission exceeded the powers granted to it by [the Maryland Code], and whether it misconstrued the law and facts applicable to the case decided.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>Workers\u2019 Compensation Comm\u2019n v. May, </em>88 Md.App. 408, 416, 594 A.2d 1232 (1991) (and cases cited therein). Section 9-745 of the Labor and Employment Article, Maryland Code, provides the following regarding appellate proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">(b) <em>Presumption and burden of </em>proof\u2014In each court proceeding under this title:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">(1) the decision of the Commission is presumed to be prima facie correct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">(2) the party challenging the decision has the burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">(c) <em>Determination by </em>court.\u2014The court shall determine whether the Commission:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">(1) justly considered all of the faets about the accidental personal injury, occupational disease, or compensable hernia;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">(2) exceeded the powers granted to it under this title; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">(3) misconstrued the law and facts applicable in the case decided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-12\">(e) Disposition.\u2014(1) If the court determines that the Commission acted within its powers and correctly construed the law and facts, the court shall confirm the decision of the Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-13\">(2) If the court determines that the Commission did not act within its powers or did not correctly construe the law and faets, the court shall reverse or modify the decision or remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">Md.Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-745 of the Labor and Employment Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-15\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the parties stipulated that there were no material faets in dispute and that the issue before the court, whether meals are included in the term \u201cpayroll,\u201d was purely a legal question. Therefore, in this appeal, we substitute our judgment for that of the Workers\u2019 Compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Commission to determine whether it misconstrued the law as it applies to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\n<em>Definition of \u201cPayroll\u201d in \u00a7 9-210</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The sole question before the trial court, and indeed the sole question properly before this Court, is how to interpret the word \u201cpayroll\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 9-210 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, Maryland Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.), Title 9 of the Labor and Employment Article. In pertinent part, the Act provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">(b) <em>Employee </em>covered.\u2014Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, an individual, including a migrant farm worker, is a covered employee if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">(1) the individual receives compensation from a farmer for any service other than office work, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">(1) operating a machine connected with animal, crop, or soil management;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">(ii) constructing or repairing a fixture or machine; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">(iii) handling an animal or crop with or without a machine; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">(2) the farmer has:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-12\">(i) at least 3 full-time employees; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-13\">(ii) an annual payroll of at least $15,000 for full-time employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-14\">Md.Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-210 of the Labor and Employment Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-15\">In this case, Pennel\u2019s annual salary, paid by check and in cash, totaled $14,424.39. At that salary, as the sole employee, Pennel would not be considered a \u201ccovered employee\u201d under the Act, as \u00a7 9-210(b)(2)(ii) specifies that the annual payroll must be at least $15,000.00. If, however, the meals prepared by Mrs. Greise are included in the payroll calculation, Pennel\u2019s salary \u201cincreases\u201d to $15,342.39, which makes him eligible for workers\u2019 compensation under the Act. Therefore, to determine whether Pennel may recover, we must determine whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>term \u201cpayroll,\u201d as it is used in the Act, includes the value of meals. We hold that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">As the Court of Appeals recently stated in <em>Sacchet v. Blan, </em>353 Md. 87, 92, 724 A.2d 667 (1999), \u201cthe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the true legislative intent that lies behind the statutory enactment, itself.\u201d <em>See also Catonsville Nursing v. Loveman, </em>349 Md. 560, 570, 709 A.2d 749 (1998); <em>Jones v. State, </em>311 Md. 398, 405, 535 A.2d 471 (1988). To determine the legislative intent, we primarily look to \u201cthe plain language of the statute, with the words given their ordinary and natural meanings.\u201d <em>Sacchet, </em>353 Md. at 92, 724 A.2d 667; <em>see also Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 672, 659 A.2d 1347 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">In this case, we are concerned with the meaning of the term \u201cpayroll.\u201d Because \u201cpayroll\u201d is not defined in the Act, we must examine the \u201cordinary and natural meaning\u201d of the term. The <em>American Heritage Dictionary </em>912 (2d ed.1982) defines \u201cpayroll\u201d as: \u201c1. A list of employees receiving wages, with the amounts due to each. 2. The total sum of money to be paid out to employees at a given time.\u201d Similarly, <em>Miriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>854 (10th ed.1997) provides that payroll is: \u201c1: a paymaster\u2019s or employer\u2019s list of those entitled to pay and of the amounts due to each; 2: the sum necessary for distribution to those on a payroll; <em>also: </em>the money to be distributed.\u201d Finally, <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1151 (6 th ed.1990) defines \u201cpayroll\u201d as: \u201c1. A list of employees to be paid and the amount due to each of them. 2. The total compensation payable to a company\u2019s employees for one pay period.\u201d None of these definitions explicitly limits the term \u201cpayroll\u201d to include only the monetary payments due to employees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, each definition leaves room for the possibility that \u201cpayroll\u201d also includes other forms of compensation or, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>at least, the monetary value of that compensation. Therefore, more than one meaning could attach to the term \u201cpayroll,\u201d and our task is to \u201cascertain the legislative intention and-place that intent into effect.\u201d <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Chapman, </em>11 Md.App. 369, 375, 274 A.2d 870, <em>aff'd, </em>262 Md. 367, 277 A.2d 444 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">When the words in a statute could be given more than one meaning, \u201cthe court may consider the consequences resulting from one meaning, rather than another, and adopt the construction that promotes the most reasonable result in light of the objectives and purpose of the enactment.\u201d <em>Fox v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>126 Md.App. 279, 285, 728 A.2d 776, <em>cert. denied, </em>355 Md. 612, 735 A.2d 1106 (1999) (citing <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730 (1986)). As we noted in <em>Chapman, </em>\u201cwe are mindful of the rule that where there is ambiguity in the compensation law the uncertainty should be resolved in favor of the claimant.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>11 Md.App. at 376, 274 A.2d 870 (citing <em>Barnes v. Ezrine Tire Co., </em>249 Md. 557, 561, 241 A.2d 392 (1968)). Indeed, the \u201cprimary purpose of the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act ... is to protect workers and their families from hardships inflicted by work-related injuries.\u201d <em>Ametek v. O\u2019Connor, </em>126 Md.App. 109, 116, 727 A.2d 437, <em>cert. granted, </em>355 Md. 610, 735 A.2d 1105 (1999). As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Philip Electronics v. Wright, </em>\u201cThe Maryland Workers Compensation Act was originally enacted in 1914 to compensate employees for the loss of earning capacity resulting from accidental injury, disease, or death occurring during the course of employment.\u201d 348 Md. 209, 215-16, 703 A.2d 150 (1997). The Act is \u201cremedial in nature\u201d and should therefore \u201c \u2018be construed as liberally in favor of injured employees as its provisions will permit in order to effectuate its benevolent purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wright, </em>348 Md. at 216, 703 A.2d 150 (quoting <em>Para v. Richards Group, </em>339 Md. 241, 251, 661 A.2d 737 (1995)); <em>see also Lovellette v. City of Baltimore, </em>297 Md. 271, 282, 465 A.2d 1141 (1983); <em>Tortuga v. Wolfensberger, </em>97 Md.App. 79, 84, 627 A.2d 56, <em>cert. denied, </em>332 Md. 703, 632 A.2d 1209 (1993).. Therefore, \u201cin interpreting the Act, we do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>not apply the canon of construction that a statute in derogation of the common law should be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>348 Md. at 216, 703 A.2d 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">In addition, \u201call sections of the Act must be read together, in conjunction with one another, to discern the true intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>348 Md. at 216, 703 A.2d 150; <em>see also Vest v. Giant Food Stores, Inc., </em>329 Md. 461, 466-67, 620 A.2d 340 (1993); <em>Ryder Truck Lines v. Kennedy, </em>296 Md. 528, 537, 463 A.2d 850 (1983).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">Statutes which relate to the same thing or general subject matter, and which are not inconsistent with each other are <em>in pari materia, </em>and should be construed together so that they will harmonize with each other and be consistent with their general object and scope, even though they were passed at different times and contain no reference to each other. Consistent with this established rule of statutory construction, we think all Sections of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (Article 101) must be read and considered together in arriving at the true intent of the Legislature, as they form part of a general system; indeed, the rule has been applied by the Court of Appeals in interpreting the Motor Vehicle Code (Article 66)6), ... the Retail Sales Tax Act (Article 81), ... the Defective Delinquent Law (Article 31B), ... and the Alcohol Beverages Code (Article 2B)----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\"><em>Chapman, </em>11 Md.App. at 375, 274 A.2d 870 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">With these considerations in mind, we examine \u00a7 9-602(a) of the Act, which addresses the method for computing an employee\u2019s average weekly wage. In pertinent part, the statute provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">(a) <em>Computation\u2014In </em>general.\u2014(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the average weekly wage of a covered employee shall be computed by determining the average of the weekly wages of the covered employee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">(i) when the covered employee is working on full time; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">(ii) at the time of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-12\">1. the accidental personal injury; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>2. the last injurious exposure of the covered employee to the hazards of an occupational disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\">(2) For purposes of a computation under paragraph (1) of this subsection, wages shall include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">(i) tips; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">(ii) <em>the reasonable value of housing, lodging, meals, rent, and other similar, advantages that the covered employee received from the employer.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Md.Code (1991, 1999 RepLVol.), \u00a7 9-602 of the Labor and Employment Article (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The Court of Appeals has recognized the nexus between the terms \u201cpayroll\u201d and \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d as they are used in the Act. In <em>Crowner v. Baltimore United Butchers Association, </em>the Court stated that, \u201c[i]n the <em>Picanardi </em>case, we held that average weekly wages could not be calculated on any broader basis than that adapted for calculating premiums and rates of insurance, and that as premiums were calculated on a payroll basis, the compensation to be awarded an injured employee must be calculated on the same basis.\u201d 226 Md. 606, 611,175 A.2d 7 (1961) (citing <em>Picanardi v. Emerson Hotel Co., </em>135 Md. 92, 108 A. 483 (1919)). The Court in <em>Picanardi </em>noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">\u201cIt is quite clear that it is the purpose of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act to secure the payment of benefits, not from the unknown and uncontrolled assets of the individual employers, but ordinarily, at least, from a fund set apart in advance of losses, either in the shape of the State Accident Fund or in the shape of insurance. This fund is to be made up of premiums payable from time to time; and to the extent that experience makes it possible to foresee, the premiums are calculated to equal in the aggregate the benefits to be paid\u2014in addition to incidental expenses with which we are not concerned. All the provisions of the Act concerning security for compensation are carefully designed to effectuate this plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">\u201cThe State Accident Fund is created by premiums equal to fixed percentages of the money paid under employers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>payrolls____ Provision is made for the facilitation of calculation on the basis of these payrolls.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><em>Picanardi, </em>135 Md. at 94, 108 A. 483 (quoting lower court opinion in <em>Picanardi v. Emerson Hotel Co., </em>Bond, J., Baltimore City Court).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In this case, Mrs. Greise cooked breakfast for Pennel six days per week for twelve years. Pennel obtained a benefit from the meals, in that he did not have to purchase food with his own funds. We agree with the circuit court that these meals constituted compensation to Pennel for his labor and should therefore be included in the computation of his wages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given the relationship between the terms \u201cwages\u201d and \u201cpayroll,\u201d we further conclude that the meals were part of the payroll in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">This determination does not, however, end our analysis. We note that in <em>Picanardi, </em>the Court of Appeals held that \u201c[i]t is clear the Legislature did not intend, as to insurance in the State Accident Fund, that board was to be included as wages unless its money value was fixed by the parties at the time of hiring.\u201d. 135 Md. at 96, 108 A. 483. In this case, nothing in the record suggests that the monetary value of the meals was fixed by the parties when Pennel was hired. Due to changes in the language of the Act and the case law addressing this issue, however, we find that fixing the value of meals at the time of hiring is no longer a prerequisite to recovering the reasonable value of meals under the circumstances presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">When <em>Picanardi </em>was decided, section 18 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>In computing the payroll the entire compensation received by every workman employed in extrahazardous work and insured in the State Accident Fund, within the meaning of this Act, shall be included, whether it be in the form of salary, wages, piecework, overtime, or any allowance in the way of profit-sharing, premium or otherwise, and whether payable in money, board or otherwise. <em>Provided the money value of board and similar advantages shall have been fixed by parties at the time of hiring.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><em>Picanardi, </em>135 Md. at 95-96, 108 A. 483 (quoting section 18 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, chapter 800 of the Acts of 1914, as amended by chapter 597 of the Acts of 1916) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Unlike the l\u00e1nguage of the statute in 1919, the current Act makes no reference to any requirement that the value of board (meals) and similar advantages be fixed at the time of hiring. Rather, recent case law recognizes that such details may be unnecessary, as the value of meals, rent, lodging and similar advantages, consideration of which is necessary in the computation of wages under the Act, are easily converted into monetary figures with a present cash value.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">For example, in <em>Barnett v. Sara Lee Corp., </em>97 Md. App. 140, 147, 627 A.2d 86, <em>cert. denied, </em>332 Md. 702, 632 A.2d 1207 (1993), this Court was asked to determine whether pension benefits were included in the statutory definition of wages, \u00a7 9-602(a)(2)(ii), as \u201cother similar advantage[s].\u201d We held that they were not. Unlike housing, lodging, meals, and rent, the other benefits enumerated in the Act, fringe benefits such as pensions \u201care not benefits with a present value that is easily converted into a cash equivalent, and, rather, they essentially constitute a speculative interest.\u201d (Citing <em>Morrison-Knudsen Construction Company v. Director, OWCP, </em>461 U.S. 624, 103 S.Ct. 2045, 76 L.Ed.2d 194 (1983).) , In this case, the monetary value of the meals was not contested at trial, and remains uncontested on appeal. Indeed, the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>stipulated that the annual value of the meals was $918.00.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As neither the current Workers\u2019 Compensation Act nor Maryland case law requires that this value be determined at the time of hiring, we find that the circuit court properly included the value of the meals in the computation of the Greise payroll. Accordingly, we affirm the court\u2019s determination that Pennel was a \u201ccovered employee\u201d under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\n<em>Standard of Review Applied by the Circuit Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Appellants further argue that the circuit court\u2019s decision must be reversed, and the case remanded for new proceedings, because the court \u201capplied an incorrect standard of review.\u201d Although we recognize that in its final conclusion the court stated an incorrect standard of review, we do not find that the court actually applied that standard when deciding this case. Therefore, we decline to reverse and remand this case on that basis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">The circuit court\u2019s opinion and order concluded as follows: Therefore, Employers\u2019 and Insurer\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment is denied. Having failed to meet their burden of proof to overcome the presumption of correctness of the decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, the decision of the Commission is affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">We agree with appellants that where the only issue before the court is one of a purely legal nature, \u201can agency\u2019s identification or interpretation of the controlling law is entitled to no presumption of correctness; the reviewing court must apply the law as it understands it to be.\u201d <em>Supervisor v. Chase Associates, </em>306 Md. 568, 574, 510 A.2d 568 (1986); <em>see also Comptroller v. Gannett, </em>356 Md. 699, 707, 741 A.2d 1130 (1999) (and cases cited therein); <em>Supervisor v. Asbury Methodist Home, </em>313 Md. 614, 626-27, 547 A.2d 190 (1988); <em>Barnes v. Myers, </em>163 Md. 206, 209, 161 A. 279 (1932). In <em>Barnes, </em>the Court of Appeals stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>The terms and manner of employment being settled for the court in this instance, there was no issue of fact to be answered by a jury; it was for the court to declare the resulting relation. This must be so in a proceeding in which a reversal or modification of the commission\u2019s order is sought, as well as in any ordinary civil proceeding, for even though, ..-. the decision of the commission is taken as <em>prima facie </em>correct, with the burden of proof cast upon the party attacking it, that decision cannot have an effect to change in any degree the legal principles which bear upon a settled, undisputed situation. There can be no such thing as a burden of proving legal principles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><em>Barnes, </em>163 Md. at 209, 161 A. 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Had the circuit court in this case actually applied the \u201cpresumption of correctness\u201d standard of review, we may have had no choice but to reverse the court\u2019s judgment. The court did not, however, rely on this standard in reaching its conclusions. Rather, the court (1) recognized that no material facts were in dispute, (2) set forth the proper standard for deciding a motion for summary judgment, (3) stated the applicable considerations for statutory construction, and (4) applied each of these principles to the Act and the undisputed facts of this case. Thus, although the court incorrectly stated that appellants \u201cfailed to meet their burden of proof to overcome the presumption of correctness,\u201d that was not the standard of review the court actually applied in arriving at its decision. We therefore decline to reverse the circuit court\u2019s judgment on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\n<em>Implications of the Summary Judgment Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Appellants concede that \u201cthe parties stipulated to the material facts and the sole issue before the Circuit Court was to construe the statute.\u201d In addition, appellants recognize that the parties agreed to proceed in the circuit court on a motion for summary judgment <em>filed by the appellants. </em>On appeal, however, appellants argue that the court erred in affirming the Commission\u2019s order \u201cbased on a motion for summary judgment\u201d because material facts were in dispute. Specifical<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>ly, appellants maintain that Pennel testified before the Commission that he did not consider the meals to be part of his compensation, but that he filed an affidavit accompanying his answer to appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment in which he asserted that he believed he was entitled to receive breakfast as part of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">First, we note that, even if material facts were in dispute in this case, the court could only have erred if it granted the motion. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 2-501(e) (summary judgment shall be entered \u201cin favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\u201d). In this case, however, the motion for summary judgment was denied. Thus, given the parties\u2019 stipulation and the denial of the summary judgment motion, we are bewilder\u00e9d by appellants\u2019 position as to this issue. Because no facts were in dispute, material or otherwise, when the circuit court denied the motion, we find no merit in appellants\u2019 argument on appeal that the court erred in basing its decision on a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Moreover, we are unclear as to what alternative course of action appellants would have had the court pursue. Upon denying the motion for summary judgment, no other motions or issues were pending before the court. Therefore, the only remaining task for the court was to affirm the Commission\u2019s order. Indeed, the parties even stipulated that if the motion for summary judgment was denied the Commission\u2019s order would be affirmed. Thus, inconsistent with their position on appeal, appellants stipulated that the circuit court\u2019s affirmance of the Commission\u2019s order would be \u201cbased on\u201d the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Finally, we disagree with appellee\u2019s argument that \u201cthe appellants should not be permitted to proceed on appeal in light of the agreement included in the stipulation.\u201d As we previously noted, the parties agreed that if the motion for summary judgment was denied by the court the award of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission would be affirmed. In his brief to this Court, appellee argues that appellants\u2019 \u201cappeal to this Court is a breach of the stipulated agreement among the parties.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">We find that appellants did not waive their right to appeal the circuit court\u2019s judgment by virtue of the stipulation. At most, the parties simply agreed that if the court denied the summary judgment motion, neither party would substantively <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> pursue any other action in the circuit court, such as filing additional motions addressing the merits of the case. The stipulation did not provide, however, that the parties would forego <em>any </em>additional legal action, such as an appeal of the circuit court\u2019s judgment, if the motion was denied. Without an explicit agreement to that effect, we will not read the stipulation in such a way as to deny appellants their right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">\n<em>Cross-Appeal\u2014Greise as a Party Plaintiff</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AF0\">In his cross-appeal, appellee argues that the circuit court erred in allowing Greise to join in the appeal as a party plaintiff, as Greise did not timely file a notice of appeal to this Court. In support of his argument, appellee relies on Maryland Rules 8-201 and 8-202, which set forth the method of securing review in this Court. Rule 8-201 states, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cthe only method of securing review by the Court of Special Appeals is by the filing of a notice of appeal within the time prescribed in Rule 8-202.\u201d Rule 8-202(a) provides that, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this Rule or by law, the notice of appeal shall be filed within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order from which the appeal is taken.\u201d Finally, Rule 8-202(e) states that, \u201c[i]f one party files a timely notice of appeal, any other party may file a notice of appeal within ten days after the date on which the first notice of appeal was filed or within any longer time otherwise allowed by this rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>Rather than filing a timely notice of appeal, Greise filed a \u201cMotion to Join Appeal as Party Plaintiff.\u201d This motion was filed beyond the time permitted in Rule 8-202(e). Therefore, appellee contends, Greise should not have been permitted to join in this appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">As this Court held in <em>Maxwell v. Ingerman, </em>107 Md.App. 677, 670 A.2d 959, <em>cert. denied, </em>344 Md. 117, 685 A.2d 451 (1996), the time requirement in Rule 8-202(e) is not jurisdictional. Therefore, this Court has the \u201cpower to entertain\u201d appeals by other parties filed later than the time allowed by the rule. <em>Id. </em>at 680, 670 A.2d 959. In <em>Maxwell, </em>we explicitly stated, \u2018We shall adopt the view that the time requirement in Rule 8-202(e) is <em>not </em>jurisdictional in nature but rather serves simply to limit the scope of review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681, 670 A.2d 959 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aix\">From a jurisprudential perspective, there is much to be said for the view that the initial appeal, timely filed, suffices to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court over the entire case____ Upon the filing of that appeal, all issues become open for potential consideration, limited only by standing and preservation impediments\u2014e.g., raising the issue below, presenting a sufficient record, and properly raising the issue in the briefs____ The time requirement for the initial appeal has far greater significance and thus justifies a jurisdictional mantle. The true finality of the judgment is affected. That is not so much the case with cross-appeals, for once one appeal is timely noted, the parties and, constructively, the world, know that the judgment is in some potential jeopardy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-11\"><em>Maxwell, </em>107 Md.App. at 682, 670 A.2d 959.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">In this ease, once the Fund filed a timely notice of appeal, Pennel was on notice that the court\u2019s judgment was in potential jeopardy. At that time, \u201call issues became open for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>consideration\u201d by this Court, limited by the doctrines of standing and preservation. Here, the only issue before us was whether appellee was a \u201ccovered employee\u201d within the meaning of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. The scope of our review was thus limited to this question. When Greise filed a motion to join in the appeal, the scope of review did not broaden. Indeed, the brief Greise filed in this Court \u201cadopt[ed] in its entirety the brief of March 7, 2000, filed by the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund,\u201d adding no additional issues for our review. Regardless of these considerations, however, the Court\u2019s holding in <em>Maxwell </em>makes it clear that the time limitation in Rule 8-202(e) is not jurisdictional. Therefore, the court did not err in permitting Greise to join in the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">We hold that the circuit court properly included the value of the breakfasts prepared for appellee in its computation of \u201cpayroll\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. In addition, we hold that the court applied the correct standard of review in reaching its decision and that Greise was properly joined in the appeal. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Allegany County.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b307-12\">. The Fund and Greise are collectively referred to as \"appellants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\">. As appellee notes in his brief to this Court, these definitions fail to provide guidance as to what constitutes \"pay,\u201d an \"amount due,\" or \u201ccompensation.\u201d The definitions of each of these words in the dictionaries we have referenced are broad enough to include forms of payment beyond money.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b317-9\">. During oral argument and in their brief to this Court, appellants argue that, because the word \"meals\u201d in \u00a7 9-602(a)(2)(ii) is \"part of a series of words\u201d including housing, lodging, and rent, the \"meals\u201d referred to \"are meals in connection with living or sleeping accommodations.\u201d We disagree with appellants\u2019 interpretation of the Act. The Act does not limit the consideration of meals to a particular context; rather, meals are simply listed as another \"advantage\" to be included in the computation of wages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\">. The value of the meals was based on $3.00 per day times six days per week times 51 weeks, which equals $918.00.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\">. This is in contrast to filing, for example, a notice of appeal with the circuit court clerk, pursuant to Rule 8-201(a), to later pursue the matter in this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b323-13\">. We recognize that the holding in <em>Maxwell </em>was in the context of a cross-appeal filed beyond the time limitations in the rule. This factual distinction is immaterial, however, as the Court\u2019s holding addressed Rule 8-202(e) in its entirety.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
