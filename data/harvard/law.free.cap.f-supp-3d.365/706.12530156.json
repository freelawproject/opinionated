Doc. 20) and Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on Atlantic Specialty Insurance Company's Duty to Defend (R. Doc. 21); Blanchard Contractors' Motion for Summary Judgment on La. R.S. 9:2780.1 (R. Doc. 32), Atlantic Specialty Insurance Company's Motion for Summary Judgment on Insurance Coverage (R. Doc. 30); and Excess Underwriters' Motion for Summary Judgment (R. Doc. 55). Having considered the parties' briefs and the applicable law, the Court now issues this Order and Reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This insurance coverage dispute arises out of a natural gas pipeline explosion. A master services agreement (\"MSA\") between Blanchard Contractors, Inc. (\"Blanchard\") and Phillips 66 Company (\"P66\") governed the work on the pipeline and included a \"knock-for-knock\" indemnity agreement, whereby Blanchard agreed to indemnify P66 for personal injury claims of Blanchard employees, regardless of fault, and vice versa. The MSA also required Blanchard to procure general liability insurance naming P66 as an additional insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Employees of P66 and Blanchard were performing a \"pigging\" operation on a segment\n   of the pipeline when the explosion occurred. The pipeline was carrying commingled, raw grade natural gas liquid from a gathering facility in Venice, Louisiana to the Enterprise Norco Fractionation Plaint in Norco, Louisiana, where it would be fractionated and processed. R. Doc. 20-3 at 2. Blanchard employees Desmond Calloway and Jacob Jambon sued P66 for personal injuries stemming from the explosion, and P66 demanded defense and indemnity from Blanchard. Blanchard presented P66's claims to its insurer, Atlantic Specialty (\"Atlantic\"), and Atlantic filed this declaratory judgment suit seeking a declaration that the indemnity and insurance provisions in the MSA are void and unenforceable under the Louisiana Anti-Indemnity Act, La. R.S. 9:2780.1. In response, P66 filed a counterclaim against Atlantic and a third-party demand against Blanchard, seeking a declaration that the indemnity and additional insured provisions of the MSA are valid and enforceable. Finally, Excess Underwriters subscribing severally to Policy No. TMU-407387 (\"Excess Underwriters\") move for summary judgment that P66 is not an additional insured under their policy and is owed no coverage. R. Doc. 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PRESENT MOTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Applicability of the Louisiana Anti-Indemnity Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   P66 moves for partial summary judgment on its counterclaim and third party demand. P66 asks the Court to issue a judgment (1) declaring that the Louisiana Anti-Indemnity Act does not invalidate the indemnity and insurance provisions in the MSA and (2) dismissing with prejudice Plaintiffs' claims seeking a declaration that the indemnity and insurance provisions are unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Blanchard opposes and moves for summary judgment that the Louisiana Anti-Indemnity Act voids any duty to defend or indemnify P66 for personal injury claims of Blanchard employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

REV. STAT. \u00a7 2780.1(A)(2)(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   P66 first argues that the MSA does not fit within this definition because it governed work on a \"hazardous liquids\" pipeline, not a \"gas\" pipeline. P66 makes this argument despite initially referring to the pipeline as a \"gas\" line - R. Doc. 20-3 at 2 (\"Employees of P66 and Blanchard were performing a pigging operation on a segment of a natural gas liquid pipeline\"); R. Doc. 20-3 at 11 (\"It is undisputed that the work being performed on the Pipeline occurred at a point after gas was comingled\"); R. Doc. 4 at 17 (\"The\n   <em>\n    Calloway\n   </em>\n   suit alleges various causes of action against Phillips 66 for bodily injury sustained by Desmond Calloway while performing maintenance on the natural-gas pipeline\") - and later arguing that the pipeline is removed from the scope of LAIA under the exception for gas gathering lines and oil flow lines carrying commingled gas. The pipeline is a \"gas line\" under the ordinary meaning of the term and, in any event, qualifies as a \"structure\" or \"improvement to real property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   P66 next argues that the MSA is removed from the scope of LAIA by two of its provisions. The first is Subpart (E):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The provisions of this Section are not intended to, nor shall they be judicially interpreted, to alter, add to, subtract from, amend, overlap, or affect the provisions\n   of [the Louisiana Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   LA. REV. STAT. \u00a7 2780.1(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Louisiana Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act (LOAIA) voids indemnity and insurance provisions in contracts that \"pertain to a well.\" Its applicability is determined under a two-part test:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   First, there must be an agreement that \"pertains to\" an oil, gas or water well. If the contract does not pertain to a well, the inquiry ends. Only if we determine that the contract has the required nexus to a well may we proceed to the second step of the process, examination of the contract's involvement with \"operations related to the exploration, development, production, or transportation of oil, gas, or water.\" ... Therefore, if (but only if) the agreement (1) pertains to a well, and (2) is related to exploration, development, production, or transportation of oil, gas, or water, will the Act invalidate any indemnity provision contained in or collateral to that agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Transcon.

LOAIA thus does not invalidate indemnity provisions in contracts that pertain to pipelines past the point of commingling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Amoco Production Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515863\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/5/949/\">\n    5 F.3d 949\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   It is undisputed that the MSA involved in this case covered work on a pipeline past the point of commingling - so the MSA did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   \"pertain to a well\" and is not within LOAIA's anti-indemnity scope. To hold that LAIA invalidates the indemnity provisions of the MSA that are not invalidated by LOAIA, P66 argues, would impermissibly \"add to\" the scope of LOAIA. But where, as here, a contract does not \"pertain to a well\" and is never within the scope of LOAIA, it is not altered or overlapped by the application of LAIA, a separate anti-indemnity statute governing a different and broader class of contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   P66 next argues that the MSA falls within LAIA's \"co-mingled for transportation\" exception to the definition of construction contract:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \"Construction contract\" shall not include any design, construction, alteration, renovation, repair, or maintenance of ... [o]il flow lines or\n   <strong>\n    gas gathering lines\n   </strong>\n   used in association with the transportation of production\n   <strong>\n    from oil and gas wells from the point that oil and gas becomes co-mingled for transportation\n   </strong>\n   to oil storage facilities or gas transmission lines.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   LA. REV. STAT. \u00a7 2780.1(A)(2)(b)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   P66 contends that this exception is not limited to \"gathering\" lines, but that it \"begins in the gathering lines and continues through the transportation process\" - such that any pipeline carrying commingled gas is exempt. This interpretation, though, runs contrary to the plain text of the statute and principles of statutory interpretation. \"Courts should give effect to all parts of a statute and should not adopt a statutory construction that makes any part superfluous or meaningless,\" and must presume that \"every word, sentence, or provision in a statute was intended to serve some useful purpose, that some effect be given to each such provision, and that the Legislature used no\n   unnecessary words or provisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Sultana Corp. v. Jewelers Mut. Ins.

Civ. Code art. 9\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   LAIA first states that it applies to contracts for the \"design, construction, alteration, renovation, repair, or maintenance\" of \"oil lines\" and \"gas lines.\" LA. REV. STAT. \u00a7 2780.1(A)(2)(a). It then carves out an exemption for \"oil flow lines\" and \"gas gathering lines\" carrying commingled oil or gas. LA. REV. STAT. \u00a7 2780.1(A)(2)(b)(ii). Under the clear statutory language, Subpart (A)(2)(b)(ii)'s \"co-mingled for transportation\" exception applies only to oil flow lines and gas gathering lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The MSA thus falls within the scope of LAIA unless the pipeline was a \"gas gathering\" line. P66 argues there is a material question of fact as to whether the pipeline was a \"gathering\" line or was functioning in a \"gathering\" capacity, since it was transporting gas to a further downstream processing facility. Blanchard responds that it cannot be a gathering line because it is a post-processing pipeline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   LAIA does not define \"gathering line.\" The Code of Federal Regulations, however, defines gathering line as line as \"a pipeline that transports gas from a current production facility to a transmission line or main.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20192.3\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 192.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And then what our pipeline was doing was simply taking that raw make pass through from the VESCO and sending it all over to Shell Norco, but Shell Norco was going to be processed and fractionated.\"). The pipeline involved here is a post-processing pipeline, and because it did not come from a \"current production facility,\" it is not a gas gathering line.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Atlantic Specialty's Duty to Defend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Under the Atlantic Policy (the \"Policy\") issued to Blanchard, Atlantic agreed to defend an \"insured\" against any suit seeking damages for bodily injury to which the Policy applies. \"Insured\" includes any organization Blanchard is obligated by an \"insured contract\" to include as an additional insured with respect to liability arising out of Blanchard's work. R. Doc. 21-7 at 32 \"Insured contact\" includes an agreement pertaining to Blanchard's business in which Blanchard assumes the tort liability of another party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26. Because the MSA (1) required Blanchard to obtain general commercial liability insurance including P66 as an additional insured and (2) required Blanchard to assume P66's liability for suits arising out of personal injury of Blanchard employees in connection with a service order; and (3) a suit was commenced against P66 for bodily injury arising out of Blanchard's work, P66 argues that Atlantic owes a duty to defend. Atlantic opposes and moves for summary judgment holding that LAIA voids any duty to defend or indemnify P66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   P66 is correct to note that an insurer's duty to defend is separate from - and broader than - its duty to indemnify. LAIA, however, voids any duty of Atlantic to indemnify or defend P66 in the\n   <em>\n    Calloway\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Jambon\n   </em>\n   suits as a matter of law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [A]ny provision, clause, covenant, or agreement contained in,\n   <strong>\n    collateral to\n   </strong>\n   , or affecting a ... construction contract which\n   <strong>\n    purports to indemnify, defend, or hold harmless\n   </strong>\n   , or has the effect of indemnifying, defending, or holding harmless, the indemnitee from or against any liability for loss or damage resulting from the negligence or intentional acts or omissions of the indemnitee, an agent or employee of the indemnitee, or a third party over which the indemnitor has no control is contrary to the public policy of this state and is\n   <strong>\n    null, void, and unenforceable\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [A]ny provision, clause, covenant, or agreement contained in, collateral to, or affecting a ... construction contract which\n   <strong>\n    purports to require an indemnitor to procure liability insurance\n   </strong>\n   covering the acts or omissions or both of the indemnitee, its employees or agents, or the acts or omissions of a third party over whom the indemnitor has no control is\n   <strong>\n    null, void, and unenforceable\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   LA.

RP 80 generally defines a \"gathering line\" as a pipeline that transports gas from \"the furthermost downstream point in a production operation to the furthermost downstream\" point of the gathering operation, which can be a gas processing plant, gas treatment facility, gas gathering compressor, point of commingling of gas from two or more fields, or point of connection of the gathering line to another pipeline.\" RP 80 \u00a7 2.2.1.2. The Code of Federal Regulations \"provides three limitations on these endpoints: (1) the endpoint may not extend beyond the first processing plant; (2) the point of commingling of gas may not be from fields more than 50 miles from one another; and (3) the endpoint may not extend beyond the furthermost downstream compressor used to increase pressure.\" James Curry,\n    <em>\n     What Producers Need to Know About the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - Jurisdiction and Changes Ahead\n    </em>\n    , Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Foundation Special Institute, 2018;\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20192.8\">\n     49 C.F.R. \u00a7 192.8\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    43 La.
