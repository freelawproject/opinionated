Accordingly, the presumption of public access has attached to all the sealed filings in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    B. With One Limited Exception, the Presumption of Access Has Not Been Rebutted\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Public Should Have Full Access to the Parties' Legal Briefings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The parties filed their papers relating to their motions for summary judgment, supporting memoranda of law,\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motions, and motions in limine under seal. These matters were submitted to the Court for adjudication, and the Court finds that unsealing of these papers is critical for the public to be able to understand the reasoning and substantive effect of the Court's orders herein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For Plaintiffs' part,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   their claims of good cause can be summarized as follows: (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   the references to pornography and webmaster conferences is irrelevant and unduly prejudicial, and do not relate to public officials or public concerns; (2) the references to internal private business communications, finances, and/or personal relationships are irrelevant to public parties or concerns; (3) references various non-parties' testimony should be redacted to protect those non-parties or Defendants; and (4) references to alleged unlawful acts of third parties and \"Methbot\" are hearsay and unreliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   None of these grounds is persuasive. First, the Dossier at the heart of this case states, in pertinent part, that a source:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   reported that over the period March-September 2016 a company called XBT/Webzilla and its affiliates had been using botnets and porn traffic to transmit viruses, plant bugs, steal data, and conduct \"altering operations\" against the Democratic Party leadership. Entities linked to one Alexei GUBAROV [sic] were involved and he and another hacking expert, both recruited under duress by the FSB, Seva KAPSUGOVICH were significant players in this operation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs brought this defamation action to challenge Defendants' report of the Dossier without independently verifying the truth of the Dossier's contents. Thus, the allegations and evidence about pornography, \"bots\" and non-party \"wrongdoing\" directly flow from the Dossier and speak to key issues in the case. Further, Plaintiffs' alleged connections to pornography and webmaster conferences (including sponsors and attendees of the conferences) were used by Defendants-albeit unsuccessfully-in support of their public figure analysis. Even though Plaintiffs deny the legal significance of these allegations (and appear to be embarrassed by them), the allegations and evidence also help explain the Court's Order on the cross-motions for summary judgment on public figure status (D.E. 385). The Court is guided by\n   <em>\n    Romero\n   </em>\n   and the Eleventh Circuit's caution that a party's \"denial\" of allegations \"is not a legitimate basis for sealing the evidence.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895395\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/1234/#p1245\">\n    480 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1247 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201911445\">\n    2013 WL 1911445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (\"personal embarrassment and general, reputation-damaging information typically do not justify sealing\" (collecting cases) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Moreover, as Defendants correctly point out, many of the sealed briefings are\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' own\n   </em>\n   filings. Plaintiffs framed the issues and brought to the Court's attention subjects they now object to as irrelevant or inflammatory. It is only natural that Defendants referenced these subjects in their opposition papers and their primary filings-Plaintiffs themselves placed the subjects at issue. The relevance of these subjects cannot be disputed in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As to the claim that publication would taint the potential jury pool, this claim is moot because this Court has already entered final judgment. True, the final judgment is pending appeal. But even if the judgment were reversed and the case were to be tried, the Court would follow the Eleventh Circuit's rationale in\n   <em>\n    Romero\n   </em>\n   : (1) pretrial publicity, even if pervasive and concentrated, cannot be regarded as leading automatically to an unfair trial; and (2) because the media has already reported on the sealed information, sealing could not remedy any of the highly unlikely harms that could be caused by pretrial publicity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895395\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/1234/#p1245\">\n    480 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1247 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Deen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201911445\">\n    2013 WL 1911445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (\"Even a casual internet search immediately reveals that the jury-taint horse has already left the barn.\"). Additionally, Plaintiffs have recourse to correct any alleged misinformation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Romero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3895395\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/1234/#p1245\">\n    480 F.3d at 1247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert\n   the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Whitney v.

Kramer and Steele designated their testimony as confidential and objected to the unsealing of this testimony. Fusion GPS failed to timely file a position statement on unsealing, despite receiving notice of its right to do so. Any claim by Fusion GPS of a continued confidentiality interest, then, is waived. The objections of Messrs. Kramer and Steele are discussed in more detail below. For now, it suffices to say that any alleged harm to non-parties is conclusory and speculative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, the parties' exhibit lists and pretrial stipulations should be subject to public inspection. The trial would have been open to the public anyway. There is no good cause to conceal these critical parts of the pretrial process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Public Should Have Full Access to the Materials Filed in Support of the Parties' Legal Briefings, Particularly Where Those Materials Were Claimed to Be Confidential by Only a Party or Parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Applying the good cause balancing test for the materials filed along with the parties' briefings, the balance tips in favor of disclosure. As to the Times' motive for seeking access to the sealed documents, news reporting is a \"legitimate purpose\" for granting access to sealed court records, as it tends to \"promote the public's understanding of the proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Abegg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1993%20WL%20246145\">\n    1993 WL 246145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (S.D. Fla. 1993). And as explained above, refusing public access would impair public understanding of judicial decision-making. Granting public access is likely to promote public understanding of historically significant events-not only this lawsuit, but also the evidence of the events underlying the Dossier (even if such evidence is disputed or only arguably relevant).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   On the other side of the scale, the degree and likelihood of potential injury is negligible, particularly where the parties have had, and continue to have, ample opportunity to respond to the information in the court of public opinion. Further, the media has already reported on much of the underlying information. Indeed, many of the sealed filings are internet publications (even if not currently publicly accessible)-for example, articles by CNN, Gizmodo, BBC News, Slate, Newsweek, Forbes, and the Washington Post; archived AWM Open webpages; and a \"year in review\" publication by PornHub. Others are publicly-available government reports or press releases; it makes no sense for this Court to seal something that other government actors have made public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Additionally, the \"private information\" cited by Plaintiffs is not, in the Court's view, so sensitive as to warrant shielding from the public's view.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Exposure comes with the territory of seeking court intervention: if a plaintiff claims harm to his personal and professional reputation (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D.E. 1-3 \u00b6\u00b6 5, 46-51), his business and personal relationships may be publicly scrutinized. If a corporate plaintiff seeks damages for business or reputational harm (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1993%20WL%20246145\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ), the corporation's finances may be publicly scrutinized. Again, Plaintiffs mostly rely on claims of relevance and\n   scandal to support continued sealing. As explained in the prior section, these claims lack merit and do not overcome the weighty presumption of public access. If Plaintiffs wanted to keep these matters private, they should have opted to resolve their dispute out of court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Union Oil Co. of Cal. v. Leavell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11205333\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/220/562/#p568\">\n    220 F.3d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 568 (7th Cir. 2000) (Easterbrook, J.)

D.E. 407. First, he argues that unsealing his testimony in this case would allow Plaintiffs to avoid certain procedural and substantive discovery limitations in their parallel lawsuit against Mr. Steele in Britain. He argues that British law forbids Plaintiffs from taking and using Mr. Steele's testimony in their British lawsuit. Unsealing the deposition here, he argues, would amount to an \"end-run\" around this limitation. Second, Mr. Steele argues that unsealing his deposition would invite unwanted attention and potential danger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Mr. Steele's first argument is without merit and does not overcome the presumption of public access.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez-Guerrero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575265\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1224/#p1235\">\n    717 F.3d at 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In denying Mr. Steele's motion to intervene to oppose the issuance of letters rogatory, the Court explained that it trusted the British courts to adequately protect Mr. Steele's rights under British law. D.E. 60, p. 2. Mr. Steele has not explained how unsealing his deposition would allow Plaintiffs to then use his testimony against him in their British lawsuit. Moreover, Plaintiffs were able to take Mr. Steele's deposition because a British court authorized it. D.E. 156-1. And in so doing, that court considered and rejected his argument that the deposition would prejudice his defense in Plaintiff's British lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575265\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1224/#p1235\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, Mr. Steele's first argument against unsealing fails to overcome the presumption of public access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Mr. Steele's second argument is similarly unavailing. He conclusorily states that unsealing his deposition testimony would subject him to unwanted attention and potential danger. He explains that in the wake of the publication of the Dossier, he received death threats and went into hiding. He fails, however, to explain how unsealing his deposition testimony here would expose him to further danger. Confronted with a similar situation, the Eleventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Perez-Guerrero\n   </em>\n   refused to conceal a plaintiff's identity.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575265\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1224/#p1235\">\n    717 F.3d 1224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There, the plaintiff was an informant for Mexican and American law enforcement, and the Board of Immigration Appeals had found that he faced danger in Mexico.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575265\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1224/#p1235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575265\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1224/#p1235\">\n    at 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the Eleventh Circuit refused to conceal his identity because \"his name, photograph, and identity as an informant have been widely reported in the media.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575265\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1224/#p1235\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The same goes for Mr. Steele. Since the publication of the Dossier, Mr. Steele's name, photograph, and identity as its author have been widely and constantly reported in the media. Accordingly, his second argument fails to overcome the presumption in favor of public access.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575265\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1224/#p1235\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Steele's objections to unsealing, therefore, are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    David Kramer's Objections Are Overruled\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Non-party David Kramer objects to unsealing his deposition testimony and declaration because it would expose him to danger. D.E. 411. One year ago, Magistrate\n   Judge O'Sullivan ruled that Mr. Kramer's deposition testimony should remain sealed because Mr. Kramer faced potential danger if he was exposed as \"the cause-in-fact of the publication of the Dossier.\" D.E. 144, p. 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Kramer advances no new arguments in support of unsealing but relies exclusively on Magistrate Judge' O'Sullivan's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Circumstances have changed since Judge O'Sullivan entered his order. When Judge O'Sullivan sealed Mr. Kramer's testimony, Mr. Kramer's role in disseminating the Dossier was not known.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575265\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1224/#p1235\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Now, however, his role as the cause-in-fact of the Dossier's publication is known. The Court discussed Mr. Kramer's role in detail in its order on the motions for summary judgment. D.E. 389, p. 5-7. But even before then, the media had reported it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , John Haltiwanger,\n   <em>\n    John McCain describes how he received the Steele dossier that contains the most salacious allegations about Trump and Russia\n   </em>\n   , Business Insider (May 22, 2018) https://www.businessinsider.com/how-john-mccain-received-steele-dossier-trump-russia-2018-5.

Accordingly, for the same reasons the Eleventh Circuit refused to conceal the plaintiff's identity in\n   <em>\n    Perez-Guerrero\n   </em>\n   , the Court overrules Mr. Kramer's objection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575265\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1224/#p1235\">\n    717 F.3d at 1236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Bitly, Inc.'s Objections are Sustained as to D.E. 275-19\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Non-party Bitly, Inc. objects to unsealing the records it produced because the records reflect Bitly's internal processes and techniques for identifying abuses of its link shortening platform.

Specifically, as Defendants explained, Mr. Ferrante reviewed the Bitly data and \"determined that the same user account that successfully hacked [John] Podesta created four nearly identical malicious links that were encoded to appear onscreen as a Google security alert prompting Mr. Podesta to change his Gmail password-and that one of those four phishing links was created using an IP address registered to XBT subsidiary Root S.A.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575265\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/1224/#p1235\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   This Court is unsealing the Ferrante report, but not the underlying Bitly records.
