HICKS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Defendant Denis Arnulfo Andino-Matamoros has filed a motion to dismiss his indictment, which had charged him with illegal reentry by a previously deported alien. (ECF No. 16 ). The government responded (ECF No. 18 ), and defendant timely replied (ECF No. 22 ). Defendant also filed a supplemental brief in support of his motion to dismiss following the government's production of the audio recording of one of his immigration hearings. (ECF No. 25 ). The government then moved to strike defendant's supplemental filing. (ECF No. 27 ). For the reasons stated below, the Court will deny the government's motion to strike and deny defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendant, a Honduran national, first entered the United States on April 1, 2005, at or near San Ysidro, California. (ECF No. 16-1 at 3 ). He was subsequently discovered by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") in El Paso, Texas, and on May 3, 2005, was served with a Notice to Appear (\"NTA\") before an immigration court for unlawfully entering the United States. (ECF No. 16 at 2 ) An NTA is a document that the government sends to an alien that instructs the alien to appear before an immigration judge at a specific place, date, and time to determine if the alien should be removed from the United States. Defendant's NTA charged him with entering the United States without being admitted or paroled following an inspection by an immigration officer, a violation of \u00a7 212(a)(6)(A)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"). (ECF No. 16-1 at 3 ). Defendant appeared for his hearing on June 28, 2005, and he appeared at each of the five subsequent hearings as his case was continued multiple times. (ECF No. 18 at 2 ). On August 24, 2005, an immigration judge granted a request to transfer defendant's proceedings from San Antonio to Houston because he had recently relocated there. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant received three separate notices of his removal hearing during his time in Houston, but his case was eventually transferred back to San Antonio in January 2006. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3). On February 13, 2006, an immigration judge dismissed defendant's case without prejudice because his \"whereabouts [were] unknown.\" (ECF No. 16-2 at 3 ). Defendant resurfaced two years later in Miami, Florida, when he pleaded guilty to possession of 20 or more grams of marijuana. (ECF No. 16 at 2 ). Several months later, he also pleaded guilty for possession of a stolen or fictious driver's license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Based on these offenses, ICE located him in a Miami-Dade County jail and lodged an immigration detainer on him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 10, 2008, he was released into ICE custody. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Two days later on November 12, 2008, defendant received an NTA that charged him with several removable offenses: (1) the previous offense of not being admitted or paroled into the United States following an inspection by an immigration officer; (2) not being in possession of any valid entry documents as required by the INA; and (3) being convicted of the narcotics offense in Miami. (ECF No. 16-4 at 2 ). Although the NTA listed the address of the immigration court in Harlingen, Texas, it did not list the date or time for the hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the time he received the NTA, defendant was being held in ICE custody at the Willacy Detention Center in Raymondville, Texas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While still in ICE custody, defendant, along with several other aliens, appeared via video feed before an immigration judge in San Antonio on December 8, 2008. During the hearing, Defendant was advised that he was allowed to be represented by an attorney if he could procure one, provided a list of legal aid\n   organizations that could potentially represent him for free or at a reduced cost, and told that he would be given a continuance if he wished to hire a lawyer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He was also informed that he could be eligible for voluntary departure if he could arrange and pay for his own transportation back to his home country. During another alien's hearing, the immigration judge explained several aspects of voluntary departure to the group as a whole, telling them that anyone granted voluntary departure who fails to leave the United States within the allotted time would have an order of removal entered against them. They would also be subject to a civil penalty and become ineligible for voluntary departure for ten years. During defendant's hearing before the immigration judge, he admitted that he was subject to removal because he entered the country illegally, did not have valid immigration documents, and had committed a marijuana offense in Miami. Defendant stated that he wanted to apply for voluntary departure, but the government objected based on his criminal history. Because of the government's objection, the immigration judge set defendant's voluntary departure hearing for January 23, 2009, at 9:00 am. Defendant received written notice for the hearing the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant once again appeared via video feed for his January 23 hearing. At the hearing, the immigration judge stated that defendant needed to prove that he deserved voluntary departure as a matter of discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The judge also stated that defendant could either present his evidence as to why he should be granted voluntary departure or withdraw his application and have a removal order entered against him. Defendant replied by stating that he wanted voluntary departure but did not have the means to pay for it. When questioned by the immigration judge, defendant confirmed that he did not have the means to pay for his way back to Honduras. The immigration judge then informed defendant that he would be detained while he arranged for transportation back to Honduras. Defendant replied by saying that he wanted to withdraw his application for voluntary departure. The immigration judge granted defendant's request and ordered that he be deported. Following defendant's removal to Honduras, he unlawfully reentered the United States on June 19, 2009, January 2, 2014, and March 26, 2015, and he was removed each time. (ECF No. 18 at 4 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant was indicted on September 12, 2018, for a fourth alleged illegal reentry into the United States after having been previously deported. (ECF No. 1 ). He now seeks to dismiss the indictment against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) allows for an alien criminally charged under \u00a7 1326(a) for illegal reentry to challenge the validity of the predicate removal order, but only if: (1) the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order; (2) the deportation proceedings at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review; and (3) the entry of the order was fundamentally unfair. To establish the third requirement, an order of removal is fundamentally unfair if defects in the proceedings violated the alien's right to due process and he suffered prejudice as a result.\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Aguilera-Rios\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265185\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/626/\">\n    769 F.3d 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2014). Under Ninth Circuit caselaw, a defendant can\n   satisfy all three requirements by establishing that the immigration judge failed to inform him of his apparent eligibility for relief and that he had plausible grounds for relief.\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Rojas-Pedroza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569260\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1253/#p1262\">\n    716 F.3d 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1262 (9th Cir. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant seeks dismissal of his indictment on two separate grounds. First, he argues that the immigration judge misadvised and \"affirmatively misled\" him about his eligibility for voluntary departure because he told defendant that he would have to pay for his own removal. (ECF No. 16 at 8 ). Second, and in the alternative, defendant argues that pursuant to a recent Supreme Court case,\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , the immigration court lacked jurisdiction over his removal proceedings because the December 8, 2008 NTA did not list the date or time of his removal hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10). Following the close of briefing, the government submitted the audio recording of defendant's January 23, 2009 voluntary departure hearing. Defendant filed a supplemental brief following the disclosure of the recording (ECF No. 25 ), but the government filed a motion to strike the supplementation, arguing that defendant merely repeated arguments made in his motion to dismiss. (ECF No. 27 ). The Court will address the government's motion to strike first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Government's Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its motion to strike, the government seeks to strike defendant's supplemental filing in support of his motion to dismiss. The United States argues that defendant merely repeats several arguments that he previously made in his motion to dismiss and that his sole new argument is not supported by the record. (ECF No. 27 at 1 ). In response, defendant argues that he had previously requested leave to supplement in his motion to dismiss and that the government failed to cite to any applicable law in requesting that his supplementation be stricken. (ECF No. 28 at 1-2 ). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(f) gives the Court discretion to strike from a pleading an insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter. The Court may also strike arguments made for the first time in reply briefs because the opposing party is deprived of an opportunity to respond.\n   <em>\n    Provenz v. Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7644338\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/102/1478/#p1483\">\n    102 F.3d 1478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1483 (9th Cir. 1996) ;\n   <em>\n    Tovar v. U.S. Postal Service\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10517555\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/3/1271/\">\n    3 F.3d 1271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1273 n.3 (9th Cir. 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Here, the Court will not strike defendant's supplementation. As an initial matter, although defendant requested leave to file a supplement, he did so within his motion to dismiss, and the Court never granted his request. Local Rule 7-2(g) prohibits parties from filing supplementations without first obtaining leave of the Court. Defendant should have filed a separate motion and explained why he had good cause to supplement his motion to dismiss if he wanted to comment on any new information he learned from the January 23, 2009 audio recording. He did not. But even so, defendant had proper grounds to file a supplemental memo following government disclosure of the January 23, 2009 immigration hearing. The audio recording of that hearing was not available to defendant (or the government) before the close of the briefing schedule. Therefore, he will be allowed to supplement his argument based on what was contained on the audio recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendant's Eligibility for Voluntary Departure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant first argues that his January 2009 removal was invalid because the immigration judge did not properly inform him of the requirements for voluntary departure. Defendant's chief complaint is that the immigration judge improperly\n   found that because he did not have the money to pay for his own way back to Honduras, he was not eligible for pre-conclusion voluntary departure. (ECF No. 16 at 7 ). He also accuses the immigration judge of having \"affirmatively misled\" him regarding his eligibility for pre-conclusion voluntary departure. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   There are two types of voluntary departure available once removal proceedings have been initiated - pre-conclusion and post-conclusion. As the name implies, an alien may apply for pre-conclusion voluntary departure before the conclusion of his removal proceedings, usually at his master calendar hearing.\n   <em>\n    In re Arguelles-Campos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20811\">\n    22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 813 (BIA 1999) (hereinafter\n   <em>\n    Arguelles-Campos\n   </em>\n   ). To be eligible for pre-conclusion voluntary departure, an alien must: (1) waive or withdraw all other requests for relief (i.e. asylum); (2) concede that he is removable; (3) waive appeal on all issues; and (4) not have been convicted of an aggravated felony or a terrorism-related charge.\n   <em>\n    Arguelles-Campos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20811\">\n    22 I. &amp; N. Dec. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   815 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.26\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(i). The alien is also required to present a passport or other travel document \"sufficient to ensure lawful entry into the county to which the alien is departing\" unless a travel document is not necessary for that country or it is already in the government's possession.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.26\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(i). Moreover, there is no requirement that the alien show that he has the financial means to depart at the master calendar hearing, but the alien will ultimately be responsible for securing and paying for transportation back to his country of origin.\n   <em>\n    Arguelles-Campos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20811\">\n    22 I. &amp; N. Dec. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   817 ; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The requirements for post-conclusion voluntary departure are more stringent. To qualify for post-conclusion voluntary departure, an alien must demonstrate that: (1) he has been physically present in the United States for at least one year preceding the date he was served with the NTA; (2) he has been a person of good moral character for at least five years preceding the application for voluntary departure; (3) he has not been convicted of an aggravated felony or terrorism-related offense; and (4) he has the financial means to depart the United States and intends to do so.\n   <em>\n    Arguelles-Campos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20811\">\n    22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 817 (BIA 1999) ; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(b)(1). The fourth requirement must be satisfied with clear and convincing evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20811\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Regardless of which type of voluntary departure the alien seeks, whether or not his request is granted rests within the sound discretion of the immigration judge.\n   <em>\n    Arguelles-Campos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20811\">\n    22 I. &amp; N. Dec. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   817 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.26\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In this case, the record and hearing recordings reflect that defendant asked for voluntary departure during his master calendar hearing on December 8, 2008. This would make his request one for pre-conclusion voluntary departure, and the evidence indicates that he was qualified for it. During his interaction with the immigration judge, defendant admitted that he was removable for any one of the three offenses listed on his NTA, he did not have any pending alternative requests for relief, he agreed to waive appeal, and he had not been convicted for any aggravated felonies or terrorism-related offenses. Thus, he was eligible for pre-conclusion voluntary departure. At the December 8 hearing, the government objected to defendant's request based on his criminal history. Because of the government's objection, the immigration judge set a voluntary departure hearing for January 23, 2009. Defendant's main contention is that at the January 23 hearing, the immigration judge \"mislead\" him into believing that he needed to provide proof that he had the financial means to qualify for pre-conclusion voluntary departure. (ECF No. 16 at 7-8 ). He argues that because the immigration judge purportedly\n   misstated the requirements of pre-conclusion voluntary departure, the judge failed to inform him of his \"apparent eligibility\" for relief, and as such, he is exempt from having to demonstrate the first two elements of \u00a7 1326(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   These allegations find no support in the record. At no time during the January 23 hearing did the immigration judge tell defendant that he was required to prove that he had the financial means to procure transportation back to Honduras. Instead, the immigration judge correctly stated what defendant, having already qualified for voluntary departure (hence the present hearing), had to do to obtain it:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant: The thing is that I don't have a way to be able to provide proof that I've been here for voluntary departure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Immigration Judge: Well sir, you don't need to prove that you've been here for voluntary departure. You just need to prove that you deserve voluntary departure as a matter of discretion. So you have two choices. You can withdraw your application for voluntary departure and I'll order you removed today. Or you can go forward with your application for voluntary departure and present your evidence as to why you should be granted voluntary departure as a matter of discretion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In fact, it was defendant, not the immigration judge, who first raised the issue of finances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant: I would like voluntary departure, but the thing is that I don't have the means to pay for it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Immigration Judge: To pay for what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant: For voluntary departure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Immigration Judge: You mean you don't have a way to pay for your transportation back to Honduras?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendant: No I do not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Immigration Judge: Well let's say you had a hearing on your application and it was granted. And I granted you 30 days to voluntarily depart the United States. And I'm certainly not saying that I would grant your application, but let's suppose that I did grant it. That would be under safeguards and you would be detained there until you could make your own arrangements and pay for your transportation back to Honduras. Are you aware of that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant: If I do ask for deportation, would I be deported?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Immigration Judge: Well I would order you today if you don't want to apply for voluntary departure. How soon the government would remove you to Honduras I could not say. That's up to them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendant: Can I be deported?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Immigration Judge: Do you want to withdraw your application for voluntary departure?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Immigration Judge: Alright, I order you removed to Honduras. Do you accept that decision as final?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendant: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant's statements demonstrate that he knew that he had to pay for transportation to Honduras. Instead of arguing his case for why he should have been given voluntary departure, defendant willingly chose to withdraw his application for it. It is unclear from the audio recording exactly why defendant did so, and he does not provide any explanation in his written submission. Defendant's argument that the immigration judge imposed a monetary requirement on him is belied by the judge's statement of \"[w]ell let's say you had a hearing on your application and it was granted.\" His statement came directly after defendant confirmed that did not have the means to pay for transportation to Honduras. The statement demonstrates that despite defendant confirming he could not pay, the immigration judge was still\n   considering granting his application for voluntary departure. This is not a situation where, as defendant appears to suggest, the immigration judge denied his application for voluntary departure because he could not pay or where the immigration judge tricked him into believing that it was a requirement. Instead, defendant voluntarily withdrew his application after learning that he would be held in a detention center while he arranged for his own transportation to Honduras. At no time during either the December 8 or January 23 hearings did the immigration judge misstate the operative law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In his supplement, defendant argues that he was not advised of his right to counsel during his January 23, 2009 hearing. (ECF No. 25 at 7-8 ). Defendant is correct; he was not advised of his right to counsel during\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   hearing. But the audio recording of the December 8, 2009 hearing indicates that defendant was advised of his right to counsel then and provided a list of organizations that may have represented him for free or at a reduced cost. He was also given the opportunity to ask for a continuance to procure and consult with counsel. Instead of asking for a continuance, he chose to proceed with his master calendar hearing and admitted removability to the immigration judge for the three reasons listed in his NTA. His challenge that he was not informed of his right to counsel is not supported by the evidence in the record or the audio recordings of the hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   But even if the immigration judge's conduct could somehow be construed as failing to inform defendant of his avenues for relief or even misleading him, defendant would still need to demonstrate the third requirement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), prejudice. In this context, an alien can establish prejudice by demonstrating \"plausible grounds\" for relief.\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Gonzalez-Valerio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9101566\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/342/1051/#p1054\">\n    342 F.3d 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1054 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

Defendant does not possess any of the positive equities listed above. Defendant had not been living in the United States long prior to his eventual deportation\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (roughly two years),\n   and there is no evidence to indicate that he had any family ties in the United States at the time of his removal. He has also not identified any specific humanitarian needs present at his 2009 deportation. But what is present, however, are several unfavorable factors. In the months leading up to his deportation, defendant had two very recent convictions, one for possession of narcotics and one for possessing a stolen or fictious driver's license. Additionally, shortly after defendant entered the United States, he was placed into removal proceedings, and he attended all the hearings. (ECF No. 18 at 2 ). But in January 2006, the proceedings were terminated because defendant's whereabouts were unknown. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) While there is no definitive evidence to suggest that defendant fled from his proceedings, the fact that he attended each of his six hearings throughout the summer of 2005 but then disappeared from the government's radar until his arrests in Miami in 2008 raises an inference that he purposefully chose to stop attending his hearings. In his written submissions, defendant does not mention his multiple removal proceedings from 2005 nor does he explain why he did not attend his hearings after August 2005. This is despite the fact that he received several notices from the government informing him about his hearings at multiple addresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   To support his prejudice argument, defendant cites to several cases where aliens with criminal records worse than his received voluntary departure.

Defendant makes the identical argument of the defendant in a relatively recent Ninth Circuit case,\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

There, like defendant here, the defendant attempted to argue that a grant of voluntary departure was plausible because the BIA had previously granted voluntary departure to aliens who had far worse criminal histories than he did.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569260\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1253/#p1262\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569260\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/1253/#p1262\">\n    at 1265-66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And as the Court illustrated above, defendant did not have any positive equities at the time of his first removal from the United States including no known family members also present in the country. The evidence before immigration judge amounted to that defendant had two very recent criminal convictions, no known family within the United States, and did not show up to his most recent prior removal hearings. It is thus unlikely that the immigration judge would have chosen to exercise his discretion to grant defendant voluntary departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In conclusion, defendant has not demonstrated that the immigration judge failed to inform him of his apparent eligibility for relief or that it was plausible that the immigration judge would have exercised his discretion in favor of granting defendant voluntary departure. The latter results in defendant being unable to show that he was prejudiced by his removal proceeding. Because, at a minimum, defendant cannot show that he suffered prejudice, he cannot demonstrate that his original removal order was \"fundamentally unfair,\" and he cannot satisfy \u00a7 1326(d)(3)'s requirement.\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

He argues that because\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   held that \"a putative notice to appear...is not a notice to appear\" and his November 12 NTA did not list date and time of his removal hearing, the immigration judge never had jurisdiction over him in December 2008, and thus his January 2009 removal order is invalid.

In doing so, it echoed many of the same reasons espoused by the Sixth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Hernandez-Perez. See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n    at 1159-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Ninth Circuit also found the BIA's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Bermudez-Cota\n   </em>\n   to \"easily meet\" the applicable deferential standard afforded to agencies interpreting their own regulations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n    at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Importantly, however, because the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   had received actual notice of the date and time of her removal hearing well in advance of it, the Ninth Circuit did not reach the question of whether jurisdiction vests if \"she had not received this information in a timely fashion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Based on the Sixth Circuit's reasoning, the Ninth Circuit's binding opinion in\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   , and the Court's own interpretation of the operative statutes and regulations, the Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable in this case and has no relevance to an immigration court's jurisdiction. Therefore, the Court will reject defendant's jurisdiction argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   But there is still one more wrinkle with defendant's case. While it is uncontested that defendant received an NTA without the date and time on November 12, 2008, it is unclear whether he received the notice of the date and time prior to his initial master calendar hearing on December 8. Both defendant (despite his having actual knowledge of the events) and the government appear to believe that he received notice on December 8, 2008, that his removal hearing was scheduled for the morning of January 23, 2009. But as the Court related in the first section of this order, defendant, while in custody at an immigration detention center, appeared via a video feed before an immigration judge for his master calendar hearing on December 8, 2008. At the time of his master calendar hearing, defendant had been in continuous immigration custody since being arrested by ICE November 10, 2008. Defendant's situation is thus different from the petitioner's in\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   and the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Hernandez-Perez\n   </em>\n   ; despite not knowing when the hearing was, defendant was never in any danger of missing it because he was in government custody and was not free to leave. But on the other hand, there is also no evidence to indicate that while defendant was in custody, he was either formally or informally told of when he would be appearing before the immigration judge. He did, however, receive sufficient notice of his January 23, 2009 voluntary departure hearing well in advance. (ECF No. 16-5 at 1 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   There is little caselaw addressing proper notice to an alien who is being held in continuous immigration detention. As stated above, in\n   <em>\n    Karingithi\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit did not reach the question of what happens in a situation where an alien did not receive the date and time of a removal hearing in a \"timely fashion.\"\n   <em>\n    Karingithi v. Whitaker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519741\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/913/1158/\">\n    913 F.3d 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1162 (9th Cir. 2018). The situation before the Court appears to be the exact case that the Ninth Circuit commented on in\n   <em>\n    Karingithi.\n   </em>\n   In the cases the Court has found where an alien appeared for his immigration hearing via video feed, he always received a Notice of Hearing prior to his master calendar hearing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Zapata-Cortinas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528790\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/1006/\">\n    351 F.Supp.3d 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D.

Ohio Oct. 18, 2018). That is not the case here. Given the fact that there is no evidence in the record to indicate that defendant received notice of the date and time of his removal hearing, the Court must find that the NTA was statutorily deficient and that defendant did not receive proper notice of his removal hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   But just because defendant never received statutorily valid notice of his removal hearing does not mean that his collateral attack automatically succeeds. The question of whether an alien defendant is exempted from having to satisfy the three requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) when the underlying removal order is void because of lack of notice has split District Courts around the country. Some courts have held that an alien is exempt from satisfying \u00a7 1326(d) if he can show that his underlying removal order was void for want of notice.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

The fact that Congress specifically added \u00a7 1326(d) in response to a case where multiple criminal defendants had alleged that their prior removal orders were invalid indicates Congress did not intend for aliens like defendant here to avoid \u00a7 (d)'s requirements in any circumstance. Simply put, a prior lawful removal order is not a perquisite for a conviction for illegal reentry charge under \u00a7 1326(a). The argument that a defendant alien cannot be convicted of a \u00a7 1326(a) illegal reentry charge based on an unlawful predicate removal order has previously been rejected by several Circuits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Earle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2912151\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/488/537/#p547\">\n    488 F.3d 537\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 547 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"In an illegal reentry prosecution, the lawfulness of deportation simply is not an element of the offense.\");\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Paredes-Batista\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1318541\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/140/367/#p376\">\n    140 F.3d 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 376 (2d Cir. 1998) (\" Section 1326 does not, on its face, require that the earlier deportation have been \"lawful\" to support a conviction for illegal reentry.\");\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Murguia-Marquez\n   </em>\n   , 687 Fed. App'x. 736, 738 (10th Cir. 2017). Defendant thus cannot bypass \u00a7 (d)'s stringent requirements because his January 2009 removal order was invalid for lack of notice or any other reason. And as the Court determined in the previous section, defendant has failed to demonstrate that he either meets or, under Ninth Circuit precedent, is exempted from meeting the requirements of \u00a7 (d). The Court will accordingly deny his motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
