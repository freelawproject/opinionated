Cole (\"Plaintiff\") commenced this putative class action, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, on March 20, 2018, alleging that defendant Stephen Einstein &amp; Associates, P.C. (\"Einstein\") and Second Round, L.P. d/b/a Third Round, L.P. (\"Second Round\") (collectively, \"Defendants\") sought to collect a debt from Plaintiff and others in violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"FDCPA\"). (Dkt. 1). Plaintiff claims that the collection letter he received from Einstein failed to articulate that the \"charges or fees\" identified therein related only to those incurred after Plaintiff's debt had been charged off. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 20 at 6). According to Plaintiff, Einstein's letter was misleading because it could be interpreted as reflecting all charges or fees incurred since the account's inception. (Dkt. 25 at 11). Plaintiff also claims that because his credit account had accrued interest at a rate exceeding that permitted by New York's usury statutes while the balance was pending with the original creditor, Defendants unlawfully attempted to take or receive interest in violation of New York law by seeking to collect the principal due after the account was charged off. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 20 at 7-8; Dkt. 25 at 19-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Presently before the Court are Defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and request for sanctions (Dkt. 22), and Plaintiff's cross-motion for sanctions (Dkt. 25). For the following reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted, Plaintiff's Amended Complaint is dismissed, and Defendants' and Plaintiff's respective motions for sanctions and costs are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are drawn from Plaintiffs Amended Complaint unless otherwise indicated and are assumed true for purposes of this motion. (Dkt. 20). On April 12, 2017, Einstein mailed a letter to Plaintiff seeking to collect an alleged debt relating to a Lowe's credit card account (the \"Letter\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13-14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 20-1). Although the Letter stated, \"CHARGES OR FEES: $ 0.00,\" Plaintiff alleges that, \"[u]pon information and belief,\n   substantial amounts of late fees have accrued on this account.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 15-16). Plaintiff further alleges that \"interest at the rate of 26.99% APR had accrued on this credit card.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17). In addition, because Second Round allegedly \"controls, approves, supervises, and oversees Einstein's collection activities\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18), \"Einstein is Second Round's agent\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff has identified two putative classes, one for each cause of action asserted in his Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-9). Plaintiff alleges that members of the first putative class were harmed because, \"[b]y falsely stating that the amount of accrued charges or fees was '$ 0.00,' Einstein made a false and misleading representation in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38). Plaintiff also states that because \"interest at the rate of 26.99% APR had accrued on this credit card[,] ... Einstein attempted to collect interest at a rate which exceeds New York's maximum rate under its criminal usury state.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 52-53). As a result, Plaintiff claims that members of the second putative class were harmed by Einstein's misrepresentation of the \"character, legal status, or amount of the debt\" as well as its ability to collect interest above the rate set by New York's criminal usury statute, and by Einstein's threat \"to collect interest which could not legally be collected\" and its collection of interest in \"[a]n amount which was not permitted by New York law,\" all in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692e, (2)(A), (5), and 1692f(1). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 54-57). Plaintiff further alleges that Second Round is vicariously liable for Einstein's conduct because Einstein is Second Round's agent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 43-44, 60-61). Plaintiff seeks statutory and actual damages on behalf of himself and the members of the putative classes as well as recoupment of reasonable attorney's fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 20, 2018, Plaintiff commenced this putative class action against Defendants, alleging that the Letter constituted \"a false and misleading representation in violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e.\" (Dkt. 1 at \u00b6 36). On May 4, 2018, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs complaint (the \"first motion to dismiss\"). (Dkt. 17). Defendants' notice of motion did not indicate whether they intended to submit reply papers in further support of their motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Fourteen days later, Defendants filed an \"amended motion to dismiss.\" (Dkt. 19). The amended motion to dismiss consisted solely of an amended notice of motion that stated Defendants' intent to file reply papers in support of the first motion to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 22, 2018, Plaintiff filed his Amended Complaint, which remains the operative pleading in this matter. (Dkt. 20). Three days later, Plaintiff filed his response to Defendants' first motion to dismiss, arguing that the motion had been rendered moot as a result of his filing of the Amended Complaint. (Dkt. 21). On June 5, 2018, Defendants filed a third motion to dismiss, which also included a request for court-ordered sanctions and costs. (Dkt. 22). Plaintiff opposes Defendants' third motion to dismiss. (Dkt. 25). On July 11, 2018, the Court granted Plaintiffs request to file a sur-reply in further opposition to Defendants' third motion to dismiss (Dkt. 28), which was filed the next day (Dkt. 29). On November 2, 2018, Defendants filed a notice of supplemental authority, drawing the Court's attention to a recent Second Circuit decision. (Dkt. 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Defendants' First and Amended Motions to Dismiss Are Dismissed as Moot\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After Plaintiff filed his original Complaint on March 20, 2018 (Dkt. 1), Defendants filed the first motion to dismiss on May 4, 2018 (Dkt. 17).
