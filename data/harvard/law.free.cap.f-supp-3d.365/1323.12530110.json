Without more, Commerce's identification of Thailand as a significant producer based on this ranking among exporters is arbitrary and lacks substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Commerce also relied on Thailand's ranking as the largest exporter among the countries that it considered to be at the same level of economic development as China.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2nd Remand Results at 6. Separately, however, Commerce acknowledged its policy of\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   determining significance relative to the comparative production of the potential surrogate countries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271092\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/1159/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 36 (citing Policy Bulletin 04.1). Commerce's policy acknowledges that a country's level of economic development is irrelevant to whether that country's production (or exports) of a given product may be considered \"significant.\" Commerce is not irrevocably committed to this policy; however, its diametrically opposite approach in this case, absent any explanation, cannot be sustained. Accordingly, Thailand's ranking among this group of countries is not substantial evidence that Thailand is a significant producer of comparable merchandise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   With respect to net exports, Commerce asserted that \"[a] country's status as a net exporter supports a finding of significant production because, as noted above, we interpret 'significant' to mean a noticeably or measurably large amount.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Precisely why Commerce considers this to be the case here is unclear. While Commerce has defined \"significant\" as \"noticeably or measurably large,\" Commerce has not explained why having net exports signifies significant production. Commerce further asserted that \"when a country is a net exporter, the assumption is that it produces more than it imports and consumes,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; however, the extent to which this is relevant to finding significant production depends, in part, on the amount of domestic consumption. Here, Commerce has failed to identify record evidence of Thailand's domestic consumption, if there is any. The pertinent question then, is whether significant production may reasonably be inferred from Thailand's net export quantity for the relevant period, which was 1,172,897 kg.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 &amp; n.31 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   To that end, Commerce asserted that record evidence enabled a comparison of the net exports of Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Commerce noted that Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia had net export quantities of 1,172,897 kg, 60,662,341 kg, and 11,112,825 kg, respectively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8. But without actually analyzing the information, Commerce simply asserted that Policy Bulletin 04.1 provides that being \"a net exporter\n   <em>\n    satisfies\n   </em>\n   the statutory requirement,\" and declared all three countries to be significant producers without addressing the disparities between their net export quantities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (emphasis added). In fact, the Policy Bulletin states that although \" 'significant producer'\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   mean a country that is a net exporter,\" Commerce should avoid \"fixed standards\" in favor of case-specific assessments dependent upon the available data, indicating that an analysis of this data is required.

In the 2nd Remand Results, Commerce circled back to some of the same reasoning the court previously rejected without addressing any of the concerns identified by the court. Moreover, Commerce's errant reasoning repeatedly ignores its own statements of practice. While Commerce is not bound by those statements of practice, it must explain its departures and has seemed unable. Therefore, the court finds that the record does not support the selection of Thailand as a significant producer. On remand, Commerce must identify a surrogate country, whether from its list of countries at the same level of economic development as the PRC or another country at a comparable level of economic development not on the list, which meets the statutory criteria and is supported by substantial evidence. Because Commerce justified its selection of surrogate values for carbonized material and financial ratios substantially on the basis that they are from the primary surrogate country,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2nd Remand Results at 13, 19, Commerce must revisit these surrogate values on remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Thus, while it may be the case that, all other things being equal, a dumping margin calculated before Commerce's policy shift would be lower than a margin calculated inclusive of an adjustment pursuant to section 1677a(c)(2)(B), there is nothing to indicate that the latter is not in accordance with law. Instead, the latter margin calculation simply includes an additional data point that Commerce was unable to include in the former.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Finally, returning to the \"policy issue\" identified in\n   <em>\n    Federal-Mogul\n   </em>\n   , adjusting EP/CEP for VAT imposed on export sales allows Commerce to calculate a tax-neutral dumping margin when normal value is calculated exclusive of VAT. In this case, as discussed in more detail below, the constructed export price reported by Jacobi includes 17 percent output VAT imposed by the Chinese government, whereas the normal value, to which it is to be compared, is determined using surrogate values that are tax-exclusive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2nd Remand Results at 25 &amp; n.108. To interpret section 1677a(c)(2)(B) as unambiguously barring Commerce from adjusting EP/CEP for these taxes when comparing those prices to a tax-exclusive normal value would be to require that it understate the margin of dumping. The court finds no support for such a requirement in the language of the statute. Thus, Commerce's conclusion that China's output VAT is an \"export tax, duty, or other charge imposed by the exporting country on the exportation of the subject merchandise\" is a permissible interpretation of section 1677a(c)(2)(B), 2nd Remand Results at 26, and the court now turns to Jacobi's arguments that the adjustment is unsupported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Jacobi suggests, however, that it calculates the net VAT payable amount\n   <em>\n    as if\n   </em>\n   it collected output VAT on U.S. sales, but that it does not actually collect output VAT on those sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jacobi's Opp'n Cmts. at 26. In making this claim, Jacobi points to no affirmative evidence demonstrating that the FOB China port value reflected in its sales documents is output VAT-exclusive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jacobi's \u00a7 AQR, Ex.

Jacobi also faults Commerce for never requesting a U.S. sales-specific VAT reconciliation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jacobi's Opp'n Cmts. at 25. However, as noted, the reconciliation document it submitted appears to include output VAT collected in connection with Jacobi's U.S. sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jacobi's Suppl. \u00a7 CQR, Ex.
