Additionally, after conducting a \"professional drone test,\" Plaintiff confirmed that the trees around the facility average 85-feet in height, with one tree reaching 100-feet, the same height as the proposed tower.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1594141\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/430/529/#p533\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27 (citing Brennan Aff., \u00b6 76) (other citation omitted).

Furthermore, after neighboring residents threatened to cut down trees on their properties to eliminate the \"natural screening\" the trees would provide to camouflage the facility, Plaintiff conducted additional tests that supported its earlier findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Moreover, notwithstanding residents' photographs of Plaintiff's balloon test, which showed that the tower would be visible from their properties, Plaintiff convincingly explained that, although the red balloon used during the test was admittedly visible through the trees and from different locations, photo simulations of the stealth monopine, designed so as to resemble the surrounding trees, conclusively demonstrated that the tower would be \"substantially screened or invisible to the majority of the locations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

With regard to Parcel B, although Defendant Town questioned the availability of Parcel B during the ZBA hearing discussing Plaintiff's application,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 27-9, ZBA Tr., at 47:25-48:5, there is nothing in the record to indicate that Defendant Town's ZBA as a whole or any of its members rejected Plaintiff's application because of the availability of other \"more feasible\" or \"less intrusive\" site locations. Rather, the Notice of Decision merely reflects a concern regarding the aesthetic impact of the facility,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the facility would produce \"an undesirable change or detriment to nearby properties,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Moreover, there is no other contemporaneous writing that indicates that Defendant Town relied on this reason to deny Plaintiff's application. Therefore, the Court finds that Defendant Town's assertion that it denied Plaintiff's application, in part, because Plaintiff had not shown that Parcel B, an allegedly \"more feasible\" location than the selected Parcel C, was not available, amounts to an impermissible\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalization. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the purported availability or feasibility of Parcel B cannot serve as a basis for denying Plaintiff's application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Similarly, Defendant Town did not mention CRAN technology at any time prior to its opposition to the pending motion, and there is nothing in the written record to indicate that Defendant Town's ZBA's denial of Plaintiff's application had anything to do with CRAN technology or Plaintiff's failure to consider the use of CRAN technology in Defendant Town. It is clear that Defendant Town's attempt to justify its February 2017 denial of Plaintiff's application on this basis is nothing more than an impermissible\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalization for its decision given that Plaintiff first proposed to use CRAN technology in another town in April 2017, \"several months\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   [Defendant] Town issued its denial.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Johnson, dated October 10, 2017 (\"Johnson Aff.\"), at \u00b6\u00b6 18-19) ) (other citations omitted). Therefore, this reason could not have possibly informed Defendant Town's decision. Accordingly, the Court rejects Defendant Town's assertion that Plaintiff should have proposed CRAN technology as an alternative to the chosen\n   facility because it is an impermissible\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   rationalization that did not form the basis for denying Plaintiff's application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     6.

To the contrary, the record demonstrates that Plaintiff has satisfied the \"public necessity\" standard because its proposed facility would only create a \"minimal intrusion\" on the community.
