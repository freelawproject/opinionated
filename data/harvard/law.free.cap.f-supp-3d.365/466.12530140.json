(D.I. 1). On May 22, 2018, Stryker filed counterclaims against Zimmer Surgical, Inc., Dornoch Medical Systems, Inc., Zimmer Inc., and Zimmer U.S. Inc.

These reissue claims are directed to a \"system for handling waste fluid\" that has two containers, each \"being configured to collect liquid waste from the patient.\" ( '920 patent, cls. 15, 29). Zimmer asserts only new reissue claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against Stryker.

R. Evid. 702. The Third Circuit has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Rule 702 embodies a trilogy of restrictions on expert testimony: qualification, reliability and fit. Qualification refers to the requirement that the witness possess specialized expertise. We have interpreted this requirement liberally, holding that a broad range of knowledge, skills, and training qualify an expert. Secondly, the testimony must be reliable; it must be based on the \"methods and procedures of science\" rather than on \"subjective belief or unsupported speculation\"; the expert must have \"good grounds\" for his or her belief. In sum,\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   holds that an inquiry into the reliability of scientific evidence under\n   Rule 702 requires a determination as to its scientific validity. Finally, Rule 702 requires that the expert testimony must fit the issues in the case. In other words, the expert's testimony must be relevant for the purposes of the case and must assist the trier of fact. The Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   that Rule 702's \"helpfulness\" standard requires a valid scientific connection to the pertinent inquiry as a precondition to admissibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   By means of a so-called \"\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing,\" the district court acts as a gatekeeper, preventing opinion testimony that does not meet the requirements of qualification, reliability and fit from reaching the jury.\n   <em>\n    See Daubert\n   </em>\n   (\"Faced with a proffer of expert scientific testimony, then, the trial judge must determine at the outset, pursuant to Rule 104(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence whether the expert is proposing to testify to (1) scientific knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Schneider ex rel.

The '920 Patent is Entitled to a Priority Date of March 4, 2002\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Zimmer moves for summary judgment that the '920 patent is entitled to a priority date of March 4, 2002. (D.I. 314 at 12). Stryker moved for summary judgment of invalidity because it argues that the '920 claims are not entitled to a priority date earlier than 2006 or, alternatively, August 2004. (D.I. 320 at 5, 7). The parties agree that entitlement to priority is a question of law to be determined at summary judgment and that no material disputes of fact exist. (D.I. 417 at 6:11-13, 12:3-7; D.I. 314 at 13 (citing case law) ). Stryker asserts that Zimmer is not entitled to a March 4, 2002 priority date for two reasons: (1) the priority chain was broken when the application for the '420 patent (of which the '920 patent is a reissue) did not reference the original '425 patent application, and (2) the disclosure of the original application does not provide the required \u00a7 112 written description support for the asserted claims. (D.I. 320 at 5, 7; D.I. 359 at 8, 10). Zimmer argues that the '420 patent does not break the priority chain and that Stryker has failed to identify a single claim limitation in the asserted claims that lacks support in the original disclosure. (D.I. 314 at 13; D.I. 351 at 2, 5).

The policy behind the doctrine of obviousness-type double patenting is to prevent parties from extending the term of their patent beyond the statutory term.

The '663 patent is a divisional of the '425 patent and also claims priority to the '425 patent. (D.I. 315-1 at 370). Stryker's asserted defense is based upon dependent claim 6 of the '663 patent, which depends from claim 5, which depends from claim 1. (D.I. 359 at 20). During prosecution, the Examiner rejected claims 1, 2, 4, and 5 as obvious. (D.I. 362-1 at 321-27). The Examiner did not reject claims 6-8, instead stating, \"Claims 6-8 are objected to as being dependent on a rejected base claim, but would be allowable if rewritten in independent form including all of the limitations of the base claim and any intervening claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 327). Zimmer did not rewrite claim 6 as an independent claim but amended claim 1 to overcome the obviousness objection. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 332-34). Stryker cites this amendment as the basis for its recapture defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Zimmer argues that Stryker's recapture defense fails as a matter of law because Stryker cannot demonstrate the deliberate surrender of subject matter in claim 6 to overcome a prior art rejection. Specifically, Zimmer argues that claim 6 was never rejected under the prior art, and the amendment to claim 1 cannot be the \"deliberate surrender\" of claim 6 subject matter under the recapture rule. I agree with Zimmer. The first step of the recapture analysis asks whether and in what aspect the reissued claims of the '920 patent are broader than those of the '663 patent. Stryker asserts the reissued claims are broader than the '663 patent. Zimmer states that I need not address this point because step two of the analysis is determinative. I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The second step of the recapture analysis asks whether there was any deliberate surrender of a claim to certain subject matter to overcome a prior art rejection. I determine there was not. The Examiner specifically provided that claim 6 was allowable if rewritten in independent form. The fact that Zimmer amended claim 1 to overcome a separate prior art rejection does not equate to a deliberate surrender of the subject matter deemed allowable\n   under claim 6. There must be evidence that an amendment or cancellation was an admission that the scope of that claim was not in fact patentable for surrender to be deliberate.\n   <em>\n    Medtronic,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8944178\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/378/503/#p518\">\n    378 F.Supp.2d at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the evidence does not indicate that the amendment of independent claim 1 was an admission that the scope of claim 6 was not in fact patentable. Because I have determined that there was no deliberate surrender under step two of the recapture analysis, I need not continue to step three. The asserted claims of the '920 patent are not invalid for reissue recapture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

Zimmer argues that Stryker overextends\n   <em>\n    Antares\n   </em>\n   because the court there relied on the failure of the specification to disclose \"the particular combinations of safety features claimed on reissue.\" (D.I. 351 at 14 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Antares\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4291314\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/1354/#p1362\">\n    771 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1363 ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   I agree with Zimmer. The '920 patent specification expressly discloses every limitation of the asserted claims. It discloses a collection cart and disposal unit without the features that Stryker identifies as new matter in the '420 patent. ( '920 patent, col. 4:64-6:40, 6:55-7:21, 8:8-20, 9:62-10:2). Therefore, the original '420 patent did more than merely suggest or indicate the invention of a collection cart and disposal unit system in the specification. This is not a case like\n   <em>\n    Antares\n   </em>\n   where the focus of the claims shifted from the original patent (jet injectors) to the reissue patents (safety features).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4291314\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/1354/#p1362\">\n    771 F.3d at 1362-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, I understand the '420 patent to describe \"independently\n   adjustable\" suction at the suction ports or suction ports arranged to have at least two levels of suction within the specification, though it does not do so explicitly. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '420 patent, col. 6:4-28). The '420 patent describes a collection cart and disposal unit. The reissue claims of the '920 patent are therefore directed to the invention disclosed in the original patent and are not invalid under the original patent requirement.

Zimmer argues that to prove its defense of intervening rights, \"Stryker must prove both that a cart was sold to a customer during the relevant time and that a later sold manifold was sold for use with that particular cart.\" (D.I. 351 at 19).

(D.I. 320 at 17). Zimmer opposes the motion for two reasons: (1) that in a two-supplier market, there is a presumption of causation for lost profits, and (2) that a dispute as to the number of suppliers in the relevant market raises a factual issue.

(D.I. 320 at 19-20). Zimmer argues that its technical expert, Mr. Meyst, has testified that the manifolds are part of the claimed infringing system because the manifold ports are the suction ports required by the claims. (D.I. 351 at 16-17). Zimmer also asserts that even if a manifold is not necessary for infringement, it is still entitled to damages for the manifold sales under a functional and economic \"single-unit\" theory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   There is a genuine dispute of material fact which precludes summary judgment as to damages on manifold sales. Stryker contends that its accused product, the Neptune 2 fluid cart, does not infringe. Zimmer's expert offers two alternate theories on infringement: that the manifold operates as the claimed suction port, or the face plate on the accused product is the claimed suction port. (D.I. 351 at 16). A\n   reasonable jury could find from the expert testimony that the manifold, when used in the system, is the suction port claimed, and therefore is part of the infringing system as a whole. Thus, there is a dispute of material fact as to whether Stryker's manifolds are part of the infringing system and subject to damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   If the manifolds are not part of the infringing system, Zimmer is not entitled to lost profits damages for the manifolds under a \"convoyed sales\" analysis as a matter of law.

The claims do not use the word \"means\" and therefore, absent evidence otherwise, the term is not a means-plus-function element. Zimmer has not shown that the term \"receiver\" fails to recite sufficient structure for performing that function. I determine that the plain and ordinary meaning of \"receiver\" is clear from the intrinsic record. The claim language itself provides sufficient structure to inform a person of ordinary skill in the art of the structure of the receiver. Claims 1, 14, and 23 explain that the receiver is \"shaped to have: a bore dimensioned to receive\" the manifold housing, \"the bore having an open distal end into which said manifold is inserted....\" ( '428 patent, col. 21:46-50). The receiver is \"formed with complementary alignment features that engage when the manifold is inserted....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   21:56-58). The specification clearly discusses components of the receiver in various embodiments and includes four columns describing the preferred embodiment of the receiver and its components. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   5:14-9:15). Thus, I determine that the appropriate construction of \"receiver\" is \"receptacle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    b. There are Material Disputes of Fact Precluding Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   There are genuine disputes of material fact that preclude summary judgment on infringement of the '428 patent. First, as to claims 14 and 23 of the '428 patent, there are genuine disputes of fact as to whether (1) the \"fluid communications path from the receiver bore into first canister\" limitation is met, (2) the \"proximal end in fluid communication with [the] first canister\" limitation is met, and (3) the canister caps or lids can be a receiver. The parties' experts disagree as to whether the opening of the receiver bore in the canister is the fluid communications path. (D.I. 351 at 26-27). Moreover, the experts have testified as to the manifolds being in fluid communication with the canister, but Zimmer's expert contends that the proximal end of the receiver bore is not in fluid communication with the canister. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28). Additionally, Zimmer points to testimony from Stryker's expert, Mr. Sheehan, that a receiver cannot be a cap. (D.I. 334 at 415). Zimmer argues that the alleged infringing receiver operates as a cap, and therefore cannot meet the claim terms of the '428 patent. (D.I. 351 at 29). Therefore, there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Zimmer infringes claims 14 and 23 the '428 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Second, as to claim 14 of the '428 patent, there is an additional dispute as to whether the manifolds satisfy the outlet at the proximal end of the housing requirement of the claims. Specifically, Dr. Layton has explained that Zimmer's systems do not have a manifold as required by claim 14. (D.I. 332, Ex. 515 \u00b6 65). Stryker contends that the opening does not need to be \"part of\" the manifold housing. (D.I. 320 at 33). Therefore, there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether this claim limitation is satisfied and summary judgment is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    12. Stryker has Not Shown that Zimmer Cannot Prove Invalidity based on Prior Art\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Stryker seeks summary judgment that the asserted claims of the '428 patent are not obvious because Zimmer cannot establish that the prior art includes multiple elements of the '428 claims.

Stryker identifies two elements of the '428 patent claims that it asserts Zimmer cannot show were present in the prior art: (1) the independent claims require a manifold to sit at an angle within a receiver, and (2) the independent claims require that when the manifold is rotated about the receiver bore axis from a first position to a second position, the \"outlet opening [when the manifold is in the second position] is located below the position of the outlet opening when [the manifold] is in the first rotational position.\" ( '428 patent, cl. 1, 14, 23). However, Zimmer has identified pieces of prior art, which its experts contend teach these elements of the '428 patent claims. (D.I. 351 at 34-35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   First, Zimmer's expert Dr. Layton identified the Adahan reference, which he asserts teaches that fluid should enter a waste container at an angle rather than vertically. (D.I. 332, Ex. 525 at 5:5-33). Moreover, a disagreement between the experts about what the Adahan reference discloses is a factual dispute about the content of the prior art.\n   <em>\n    Graham,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n    383 U.S. at 17-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n    86 S.Ct. 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Zimmer further argues that the license is not economically comparable to either the '920 or '428 patents because it licenses the rights to multiple patents, sets multiple royalty rates, is a settlement agreement, and was entered eight to eleven years before the hypothetical negotiations-a much different context than a hypothetical negotiation involving two willing licensors. (D.I. 323 at 7-9). Stryker maintains that Dr. Vellturo's opinion, relying on Stryker's technical expert, establishes that \"the 2006 Bemis License is the most relevant license in the record and is economically and technologically comparable to the accused products and the patents-in-suit.\" (D.I. 360 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The Bemis License Agreement between Dornoch, Bemis, and Educator Partnership took place on May 10, 2006, eight to eleven years before the hypothetical negotiations at issue here.

Dr. Vellturo uses broad and nebulous language to describe the technological comparability of the patents in the Bemis license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 325-1 at 112 (\"At a broad level, the patents licensed ... relate to inventions used to help reduce user exposure to surgical waste, and thus provide benefits along the same general lines as ... the '428 patent.\"); D.I. 325-2 at 66 (\"I similarly find that the inventions licensed ... provide benefits along the same general lines as the '920 Patent ed Invention.\"). Stryker's technical expert, Mr. Sheehan, also does not provide any analysis of comparability. Instead, he generally identified\n   the subject matter of the Bemis patents. (D.I. 363-1 at 42 (stations for draining and cleaning canisters, specially designed canisters, and a conduit with cleaning fluid placed within the canisters) ). \"[A]lleging a loose or vague comparability between different technologies or licenses does not suffice.\"\n   <em>\n    LaserDynamics,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523807\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/51/#p77\">\n    694 F.3d at 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Because Dr. Vellturo's analysis fails to demonstrate how technologically and economically similar or dissimilar the Bemis license is, it is unreliable.

(D.I. 360 at 13). I agree with Stryker. The start date for damages, at least in this case, is a legal issue. Moreover, Dr. Vellturo, in his reply report agreed with Dr. Mody's adjusted damages calculation using his methodology and the March 7, 2017 start date. (D.I. 363-1 at 13).

In determining whether a violation of Rule 26(a) was\n   substantially justified or harmless, courts consider the following factors: (1) the importance of the information withheld; (2) the prejudice or surprise to the party against whom the evidence is offered; (3) the likelihood of disruption of the trial; (4) the possibility of curing the prejudice; (5) the explanation for the failure to disclose; and (6) the presence of bad faith or willfulness in not disclosing the evidence (the \"\n   <em>\n    Pennypack\n   </em>\n   factors\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Konstantopoulos v.

(D.I. 32, \u00b6 11a; D.I. 86, \u00b6 6a). Thus, I agree with Stryker that Dr. Mody's disclosure of damages figures for the specimen collection manifolds is untimely. Turning to the\n   <em>\n    Pennypack\n   </em>\n   factors, Dr. Mody's opinion is undeniably important given the amount of damages sought, which weighs against excluding the evidence. There is little prejudice or surprise to Stryker, however, as Stryker's own expert, Dr. Vellturo, included those manifolds in his own damages calculations. To the extent there is any prejudice, that prejudice may be cured by permitting Stryker to file a sur-reply report. It does not appear that there was any bad faith in the belated disclosure. Therefore, Dr. Mody's opinions will not be excluded under the\n   <em>\n    Pennypack\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Additionally, I determine that Dr. Mody's opinions on specification collection manifolds are not legally flawed or unreliable. She applies the same methodology as she does for the other manifolds that Stryker sells. To the extent that Stryker disputes her analysis, that is a weight issue appropriately dealt with on cross examination. Therefore, I deny Stryker's motion to exclude Dr. Mody's analysis, but grant Stryker's request to provide a sur-reply report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

(D.I. 328 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Opinions of Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Stryker moves to exclude Mr. Lentz's opinions relying on four opinions of counsel on other Stryker patents and non-accused Zimmer products as irrelevant to willfulness. (D.I. 328 at 14). Zimmer contends that Mr. Lentz's opinions merely opine on \"corporate practice from the perspective of an in-house patent attorney\" and provide context for the factfinder to determine the issue of intent. (D.I. 353 at 15-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   I do not believe this issue is appropriately addressed under\n   <em>\n    Daubert.\n   </em>\n   The parties appear to be disputing the relevance of the opinions of counsel and Zimmer's course of conduct before the '428 patent issued. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 328 at 15 (\"[a]n opinion of counsel ... is not relevant\"); D.I. 353 at 16 (\"pre-patent issuance conduct ... is relevant\") ). This is not a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   inquiry. To the extent that these issues are relevant, Mr.\n   Lentz's opinions provide appropriate expert testimony to contextualize Zimmer's actions for the purposes of willful infringement. Therefore, Stryker's motion is denied as to Mr. Lentz's opinions regarding the opinion of counsel documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    b. State of Mind Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Stryker moves to exclude Mr. Lentz's opinions regarding the filing of the certificate of correction for the '920 patent as improper testimony on state of mind.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.I. 328 at 16). Zimmer contends that Mr. Lentz's opinion merely sets out the fact that the declarations were signed subject to penalties and ethical obligations, as well as the standard by which the Patent Office reviews the petition. (D.I. 353 at 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   I find that the majority of the testimony Stryker seeks to exclude is permissible expert opinion testimony regarding standards which are helpful to the factfinder in evaluating the behavior of Zimmer's patent prosecution counsel. However, Mr. Lentz does improperly opine on state of mind in \u00b6 84 of his report. Specifically, I will exclude the statement, \"If Mr. Johnston had realized his mistake, he almost certainly would have corrected it (especially given that he realistically had nothing to gain by not correcting it)....\" as this statement is clear improper testimony on state of mind and intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Technical Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Stryker contends that Mr. Lentz, despite not being designated as a technical expert, repeatedly offers technical opinions throughout his report. (D.I. 328 at 18). Zimmer argues that Mr. Lentz has not offered technical opinions, but rather an opinion on \"how companies analyze and clear patents when designing and releasing products.\" (D.I. 353 at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The paragraphs that Stryker seeks to exclude contain what appears to be Mr. Lentz's recitation of what Zimmer's attorneys understood at the time. However, the paragraphs also include statements by Mr. Lentz that purport to testify on a technical understanding of the '428 patent family and the differences between the patents. These statements are impermissible.\n   <em>\n    Sundance, Inc. v.

Thus, to the extent Mr. Lentz purports to provide his own opinion of technological differences, his testimony and opinion is excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Opinion of Stryker's Actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Stryker contends that Mr. Lentz's opinions regarding Stryker's prior willful infringement should be excluded as irrelevant and unhelpful to the trier of fact. (D.I. 328 at 19). While Zimmer does not dispute the irrelevancy of these opinions, it argues that Stryker's own expert, Mr. Sterne, offers an opinion that Zimmer's prior willful infringement of unrelated patents is relevant to Zimmer's alleged willful infringement of the '428 patent. (D.I. 353 at 19). I determine neither opinion is relevant or helpful to the trier of fact and exclude both experts' opinions on previous actions in regards to unrelated patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Explanation of Standard Practices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Stryker contends that Mr. Lentz's explanation of standard practices will not assist the factfinder and therefore should be excluded under Rule 702. (D.I. 328 at 19-20). Zimmer argues that Mr. Lentz provides an opinion on customary behavior which will help the jury to evaluate Zimmer's behavior regarding the '428 patent. (D.I. 353 at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Stryker asserts that Mr. Lentz's testimony is both irrelevant and meant to confuse the jury because he provides testimony about standard practices but does not opine on whether Zimmer followed those internal procedures. (D.I. 328 at 20). To the extent Mr. Lentz's opinions may give the jury a frame of reference upon which to base its conclusion about Zimmer's behavior, his opinions are relevant. Therefore, Stryker's motion is denied as to these paragraphs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

(D.I. 324 at 4). Stryker asserts that Mr. Meyst \"wrongly assessed [noninfringing alternatives] in view of the allegedly infringing products\" instead of Zimmer's products. (D.I. 324 at 5). Zimmer alleges that Mr. Meyst \"analyzed whether Stryker's proposed noninfringing substitutes had the features demanded by customers and were acceptable alternatives to the system claimed in the '920 patent\" and therefore his opinion should not be excluded. (D.I. 355 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   \"To recover lost profits, the patent owner must show 'causation in fact,' establishing that 'but for' the infringement, he would have made additional profits.\"\n   <em>\n    Grain Processing Corp. v.

Yet the parties appear to dispute whether a two-supplier market exists. (D.I. 392 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Mr. Meyst's opening report (D.I. 331, Ex. 503) and his rebuttal report (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 505) discuss noninfringing alternatives by comparing them to the accused infringing product and the patented system. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 503 \u00b6\u00b6 428-32, Ex. 505 \u00b6\u00b6 81-99). Mr. Meyst then stated at deposition that he did not compare the purported non-infringing alternatives to Zimmer's products in determining whether the purported alternatives would be acceptable. (D.I. 333, Ex. 1000 at 216:2-10). This is a legally incorrect analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   However, Zimmer also notes that Mr. Meyst's opinions \"provide Zimmer's damages expert [with] a technical perspective on the substantial features [that differ] between the [non-infringing] Neptune 1 and the [accused infringing] Neptune 2 systems,\" which underlies her apportionment analysis for reasonable royalties. (D.I. 355 at 3). Therefore, Mr. Meyst will be precluded from offering his opinions (D.I. 331 at Ex. 503 \u00b6\u00b6 428-32, Ex. 505 \u00b6\u00b6 81-99) for the purposes of noninfringing alternatives because they are unreliable and irrelevant. However, Zimmer's damages expert will not be precluded from relying on these opinions in her apportionment analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Doctrine of Equivalents Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Stryker moves to strike Mr. Meyst's doctrine of equivalents opinion on claims 20 and 35 of the '920 patent as an untimely disclosed new theory. (D.I. 324 at 5-6). Specifically, Stryker asserts that Mr. Meyst's opening report did not allege infringement of claims 20 and 35 under the doctrine of equivalents. (D.I. 324 at 6). Zimmer argues that Mr. Meyst does not offer a new opinion on reply, or if he does, that the\n   <em>\n    Pennypack\n   </em>\n   factors weigh against exclusion of Mr. Meyst's opinion. (D.I. 355 at 3-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   \"Plaintiffs should not be permitted to advance a new infringement theory in their reply report.\"\n   <em>\n    HSM Portfolio LLC v.

(D.I. 331, Ex. 503 \u00b6\u00b6 129-31, 229-31, 319-21, 412-14). After Stryker's expert offered opinions of no infringement (D.I. 334 at 94-97, 122-23), Mr. Meyst included doctrine of equivalents opinions for claims 20 and 35 for the first time. (D.I. 331, Ex. 505 \u00b6\u00b6 32-36, 40, 69-73, 77).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In determining whether to exclude expert testimony, courts consider the\n   <em>\n    Pennypack\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Konstantopoulos,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"854653\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/112/710/#p719\">\n    112 F.3d at 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While it is true that Stryker had the opportunity to depose Mr. Meyst on his infringement theories, I am not convinced that it is sufficient to cure the prejudice. If Zimmer had timely disclosed this infringement theory, Stryker's expert may have been able to assert different theories of non-infringement. Additionally, Stryker has alleged that the untimely disclosure was intentional and in bad faith because Mr. Meyst's opening report did disclose doctrine of equivalents theories for other asserted claims. (D.I. 324 at 6). While there seems to be little risk that permitting this theory would disrupt the trial, that by itself does not overcome the prejudice to Stryker. Therefore, with respect to the new infringement theory for claims 20 and 35 raised in Mr. Meyst's reply report, Stryker's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    6.

Obviousness Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   First, Stryker moves to exclude \"Dr. Layton's opinions alleging that the '428 patent claims are obvious based on the Transposal High Fluid Cart [ ] used with a 'CL100' or 'CL200' lid are unreliable because he inappropriately relies on irrelevant, insufficient and unreliable documents.\" (D.I. 324 at 2). Stryker asserts that Dr. Layton relies on unreliable facts and data in his obviousness opinion including exhibits and documents that post-date the priority date and unauthenticated exhibits and documents. (D.I. 324 at 8-11). Zimmer argues that Stryker misrepresents the facts and data Dr. Layton relies on because it fails to acknowledge certain witnesses who are familiar with the Transposal system as sold before the '428 patent's priority date. (D.I. 355 at 8-9). Moreover, Zimmer asserts that the sufficiency of the evidence is the province of the jury and an inappropriate matter for a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   motion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9). Finally, Zimmer asserts that post-priority-date or undated documents may corroborate contemporaneous documentary and physical evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Dr. Layton relies on a variety of evidence to assert that the Transposal high fluid cart had certain features prior to the critical date. To the extent he relies on\n   evidence that is undated, post-dated, or physical evidence that was possibly modified between the alleged prior sale and the examination by the expert, he has not provided any reliable basis for drawing the inference that the characteristics of the items he examined were present in a product sold prior to the critical date. \"This falls short of a reliable opinion based on [Dr. Layton's] scientific, technical or specialized knowledge, as required by Rule 702.\"\n   <em>\n    XpertUniverse, Inc. v.

Opinions Regarding \"Fluid Communications Path\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Stryker moves to exclude Dr. Layton's opinions that the accused products do not a have a \"fluid communications path\" as contrary to the court's claim construction. (D.I. 324 at 14). Specifically, Stryker attacks Dr. Layton's opinion that \"the 'fluid communications path' requires a structure and cannot be a opening or gap.\" (D.I. 324 at 14). Zimmer argues that Dr. Layton's opinions are not contradictory to the court's claim construction. (D.I. 355 at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   I construed the claim term \"a fluid communications path from the bore of said first receiver into said first canister\" consistent with its plain and ordinary meaning, \"a path for conveying fluid from the receiver bore into the first canister\". (D.I. 276 at 23). Relying on the doctrine of claim differentiation, I specifically determined that \" 'path' should be given a broader scope than 'conduit.' \" (D.I. 276 at 24). Dr. Layton's opinion is not inconsistent with that construction, nor is it an improper attempt to resurrect Zimmer's conduit argument from the Markman hearing. Therefore, Stryker's motion is denied as to Dr. Layton's opinions on the \"fluid communications path\" limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Opinions and Statements Regarding \"Housing\" and \"Outlet Opening at the Proximal End\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Stryker moves to exclude Dr. Layton's noninfringement opinions about the \"housing\" and the \"outlet opening at the proximal end [of the housing]\" because they are unreliable and based on a misunderstanding of the governing claim construction. (D.I. 324 at 15). Zimmer asserts that Stryker's motion is an attempt to request a construction of the term \"housing\" and fails to explain why Dr. Layton's opinion should be excluded. (D.I. 355 at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Dr. Layton's opinions are not inconsistent with the governing claim constructions. Dr. Layton does not suggest that the manifold must have a \"closed end.\" While I did not explicitly construe housing to mean \"outer enclosure,\" I determined that \"the disputed claims already capture[d] this requirement\" and, therefore, I did not need to read Zimmer's proposal into the disputed limitation. (D.I. 276 at 20). Thus, I do not find Dr. Layton's opinions inconsistent with the governing claim constructions. However, to the extent that Dr. Layton suggests that I defined the housing as an outer enclosure,\n   that opinion shall be excluded as contrary to what I actually held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   <strong>\n    d.

(D.I. 324 at 19). Specifically, Stryker contends that Dr. Layton never relied on a combination with Blake for claim 1 nor explained how Blake satisfied the specific elements of claim 1 in his opening report. (D.I. 324 at 20). Zimmer argues, \"Neither the Blake reference nor the combination was new or a surprise to Stryker,\" because Dr. Layton \"explained that claim 4, which depends from claim 1, would have been obvious based on the Transposal High Fluid Cart in view of Adahan and Blake.\" (D.I. 355 at 18).

The Blake reference was disclosed in Dr. Layton's initial report. It was used in an obviousness combination for a dependent claim of claim 1, which inherently implicates the independent claim's validity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Callaway Golf Co. v. Acushnet Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038296\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/576/1331/#p1344\">\n    576 F.3d 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1344 (Fed Cir. 2009). Stryker was able to depose Dr. Layton on this reply opinion, and there does not appear to be any bad faith action by Zimmer. Moreover, to the extent there is any prejudice to Stryker, I find that this prejudice can be remedied by allowing Stryker's expert to file a supplemental report addressing the Blake combination for claim 1 of the '428 patent. Therefore, Stryker's motion to strike is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Zimrner's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Priority Date (D.I. 309) is GRANTED. U.S. Patent No. RE44,920 (the '920 Patent) is entitled to a priority date of March 4, 2002 and is not invalid based on art dated after March 4, 2002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   2.

Stryker's Motion to exclude and strike opinions and testimony of Dr. Mody and Mr. Lentz (D.I. 327) is DENIED as to Dr. Mody's opinions and Mr. Lentz's opinions on the opinions of counsel and standard practices, and GRANTED as to Mr. Lentz's technical opinions, the following statement in \u00b6 84 of his report (\"If Mr. Johnston had realized his mistake, he almost certainly would have corrected it (especially given that he realistically had nothing to gain by not correcting it)....), and his opinion of Stryker's previous actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   12.
