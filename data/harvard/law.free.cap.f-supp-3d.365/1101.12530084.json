(ECF No. 42 ). Haig repeatedly claimed that Lake City Army Ammunition Plant manufactured the ammunition that he sold.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Haig also stated that he manufactures ammunition only for his personal use.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During these interviews, the agents observed reloading equipment in Haig's shop, which was in the backyard of his residence located at 4323 East Encanto Street, Mesa, Arizona. (ECF No. 1 ). Haig voluntarily provided the agents with a sample of ammunitions that he sells to customers and claimed that the ammunition from the Las Vegas crime scene would not have his tool marks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   FBI investigators subsequently forwarded evidence from the Las Vegas crime scene to a laboratory for forensic analysis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The examination revealed that: (1) two rounds of unfired .308 caliber cartridges from Paddock's hotel rooms had Haig's fingerprints; (2) the cartridges had reloading equipment tool marks; and (3) the cartridges contained armor piercing/incendiary bullets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 19, 2017, the FBI obtained and executed a search warrant at Haig's residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Law enforcement officials seized over one hundred (100) items, including live ammunition, reloading equipment, and ammunition sales records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Laboratory analysis confirmed that the ammunition from Haig's residence was reloaded armor piercing ammunition and contained tool marks consistent with the marks on the reloaded armor piercing rounds from Paddock's hotel rooms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Haig does not have a license to manufacture armor piercing ammunition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Analysis of the sales records revealed that Haig had engaged in over one hundred (100) sales of armor piercing ammunition throughout the country.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Three of these sales were with customers residing in the state of Nevada.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Law enforcement officials interviewed these customers and discovered that two of the sales occurred in person at the Cashman Center in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The third sale was an online transaction and the ammunition was shipped to a residence in Elko, Nevada.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 22, 2018, a grand jury in the District of Nevada returned an indictment charging Haig with one count of engaging in the business of manufacturing ammunition without a license in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(B) and 924(a)(1)(D).

On multiple occasions Haig made various representations in the media regarding his business, Specialized Military Ammunition (\"SMA\"), which is an Arizona limited liability company. (ECF No. 42 ). Among these representations, Haig made statements regarding his awareness of laws governing the sale of ammunition and that he runs SMA as a \"strong hobby\" rather than a business.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Now, Haig moves to exclude evidence connecting him to the October 1, 2017, shooting, including Eric Smith, Monte Swank, Jacqueline Slebrch, Michelle Reznicek, and Peter Petersen's (collectively the \"experts\") expert testimony.

(ECF No. 42 ). The repeat sales in multiple locations, including a gun show and a private residence, as well as the large quantity of ammunition sold are circumstances showing that Haig was engaged in a business. Thus, evidence of Haig's transactions with Paddock is relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The government also intends to introduce expert testimony about forensic evidence showing that Haig manufactured the ammunition that law enforcement officials recovered in Paddock's hotel rooms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ( ECF No. 42 ). Such testimony directly\n   supports the government's charge because it makes it more probable that Haig manufactured and sold ammunition. Thus, the experts' testimonies are also relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Lastly, in light of Haig's pre-trial motion in which he challenged venue, there is a substantial likelihood that Haig will challenge venue again at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 18 ).

(ECF No. 40 ). The court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    i.

However, Rule 403 does not mandate the exclusion of evidence due to the mere existence of unfair prejudice. Rather, unfair prejudice must\n   <em>\n    substantially\n   </em>\n   outweigh probative value, and the evidence at issue does not meet this exacting standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The government seeks to present evidence at trial that is uniquely probative as it includes forensic data of tool marks definitively showing that Haig manufactured the reloaded ammunition in Paddock's hotel rooms with the reloading equipment located at his residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ( ECF No. 42 ). Moreover, Haig's fingerprints show to a high degree of certainty that Haig was once in possession of the reloaded ammunition, which confirms that Haig was selling ammunition that he manufactured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ( ECF No. 42 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The government also seeks to present evidence at trial regarding Haig's interviews during the government's investigation into the October 1, 2017, shooting and Haig's public statements in the media. (ECF No. 42 ). This evidence, which largely consists of Haig allegedly lying about selling ammunition that he manufactures and Haig implying that he has a general understanding of the laws governing the sale of firearms, is compelling circumstantial evidence showing that Haig knew it was illegal to sell without a license ammunition that he manufactured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, to grant Haig's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   would be nothing\n   less than to exclude the heart of the government's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The court also emphasizes that procedural safeguards, such as jury instructions, will help minimize the risk of prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Norris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076426\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/423/732/#p734\">\n    423 F. App'x 732\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 734 (9th Cir. 2011) (\"... we must presume that juries will follow the district court's limiting instructions.\"). Moreover, the government has agreed not to present remarkably prejudicial evidence of the October 1, 2017, shooting. Thus, the court will exclude evidence that pertains to the following matters:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (1) Evidence related to the injury of victims or the Route 91 concert venue crime scene.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (2) Photographs or videos of paddock.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (3) Photographs or descriptions of Paddock's hotel rooms that do not relate to the recovery of ammunition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (4) Photographs or descriptions of Paddock's firearms that are not connected to Haig's sale of ammunition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (5) Portions of Haig's media statements that do not relate to his sale of ammunition or his transactions with Paddock.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   (6) Portions of Haig's statements that relate to the October 1, 2017, shooting casualties or that otherwise do not relate details of his sale of ammunition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (ECF No. 42 ) (the government does not intend to present evidence on the matters listed above).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Accordingly, because the evidence at issue is uniquely probative and the government will not be able to present the most prejudicial evidence pertaining to the October 1, 2017, shooting, unfair prejudice does not substantially outweigh probative value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Remaining Rule 403 concerns\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Haig argues that testimony from five expert witnesses regarding unfired cartridges from Paddock's hotel rooms would confuse the issue and mislead the jury. (ECF No. 40 ). The court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Although the government will present evidence connecting Haig to the October 1, 2017, shooting, the government will not include evidence that is not relevant to Haig's manufacture and sale of ammunitions. Further, the court will provide jury instructions that clearly identify the issues that the jury must resolve.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Norris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076426\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/423/732/#p734\">\n    423 F. App'x at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With these precautions, the court does not see any genuine danger that the experts' testimonies would confuse the issues or mislead the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Haig also requests that the court exclude the testimony of many individuals that purchased ammunition from Haig as the presentation of such testimony would be needlessly cumulative. (ECF No. 40 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The parties have not sufficiently disclosed the relevant witnesses for the court to determine if their testimony would be needlessly cumulative. Accordingly, the court will not exclude the witnesses' testimony subject to Haig's ability to renew his objection at the appropriate time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    c. Summary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The court will not exclude evidence connecting Haig to the October 1, 2017, shooting. However, in order to diminish the risk of prejudice, the court will not permit the government to present evidence that is not related to Haig's sale of ammunition or Haig's transactions with Paddock, as listed in subsection (b)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.
