Davis, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on a motion to dismiss, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a\n   claim, filed by defendant Josh Enterprises, Inc. (\"Defendant\") pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Def. Mot., ECF No. 9. Plaintiff Suzanne Kuntze (\"Plaintiff\") claims that Defendant violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") by purposefully misclassifying her as exempt from overtime, failing to pay her overtime, and failing to pay her at her regular rate for mandatory training hours. Defendant contends that (1) it already paid Plaintiff the money to which she is entitled under the \"fluctuating workweek\" calculation for overtime pay, thus mooting Plaintiff's overtime claim and depriving the Court of jurisdiction; (2) Plaintiff failed to state a claim for unpaid regular time; and (3) even if Plaintiff amends her claim for unpaid regular time, the claim would be moot because Defendant already paid more than full relief. Plaintiff responds that (1) the fluctuating workweek method does not apply to the overtime claim advanced in this case and, therefore, her claim for overtime is not moot; and (2) she adequately alleged a violation of the FLSA for unpaid regular hours. Alternatively, Plaintiff requests that she be granted leave to amend the record, or that the Court permit the parties to conduct discovery, and that Plaintiff be granted leave to amend her complaint after discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff began working for Defendant, a tax service company, in 2015 after Defendant acquired ownership of Plaintiff's previous employer. Plaintiff worked for her previous employer year-round since 2005. Compl. \u00b6 9, ECF No. 1. In 2015, after taking over the company, Defendant gave Plaintiff the title of \"Manager\" and had her sign a new employment agreement. Compl. \u00b6 10-11. Under the new agreement, Plaintiff worked as a seasonal employee making a bi-weekly salary of $ 1,280.00 during \"tax season.\" Compl. \u00b6 13; Pl.'s Ex. B, ECF No. 1-2. During the off season, she worked reduced hours at an hourly wage. Compl. \u00b6 14-15. Plaintiff alleges that, notwithstanding her title as \"Manager,\" Defendant took away her managerial job duties such as the ability to hire, fire, schedule, and supervise employees, reducing her responsibilities to that of a \"regular customer service tax preparer.\" Compl. \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the end of 2015, Plaintiff was required to sign a new employment agreement to keep her position. Compl. \u00b6 16. The agreement kept Plaintiff on a bi-weekly salary of $ 1,280.00 during the tax season and changed her title to \"Shift Supervisor.\" Compl. \u00b6 16; Pl.'s Ex. C, ECF No. 1-3. At the end of 2016, Defendant required Plaintiff to sign a new employment agreement which set her bi-weekly salary at $ 1,330.00 for the tax season. Compl. \u00b6 20; Pl.'s Ex. D, ECF No. 1-4. None of the agreements capped Plaintiff's tax season hours, but all three required Plaintiff to clock-in and out. Pl.'s Exs. B, C, D. The agreements also noted that Defendant would schedule Plaintiff's hours \"to meet [Defendant's] customer demands because customer demand fluctuates throughout Tax Season.\" Pl.'s Exs. B, C, D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In a letter dated August 11, 2017, Plaintiff requested a $ 60,000 payment from Defendant to compensate her for unpaid overtime and regular time. Def.'s Ex. A, ECF No. 10-1. Defendant responded via counsel on November 18, 2017, with a letter stating that, while Defendant maintained that Plaintiff was exempt from overtime, it would nonetheless compensate Plaintiff for overtime based on the fluctuating workweek methodology. Def.'s Ex. C, ECF No. 10-3. With the letter, Defendant issued two checks purportedly \"in full satisfaction\n   of [Plaintiff's] claims against [her] employer.\" Def.'s Ex. C. The letter explained that one check, in the amount of $ 5,977.72, was for uncompensated overtime calculated based on half of her regular hourly rate under the fluctuating workweek method, plus an additional, equal amount, for liquidated damages. Def.'s Ex. C. The second check, which was in the amount of $ 267.78, was intended to compensate Plaintiff at her regular hourly rate for the sixteen and a half regular hours that she spent completing mandatory training. Def.'s Ex. C. Plaintiff did not cash the two checks and instead filed her complaint in this case on January 19, 2018. Mem. in Support of Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 10 ; Compl., ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The day before Plaintiff filed her complaint, counsel for Defendant sent a letter to Plaintiff's counsel highlighting issues raised during an earlier phone conversation. Def.'s Ex. D, ECF No. 10-4. The letter again emphasized that Defendant believed Plaintiff was exempt from overtime pay, but claimed that even if she was not, Defendant had already given Plaintiff every dollar to which she was entitled under the proper calculation method in this jurisdiction. Def.'s Ex. D. Counsel for Plaintiff replied to Defense counsel's letter on January 19, 2018. Def.'s Ex. E, ECF No. 10-5. The letter from Plaintiff's counsel alleged that Defendant willfully misclassified Plaintiff as \"exempt\" from overtime payment, argued that the fluctuating workweek method was not applicable in this case, and demanded that Plaintiff be paid based on a time-and-a-half calculation of overtime. Def.'s Ex. E. The letter claimed Plaintiff sought a total of $ 29,298.90 as a settlement payment, which covered overtime calculated at the time-and-a-half rate, unpaid training time at her regular rate, liquidated damages, and attorney's fees. Def.'s Ex. E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 12, 2018, counsel for Defendant sent Plaintiff's counsel two cashier's checks, one for $ 267.78 as payment for training hours at Plaintiff's regular hourly rate, and one for $ 5,980.10 as payment for Plaintiff's overtime hours plus liquidated damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def.'s Ex. F, ECF No. 10-6. The facts in the record do not state whether Plaintiff cashed or deposited the cashier's checks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss on April 16, 2018. Def. 's Mot., ECF No. 9. On July 11, 2018, the Court issued an order directing the parties to schedule oral argument on the motion to dismiss and to address controlling case law of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit that applied the half-time calculation of the fluctuating workweek method to misclassification cases. Order, ECF No. 17. The Court also directed Plaintiff to be prepared to address how discovery could alter the amount of damages recoverable, and whether willful misrepresentations of entitlement to overtime have any relevance to civil damages, in light of the FLSA's provision regarding criminal prosecution for willful violations. Order, ECF No. 17. The Court then held a hearing on the motion to dismiss on September 25, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In the former situation, known as a facial challenge, the court is required to accept all of the complaint's factual allegations as true, \"and the plaintiff, in effect, is afforded the same procedural protection as he would receive under a 12(b)(6) consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1502630\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/697/1213/#p1219\">\n    697 F.2d at 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the latter situation, known as a factual challenge, \"the district court may regard the pleadings as mere evidence\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on the issue and may consider evidence outside the pleadings.\"\n   <em>\n    Velasco v.

However, in those cases, it does not appear that the issue of a district judge's authority to weigh evidence was squarely presented to the Fourth Circuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, in at least two of the cases, there were not material disputes of fact, and thus, there was no need to \"weigh\" the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 855 F.3d at 251 ;\n   <em>\n    Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac R.R.

In other words, the employee has bargained to be paid the same rate whether he or she works under or over forty hours (the \"time\" portion of time and half), and in exchange for the employer's promise to pay the same rate every week, the employee only receives the \"half\" portion of time and a half if he or she works over forty hours per week.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For example,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   consider an hourly employee who works for $ 10 an hour and works thirty hours in week one making $ 300 for the week, forty hours in week\n   two making $ 400, and fifty hours in week three making $ 550. The $ 550 is calculated by adding $ 400 for the forty hours and $ 150 for the ten hours of overtime at a rate of $ 15 per hour (one and a half times the employee's normal $ 10 rate). On the other hand, consider a salaried employee who makes $ 400 per week, qualifies under the fluctuating workweek method, works the same number of hours as the hourly employee each week, and gets $ 400 in week one, $ 400 in week two, and $ 440 in week three. The $ 440 is calculated by dividing the guaranteed $ 400 weekly salary by the total number of hours worked that week to get the average hourly salary for the week ($ 400 \u00f7 50 hours = $ 8.00 per hour). The eight dollars are then divided in half ($ 8.00 \u00f7 2 = $ 4.00 per hour) and multiplied by the number of hours worked overtime that week ($ 4.00 x 10 hours = $ 40). That number is then added to the weekly salary ($ 400 + $ 40 = $ 440). As shown by this example, the employee essentially bargained away the time-and-a-half rate he or she would have received as an hourly employee in order to receive a guaranteed $ 400 per week, even if the employee works less than forty hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C. 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) should be granted if a complaint fails to \"allege facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atlantic Corp. v.

While time and a half is the default method under the FLSA, the fluctuating workweek method is a product of case law and regulation that require proof of four elements: (1) the employee's hours fluctuate each week, (2) the employee receives a fixed salary that does not vary when hours fluctuate, (3) the employee's pay did not fall below minimum wage, and (4) the employer and employee have a clear and mutual understanding that fixed payment will be made for fluctuating hours. 29 C.F.R. 778.114 (a) ;\n   <em>\n    Baclawski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203037394\">\n    2017 WL 3037394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20111317\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist.

Critical to the inquiry in this case is a question of fact about whether the parties had a clear and mutual understanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Second, having reviewed the merits facts necessary to succeed on Plaintiff's claim, the Court looks to the facts necessary to establish jurisdiction in order to determine whether the merits facts and jurisdictional facts overlap. The jurisdictional issue of mootness in this case turns on whether the Defendant's payment for overtime under the fluctuating workweek method constituted \"complete relief.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201089417\">\n    2016 WL 1089417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2035807\">\n    2016 U.S. Dist.

Plaintiff advances two arguments against application of the fluctuating workweek method: (1) a legal argument that the fluctuating workweek method can never apply in cases where an employer willfully misclassifies an employee as exempt from overtime, and (2) a factual argument that the fluctuating workweek method cannot apply in this case because there was not a clear and mutual understanding between the parties that Plaintiff's salary was intended to cover fluctuating hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Legal Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The first jurisdictional argument (that the fluctuating workweek method cannot apply in\n   <em>\n    willful\n   </em>\n   misclassification cases), though predicated on the assumption that Plaintiff can establish willfulness, is presented to this Court as a\n   <em>\n    legal issue\n   </em>\n   that the Court can resolve without any discussion of the facts of this case. Further, there are no relevant facts that Plaintiff can discover that would change the outcome of the Court's decision on such legal issue.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4082247\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/140/#p145\">\n    811 F.3d at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a district court did not abuse its discretion in denying discovery on a jurisdictional issue because there were \"no facts that [the plaintiff] could have uncovered in discovery [that] would establish jurisdiction\").

Relying on the reasoning in district court cases from other jurisdictions, Plaintiff argues that the fluctuating workweek method cannot apply in\n   <em>\n    willful\n   </em>\n   misclassification cases because there can be no clear and mutual understanding that a fixed salary covers fluctuating hours when an employer misleads an employee into believing the employee is exempt from overtime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Boyce\n   </em>\n   , 223 F.Supp.3d at 948-49 (holding that the fluctuating workweek method cannot apply in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   misclassification case, without regard to willfulness, because a clear and mutual understanding \"cannot exist where the agreement is based on the false premise that the employee is not entitled to any overtime\");\n   <em>\n    Costello v.

The issues directly before the Fourth Circuit on cross appeals were (1) whether the half-time rate of the fluctuating workweek calculation method applied to calculate damages in misclassification cases and (2) the proper standard for determining whether the employer acted willfully, a finding that impacted the number of years that the plaintiffs could recover overtime wages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053771\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/351/#p353\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053771\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/351/#p353\">\n    at 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 357-58 ; Brief of Appellee/Cross Appellant at 1,\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053771\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/351/#p353\">\n    630 F.3d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (No. 09-2189 ). The Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court's application of the half-time rate of the fluctuating workweek calculation method on the facts before it, but remanded on the issue of willfulness, finding that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the employer acted willfully, without any suggestion that a finding of willfulness on remand would undercut the application of the fluctuating workweek method.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053771\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/351/#p353\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053771\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/351/#p353\">\n    at 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Logically, it seems clear that the Fourth Circuit anticipated that the lower court would apply the fluctuating workweek method, whether or not it found that the employer willfully misclassified the employees, otherwise, why would they remand. Thus, while\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   may not be directly on point because the Fourth Circuit did not\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   decide the issue of whether the fluctuating workweek method could be applied in\n   <em>\n    willful\n   </em>\n   misclassification cases, the logical implication of the decision is that the fluctuating workweek method can apply in such cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053771\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/351/#p353\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053771\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/351/#p353\">\n    at 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, this Court relies on\n   <em>\n    Desmond\n   </em>\n   as Circuit authority standing for the proposition that the half-time calculation of the fluctuating workweek method can apply to calculate damages in willful misclassification cases if all requirements for its application are satisfied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Factual Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The second jurisdictional argument advanced by Plaintiff is a factual argument contending that Defendant's payment did not render this case moot and deprive the Court of jurisdiction because Defendant calculated the payment using the fluctuating workweek method, and the fluctuating workweek method does not apply in this case because the parties lacked a clear and mutual understanding that Plaintiff's salary was intended to cover fluctuating hours. Like Plaintiff's merits-based argument, this jurisdictional argument requires proof of facts necessary to determine which overtime calculation method was applicable. Accordingly, there is clearly substantial overlap in the facts necessary to prove the merits of Plaintiff's overtime claim and the facts necessary to resolve this jurisdictional issue. As discussed above, both issues turn on whether the parties had a clear and mutual understanding that Plaintiff's salary was intended to cover fluctuating hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Because facts necessary to determine jurisdiction are intertwined with the facts necessary to determine the merits, it would be improper for the Court to resolve such factual disputes at this stage of the case as it would deprive the parties of their right to a jury trial on the merits issues.\n   <em>\n    Arbaugh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5937941\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/500/#p514\">\n    546 U.S. at 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5937941\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/500/#p514\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If satisfaction of an essential element of a claim for relief is at issue, however, the jury is the proper trier of contested facts.\");\n   <em>\n    Baclawski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203037394\">\n    2017 WL 3037394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20111317\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist.
