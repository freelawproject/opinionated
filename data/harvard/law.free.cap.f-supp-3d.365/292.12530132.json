(Compl. (Doc. No. 1).) Defendants, the Secretary of the United States Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") and the national and district directors of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   move to dismiss pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12(b)(1) on the ground that USCIS has already adjudicated the applications, thereby rendering Le Chen's claim moot. (Defs. Mem. (Doc. No. 18).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, defendants' motion is granted and the case is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following facts are derived from Le Chen's complaint, the allegations of which are accepted as true for the purposes of this Order, and from exhibits attached to defendants' motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Le Chen is a citizen of China. (Compl. at 2.) After coming to the United States, Le Chen petitioned for asylum with the help of an immigration attorney, Vanessa Bandrich. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) On February 9, 2011, USCIS granted Le Chen asylum status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.) On March 1, 2011, Le Chen filed I-730 Refugee/Asylee Relative Petitions (the \"I-730 Petitions\") on behalf of his wife and daughter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) On February 21, 2012, he filed an I-485 Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (the \"I-485 Application\") on his own behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Over the next five years, Le Chen repeatedly followed up on these filings, trying without avail to elicit a disposition from USCIS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-17.) Meanwhile, during roughly the same period, Bandrich was indicted, prosecuted, and convicted for participation in a large-scale asylum fraud. (Ex. B to Decl. of Lisa D. Kutlin (\"Kutlin Decl.\") (Doc. No. 19-2) at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 10, 2017, Le Chen filed the instant action, seeking a writ of mandamus from this Court compelling USCIS to act. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 22.) Shortly thereafter, USCIS acted. On November 6, 2017, it terminated Le Chen's asylum status after determining that his original grant of asylum was obtained pursuant to Bandrich's fraud. As a consequence of this, both the I-485 Application and the I-730 Petitions were resolved in short order. First, on December 8, 2017, USCIS placed Le Chen in removal proceedings and, pursuant to those proceedings, on January 8, 2018, it administratively closed his I-485 Application. (Ex. C to Kutlin Decl. (Doc. No. 19-3) at 2.) Second, on January 31, 2018, USCIS denied the I-730 Petitions on the ground that Le Chen had lost his asylum status. (Ex. D to Kutlin Decl. (Doc. No. 19-4) at 2-3; Ex. E to Kutlin Decl. (Doc. No. 19-5) at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 13, 2018, defendants moved to dismiss Le Chen's complaint as moot. (Defs. Mem. at 9.) Despite being directed to do so, Le Chen has not replied, nor has he taken any action in this case since filing the complaint over a year ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A district court must dismiss an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) when the court \"lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.\"\n   <em>\n    Cortlandt St. Recovery Corp. v.

Plaintiffs, even those proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , bear the burden of proving that subject matter jurisdiction exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrison v.

In determining whether the plaintiff has met that burden, \"[t]he court must take all facts alleged in the complaint as true and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of plaintiff, but jurisdiction must be shown affirmatively,\n   and that showing is not made by drawing from the pleadings inferences favorable to the party asserting it.\"\n   <em>\n    Morrison v.

However, USCIS already did this in January 2018, when it administratively closed the I-495 Application and denied the I-730 Petitions. Accordingly, Le Chen's claims are moot, and his complaint must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    You Zeng Huang v.
