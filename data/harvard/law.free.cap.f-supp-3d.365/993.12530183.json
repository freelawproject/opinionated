In deciding to forge ahead and incur these significant fees, EcoRights increased the amount of attorneys' fees at issue, which made settlement more difficult to reach.

That is not to say that FOIA cases cannot be complex. But the high rates awarded for complex class action cases can be explained in large part by the necessity in those cases for plaintiffs' counsel to incur significant cost outlays (for experts, document review systems, travel, depositions, etc.) as well as attorney time (to review hundreds of thousands of documents, numerous depositions, etc.) which are not typically required in FOIA cases and were not required in these cases.\"). The Court finds EcoRights' counsel staffed the matter robustly with six attorneys, which necessarily increased fees for communications and coordination of activities; requests a very high hourly rate\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; prematurely incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars in preparing and filing the Fees Motion, which increased the overall fees at issue and made settlement of the fees issue less likely; and spent excessive hours drafting documents such as the initial case management conference statement, motions for summary judgment that recycled previously-briefed arguments, and the instant Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Extrapolating counsel's billing on the CMC statement, Second Summary Judgment Motion, and Fees Motion, and based on the Court's overall experience with the case and its review of the billing records, the Court finds the claimed hours are excessive and that a 55% across-the-board reduction is appropriate.
