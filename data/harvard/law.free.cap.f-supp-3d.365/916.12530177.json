Kok, Y.T. Kok, Samuel Chia, Jue Liang, Roger Zhang, Phaik Ee Ooi, Yu Kok Hoong, and Qingzhou Chen. Ominously, Motorola cautions that this may only be the beginning [Dkt. # 403, at 1 n.1], despite the fact that discovery is over in less than a month on April 12\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   . [Dkt. # 399].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Motorola's quest for forensic inspection began about a year ago on March 1, 2018. [Dkt. # 173]. At that time, discovery was supposedly limited to Hytera's statute of limitations defense, an issue that has eluded resolution since May of 2017 [Dkt. # 32], until a few days ago. [Dkt. # 435]. But discovery unfortunately went far beyond that. [Dkt. # 231]. And, based on Motorola's representations to the court since it amended its Complaint to add a copyright claim (ostensibly, in order to avoid its case being scuttled by Hytera's statute of limitations defense), its quest has gone far enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When Motorola first sought forensic examination of the computers in China, it claimed that discovery of Hytera's source code for certain specified products was necessary to combat Hytera's motion for summary judgment and that what was sought was \"\n   <em>\n    highly relevant\n   </em>\n   \" to Hytera's statute of limitations defense. [Dkt. # 175, at 1](Emphasis supplied). But Motorola was never able to explain how concealment or destruction of information on computers in China - computers that Motorola never had access to or claimed to have access to - somehow thwarted Motorola from discovering that former employees in Malaysia left Motorola's employ with trade secrets. [Dkt. # 231, at 9-12]. And, as it turned out, the discovery was not necessary. It was not even mentioned in the parties' \"Stipulated Order to Extend Briefing on Hytera's Motion for Summary Judgment\" [Dkt. # 181-1], and Motorola responded to Hytera's motion for summary judgment with a 25-page brief without it on May 4, 2018 [Dkt. # 216, at 23-25], two weeks prior to resolution of its motion to compel forensic inspection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As I noted at the hearing on the motion to compel in May:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   ... if you thought it was relevant to summary judgment, you should have interrupted the briefing on that issue and said, \"Wait a minute. We can't do what we should be doing effectively because we haven't completed discovery.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The mere fact that you all went ahead and filed and thought whatever you did was enough is -- speaks volumes with me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [Dkt. # 234, at 9]. And it continues to speak volumes. Indeed, the cases are quite\n   uniform in rejecting claims of prejudice where a party could, but does not, take action and later cries foul.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

Rather, they would have moved to compel and vigorously complained to the court that the depositions could not proceed without the requested information.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Motorola indicated that once the summary judgment hurdle was cleared and full-blown discovery was opened, it would come back with a renewed motion for forensic discovery. [Dkt. # 234, at 13-14]. Full-blown discovery, in fact, commenced on July 10, 2018 [Dkt. # 252], or ought to have. [Dkt. # 277]. There was some confusion over Judge Norgle's Order adopting the parties' plan but, in any event, my subsequent Order of August 13, 2018, made it clear that fact discovery was to proceed apace and conclude on February 28, 2019. [Dkt. # 277, at 7]. But, remarkably and inexplicably, the balance of the year went by without a peep from Motorola about renewing its motion for forensic inspection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   If that inspection were as critical as now claimed, one would have expected something more than silence from Motorola.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   cases cited above. What Judge Posner said in\n   <em>\n    Muhammad v. Oliver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052159\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/547/874/#p877\">\n    547 F.3d 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 877 (7th Cir. 2008) applies here,\n   <em>\n    mutatis mutandis\n   </em>\n   : \"if there is an executed standstill agreement, one would expect an allegation to that effect. There is none. The ... silence is deafening.\" The principle of experience underlying these cases applies to Motorola's conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 11, 2019, fully five months into merits discovery, and just a month and a half before fact discovery was then set to close, Motorola finally filed its \"Renewed Motion to Compel Forensic Inspection of Hytera Computers and Network Servers\" There was certainly no sense of urgency revealed by that timeline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   That is significant because Local\n   Rule 16.1 provides that \"discovery must be completed before the discovery closing date. Discovery requested before the discovery closing date, but not scheduled for completion before the discovery closing date, does not comply with this order.\" In\n   <em>\n    RBS Citizens, N.A. v.

Ill. 2016). It would be truly remarkable had the briefing and resolution of Motorola's motion, and then the complicated process of scheduling and completing forensic examination in China, been accomplished between January 11\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   and February 28\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   . It wasn't until after Motorola filed its motion that Judge Norgle extended the fact discovery deadline to April 12\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   . [Dkt. # 399].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Even with that extension, Motorola's motion is untimely.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The briefing schedule - which Motorola played a role in setting - was set to go through March 6\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   , with a further hearing on March 20\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   . Even if Motorola's motion were granted instantaneously, and Hytera did not file objections with Judge Norgle under Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a), that would leave 3 weeks to complete the whole forensic examination process in China. Perhaps tellingly, Motorola never indicates how long it expects that examination to take; the proposed protocol for the inspection suggests it will take at least a week, and probably longer, as Hytera is to allow \"reasonable requests for overtime ... on weekends.\" [Dkt. # 405-1, at 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Even more than in ordinary, less complicated cases, resort to court intervention could be anticipated here, involving\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspections of materials and complicated issues and extended presentations by counsel on both sides, [Dkt. # 405-1, at 7-9], which would entail lengthy briefing and argument, consideration of those arguments and finally, rulings, which require time for reflection and preparation.\n   <em>\n    Rogers v.

By waiting half a year, until fact discovery was winding down, to revisit its quite complicated forensic examination request, Motorola played a dangerous game. Motorola's motion violated Local Rule 16.1 when it was filed and even after Judge Norgle granted an extension of the discovery deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   But there is more. Motorola has insisted on how crucial this forensic examination is. But, as past is prologue, it unfortunately has a somewhat hollow ring to it. Motorola told us once that the discovery was necessary to its defense against the statute of limitations. It was not. As a result, Motorola's cries should now be viewed with perhaps greater scrutiny than they would have been had Motorola acted in a more timely and expected fashion. The question that remains is, why is this additional and intrusive discovery necessary, when it certainly appears not necessary?\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Motorola, discovery already conducted has \"confirmed that Hytera was in possession of dozens of Motorola confidential documents, [and] also revealed ... that Hytera copied Motorola's confidential and copyrighted code that forms the foundation for essential functions, instructions, and user interfaces in Motorola's digital radio products into Hytera's competing products.\" Motorola has told the court that discovery has already \"revealed that the source code for Hytera's products contains a substantial amount of Motorola's confidential and copyrighted source code, copied verbatim into Hytera's products, right down to the capitalization, wording, and formatting that were chosen by Motorola's engineers in designing Motorola's products.\" [Dkt. ## 256, at Par. 3; 258, at 1-2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Even though discovery was limited to Hytera's trade secrets statute of limitations defense, Motorola \"examined Hytera's source code, spent months analyzing that code, and obtained email correspondence between Hytera engineers that revealed evidence of copyright infringement.\" [Dkt. # 258, at 14]. In its review of these materials, Motorola says it \"discovered that Hytera's source code contains at least tens of thousands of lines of source code that include wording, formatting, and capitalization of elements that are identical to or inconsequentially different than the corresponding lines of Motorola's copyrighted source code.\" [Dkt. # 311, at 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The copying was so \"brazen\" - Motorola's word - that typos were even reproduced. [Dkt. # 311, at 3].\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inv. Serv. Co. v.

Unfortunately, all too many counsel subscribe to the view that if a belt is good, adding suspenders is even better, and all too many delight in overkill and overproof, often regardless of the need for and effect on their case. Indeed it is fair to say that \"this case presents yet another example of the discovery overkill that plagues civil litigation\" and that \"there is no basis to view the discovery request ... as anything more than lawyers trying to fulfill their duty of zealous advocacy.\"\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health v.

This, despite the fact that Motorola was informed in no uncertain terms that proportionality was the\n   major concern the court had with the request a month before Motorola filed the current version of its motion. [Dkt. # 398]. The closest it comes is to say, essentially, that while it has uncovered mountains of evidence - totaling millions and millions of pages - there must be more. [Dkt. # 406, at 12-14].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In addition to the numerous representations made in other filings in this court and before Judge Norgle, Motorola tells us in its current motion that discovery has established that: Hytera's current source code contains at least thousands of explicit copies of Motorola's own confidential source code (it obviously did not get there by accident or without Hytera's knowledge - and no reasonable fact finder would conclude otherwise); Hytera's technical documents contain verbatim or paraphrased descriptions of Motorola's own\n   <em>\n    confidential\n   </em>\n   technical documents - what could be of greater significance to the fact finder - and Hytera's employees discussed not just how to copy Motorola's source code, but how to conceal that copying. And, Hytera took Motorola's confidential information. [Dkt. # 406, at 12]. Given the elements of a claim for copyright infringement, what more does Motorola want? Or more precisely, what more is Motorola reasonably entitled to. While most lawyers may prefer the belt and suspenders approach to information gathering, the doctrine of proportionality may not allow that luxury. It certainly does not here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Motorola tells us that it has evidence that Hytera engineers discussed and copied Motorola's confidential materials in internal emails. That is rather damning evidence in and of itself in light of Hytera's failure to have produced any such emails. Nonproduction under appropriate circumstances has its own independent evidentiary significance, which in this case would favor Motorola and disfavor Hytera. While it also says it has emails from Hytera indicating that Sam Chia discussed aligning their stories as a result of Motorola's lawsuit, it insists on discovery regarding a missing email from Hytera's chairman. It says it has evidence that Sam Chia's Hytera laptop contains evidence showing that he possesses (or at one time possessed) large amounts of Motorola source code. Nonetheless, it wants what it believes are over one-hundred files that Hytera has not produced. [Dkt. # 406, at 13-14]. Despite all the evidence it acknowledges it already has, and the inevitable and damning inferences from Hytera's nonproduction of certain documents alleged by Motorola to be significant, Motorola claims that forensic examination is\n   <em>\n    necessary\n   </em>\n   to show where stolen files were stored, how they moved around Hytera's computers, and who deleted them. [Dkt. # 406, at 14]. But Motorola fails to explain how any of that is relevant to a claim for copyright infringement - and certainly not how it is necessary to proving its case in light of what it already has. At best, the evidence is of marginal relevance and thus discovery related to it may properly be denied either on the grounds that the evidence is, at best, marginally relevant and certainly that the discovery that Motorola seeks is not proportional to the needs of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In the end, \"mere skepticism that an opposing party has not produced all relevant information is not sufficient to warrant drastic electronic discovery measures.\"\n   <em>\n    John B. v.

Even if one concedes that Motorola's\n   skepticism and suspicion are well-founded, Motorola has not explained how the evidence it suspects can be unearthed through a forensic examination in China is necessary or more than marginally relevant - if that. And even if one assumes some of the evidence is relevant to Motorola's trademark claims, it certainly appears to be cumulative, at least based on Motorola's representations to the court. In conclusion, the requested discovery is significantly out of proportion to the needs of the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1) ; (2)(C)(I).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Motorola's motion, then, must be denied without any foray into the complex issues of Chinese law and state secrets. Nevertheless, a brief excursion into that labyrinthian question is perhaps worthwhile. Motorola's position is that Chinese law doesn't hinder its inspection of Hytera's computers in China, and the Hague convention and, indeed, comity, don't come into play. Hytera, of course, sees it quite differently. The parties tell us that the Chinese statute at issue here is Article 277 of the Civil Procedure Law, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The request for and provision of judicial assistance shall be conducted through the channels stipulated in the international treaties concluded or acceded to by the People's Republic of China.

The act of \"making investigations and collecting evidence\" under Article 277\n   <em>\n    does not include voluntary production of documents or voluntary disclosure of information\n   </em>\n   of one party to another party or to a third-party investigator for the purpose of resolving a dispute in or out of court because these acts do not encroach on the supremacy of Chinese\n   judicial or executive authorities.

The amount of discovery Motorola has already accumulated and what, according to Motorola, it already proves detracts from the importance of (and need for) further discovery. This factor clearly goes against ordering a forensic examination of computers in China. The second factor - the degree of specificity of the request - is a closer call, but also tends to work against Motorola. While, on the one hand, Motorola's request involves what appears to be a fairly specific keyword search protocol, on the other, there is no denying that forensic examination is generally broadly intrusive, As the Supreme Court said in\n   <em>\n    Societe Nationale\n   </em>\n   , \"[s]ome discovery procedures are much more 'intrusive' than others.\" 482 U.S. at 545,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217178\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/522/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court happened to be distinguishing the less intrusive interrogatory from the more intrusive request for production. Obviously, forensic examination of computers in China is, by any measure, on the more intrusive end of the spectrum, easily more intrusive than a request for production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Supreme Court advised that \"[t]he exact line between reasonableness and unreasonableness in each case must be drawn by the trial court, based on its knowledge of the case and of the claims and interests of the parties and the governments whose statutes and policies they invoke.\" 482 U.S. at 546,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217178\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/522/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, we have a fairly specific search protocol offset by the fact that it is, nevertheless, a court-ordered forensic examination, seasoned with the fact that so much discovery has already been produced that, according to Motorola, proves its case. It is, as said, a closer call, but this factor weighs slightly against Motorola's request as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The third factor is whether the information at issue originated in the United States. Motorola claims that the information it is seeking through the proposed forensic examination originated in the Untied States, but provides nothing to support this claim. [Dkt. # 406, at 10]. Indeed, based on the allegations in Motorola's Amended Complaint, it certainly seems that the source code at issue here originated, not in the United States, but in Malaysia. Motorola states that Samuel Chia, Y.T. Kok, and G.S. Kok were directly involved in developing the technology at issue here. [Dkt. # 265, \u00b6. 55]. Samuel Chia did coding, documentation, testing, and release of software. [Dkt. # 265, \u00b6. 56]. Y.T. Kok did design, development, and release of software. [Dkt. # 265, \u00b6. 57]. G.S. Kok did design, development, and release of software. [Dkt. # 265, \u00b6. 58]. The majority of this development and work was done in Malaysia at Motorola Solutions Malaysia SBN, BHD; the rest in Singapore. [Dkt. # 99-1, Page 43/134]. Against this backdrop, Motorola may not by virtue of its mere\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   persuasively convince the fact finder that the source code originated in the United States. Again, merely saying so doesn't make it so. Everything in the record suggests the code originated overseas by foreign nationals working for a foreign subsidiary. As it stands, this factor weighs against any forensic examination in China.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The fourth factor works in Motorola's favor. There appear to be no alternative means of securing the information Motorola wants. Hytera has produced over two million documents totaling more than twenty million pages. It has voluntarily performed a forensic inspection of the computers at issue and produced some deleted files. The additional information Motorola\n   wants either never existed, or no longer exists - after all, Motorola did not file suit until nearly ten years after its employees left for Hytera and eight years after Hytera released its product - or is so deeply imbedded in the computers and servers that, as Motorola claims, only a forensic examination can get to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The fifth factor - the extent to which denying the request would undermine important interests of the United States (and the extent to which granting the request would undermine Chinese interests) - is a bit of a toss-up. Motorola points out that enforcement of United States trademark and copyright laws is a significant interest. In the end, the trade secrets and copyrighted material are owned by a United States-based company. But, again, there is some attenuation as the source code was developed in Malaysia by foreign nationals working for a foreign subsidiary. United States interests would be implicated much more directly, of course, had Motorola not chosen to develop this product 9,000 miles away. On the other side there is China's interest in enforcing its laws. Motorola doesn't think Chinese law even applies here, but, again, the opinion it submitted is couched in terms of voluntary discovery. Court-ordered discovery is not voluntary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Again, we need not resolve issues regarding Chinese law or rule on that basis because Motorola's motion must be denied for other reasons. It would seem that comity factors tend to go against ordering a forensic examination of computers in China. In the end though, Motorola waited too long - five months by the most lenient reckoning - to reintroduce the forensic examination issue into these proceedings. Filing the motion a handful of weeks before the close of discovery ensures the complicated process would not be completed before discovery ended. Moreover, the lack of urgency with which Motorola acted undermines its claims of how important this discovery is - and similar claims proved unreliable during statute of limitations discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Motorola has failed to carry its burden that the additional discovery it seeks - which would come after mountains of discovery have already been produced - is necessary or proportional to the needs of the case. Proportionality determinations, as we have shown, are made on a case by case basis with no single factor outweighing other factors. A court's decision regarding proportionality and the court's handling of discovery generally will only be disturbed on a showing of an abuse of discretion, which, of course, is highly deferential.\n   <em>\n    Yonts v.
