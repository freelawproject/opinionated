The Court has reviewed the Motion, all supporting and opposing submissions, the record and applicable law, and is otherwise fully advised. For the reasons that follow, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 11, 2016, Plaintiffs Caleb Wistar and Ernest Mayeaux (\"Plaintiffs\"), on behalf of themselves and on behalf of those similarly situated (collectively, the \"Customers\" or \"Class Members\"), filed the instant action against Defendants Raymond James. ECF No. [1]. On August 8, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Class Action Complaint (\"SAC\"). ECF No. [38]. In the SAC, Plaintiffs assert that Raymond James' Customers were charged an unauthorized and unreasonable \"Processing Fee\" (sometimes labeled as a \"Misc. Fee\"), when it executed trades for their Customers in the \"Passport Investment Account Program\" (\"Passport Account\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Passport Account is a Raymond James commission-free account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Customers who signed up for the Passport Account program were not supposed to be charged any commissions on individual trades.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Instead, these Customers\n   were charged a single \"Advisory Fee\" based on the total value of the qualifying assets in their Passport Accounts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The SAC alleges that the Raymond James Customers who opened a Passport Account were required to sign a \"Passport Non-Discretionary Client Agreement\" or \"Passport Discretionary Client Agreement\" (the \"Passport Agreement\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4. Customers agreed to pay for \"transaction execution and clearing services\" at a \"flat fee per transaction ... herein referred to as a 'Processing Fee.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5. The Processing Fee charged during all relevant periods ranged from $ 9.95-$ 30.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Processing fee was in addition to a charge per transaction for handling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Passport Agreement made clear that the Processing Fees are not \"commissions, but are to defray the expenses incurred in facilitating the execution and clearing of Client's portfolio transactions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. The Plaintiffs claim, however, that the expenses incurred by Raymond James in facilitating the execution and clearing of a Customer's transactions were significantly lower than the Processing Fees charged by Raymond James.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. The SAC alleges that the cost incurred by Raymond James for these trades was no more than $ 5.00 per transaction. Therefore, the Processing Fee charged contained up to a 1000% mark-up for profit in some instances.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, it was an unauthorized commission in an account that is supposed to be commission-free.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that because \"Raymond James charged an unauthorized and unreasonable 'Processing Fee' for trades, and because this \"Processing Fee\" was far in excess of, and not directly or reasonably related to, the 'expenses incurred in facilitating the execution and clearing' of trades, contractual and common law duties owed to Customers were breached.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs assert claims for breach of contract and negligence.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs allege three causes of action against the Defendants: a claim for breach of contract asserted against RJFSA (Count I), a claim for breach of contract asserted against RJFS (Count II), and a claim for negligence asserted against RJFS (Count III). Defendants move to dismiss all of Plaintiffs' claims. They argue that, as to the breach of contract claims, Plaintiffs have failed to identify the contractual provisions that Raymond James breached and the contract language itself negates the Plaintiffs' claims. With respect to Plaintiffs' negligence claim, Defendants argue that it is barred by the independent tort rule. The Court will address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Breach of Contract Claims\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In Counts I and II, Plaintiffs allege breach of contract claims against both RJFSA and RJFS respectively. The Plaintiffs assert that RJFSA entered into the Passport Agreement for itself, and as agent for its principal, RJFS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53. RJFS entered into the Passport Agreement through its agent RJFSA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66. Under Florida law, the elements of breach of contract are: (1) the existence of a contract, (2) a breach thereof, and (3) damages flowing from the breach.\n   <em>\n    Knowles v. C. I. T. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9693616\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/346/1042/#p1043\">\n    346 So.2d 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1043 (Fla. 1st DCA 1977).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In the SAC, Plaintiffs claim that Raymond James beached the Passport Agreement by charging its Passport Account Customers a Processing Fee, which bore no reasonable relationship to the direct and actual costs in executing and clearing the fee investment transactions. ECF No. [1], at \u00b6\u00b6 59, 72. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' Breach of Contract claims should be dismissed because Plaintiffs fail to identify what specific terms of the Passport Agreement Raymond James allegedly breached, and that the breach of contract claims are otherwise premised on a term that either does not exist or is contradicted by the Passport Agreement's express terms. ECF No. [49], at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants cite to several cases supporting the proposition that a breach of contract claim should be dismissed where a plaintiff fails to identify the specific contractual provision a defendant is alleged to have breached, including two decisions authored by this Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. However, Defendants' reliance on these decisions is misplaced. Unlike in the present case, the plaintiffs in the decisions cited in Defendant's Motion could note cite to a specific contract provision in bringing their breach of contract claims.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Fla. Sept. 22, 2015) (dismissing a breach of contract\n   claim where plaintiffs alleged the existence of a written contract but failed to identify the specific contractual provisions the defendant allegedly breached). A review of the SAC in this case reveals the opposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In their Response, Plaintiffs contend that the SAC clearly alleges which provisions of the Passport Agreement they claim Raymond James breached. ECF No. [53], at 5. Specifically, the Plaintiffs argue that the SAC cites to four provisions in the Passport Agreement that the Defendants breached, which include the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Customers agree to pay \"a quarterly Advisory Fee ... this fee is based on the level of assets in [their] Account, independent of the level of trading activity.\" ECF No. [38], at \u00b6 38 (quoting the Passport Agreement attached as Exhibit B to the SAC, at 5);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Customers agree to pay a \"flat fee per transaction,\" for \"transaction execution and clearing services.\" ECF No. [38], at \u00b6 42 (quoting the Passport Agreement attached as Exhibit B to the SAC, at 1-2);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Customers understand that the \"Investment Adviser Representative will not share in any Processing Fee. Processing Fees are not commissions, but are to defray the expenses incurred in facilitating the execution and clearing of Client's portfolio transactions.\" ECF No. [38], at \u00b6 43 (quoting the Passport Agreement attached as Exhibit B to the SAC, at 2); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 \"[Customers] should also consider whether it would be better for [the Customer] to pay separately for each trade [the Customer] execute[s] and each product and service [the Customer] use[s].\" ECF No. [38], at \u00b6 39 (quoting the Passport Agreement attached as Exhibit B to the SAC, at 5).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs essentially argue that the Processing Fee Raymond James charged its Customers was a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   commission in violation of the above provisions of the Passport Agreement. Based on the above, the Court agrees with the Plaintiffs that they have adequately identified the provisions in which they claim the Defendants have breached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants further argue that the Plaintiffs cannot escape the express terms of the Passport Agreement. ECF No. [49], at 7-8. Under general contract principles, the plain meaning of a contract's language governs its interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Belize Telecom, Ltd. v. Belize,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3580676\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/528/1298/\">\n    528 F.3d 1298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1307 &amp; n. 11 (11th Cir. 2008).

In reviewing a breach of contract claim on a motion to dismiss, courts must construe contracts in such a way as to give reasonable meaning to all provisions, rather than leaving part of the contract useless.\n   <em>\n    Novoneuron Inc. v. Addiction Research Inst.\n   </em>\n   , Inc.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=326%20Fed.%20Appx.%20505\">\n    326 Fed. Appx. 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 508 (11th Cir. 2009). Here, given the allegedly high mark-up, Plaintiffs are asserting that in application the Processing Fee was not a \"fee\" but rather a \"commission,\" and that the Processing Fee was not being used to \"defray\" costs because it was significantly higher than the actual fees being incurred by the Defendants, and that the charging of such fees was a breach of the terms of the Passport Agreement. Further, to the extent that there is any ambiguity as to whether Raymond James was allowed to charge a Processing Fee in excess of the actual costs associated with executing and clearing of a transaction, such ambiguity would be construed against Raymond James, as the drafting\n   party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cardoso v.
