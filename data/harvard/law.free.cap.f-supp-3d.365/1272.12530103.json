On February 22, 2019, Defendant filed a Reply [ECF No. 63 ] and a Response to Plaintiff's Additional Facts [ECF No. 64] (the \"Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s SOF\"). On February 28, 2019, Plaintiff filed a Surreply [ECF No. 66 ]. The Court has carefully considered the parties' submissions, their exhibits, the record,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Complaint [ECF No. 1 ], and\n   applicable law. For the following reasons, the Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 6, 2017, Plaintiff suffered injuries from a slip and fall on Defendant's vessel, the\n   <em>\n    Carnival\n   </em>\n   Pride. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 1-2). Plaintiff's narrative, supported by the record, is straightforward. Plaintiff slipped and fell in a five-by-five-foot oily puddle of pool water while participating in Defendant's dancing event hosted on the Lido Pool Deck next to the main deck pool. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 11). Plaintiff was dancing barefoot and did not feel any wetness on the floor before falling. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 13). For 30 minutes, Plaintiff and her sister, Jean Gazda, did not witness anyone spill or drop a drink where Plaintiff fell. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, 48). Plaintiff and her sister did not see any crewmembers mopping the floor during the dance. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35, 48). They also did they see anyone exit the pool and walk on the area where Plaintiff slipped and fell. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After falling, Plaintiff felt wet oily pool water on her pants and legs. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 13, 16). Plaintiff and her sister could not see the puddle because the pool deck was dimly lit, and the floor was shiny. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22, 43). Nevertheless, they both knew there was a large puddle of water and saw the moisture on the left side of Plaintiff's body. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff knew it was pool water because it was not colored, lacked an odor, and wasn't sticky. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Based on the events leading up to her slip and fall, Plaintiff filed a Complaint [ECF No. 1 ] asserting a single negligence claim (Count I) (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-29). Plaintiff contends Defendant could have closed or reasonably maintained the Lido Pool Deck during the dancing event to ensure the floors were dry, or at a minimum, placed signs in the area to alert passengers the floor could be wet and slippery. (\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant now seeks summary judgment arguing no genuine dispute of material fact remains on Plaintiff's negligence claim. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot.; Reply).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Summary judgment is rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant asserts it is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff has failed to present triable issues of fact on whether Defendant breached its duty of care. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot.;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Reply). Specifically, Defendant contends (1) no dangerous condition existed (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. 8-12), and in any event (2) it was not placed on either actual or constructive notice of any dangerous condition (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   12-15). The Court addresses, and rejects, these two arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Dangerous Condition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   First, Defendant asserts no dangerous condition existed to give rise to a breach of a duty of care. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   8). Defendant posits Plaintiff's record evidence is limited to guesswork that is insufficient to withstand summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   9). Defendant insists \"[c]ommon sense dictates that an invisible film of 'sunscreen oils and aerosols' in the midst of a large number of 'line dancers' would have created a noticeable safety issue long before [ ] Plaintiff's fall.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   10 (alterations added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"A dangerous condition is one that is not apparent and obvious to a passenger .... The mere fact that an accident occurs does not give rise to a presumption that the setting of the accident constituted a dangerous condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v. NCL (Bah.) Ltd.\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:15-cv-22254,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204809347\">\n    2016 WL 4809347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (S.D.

App'x 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2017) (alteration added; citations omitted). Certainly, \"[a] cruise line does not need to warn passengers or make special arrangements for open-and-obvious risks ....

Again, Plaintiff slipped and fell in a five-by-five-foot oily puddle of pool water. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 11). She was dancing barefoot and did not feel any wetness on the floor before falling. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 13). Plaintiff and her sister could not\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   the puddle because the pool deck was dimly lit, and the floor was shiny. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20, 22, 43). Yet, they both eventually inferred there was a large puddle of water from the moisture on Plaintiff's body. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Under these facts, a reasonable trier of fact could find the puddle was a dangerous condition that was not open and obvious -- that a passenger reasonably would not expect to find the puddle of water that caused Plaintiff's injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diczok v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267392\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/263/1261/#p1265\">\n    263 F.Supp.3d 1261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1265 (S.D.

Actual Or Constructive Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant next argues that even if a dangerous condition existed, there is no record evidence to support an inference Defendant had actual or constructive notice of such a condition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 12-15). Defendant contends Plaintiff's testimony regarding constructive notice is predicated on speculation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   15). The Court must again disagree with Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"In the Eleventh Circuit, under federal maritime law, there must be a finding of actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition before a cruise ship can be held liable for negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Wieters v.

(\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 19).
