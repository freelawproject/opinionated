Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This lawsuit involves facts that are nothing short of horrific. A houseboat is beached in a popular swimming area called Sandy Point, a place where boaters and swimmers comingle. When a houseboat unexpectedly starts its engines tragedy strikes. A four-year old girl is sucked into the propeller, mutilated, and drowned. Her father, while attempting to save her, had both his legs amputated by the boat's propeller-he would eventually die from those injuries. The wife and mother of the husband and daughter was a bystander and witnessed the entire grisly scene. Plaintiffs have brought an action for damages against the United States of America under the Federal Tort Claims Act (the \"FTCA\") in response to these events. Plaintiffs' claim focuses on allegations that Defendant was (1) aware of the fact that Sandy Point was used by both swimmers and boaters; (2) that the operation of boats presented a hazard to swimmers in the same area; and (3) that Defendant failed to properly regulate the use of motorized vehicles in this environment and did not post any signs warning the public of the hazards of having both boats and swimmers sharing the same space.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Federal Tort Claims Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The FTCA waives sovereign immunity and permits suit against the United States for claims sounding in state tort law for money damages.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202674\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (waiving sovereign immunity to make the Government liable \"in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances\").

Preliminary Disputes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The first issue to be addressed is who has the burden of establishing jurisdiction. The Court finds that the burden rests on the plaintiff because they are the party asserting jurisdiction. At the pleading stage, the plaintiff has the burden to \"invoke the court's jurisdiction by alleging a claim that is facially outside of the discretionary function exception.\"\n   <em>\n    Freeman v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3331652\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/326/#p334\">\n    556 F.3d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 334 (5th Cir. 2009). The Court notes it is unclear whether the plaintiff or the government bears the ultimate burden of proving that the discretionary function exception applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    St. Tammany Par., ex rel. Davis v. Fed. Emergency Mgmt.

However, there is no question that the plaintiff bears the burden of showing Congress' unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147542\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/375/#p377\">\n    511 U.S. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147542\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/375/#p377\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147542\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/375/#p377\">\n    128 L.Ed.2d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). At the motion to dismiss stage, this includes pleading facts that facially allege matters outside of the discretionary function exception.\n   <em>\n    St. Tammany Parish\n   </em>\n   , 556 F.3d at 315 n.3. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that it is Plaintiffs' burden (1) to establish that the discretionary function exception does not apply; and (2) to establish that the decision of the United States Army Corps of Engineers (\"USACE\") allowing swimmers and boaters to mix at Sandy Point was either not discretionary or not subject to a policy analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    499 U.S. at 322-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The next issue is whether the Court must, as is typical at a motion to dismiss stage, accept the factual allegations in the complaint as true. The Government contends that at this stage-where the Court is determining whether or not subject matter jurisdiction exists-\"no presumptive truthfulness attaches to the plaintiff's allegations....\" Document No. 17 at 2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Montez v. Dep't of Navy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9187260\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/392/147/#p149\">\n    392 F.3d 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149 (5th Cir. 2004) ). The Court finds that in determining whether it is properly vested with subject matter jurisdiction, it is \" 'free to weigh the evidence and resolve factual disputes in order to satisfy itself that it has the power to hear\n   the case.' \"\n   <em>\n    Krim v. pcOrder.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9179000\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/402/489/#p494\">\n    402 F.3d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 494 (5th Cir. 2005) (\n   <em>\n    quoting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montez v.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Court is also aware that a Rule 12(b)(1) motion \"should be granted only if it appears certain that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle [the] plaintiff to relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Ramming v. U.S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9391482,9395598\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/281/158/\">\n    281 F.3d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 161 (5th Cir. 2001) (citing\n   <em>\n    Home Builders Ass'n of Miss., Inc. v.

The Government contends that this is a misstatement of the law. According to the Government, the question for the Court is instead whether the choice is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     susceptible\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to policy analysis or is \"grounded in the policy of the regulatory regime.\"\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    499 U.S. at 324-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It does not matter whether the employee \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     in fact\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   engaged in a policy analysis when reaching his decision\" as long as his decision is \"susceptible to policy analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Spotts v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3704222\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/613/559/#p572\">\n    613 F.3d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 572 (5th Cir. 2010) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    499 U.S. at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (emphasis in original). The Court sides with the Government on this issue because it believes the Government has correctly stated the appropriate standard regarding the discretionary function exception. The Court also concurs that where a regulation or policy affords discretion to the employee, \"the very existence of the regulation creates a\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     strong presumption\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \" that the discretionary action taken under that regulation or policy implicates the same policy considerations.\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    499 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. The Discretionary function exception\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court begins with the issues regarding the discretionary function exception to the FTCA. The discretionary function exception provides broad immunity-it precludes tort liability for \"[a]ny claim based upon an act or omission of an employee of the Government ... based upon ... a discretionary function or duty....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The statutory delegation then goes on to address access to the water areas:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   The water areas of all such projects\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     shall be open to public use generally\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   for boating, swimming, bathing, fishing, and other recreational purposes, and ready access to and exit from such areas along the shores of such projects shall be maintained for general public use, when such use is determined by the Secretary of the Army not to be contrary to the public interest,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     all under such rules and regulations as the Secretary of the Army may deem necessary.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   16 U.S.C. \u00a7 460d.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   USACE has subsequently promulgated regulations governing the use of water areas, which make clear that boats can be used generally in all locations except where expressly prohibited and that swimming may also be done at one's own risk anywhere not specifically prohibited.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20327.3\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 327.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), 327.5(a). Again, the regulations both permit mixed use water areas such as the one at Sandy Point, while simultaneously giving broad discretion to USACE to determine whether and where to limit access to boaters or swimmers. The Court finds that a plain reading of the statute makes clear that the Secretary of the Army is afforded broad discretion to control the use, users, and access to areas such as Sandy Point. Additionally, there is indisputable evidence that USACE\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     did\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   promulgate subsequent regulations using such discretion and that the decision to allow boaters and swimmers to use Sandy Point was a discretionary decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20327.3\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 327.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), 327.5(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs, understandably, argue that USACE's decision allowing swimmers and boaters to cohabitate in the same body of water is inherently dangerous and for this reason believe that USACE's decision was\n   negligent. However, this is not the question before the Court. Instead, the question is whether any discretionary action was taken pursuant to an existing regulation or statute. As repugnant as it might seem given the tragedy that occurred, the question before the Court is not whether the action that was taken, based on the exercise of that discretion, was negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   However, the Court finds that the decision whether to place a warning about the allegedly dangerous condition created by USACE's discretionary choice-allowing swimmers and boaters to cohabitate-is not necessarily an exercise of discretion, although it might be. While Defendant may be correct that no statute or regulation compels USACE to place any warning, and the regulations warn that swimming \"at one's own risk is permitted,\" the Court finds that it is not appropriate to dismiss the failure to warn claim at the motion to dismiss stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Government relies on Fifth Circuit precedent holding that both \"the evaluation of actual or suspected hazards, and the decision to proceed in a particular manner in light of those hazards, are protected discretionary acts, not subject to tort claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Ford v.

United States\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit oversaw a challenge to federal officials' management of relief operations and evacuation efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3331652\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/326/#p334\">\n    556 F.3d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 328 (5th Cir. 2009). The Fifth Circuit held that \"the government's decisions about when, where, and how to allocate limited resources within the exigencies of an emergency are the types of decisions that the discretionary function exception was designed to shelter from suit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3331652\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/326/#p334\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3331652\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/326/#p334\">\n    at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Although no emergency situation is implicated in this case,\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   is still instructive in that USACE is tasked with deciding when, where, and how to allocate limited resources. USACE is tasked with-and given discretion to-manage a variety of resources at a location like Sandy Point.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20327.1\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 327.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . USACE is tasked with providing \"the public with safe and healthful recreational opportunities\" while at the same time \"protecting and enhancing\" the resources providing such opportunities. The Court agrees with Defendants that USACE must balance both factors as it manages its limited resources as best it can in each situation. In light of the \"strong presumption\" that, where permitted by the relevant statute or regulation, the exercise of choice or judgment implicates relevant policy, decisions regarding how to provide \"the public with safe and healthful recreational opportunities\" while at the same time \"protecting and enhancing\" the resources providing such opportunities are grounded in social, economic, and public policy.\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    499 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Court is mindful that the proper inquiry under prong two is not whether Defendant was in fact engaged in a policy analysis when reaching its decision but instead whether the decision was \"susceptible to policy analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    499 U.S. at 325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The focus of the inquiry is not on the agent's subjective intent in exercising the discretion conferred by statute or regulation, but on the nature of the actions taken and on whether they are susceptible to policy analysis.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shansky v.

The Court finds Plaintiffs have failed to defeat Defendants' contention that regardless of the actual decision-making process, the health, safety, financial, and other feasibility concerns implicated by USACE's discretionary decision render that decision susceptible to policy analysis. As such, the Court dismisses Plaintiffs' claim based on USACE's decision allowing mixed use by boaters at swimmers at Sandy Point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The question of whether the decision allowing mixed use in certain parts of Sandy Point, without warnings, is susceptible to policy analysis requires a separate discussion. There is certainly Fifth Circuit precedent indicating that the Court should find that the decision whether to warn the public of the mixed use is a discretionary function. For example, there is the decision in\n   <em>\n    Theriot v. United States\n   </em>\n   , in which the Fifth Circuit considered how the USACE was to notify the public of the existence of a sill-an underwater dam formed naturally from sediment-in the Mississippi River.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11114464\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/245/388/\">\n    245 F.3d 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1998). The Fifth Circuit determined that USACE's decision was subject to policy considerations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11114464\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/245/388/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11114464\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/245/388/\">\n    at 399-400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those considerations included \"the degree of danger an object poses, the vessel traffic type and density, the location of the object in relation to the navigable channel, the history of vessel accidents, and the feasibility and economics, including costs, of erecting and\n   maintaining physical markers in light of the available resources.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11114464\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/245/388/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Hix v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs\n   </em>\n   , an unpublished opinion, the Fifth Circuit found that USACE's decisions with respect to placing and removing warning signs fell \"squarely within the discretionary function exception to the FTCA.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"878856\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/155/121/#p126\">\n    155 F. App'x 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126 (5th Cir. 2005). Defendant also argues that the decision whether to post warnings in this situation is the type of decision that is subject to the same policy considerations that underlay Congress' decision to grant USACE discretion to manage the water areas of Temple Lake Park.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    499 U.S. at 324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court hesitates granting Defendants' motion to dismiss the claim based on a failure to warn because of the holding in the Fifth Circuit case of\n   <em>\n    Wysinger v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548254\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/784/1252/#p1253\">\n    784 F.2d 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1986). In\n   <em>\n    Wysinger\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   It is clear in this case that the discretionary action which is at issue was the decision of the Forest Service that a life guard was not necessary at this site. Since appellant's wrongful death claim is based upon failure to have a life guard at the site, the attempt to recover under the Federal Tort Claims Act must fail because the governmental decision not to have a life guard at the site fell in the \"discretionary function\" exception to jurisdiction under the Federal Tort Claims Act.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Only if there had been a life guard on duty who acted negligently, or the government had negligently failed to warn of dangers at the swimming site would there be jurisdiction under the Federal Tort Claims Act.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548254\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/784/1252/#p1253\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1548254\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/784/1252/#p1253\">\n    at 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The Court cannot find that it lacks jurisdiction over a claim of liability based on the failure to warn given the holding in\n   <em>\n    Wysinger\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The Court expresses no opinion as to whether Defendant is in fact liable for failing to post warnings or whether Defendant even had a duty to post warnings. Instead, this decision is limited to the question of whether the Court has subject matter jurisdiction to consider the claim or must dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Because of the foregoing, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Original Complaint.
