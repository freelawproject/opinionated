D. 4 \u00b6 1. On October 22, 2015, Algonquin and Maritimes &amp; Northeast Pipeline, LLC (\"Maritimes\") filed an application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") to construct and operate a natural gas pipeline and related facilities known as the Atlantic Bridge Project (\"AB Project\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. As a part of the AB Project, Algonquin proposed to construct a compressor station located in Weymouth (the \"Compressor Station\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. Weymouth filed an unopposed petition to intervene in Algonquin and Maritimes' application process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5; D. 6-1 at 145.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 2, 2016, FERC issued an environmental assessment for the AB Project. D. 4 \u00b6\u00b6 6-7; D. 6-1. FERC's assessment, which was subject to a thirty-day comment period, addressed potential environmental issues associated with the Compressor Station, including air quality, noise, and visual effects, as well as possible alternative locations for the Compressor Station. D. 4 \u00b6\u00b6 6-7; D. 6-1 at 18-52. FERC determined that \"the impacts associated with [the AB\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Project] can be mitigated to support a finding of no significant impact.\" D. 4 \u00b6 8; D. 6-1 at 16. FERC concluded that an environmental impact study was not warranted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On January 25, 2017, FERC issued a certificate (the \"Certificate\") granting Algonquin's application for authorization to construct and operate the AB Project subject to certain conditions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. 4 \u00b6 10; D. 6-1 at 54, including the completion of construction within two years from the date of the AB Certificate, compliance with applicable NGA regulations and compliance with environmental conditions outlined in Appendix B to the AB Certificate. D. 6-1 at 142-53. On February 24, 2017, Weymouth filed requests for rehearing and rescission of FERC's order authorizing the AB Project and a motion to stay the order. D. 4 \u00b6 11; D. 7-1 at 1-93. FERC denied both requests. D. 7-1 at 97-98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As part of the conditions FERC set forth in Appendix B to the AB Certificate, Algonquin must obtain a consistency certification from the Massachusetts Office of Coastal Zone Management (\"MCZM\") before beginning construction of the Compressor Station, D. 4 \u00b6 16; D. 6-1 at 151. The MCZM is the lead state agency responsible for implementing the Massachusetts Coastal Management Program (\"MCMP\") and reviewing federal licenses and permits to ensure consistency with the Coastal Zone Management Act (\"CZMA\"). D. 4 \u00b6 17; D. 8-1 at 33. The Compressor Station would be in a \"coastal zone\" as defined by the CZMA because it affects land regulated by the MCMP.

In making consistency determinations as authorized by the CZMA, the MCZM reviews whether projects requiring a federal permit are consistent with the \"enforceable policies\" contained within the MCMP. D. 4 \u00b6 18; D. 8-1 at 35;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   16 U.S.C \u00a7 1456(c)(3)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The MCZM has published a policy guide (the \"Policy Guide\") that \"serve[s] as the official reference for the enforceable policies, listed federal actions, and necessary data and information for the Massachusetts coastal program.\" D. 4 \u00b6 19; D. 8-1 at 35. Appendix 3 of the Policy Guide includes a \"complete list\" of statutes, regulation and other legal authorities \"that constitute the legal basis for the enforceable [MCMP] policies.\" D. 4 \u00b6 38; D. 8-1 at 3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. 8-1 at 133-37. The list includes, in relevant part, the Public Waterfront Act, Mass. Gen. L. c. 91 (\"Chapter 91\") and the Massachusetts Waterways Regulation, 310 C.M.R. \u00a7 9.00, D. 8-1 at 136, which are germane to the AB Project's consistency certification process given that permanent facilities and construction work associated with the Compressor Station require use of private and public tidelands regulated by Chapter 91 and 310 C.M.R. \u00a7 9.00.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. 4 \u00b6 40. Specifically, the Policy Guide states that an application for consistency certification must include \"complete state licenses or permit applications, including a Chapter 91 Waterways License pursuant to 310 CMR \u00a7 9.00\" (\"Chapter 91 License\"). D. 4 \u00b6 39;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. 8-1 at 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 8, 2015, Algonquin filed an application with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\") seeking a Chapter 91 License, which would authorize Algonquin to use certain filled tidelands to construct the Compressor Station. D. 4 \u00b6 41; D. 8 \u00b6 3. On May 17, 2017, DEP issued a \"Written Determination Pursuant to M.G.L. Chapter 91\" (the \"Written Determination\") expressing \"its intent to approve [Algonquin's] application subject to the attached conditions.\" D. 4 \u00b6 42;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. 8-1 at 2. According to the Written Determination, DEP will not issue a Chapter 91 License until the Compression Station receives local approval pursuant to 310 C.M.R. \u00a7 9.11(3)(c)(3) (explaining that DEP may\n   only provide a Chapter 91 license when the applicant has submitted, among other things, final documentation relative to other state and local approvals that must be obtained) or until a determination is made that such approvals are preempted under the NGA. D. 4 \u00b6 44; D. 8-1 at 4-5. DEP noted, however, that the FERC Certificate authorizing the AB Project expressly stated that \"permits which unreasonably delay the construction or operation of facilities approved by [FERC] may be inconsistent with the [NGA].\" D. 8-1 at 4-5 (internal quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On June 7, 2017, Weymouth appealed the Written Determination to DEP's Office of Appeals and Dispute Resolution (\"OADR\"). D. 4 \u00b6 45; D. 8-1 at 143-63. In its prehearing statement, Weymouth asserted, among other things, that the Written Determination was prematurely issued and a final Chapter 91 License was inappropriate given that Algonquin had not received certain local approvals, including a certificate of compliance with Weymouth's wetlands ordinance (at issue in\n   <em>\n    Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC v. Weymouth Conservation Commission et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-10788-DJC (\"\n   <em>\n    Algonquin I\"\n   </em>\n   ) )\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and its zoning ordinance (the \"Ordinance\") prohibiting buildings erected, altered or used \"for any purposes injurious, noxious or offensive to a neighborhood by reason of the emission of odor, fumes, dust, smoke, vibration or noise....\" D. 8-1 at 233-34;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. 4 \u00b6 46. Weymouth explained that the Compressor Station violates the Ordinance because it is \"not included in the [Ordinance's] list of exempted purposes, and because it would result in the emission of noxious and offensive noises and odors.\" D. 4 \u00b6 48; D. 8-1 at 233-34. Weymouth concluded that the Compressor Station would not comply with the Ordinance even though Algonquin has not applied for a building permit or a municipal zoning certificate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. 23 \u00b6\u00b6 6-12; D. 21-1 \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Weymouth also filed a motion to stay the appeal of the DEP's Written Determination until Algonquin demonstrated compliance with the Ordinance and the wetlands ordinance at issue in\n   <em>\n    Algonquin I\n   </em>\n   , or obtained a ruling from a court of competent jurisdiction preempting the same.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. 4 \u00b6 49; D. 8-1 at 249-61. On August 22, 2017, the DEP officer presiding over Weymouth's appeal issued an order staying the Chapter 91 license proceeding until this Court issued a decision regarding whether \"the Weymouth Conservation Commission's denial of a wetlands permit under the Weymouth wetlands ordinance is preempted by the NGA.\" D. 4 \u00b6 54; D. 8-2 at 6-7. Following this Court's determination in\n   <em>\n    Algonquin I\n   </em>\n   that the wetlands ordinance is preempted by the NGA, Algonquin moved to lift the stay of the Chapter 91 license proceeding. D. 4 \u00b6 56; D. 8-2 at 44-49. Weymouth opposed Algonquin's motion, in part, because it alleged this Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Algonquin I\n   </em>\n   was \"clearly erroneous and likely to be overturned on appeal.\" D. 8-2 at 51. In March 2018, the DEP presiding officer issued an order that vacated the stay and scheduled bifurcated hearings on the issues raised in Weymouth's appeal, including whether Algonquin is \"required to obtain a municipal zoning certificate\" to obtain a Chapter 91 License. D. 8-2 at 71 n.8. On November 21, 2018, the DEP presiding officer ruled, in relevant part, that Algonquin \"must obtain a local zoning certificate prior to final license\n   issuance unless [the Ordinance] is preempted by the Natural Gas Act.\" D. 36 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

D. 1. Algonquin has now moved for summary judgment. D. 3. Weymouth filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, D. 21, and moved to dismiss the complaint, D. 19.

Because FERC has already \"carefully reviewed the very\" proposal Weymouth \"seek[ ] to further regulate and, after considering environmental impacts, authorized the project,\" the Ordinance \"clearly collides with FERC's delegated authority and is preempted\" in its entirety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Weaver's Cove\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500401\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/589/458/#p467\">\n    589 F.3d at 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Weymouth also asserts that the Ordinance does not conflict with FERC's exclusive authority to review and approve the Compressor Station because Algonquin never applied for a municipal zoning certificate and, as a result, has not determined which provisions of the Ordinance that might apply. D. 22 at 18. However, \"subjecting the project to regulation under the [O]rdinance,\" including the municipal zoning certification process, \"would be tantamount to conferring on [Weymouth] the power to review and nullify FERC's decision\" authorizing the Compressor Station's construction.\n   <em>\n    Algonquin LNG v. Loqa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11493530\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/79/49/#p52\">\n    79 F.Supp.2d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52 (D.R.I. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, Weymouth asserts that discovery is needed before the Court can reach a decision on summary judgment. Where, as here, the parties have litigated an overlapping issue,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Algonquin I\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-10788-DJC, and have provided hundreds of pages of exhibits, affidavits and an administrative record in support of the pending motions, the issue here is ripe for resolution at this stage in the litigation. For the aforementioned reasons, the Ordinance conflicts with the NGA and is preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court ALLOWS Algonquin's motion for summary judgment. D. 3. The Court DENIES Weymouth's motion to dismiss, D. 19, and cross-motion for summary judgment, D. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    So Ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Weymouth disputes several facts that contain characterizations of documents only \"to the extent th[e] characterization differs from the document's content\" and does not otherwise dispute the authenticity of the underlying document or the Court's authority to consider the same in resolving the pending motions discussed herein.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , D. 24 \u00b6 6.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Algonquin I\n    </em>\n    , this Court ruled in Algonquin's favor, concluding that Weymouth's wetlands ordinance conflicted with the NGA and, therefore, was preempted.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Algonquin I\n    </em>\n    , No. 17-cv-10788-DJC, D. 38 at 14. Weymouth filed an appeal on July 24, 2018, and the First Circuit held oral argument on that matter on January 8, 2019. As of the date of this Court's order, the First Circuit had not yet decided\n    <em>\n     Algonquin I\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    In light of this ruling, the Court does not reach Algonquin's field preemption argument.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Weymouth attempts to narrow the scope of\n    <em>\n     Weaver's Cove\n    </em>\n    application to the instant case by asserting that the First Circuit found conflict preemption for an LNG terminal based on the NGA's grant of express, preemptive jurisdiction over such facilities and the Compressor Station at issue here is not an LNG terminal. D. 22 at 20. FERC has the exclusive authority to issue a certificate of public convenience and necessity, which authorizes the construction and operation of facilities like the Compressor Station.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717c. To the extent the Weymouth Zoning Ordinance conflicts with that authority, the First Circuit's analysis of conflict preemption in\n    <em>\n     Weaver's Cove\n    </em>\n    applies with equal force to the facts at issue here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
