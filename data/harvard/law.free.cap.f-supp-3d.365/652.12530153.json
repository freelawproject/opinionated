BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   in this case seek damages for injuries resulting from the unauthorized publication of their personal information\n   on the internet. Plaintiffs allege that their information was illegally obtained by Russian intelligence operatives during the Russians' hack of computer servers belonging to the Democratic National Committee (\"DNC\" or the \"Committee\"). The Amended Complaint alleges that \"[a]gents of the Trump Campaign, acting on behalf of the Campaign, met with-and were otherwise in contact with-Russian officials or their agents on numerous occasions during the spring and summer of 2016.\" ( Am. Compl. \u00b6 15, ECF No. 8.) During this period, the Kremlin alerted Donald J. Trump for President, Inc. (the \"Campaign\" or \"Defendant\") that it possessed stolen DNC emails and could publicize them in order to harm the DNC and Mr. Trump's political opponent, Hillary Clinton, thereby helping the Campaign win the 2016 presidential election. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) In return, the Campaign and the Russian regime allegedly agreed that the Campaign would provide political benefits to Russia. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Following this coordination of effort, and at the direction of the Campaign and Russian agents, \"the emails were then released by WikiLeaks, which joined the conspiracy as a trusted Russian intermediary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the Amended Complaint, \"[i]n order to defeat Secretary Clinton and help elect Mr. Trump, hackers working on behalf of the Russian government,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86), allegedly converted \"voluminous amounts of data, including emails and other documents sent to and from thousands of individuals. Some of those individuals were staff members of the DNC; some were donors; and some were other supporters, members of the media, or other private citizens.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) \"On July 22, 2016, WikiLeaks posted thousands of private emails on the Internet. These emails were made available to anybody in the world with a web browser.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) As a result of the publication of the Plaintiffs' personal information, which allegedly included emails, social security numbers, dates of birth, home addresses, phone numbers, and banking relationships, they allegedly sustained significant personal and financial damage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.) This lawsuit followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs' Amended Complaint alleges three discrete causes of action. In Count I, they allege a conspiracy to intimidate lawful voters from giving support or advocacy to electors for president and to injure citizens in person or property on account of such support or advocacy in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 257-70.) Count II seeks damages for public disclosure of private facts as to Mr. Cockrum in violation of Tennessee law (civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting liability). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 271-78.) The third count is a claim of public disclosure of private facts as to Mr. Comer in violation of Maryland law (civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting liability). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 279-86.) Count IV alleges public disclosure of private facts as to Mr. Schoenberg in violation of New Jersey law (civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting liability). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 287-94.) Count V is a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress as to Mr. Comer in violation of Maryland law (civil conspiracy and aiding and abetting liability). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 295-303.) During oral argument, Plaintiffs moved to dismiss Count VI, which seeks damages for civil conspiracy in violation of the common law. Counsel represented to the Court that it wished to dismiss Count VI because the theory underlying this cause of action is\n   integrated into the preceding counts. Consequently, the Court will grant counsel's oral motion, and Count VI will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Presently before the Court is Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (the \"Motion,\" ECF No. 22.) Both the Plaintiffs and the Campaign have filed extensive memoranda supporting their respective positions on the pending Motion. The Court heard oral argument on January 24, 2019. The parties were then directed to file supplemental memoranda addressing the choice of law governing Counts II, III, and IV. The parties have done so, and the matter is now ripe for this Court's review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The well-pleaded facts contained within the Amended Complaint both inform and constrain this Court's review of the Campaign's Motion at this stage. The task at hand is to determine the sufficiency of the Amended Complaint, \"not resolve contests surrounding the facts, the merits of a claim, or the applicability of defenses.\"\n   <em>\n    Republican Party of N.C. v.

At this stage of the proceedings, the record is one dimensional, focusing solely on the adequacy of the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss \"should not be granted unless it appears certain that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts which would support its claim and would entitle it to relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Mylan Labs., Inc. v.

Here, unlike\n   <em>\n    Bartnicki\n   </em>\n   , the Campaign is alleged to have conspired with the Kremlin and WikiLeaks prior to the information being released and for its own benefit. The Amended Complaint alleges that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   In June 2016, six weeks after learning that the Russians had \"dirt\" that they were willing to use to benefit the Campaign, senior Trump Campaign officials met with an agent of the Russian regime .... According to email correspondence regarding the meeting that Donald Trump Jr. made public on his Twitter account, rather than avoiding coordination with a foreign government that was attempting to interfere in a U.S. election, Mr. Trump Jr. responded over the email: \"If it's what you say I love it especially later in the summer.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 15.) Furthermore, the information at issue in\n   <em>\n    Bartnicki\n   </em>\n   pertained to a contemplated act of violence\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   , clearly a matter of public concern.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301565\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/514/\">\n    532 U.S. at 519, 525, 540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301565\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/514/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At this stage of the proceedings, the Court's analysis of the Defendant's 12(b)(6) Motion is limited to the four comers of the Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v.

The Amended Complaint discloses in considerable detail the alleged interactions between the Campaign and Russian operatives to arrange for the publication of the stolen information. The Amended Complaint provides specific dates and identifies participants in conversations and meetings concerning publication of the stolen DNC emails. For example, Paragraph 113 of the Amended Complaint reads,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [a]ll told, during the four months and eight days between March 14, 2016, when Mr. Papadopoulos first made contact with a Russian agent, and July 22, 2016, when the stolen DNC emails were released on WikiLeaks, agents and associates of the Trump Campaign had at\n   least 41 separate contacts with Russian agents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 113.) Collectively, the detailed descriptions of conversations and meetings between representatives of the Campaign and Russian operatives is more than ample at this point to provide a plausible factual basis for Plaintiffs' allegation that the Campaign was aware that the stolen information had been unlawfully obtained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The second facet of the Campaign's First Amendment challenge is its contention that the disclosed information dealt with matters of public concern. This is a closer question, particularly since the information was at least in part related to a political campaign and a candidate's supporters. The Campaign maintains that the disclosure may have contained some peripheral private information concerning the individual Plaintiffs, but it was overshadowed by information concerning the Clinton Campaign and the DNC, including the Committee's hostility towards Senator Bernie Sanders and Hispanic voters.

In addition to this formidable authority, the Eighth Circuit reached a similar conclusion in a \u00a7 1985(3) case that was brought under the support or advocacy clauses of \u00a7 1985(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Federer v.

Where the right is contingent on state action, a litigant must plead state action as part of his claim. Accordingly, a court's assessment of any \u00a7 1985(3) claim begins with the threshold question: what is the constitutional right at issue? This Court's analysis of Count I therefore begins by determining the right Plaintiffs seek to vindicate, and then focuses on whether Plaintiffs pleaded sufficient facts to support their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1985(3) Claim Fails in the Absence of State Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In Count I, Plaintiffs contend they have alleged a viable claim under \u00a7 1985(3)'s support or advocacy clauses. (Pls.' Mem. Opp'n Mot. Dismiss 23.) The Amended Complaint states, \"one or more conspirators caused to be published on the Internet hacked DNC emails containing private facts about Plaintiffs ... including Plaintiffs', lawful\n   <em>\n    support and advocacy\n   </em>\n   for a candidate for President.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 263 (emphasis added).) Plaintiffs further allege that \"[a]s a natural and foreseeable result of the conspiracy, Plaintiffs, among other persons, were injured in their persons and property.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 268.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Campaign, on the other hand, argues that Plaintiffs claim under \u00a7 1985(3) must be dismissed because (i) the alleged conspiracy did not involve physical violence, or the threat thereof; (ii)\n   <em>\n    the alleged conspiracy does not allege state action\n   </em>\n   ; (iii) Plaintiffs were not the intended target of the alleged conspiracy; and (iv) because Plaintiffs improperly attempt to hold the Campaign liable under a theory of respondeat superior. (Def.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 17-24.) The Court agrees with the Campaign that Plaintiffs' claim under Count I must be dismissed based on the absence of state action-a necessary component of Plaintiffs' \u00a7 1985(3) claim. Furthermore, because this factor is by itself dispositive of Count I, the Court need not address the Campaign's alternative arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Plaintiffs and the Campaign agree that the equal protection clauses of \u00a7 1985(3) are vehicles for asserting rights that are established elsewhere. (Pls.' Mem. Opp'n Mot. Dismiss 27; Def.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 21.) However, the parties disagree as to whether the same constraint applies to the statute's support or advocacy section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Reading the statute as a whole, the Campaign argues that \u00a7 1985(3) is purely remedial, and therefore, a litigant must allege the violation of a substantive constitutional right. The Campaign states, \" Section 1985(3) is thus designed to enforce preexisting constitutional rights against state action, not to create new rights against private action. Indeed, the enforcement clauses empower Congress only to enact 'remedial' laws enforcing preexisting rights; they do not empower it to enact 'substantive' laws expanding those rights.\" (Def.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 21-22 (emphasis omitted) (citation omitted).) Therefore, the Campaign argues Plaintiffs must allege a substantive right for Count I to proceed. Furthermore, because Plaintiffs' claim seeks to vindicate First Amendment rights, they must also allege state action.

This Court recognizes that the claims in\n   <em>\n    Novotny\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Carpenters\n   </em>\n   were brought under \u00a7 1985(3)'s equal protection clauses; however, in rendering those decisions the Supreme Court interpreted \u00a7 1985(3)\n   <em>\n    as a whole\n   </em>\n   when describing the statute's remedial nature. Certainly, the Supreme Court could have distinguished its interpretation of specific clauses within the statute, but it elected not to do so. Furthermore, the fact that the Supreme Court has interpreted some aspects of \u00a7 1985(3)'s clauses differently,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   footnotes 10-11, bolsters the conclusion that the Court chose not to do so elsewhere-namely with respect to the statute's remedial nature by requiring the vindication of substantive constitutional rights. Accordingly, this Court will follow the Supreme Court's historically consistent interpretation, as it must, and conclude that \u00a7 1985(3) is purely remedial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Therefore, in order to plead a viable claim under Count I, Plaintiffs must allege the violation of a substantive constitutional right coupled with state action. Plaintiffs fail to do so. As noted, the first step in evaluating a \u00a7 1985(3) claim is determining the constitutional right that a litigant seeks to vindicate. Contrary to Plaintiffs' reasoning, the U.S. Constitution does not specifically protect a person's \"support and advocacy ... [for] a candidate for President.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 267.) However, the\n   First Amendment does protect the freedom of speech and the freedom to peacefully assemble from government intrusion. U.S. Const. amend. I. Based on the rights they seek to protect, Plaintiffs' claim will therefore be construed as alleging violations of the First Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carpenters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201192\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/825/#p839\">\n    463 U.S. at 829-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201192\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/825/#p839\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (construing the plaintiffs' claims under the First Amendment where a civil conspiracy violated the right of non-union persons to freely and non-violently associate with other non-union employees);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gill v.

Taking this fact to its logical conclusion, the Campaign is incapable of state action because it is a private entity. The Court therefore agrees with the Campaign's assertion that Plaintiffs' failure to plead state action is fatal to Count I, and that Count will be dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

As this case demonstrates, however, determining the place of the wrong can be an elusive undertaking. In an effort to determine which state's law to apply, the Court will consider the parties' arguments with respect to (1) the proper application of\n   <em>\n    lex loci\n   </em>\n   , (2) the elements of the public disclosure of private facts tort, and (3) the approach for identifying the place of the wrong where the act of publication marks completion of the tort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The parties present competing approaches for applying\n   <em>\n    lex loci\n   </em>\n   to identify the place of the wrong. Relying on\n   <em>\n    Milton\n   </em>\n   , the Campaign suggests that the place of the wrong in a\n   <em>\n    lex loci\n   </em>\n   analysis is always the place of the wrongful act. (Def.'s Suppl. Resp. Br. 2.) In\n   <em>\n    Milton\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff argued that, after termination of his employment in Maryland, the place of the wrong in his action for wrongful discharge was his state of residence, Virginia.\n   <em>\n    Milton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"256917\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/138/519/#p521\">\n    138 F.3d at 521-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Milton reasoned that the effects of the injury were felt in Virginia, thus \"making that state the\n   <em>\n    loci delicti\n   </em>\n   , or place of the injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"256917\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/138/519/#p521\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"256917\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/138/519/#p521\">\n    at 521\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth Circuit rejected Milton's argument, concluding that \"Virginia clearly selects the law of the place\n   <em>\n    where the wrongful act occurred\n   </em>\n   , even when that place differs from the place where the effects of the injury are felt.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"256917\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/138/519/#p521\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"256917\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/138/519/#p521\">\n    at 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In effect, the Campaign therefore argues that the place of the wrong is where the tortious conduct occurred-regardless of whether the actual cause of action had accrued at the time the tortious act was done. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Suppl. Resp. Br. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   However, contrary to the Campaign's reasoning, the\n   <em>\n    Milton\n   </em>\n   court's use of the term \"wrongful act\" carried a precise meaning. Quoting the Supreme Court of Virginia, the\n   <em>\n    Milton\n   </em>\n   court noted that \" '[t]he word 'tort' has a settled meaning in Virginia. A tort is any civil wrong or injury; a wrongful act.' \"\n   <em>\n    Milton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"256917\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/138/519/#p521\">\n    138 F.3d at 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Buchanan v.

Accordingly,\n   because the wrongful act is the\n   <em>\n    tort itself\n   </em>\n   , a court must look to the nature of the tort in determining the place of the wrong. In\n   <em>\n    Milton\n   </em>\n   , the tort was actionable upon the plaintiff's termination. Depending on the tort, however, the cause of action may not accrue until sometime after a defendant's act is complete.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Restatement (First) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 377 cmt. a, n.4 (\"When a person sustains loss by fraud, the place of the wrong is where the loss is sustained, not where fraudulent representations are made.\"). Such instances require an analysis tailored to the tort at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As Plaintiffs point out, the Fourth Circuit adopted such an analysis in\n   <em>\n    Quillen.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Quillen\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff purchased a product in Tennessee and later became ill from use of that product at her home in Virginia.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1573861\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/789/1041/#p1044\">\n    789 F.2d at 1042-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff argued that the district court erred in that case by applying Virginia law to her strict liability claim rather than Tennessee law, given that she had purchased the product in Tennessee and was later hospitalized there after falling ill in Virginia.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1573861\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/789/1041/#p1044\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1573861\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/789/1041/#p1044\">\n    at 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addressing the plaintiff's argument, the Fourth Circuit explained that \"[t]he place of the wrong for purposes of the\n   <em>\n    lex loci delicti\n   </em>\n   rule ... is defined as the place where 'the last event necessary to make an act liable for an alleged tort takes place.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1573861\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/789/1041/#p1044\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3952337\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/436/460/#p462\">\n    436 F.Supp. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   462 ). The court in\n   <em>\n    Quillen\n   </em>\n   looked to the point of completion of the tort-based on its elements-to determine the place of the wrong.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3952337\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/436/460/#p462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the plaintiff's cause of action did not accrue until she became ill in Virginia, the\n   <em>\n    Quillen\n   </em>\n   court found that Virginia, not Tennessee, was the place of the wrong.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3952337\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/436/460/#p462\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Accordingly, this Court finds that, reading the Fourth Circuit's guidance in\n   <em>\n    Milton\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Quillen\n   </em>\n   together, a proper application of\n   <em>\n    lex loci\n   </em>\n   requires a tort-by-tort analysis of when a tort is alleged to have been completed to determine the place of the wrong. Applying this rule, the Court now turns to an analysis of the specific tort alleged in Counts II-IV-public disclosure of private facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In order to determine when the wrongful act in a claim for public disclosure of private facts is complete, the Court must determine the tort's elements, an issue on which the parties are unable to reach a consensus. Unfortunately, the Court draws guidance from a finite well of authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the substantive law of each Plaintiff's home state-Maryland, New Jersey, and Tennessee-govern their respective claims. (Pls.' Mem. Opp'n Mot. Dismiss 9-10.) Each claim was pleaded in the Amended Complaint under the express presumption that the designated states' law would apply. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 60-71.) The crux of Plaintiffs' argument is that these states represent the place of the wrong because the private disclosure of public facts tort was completed when the Plaintiffs were injured in their home states. (Pls.' Suppl. Br. 4-6, ECF No. 86.) As articulated by Plaintiffs, the analysis \"necessarily turns on the elements of the specific tort at issue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) Consequently, the tort's elements control the determination of the last event necessary for the Defendant to be liable, which they contend was each Plaintiff's injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-6.) This argument, however, depends on whether actual injury to the plaintiff is a necessary element of the alleged tort itself, as opposed to an element of damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Public disclosure of private facts is a sparsely litigated invasion of privacy tort. The Restatement (Second) of Torts provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   One who gives publicity to a matter concerning the private life of another is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the matter publicized is of a kind that\n   (a) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (b) is not of legitimate concern to the public.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652D. According to the Restatement's articulation, the tort requires publicity and satisfaction of several criteria with respect to the content of the published information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Although not recognized in every jurisdiction, this cause of action has been acknowledged by courts in Maryland, New Jersey, and Tennessee. However, in the few instances in which the tort has been litigated in those states, the state courts' articulation of the elements tracks closely with that of the Restatement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lindenmuth v.

However, the Fourth Circuit, applying Virginia law, never reached the issue in that case.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1855042\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/704/1296/#p1302\">\n    704 F.2d at 1302-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the jurisdictions whose law Plaintiffs seek to apply, they cite only to a model jury instruction from New Jersey that includes an injury element with no cited underlying authority. (Pls.' Suppl. Reply Br. 6, ECF No. 96.) Notably, according to the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652H cmt. c, \"[w]hether in the absence of proof of actual harm an action [based upon \u00a7 652D ] might be maintained for nominal damages remains uncertain.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Since relevant tort jurisprudence is scant and inconclusive, this Court will adopt for the sake of analysis the elements of the common-law tort of public disclosure of private facts recognized in Maryland, New Jersey, and Tennessee, as Plaintiffs urge. Accordingly, this Court finds that no actual injury is required, and that the wrongful act of public disclosure of private facts was complete upon publishing Plaintiffs' personal information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   However, the Court's\n   <em>\n    lex loci\n   </em>\n   analysis still yields a subsidiary but critical issue-how to identify the place of the wrong, here, the point of publication, which completes the pivotal act of public disclosure. The parties equate the necessary analysis to an analogous publication-based tort, defamation. This Court notes, as it previously has, that it remains \"far from clear\" how the Supreme Court of Virginia would apply\n   <em>\n    lex loci\n   </em>\n   in \"situations where [ ] defamatory content is 'published' in multiple jurisdictions, such as on a national television broadcast or... a website that can be accessed worldwide.\"\n   <em>\n    Kylin Network (Beijing) Movie &amp; Culture Media Co.

June 1, 2017) (Hudson, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that even if the Court determines that publication marks the culmination of the tort, the place of the wrong is nonetheless the Plaintiffs' home states. (Pls.' Suppl. Br. 6.) Plaintiffs urge the Court to adopt an analysis in which \"the legal injury [upon publication] is the location where the information was communicated to the public and caused reputational harm.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs maintain that rather than focusing on the location of reputational impact, as they argue would be the case with defamation, the Court should focus on the\n   <em>\n    personal nature\n   </em>\n   of the public disclosure of private facts; that is, the indignation experienced by Plaintiffs following publication. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.) According to Plaintiffs, focusing on the personal nature of the injury would enable the Court to avoid this convoluted jurisdictional issue where reputational impact can occur in many places depending on where it is accessed.

Enc. 1015 (2d ed. 1896) ). Defamation and public disclosure of private facts are admittedly not identical claims, with the most obvious distinction being that the information published in the latter offense is true. Nonetheless, both have the common element of publication. Information published to the\n   Internet is communicated in a form that is accessible by third parties worldwide. Based on this Court's analysis of closely related jurisprudence, it is of the opinion that the Supreme Court of Virginia would find that the place of the wrong in these claims for public disclosure of private facts is the place where the act of publication to the Internet occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Predicated on this conclusion, the Campaign contends that this renders New York the place of the wrong because the Campaign's headquarters is located there. (Def.'s Br. Supp. Mot. Dismiss 12.) However, Plaintiffs did not allege that the Campaign physically published their information, but rather that they conspired to do so. While the conspiracy was allegedly formed in New York, the underlying tort, the publication, was allegedly done at some later time by a third party, WikiLeaks. Accordingly, it would be inappropriate to designate New York as the place of the wrong.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   According to the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs' \"private information was published to the entire world during the 2016 presidential campaign\" as a result of an alleged conspiracy between the Campaign and Russian agents to \"to harm the DNC and Mr. Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, and help the Trump Campaign.\" (Am. Compl. 1-2.) Upon formation of the agreement, the Campaign and Russian agents allegedly directed WikiLeaks to publish the information online. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) While the Amended Complaint reveals that Wikileaks published the information to the Internet, it does not disclose the location from which the information was posted. Agents of WikiLeaks could have posted the DNC's information from countless locations around the world. Therefore, the Court cannot determine where the act of publication occurred based on the Amended Complaint. As a result, the Court will apply the law of the forum state, Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   As the Court has already noted, the Fourth Circuit considered whether Virginia recognizes a common-law right to privacy in\n   <em>\n    Brown,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1855042\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/704/1296/#p1302\">\n    704 F.2d at 1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result of a limited Virginia statutory right to privacy and the Supreme Court of Virginia's silence as to whether a broader common-law right exists, the\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   court declined to find that Virginia recognizes such a right.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1855042\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/704/1296/#p1302\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court of Virginia\n   later acknowledged its agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    WJLA-TV v.

Therefore, this Court also finds that Virginia does not recognize a common-law right to privacy. Because no such cause of action exists in Virginia, the Court will dismiss Plaintiffs' claims for public disclosure of private facts without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (Count V)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff Comer alleges that Defendant conspired to commit intentional infliction of emotional distress (\"IIED\"), or in the alternative aided and abetted other alleged tortfeasors to that end. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 295-303.) Applying Virginia's\n   <em>\n    lex loci\n   </em>\n   analysis, the Court will first look to the elements of IIED to determine the place of the wrong. A cause of action for IIED exists where \"1) the wrongdoer's conduct was intentional or reckless; 2) the conduct was outrageous or intolerable; 3) there was a causal connection between the wrongdoer's conduct and the resulting emotional distress; and 4) the resulting emotional distress was severe.\"\n   <em>\n    Supervalu, Inc. v.

Based on these elements, the tort of IIED is complete when a plaintiff experiences severe emotional distress. As alleged by Plaintiffs, this occurred in Plaintiff Comer's home state, Maryland. (Pls.' Mem. Opp'n Mot. Dismiss 10.) Thus, the Court will apply Maryland substantive law to Plaintiff Comer's IIED claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Importantly, under Maryland law, conduct sufficient to sustain a claim for IIED must be \"extreme and outrageous.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Harris v.
