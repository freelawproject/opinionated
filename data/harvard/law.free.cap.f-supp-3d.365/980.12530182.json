ECF No. 343 at 7. The $85 million total includes: (1) approximately $45.4 million in damages and restitution for wage-and-hour violations; (2) approximately $6.7 million in statutory penalties; and (3) approximately $33.3 million\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   in civil penalties under PAGA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-16, 19-20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   With one exception, Virgin raises no factual disputes as to Plaintiffs' calculation of damages and penalties.

Scope of Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court first addresses Virgin's contention that Plaintiffs should receive no damages because the Court's prior findings on liability were erroneous. ECF No. 352 at 13-15. Virgin did not request leave to file a motion for reconsideration,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Civil L.R. 7-9(a), and the points Virgin raises in support have been thoroughly litigated already.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, to state the obvious, Virgin's disagreement with the Court's liability rulings does not present a freestanding basis for reducing the amount of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, the Court considers Plaintiffs' argument that Virgin is precluded from raising challenges to Plaintiffs' damages request that were not raised in opposition to Plaintiffs' first motion for summary judgment. ECF No. 343 at 16-17, 20. Generally, \"a party opposing a summary judgment motion must inform the trial judge of the reasons,\n   <em>\n    legal or factual\n   </em>\n   , why summary judgment should not be entered.\"\n   <em>\n    USA Petroleum Co. v.

Where a party \"has a full and fair opportunity to ventilate its views with respect to an issue\" at summary judgment, yet does not raise it, the Ninth Circuit deems the argument abandoned on appeal.\n   <em>\n    BankAmerica Pension Plan v.

ECF No. 352 at 15-16. Virgin cites no authority to support this proposition. Moreover, Plaintiffs' requested relief is based solely on liability incurred by Virgin America up until December 15, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 297 at 3 (stating that Plaintiffs became employees of Alaska Airlines on December 16, 2017); ECF No. 330 at 2 (setting December 15, 2017 as end date for requested relief). As to that liability, Alaska Airlines is part of this litigation as Virgin America's successor in interest. ECF No. 297 at 3-4. \"When the successor in interest voluntarily steps into the shoes of its predecessor, it assumes the obligations of the predecessor's pending litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Zest IP Holdings, LLC v.

Cal. Oct. 16, 2013) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Minn. Min. &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Eco Chem, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317321\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/757/1256/#p1263\">\n    757 F.2d 1256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1263 (Fed.

That role does not allow Alaska to raise previously abandoned arguments at this late stage of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"317321\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/757/1256/#p1263\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (concluding that successor-in-interest could not raise \"new claims and defenses\" upon being joined).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, Virgin argues that it necessarily must be able to raise any arguments regarding damages because Plaintiffs' class certification motion proposed to trifurcate trial into three stages concerning liability, damages, and derivative claims. ECF No. 352 at 16 (citing ECF No. 70 at 35-36). That contention is misplaced. Although Plaintiffs proposed to\n   <em>\n    try\n   </em>\n   their case in this manner, their summary judgment motion sought determinations on their entire case, including the monetary relief at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 225 at 28-33. Virgin was obligated to raise its damages arguments at that point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    USA Petroleum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1834592\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/13/1276/#p1284\">\n    13 F.3d at 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Virgin raises a similar argument that the fact that the parties stipulated to a briefing schedule for this motion that included an opportunity for Virgin to file an opposition necessarily provides Virgin unconstrained freedom to raise any argument. ECF No. 352 at 16 (citing ECF No. 330 at 3). But giving Virgin an opportunity to contest Plaintiffs' final calculation of damages, based on data that had not yet been provided,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 343-1 \u00b6 28, does not equate to Plaintiffs waiving the right to contest Virgin raising untimely new arguments about the legal availability of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Accordingly, the Court will disregard the arguments that Virgin could have raised previously, but did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Damages Model\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Virgin raises a single factual dispute regarding the model Plaintiffs used to calculate damages. Specifically, Virgin contends that Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Breshears, improperly assumed that all class members reported to work one hour before a flight, as required by Virgin's own policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 343-2 \u00b6 33 ; ECF No. 352 at 19-20. Given that some flight attendants arrived late to work, Virgin argues, Plaintiffs have failed to provide sufficient evidence to support this element of the damages model. ECF No. 352 at 20. In response, Plaintiffs contend that it is reasonable to use the flight attendant reporting time required by Virgin's written policy. ECF No. 355 at 10-11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As a threshold matter, Plaintiffs' damages model does not need to capture the precise time each employee reported to work for each shift in order for the Court to award damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tyson Foods, Inc. v.

ECF No. 352 at 17. The Court considers this factor.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Amaral\n    </em>\n    , 163 Cal.

The weight of this factor is lessened, however, given that Virgin has not presented any evidence that the full penalty would be excessive in relation to its ability to pay.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n     <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20572\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (also considering employer's sales and profits relative to penalty amount).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Second, Virgin again emphasizes the uncertainty regarding its liability in this case. ECF No. 352 at 17-18. As set forth in the Court's earlier orders, prior law was unsettled regarding the extraterritorial applicability of California's wage-and-hour laws in this context.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 104 at 11-18 ; ECF No. 121 at 14.

Plaintiffs respond that the Court's prior order finding that Virgin violated California law is sufficient. ECF No. 355 at 10 n.4 (citing ECF No. 317). In the order cited by Plaintiffs, the Court denied Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to prospective injunctive and declaratory relief. ECF No. 317 at 13. From Plaintiffs' response, it appears that they seek only declaratory relief regarding Virgin's past conduct.

The Court will award Plaintiffs' proposed amount, with two exceptions. First, the Court holds that Plaintiffs are not entitled to prejudgment interest on their meal period and rest break claims under California Labor Code section 218.6. Accordingly, the Court subtracts $60,518.78 in prejudgment interest from the proposed total as of October 25, 2018, and $52.16 in the per-day prejudgment interest following that date.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 343 at 15. Second, the Court exercises its discretion under California Labor Code section 2699(e)(2) to reduce the remaining PAGA penalties by 25 percent, from $33,308,200 to $24,981,150.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    In sum, the Court awards Plaintiffs: (1) $45,337,305.29 in damages and restitution; (2) $3,552.71 per day in continuing prejudgment interest after October 25, 2018; (3) $6,704,810 in statutory penalties; and (4) $24,981,150 in PAGA civil penalties.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Plaintiffs are ordered to serve a proposed form of judgment on Defendants within five court days.
