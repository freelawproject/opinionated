ECF No. 73. On December 21, 2018, the Plaintiff filed his response in opposition to the Defendants' motion. ECF No. 76. The Defendants filed a reply on January 4, 2019. ECF No. 93. While the Plaintiff requested oral argument in his response, the Court finds that no additional information will assist the Court in making its decision. Accordingly, upon review of the filings, this matter is now ripe for the Court's consideration. As more fully explained herein, the Defendants' motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This civil action commenced on August 2, 2017, when Michael Barrick (\"Plaintiff\") filed a three-count Complaint alleging wrongful termination and retaliation in violation\n   of West Virginia common law, the Dodd-Frank Act and the Bank Secrecy Act (\"BSA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No 1. On October 6, 2017, the Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Plaintiff's complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. ECF No. 11. On January 29, 2018, this Court granted in part the Defendants' motion, dismissing the Plaintiff's West Virginia common law claim. ECF No. 18. On March 6, 2018, the Plaintiff filed a stipulation of dismissal as to his Dodd-Frank Act claim. ECF No. 21. Several months later, the Plaintiff filed a motion to amend his complaint, which this Court granted. ECF Nos. 32, 33, 36, 39, 40. The Plaintiff's amended complaint, filed on August 9, 2018, alleges two counts, retaliation in violation of the BSA and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\"SOX\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Viewing the material facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, the facts are as follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiff avers that he, along with his father and the rest of the group\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , uncovered and reported an illegal sports gambling operation taking place at Defendant PNGI's casino in Charles Town, West Virginia. Prior to reporting to Bill Florence (\"Florence\"), the Vice President of Table Games\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , the group hired a private investigator, Tim May, who was assisting with the matter. During the course of this investigation, Tim May involved Bob Lind who worked as an investigator for the West Virginia Lottery Commission. Bob Lind assisted Tim May in the investigation and attended meetings Tim May had with the group. The group also discussed contacting the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") and the Plaintiff believes that Herman Barrick and Bob Lind made the decision to contact the FBI. The Plaintiff alleges that Tim May Investigations told Herman Barrick that the FBI was contacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 22, 2017, the Plaintiff met with Florence and Repetto, the Plaintiff's shift manager, about his final written warning. Either during this meeting or the next day, the Plaintiff reported his allegations of the illegal sports gambling operation which was being run by Immordino, the Plaintiff's assistant shift manager.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiff also reported that Champa, another employee, was involved in a sports betting operation and using the money from the sports books to buy a karaoke bar in Laos. The Plaintiff notified Florence that Herman Barrick had contacted the West Virginia Lottery Commission and he was \"pretty sure\" the FBI was also contacted. Pl.'s Ex. 2, Plaintiff Dep. at 337:9-22. After reporting to Florence, the Plaintiff requested a month off so that the company could perform an investigation into the illegal sports gambling that was taking place at the Hollywood Casino property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Florence confronted Immordino about the allegations. Sometime after this discussion, Immordino or Repetto told Florence that the Plaintiff had borrowed large sums\n   of money from other employees. Florence reported the Plaintiff's allegations of illegal sports gambling and the allegations that the Plaintiff had borrowed money from other employees to Hollywood Casino. He also reported the sports gambling allegations to the Deputy Director of Security at the West Virginia Lottery, Hollywood Casino's Vice President of Human Resources, Hollywood Casino's General Manager, and the lead West Virginia Lottery Investigator at the Hollywood Casino Property. As a result of the investigation, it was discovered that Immordino was running sports pools at Hollywood Casino. Following this discovery, Immordino was terminated from his employment with the casino. Pl.'s Ex. 8, Bak-Boychuk Dep. at 16:15-19; Defs.' Ex. E at 11, n.6; Defs.' Ex. M, Bak-Boychuk Dep. at 60:3-22. Champa was not terminated because there was not a conclusive finding that he was involved in running an illegal sports gambling operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Alex Bak-Boychuk, Vice President of Employment and Business Affairs, and Kathy Greene, Vice President of Talent Management at PNGI, conducted an investigation into the allegations against the Plaintiff. This investigation revealed that the Plaintiff had borrowed money from other employees over whom he had a supervisory role. After this investigation, the Plaintiff was presented with a termination notice due to his prior disciplinary record, the amount of money he had borrowed from other employees and his failure to disclose these loans to management. When presented with the notice, the Plaintiff alleged that he had previously disclosed these loans to Morrison, who was his supervisor at the time. The Plaintiff's allegation that he reported to a supervisor was investigated prior to the Plaintiff's termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Morrison confirmed she knew about the money the Plaintiff had borrowed from one of the employees, Travis Voit. Ultimately, the Plaintiff's employment was terminated and his father and mother were offered separation packages\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Provided information regarding a possible violation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   There are two issues regarding whether the Plaintiff provided information of a possible violation of specified laws. First, the Court must determine if the Plaintiff, or someone at the Plaintiff's request, actually provided this information to the FBI. Based on the evidence provided by the parties, the Plaintiff believes the FBI was contacted by Bob Lind or Tim May on behalf of the Plaintiff and the rest of the group. ECF No. 76 at 12 ; Pl.'s Ex. 2, Plaintiff Dep. at 177:10-178:17; Pl.'s Ex. 4, Herman Barrick Dep. at 121:5-12. The\n   Plaintiff believes Herman Barrick requested the FBI be contacted. ECF No. 76 at 12 ; Pl.'s Ex. 2, Plaintiff Dep. at 342:8-21; Defs.' Ex. A, Plaintiff Dep. at 181:2-9, 341:9-13. Herman Barrick is uncertain whether or not the FBI was ever actually contacted. ECF No. 74 at 13 ; Defs.' Ex. K, Herman Barrick Dep. at 121:13-21, 122:1-3. Herman Barrick says he did not specifically request the FBI be contacted, but rather, he wanted the investigators to do everything needed to comply with the requirements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205312\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Based on the evidence submitted by the parties, there is a question of fact regarding whether or not the FBI was contacted at the Plaintiff's request. It is unclear if Bob Lind or Tim May contacted the state police or the FBI, both agencies or neither agency. Because there is a genuine dispute of fact as to this material issue, it is a question for the finder of fact, not the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, the Court must determine if the possible violation reported is one that is entitled to protection under the whistleblower provision. It is \"essential under the BSA that the report ... suggest a violation of a provision carrying 'the force of law.' \"\n   <em>\n    Taft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306482\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/156/407/#p413\">\n    156 F.Supp.3d at 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Segarra v.

ECF No. 41 at 3. The Plaintiff alleges rather than reporting the activity, Florence attempted to cover up the illegal sports gambling by warning those involved and retaliated against him by seeking to have his employment terminated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4227180\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/942/432/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is the violation upon which the Defendants rely in their motion when they argue that the Plaintiff did not report a possible violation of law. The Plaintiff asserts in his response that the possible violation of law he was reporting was a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201956\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). This allegation was included in the Plaintiff's amended complaint under Count II, his SOX claim. If this is the Plaintiff's possible violation, it is unclear what relevance the failure to file a suspicious activity report has on the Plaintiff's claim. While the Plaintiff should have included this under his BSA claim, it is included in the Plaintiff's amended complaint and the Court will determine if it meets the requirement for a possible violation of law. The Court will not address the Defendants' argument that there was no obligation to file a suspicious activity report because it is not the basis of the Plaintiff's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the Plaintiff's response, he claims he was reporting a violation of \u00a7 1956(a), transferring funds from a place in the United States to a place outside of the United States knowing that the funds are proceeds of unlawful activity. ECF No. 76 at 18-19. The Plaintiff asserts that he provided information of a possible violation because he reported that Champa was using the funds from the illegal sports books to buy a bar in Laos.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pl.'s Ex. 2, Plaintiff Dep. at 342:8-21; Pl.'s Ex. 14, Tim May Investigation Notes, at PNGI-MB 0000993, 00000996, 00000997, 00000999. Section 1956(a) is one of the enumerated\n   laws covered under the BSA. Therefore, the Plaintiff reported a possible violation of \u00a7 1956(a) by an employee of the financial institution, specifically Champa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   c. Provided information to the Attorney General or \"any Federal supervisory agency\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Defendants argue that the Plaintiff fails to meet the requirement of providing information to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General or \"any Federal supervisory agency.\" In the Plaintiff's amended complaint, he contends that the FBI is a \"Federal supervisory agency\" for the purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205328\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . ECF No. 41 at 16. The Defendants argue that the FBI is not considered a \"Federal supervisory agency\" under the United States Code. To support this argument, the Defendants cite\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201813\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1813\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (q) defining a \"Federal supervisory agency\" as: (1) the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; (2) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; or (3) the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. This Court does not find that the FBI could reasonably be interpreted to be a Federal supervisory agency for purposes of the anti-retaliation provision of the BSA. Furthermore, while the Plaintiff relies on this in his amended complaint, this is not the argument he sets forth in his response to the Defendants' motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the Plaintiff's response, he contends that he complained about the illegal acts to the FBI, which was in effect complaining to the Attorney General for the purposes of the BSA.

Afterward, the Plaintiff's supervisor contacted the West Virginia Lottery Commission and the casino retained an independent third party to investigate the Plaintiff's report. At some point after the Plaintiff reported to Florence, Florence discovered that the Plaintiff owed money from loans he obtained from other employees. This led the casino to investigate the loans the Plaintiff had obtained from other employees, because it violated company policy. The Defendants have set forth clear and convincing evidence that the Plaintiff's violations, and\n   not the Plaintiff's reporting, led to his termination from employment with Hollywood Casino. Furthermore, as in\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   , Herman Barrick, who also reported the violations, remains employed at Hollywood Casino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Plaintiff lists several disputed facts which he argues are material. The Plaintiff argues that when the Defendants learned about the Plaintiff's loans is a material fact in dispute. The Defendants allege that the loans were discovered when the Plaintiff took a leave of absence and employees started to become concerned that the Plaintiff would not be returning and would not be paying them back. ECF No. 74 at 7. The Plaintiff alleges that Florence learned of the loans from Immordino or Repetto after the Plaintiff accused Immordino of running a sports pool. ECF No. 76 at 7 ; Pl.'s Ex. 3, Florence Dep. at 57:20-58-20. The Plaintiff asserts this fact is material because Immordino revealed the Plaintiff's loans in retaliation for the Plaintiff disclosing that Immordino ran a sports betting pool. ECF No. 76 at 7-8. It is undisputed that Immordino no longer works at the casino as a result of the investigation and he was not involved in the decision to terminate the Plaintiff. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, Immordino's motivation for reporting the loans was not imputed to the employer. The Plaintiff's reported violation protected under this statute was involving Champa's conduct, not Immordino's conduct. While the Plaintiff did report that Immordino was involved in illegal sports gambling, he did not argue in his response the report was a basis for the possible violation of law. The Plaintiff makes a similar argument regarding Florence providing evidence for the investigation even though it was not requested of him. ECF No. 76 at 22 ; Pl.'s Ex. 3, Florence Dep. at 73:14-75:1; Ex. 8, Bak-Boychuk Dep. at 72:5-9. The Court applies the same analysis and conclusion to this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Plaintiff argues there is a material fact at issue because the parties dispute whether the Defendants took retaliatory action against Herman Barrick. ECF No. 76 at 8. The Plaintiff asserts that Herman Barrick was retaliated against because the company tried to force him to take a separation package the day the Plaintiff was terminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pl.'s Ex. 4, Herman Barrick Dep. at 197:13-198:9, 200:23-201:4; Ex. 11, Linda Barrick Dep. at 48:17-51:13. The Court has reviewed the depositions and finds there was a misunderstanding as to whether Herman Barrick was being discharged or provided with a voluntary separation agreement. Even in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, viewing \"the separation package as a tactic for the Defendants to remove all people who were involved in the disclosure of sports betting,\" [ECF No. 76 at 9 ] Herman Barrick remains employed at the casino. He was not terminated for his reporting of the possible violation. The Plaintiff, who was on a final written warning, was terminated from the casino when his loans were discovered. Furthermore, even without Herman Barrick as a direct comparator, the Court finds a legitimate intervening event exists. The Plaintiff was on final written warning when he violated company policy further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Plaintiff argues that Al Welsh, his second line supervisor, knew about a loan he obtained from another employee, Milton Brooks, and the policy was never enforced. Pl.'s Ex. 8, Bak-Boychuk Dep. at 32:6-19; Pl.'s Ex. 10, CTRS Investigation at PNGI-MB 0000579. Al Welsh never reported the Plaintiff's loan obtained from Milton Brooks to Florence, Vice President of Table Games. When his failure to report was revealed during the investigation into the Plaintiff's loans, there was recommended discipline for Al Welsh for not handling this issue properly. Pl.'s Ex. 10, CTRS Investigation at PNGI-MB 0000579.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Plaintiff further argues that the investigation into the Plaintiff's loans was a \"fishing expedition\" to find a reason to terminate the Plaintiff. To support this assertion, he states that there were allegations of other employees borrowing and loaning money to each other, but only his loans were verified. ECF No. 76 at 9 ; Pl.'s Ex. 8, Bak-Boychuk Dep. at 50:2-6, 100:21-101:18; Pl.'s Ex. 10, CTRS Investigation, at PNGI-MB 0000579. The facts in the record show that there was a recommendation for other employees as a result of this investigation, including Al Welsh. The Plaintiff argues that he was the only employee terminated for this conduct [ECF No. 76 at 9 ], but he does not provide any evidence showing any of the other employees investigated were on final written warning. He also argues that economic relationships were not being tracked by Schedulers and Shift Managers and that training had not been provided on economic relationships. ECF No. 76 at 9-11 ; Pl.'s Ex. 6, Morrison Dep. at 25:13-26:12; Pl.'s Ex. 8, Bak-Boychuk Dep. at 34:17-35:12; Pl.'s Ex. 9, Greene Dep. at 48:12-49:8; Pl.'s Ex. 10, CTRS Investigation Summary. The Plaintiff argues that without training on this policy and a proper reporting procedure, \"that Defendants' enforcement of the policy, when it had not previously made efforts to enforce the policy before, was merely a way to excise the Plaintiff from Hollywood Casino.\" ECF No. 76 at 11. Ultimately, the Plaintiff acknowledged that he read and signed off on the policy prohibiting economic relationships and he acknowledged that he understood his conduct was a violation of policy. ECF No. 74 at 7 ; Defs.' Ex. F; Defs.' Ex. A, Plaintiff Dep. at 305:6-24, 306:1-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court finds, even under this broad and forgiving standard, that a legitimate intervening event is present and the Plaintiff was terminated from his employment for non-discriminatory reasons. Even if the Plaintiff had provided enough evidence that his report was a contributing factor, the Defendants provided clear and convincing evidence that the Plaintiff would have been terminated for his violation of policy without his protected reporting. Therefore, this claim fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

He supports this by alleging that sports gambling was \"unlawful\" and he \"was concerned it was affecting the business.\" ECF No. 76 at 24 ; Pl.'s Ex. 2, Plaintiff Dep. at 148:4-12. The Defendants argue the Plaintiff admitted that he had no reasonable belief that the conduct he alleged constituted a violation of the specific laws enumerated under SOX. ECF No. 74 at 19-20 ; Defs.' Ex. A, Plaintiff Dep. at 185:1-6, 186:9-19, 187:6-16. The Defendants base this argument on the Plaintiff's testimony that he did not know what mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, securities fraud or the other enumerated laws were under SOX.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703286\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/344/#p352\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court would find it hard, if not impossible, for someone to hold a subjective belief of a violation if they have no understanding of the law. This is not to say the Plaintiff needed to know the elements of fraud or an exact definition, but to have a belief, he should have, at the very least, a basic understanding. \"It would make no sense to allow [the Plaintiff] to proceed if he himself did not hold the belief required by the statute....\"\n   <em>\n    Livingston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3703286\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/344/#p352\">\n    520 F.3d at 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because this Court finds the Plaintiff did not hold a subjective belief that the conduct he reported violated one of the enumerated laws, it is not necessary to address if the Plaintiff's belief was objectively reasonable or if the \"definitively and specifically\" standard is still the appropriate test to apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiff did not reasonably\n   believe the reported conduct constituted a violation of one of the laws covered by SOX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Even if the Plaintiff was able to succeed in showing that he had a reasonable belief, by a preponderance of the evidence, his claim would still fail as a matter of law. The Plaintiff has the burden of establishing that his protected activity was a contributing factor to his termination. Even if he were able to meet this burden, the Defendants would still prevail. As discussed more thoroughly under the Plaintiff's BSA claim, a legitimate intervening event exists and the Defendants have established by clear and convincing evidence that the same unfavorable personnel action would have been taken in the absence of the Plaintiff's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
