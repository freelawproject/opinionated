GORDON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Diana Rosas sued defendant GEICO Casualty Company (GEICO), alleging four causes of action arising out of GEICO's insurance coverage of her injuries resulting from a car accident. GEICO moves to dismiss claims 2, 3, and 4. ECF No. 6. GEICO alternatively moves to bifurcate and stay claims 2 and 3 pending the outcome of Rosas's breach of contract claim. ECF No. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I grant GEICO's motion to dismiss claims 2, 3, and 4 because Rosas's complaint lacks sufficient facts to state those claims. However, I grant Rosas leave to amend her complaint if she can plead sufficient facts to properly state her claims.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rosas alleges that she was a passenger in a vehicle driven by Kimberly Fox that was rear-ended at a red light. Fox was insured by GEICO. Rosas sustained physical injuries that require continuing medical attention. When GEICO contacted Fox about the collision, Fox informed GEICO that Rosas was in the car and provided GEICO with Rosas's contact information. More than one year later,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   GEICO contacted Rosas regarding her coverage under Fox's underinsured motor vehicle policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   One year after that, Rosas submitted her proof of claim to GEICO. After a medical examination, GEICO valuated Rosas's claim at $ 28,750. Later, GEICO re-valuated the claim at $ 50,000. ECF No. 1-1 at 2-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rosas alleges that GEICO has not tendered any benefits to Rosas, misrepresented pertinent facts or policy provisions, offered to pay the undisputed portion\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   only if Rosas agreed to diminish her rights to extra-contractual claims, intentionally undervalued the benefits owed to her, and that this conduct has caused and continues to cause additional damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Rosas asserts four causes of action: (1) breach of contract, (2) unfair practices in settling claims in violation of Nevada Revised Statutes \u00a7 686A.310, (3) bad faith and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and (4) declaratory relief. ECF No. 1-1. GEICO moves to dismiss the extra-contractual claims (2, 3, and 4). ECF Nos. 6, 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Unfair Settlement Practices (Claim 2)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under Nevada Revised Statutes \u00a7 686A.310, an insurer is liable for damages if it engages in any of various enumerated acts. Rosas asserts that GEICO violated several provisions in \u00a7 686A.310 but simply recites the language of those provisions without providing sufficient supporting factual allegations. It is not clear that GEICO has unduly delayed payment of benefits to Rosas, particularly considering the length of time Rosas took to submit her proof of claim; it is not clear that GEICO did not conduct a reasonable investigation; Rosas does not explain how GEICO misrepresented pertinent facts or policy provisions; and she did not provide any detail regarding how GEICO undervalued her claim, other than to include the amount of its offer and simply allege that it was intentionally undervalued. Reciting the elements of a cause of action is insufficient to state a claim. I therefore grant GEICO's motion and dismiss Rosas's claim for violations of \u00a7 686A.310, without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

While the complaint plainly alleges that there is a contract between the parties, it does not provide sufficient facts for me to plausibly infer that GEICO acted in a manner unfaithful to the purpose of that contract or that her justified expectations were denied. As with her claim for violation of unfair practices, it is not clear that GEICO has unduly delayed payment of benefits to Rosas, and she does not provide any detail about how GEICO undervalued her claim. I therefore grant GEICO's motion and dismiss Rosas's claim for bad faith and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Declaratory Relief (Claim 4)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   GEICO moves to dismiss Rosas's fourth cause of action, arguing that declaratory relief is only available when there is a dispute about the existence and coverage of the insurance contract. ECF No. 6 at 4. It contends that \"there are no contractual coverage issues\" in this case, so the specific contractual obligations of the parties can be determined in the cause of action for breach of contract, and declaratory relief is therefore duplicative and unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8556954\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/107/226/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Rosas does not respond to this portion of the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Claims for declaratory relief frequently accompany claims for breach of insurance contracts and are used to determine whether coverage exists in a given insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    El Capitan Club v.

Nev. Feb. 10, 2009). However, \"the declaratory relief statute should not be used for the purpose of anticipating and determining an issue which can be determined in the main action,\" but is instead most appropriate when it would be beneficial to make an early determination of coverage under the policy.\n   <em>\n    El Capitan Club\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4878083\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/89/65/\">\n    506 P.2d at 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Here, there appears to be no dispute regarding the existence of a valid insurance contract between GEICO and Fox, according to which Rosas was insured. GEICO's behavior up to this point\n   and the content of its filings suggest that it agrees that there is a contract. Instead, the dispute in this case is about what specifically is owed under that contract, an issue that can be determined through Rosas's main contractual action. Because Rosas does not allege any contractual disputes that cannot determined in that main action, I grant GEICO's motion to dismiss the action for declaratory relief, without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Geico's Motion to Bifurcate and Stay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As an alternative to dismissal, GEICO moves to have claims 2 and 3 bifurcated and stayed, pending the resolution of her claim for breach of contract. It argues that doing so will further the interests of judicial economy, fairness to the parties, and clarity to jurors if this dispute continues to trial. ECF No. 7 at 16-19. Rosas responds that bifurcating and staying those claims would unnecessarily multiply proceedings and cause unnecessary delay, especially if done before the conclusion of discovery. ECF No. 9 at 12-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Rule 42(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes courts to order a separate trial of any claim when separation is in the interest of judicial economy, will further the parties' convenience, or will prevent undue prejudice. Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b). The decision to bifurcate is committed to the discretion of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Hirst v.

Rosas's claims are intertwined, so separating and staying at this time would unnecessarily prolong the process and waste judicial resources supervising two phases of discovery. I therefore deny GEICO's motion to stay and bifurcate. If GEICO feels bifurcation is prudent at some later stage of this case, it may move again at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    E.
