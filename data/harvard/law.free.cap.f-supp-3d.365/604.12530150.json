The matters have been fully briefed and are ripe for ruling. For the reasons that follow, the United States is dismissed, plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment is granted in part and denied in part, and defendants' motions for summary judgment are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 23, 2013, plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that two of their employees, a consultant, and others engaged in a conspiracy to defraud plaintiffs of millions of dollars. [DE 1]. On April 23, 2014, the United States moved to intervene and stay discovery in the matter due to ongoing grand jury investigations, [DE 144], which was granted by the Court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on September 30, 2014 [DE 209]. The Court further granted in part a motion for judgment on the pleadings filed by defendants Big South Wholesale of Virginia (Big South Wholesale-Va.), Big South Wholesale, Carpenter, and Small (collectively the Big Sky defendants) and dismissed plaintiffs' claims for breach of fiduciary duty and constructive fraud against Carpenter and Small, as well as plaintiffs' claims for tortious interference, misappropriation of corporate opportunities, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and unjust enrichment against the Big Sky defendants. [DE 212].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 24, 2015, the Court declined to extend the stay of discovery further [DE 323], and the case proceeded through discovery. On June 1, 2016, the parties filed various motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 24, 2016, the Court held an evidentiary hearing on a petition to substitute the United States as a party pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Westfall certification) that had been filed by the Big Sky defendants. On November 7, 2016, the Court granted in part the petition to substitute the United States and granted Westfall certification to the Big Sky defendants for plaintiffs' fourth through ninth and seventeenth claims for relief. [DE 635].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By order entered May 19, 2017, the seal imposed on a large number of documents in the case was lifted. [DE 810]. The Court took up plaintiffs' motion to reconsider Westfall certification and, after a hearing on July 20, 2017, granted the motion to reconsider, removed Westfall certification for the Big Sky defendants, and dismissed the United States as a substituted party. [DE 1096]. The Big Sky defendants appealed the denial of Westfall certification, and by opinion filed August 3, 2018, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit vacated this Court's order removing Westfall certification and remanded the case for further proceedings.

Also remaining for adjudication are plaintiffs' claims against Carpenter, Small, and/or Big South Wholesale and Big South Wholesale-Va. for federal RICO violations and breach of contract (plaintiffs' first, second, third, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth claims for relief); plaintiffs' claims against Daniel and/or Universal Services Consulting Group (Universal) for federal RICO violations, North Carolina RICO violations, fraud, fraud in the inducement, constructive fraud, violations of the North Carolina UDTPA, breach of fiduciary duty, tortious interference with contractual relations, misappropriation of corporate opportunities, civil conspiracy, and unjust enrichment (plaintiffs' first through third, fourth through sixth, seventh through eleventh, and fifteenth through eighteenth claims for relief); plaintiffs' claims against Johnson for federal RICO violations, North Carolina RICO violations, fraud, fraud in the inducement, North Carolina UDTPA violations, breach of fiduciary duty, and civil conspiracy (plaintiffs' second, sixth, seventh through tenth and seventeenth claims for relief); Carpenter and Small's counterclaims for breach of contract, piercing the corporate veil, violations of North Carolina's UDTPA, and punitive damages; Daniel's counterclaim for indemnification; and Johnson's counterclaim for indemnification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs have moved for partial summary judgment on their claims for breach of the asset purchase agreement, breach of consulting agreement, and breach of employment agreement (plaintiffs' twelfth through fourteenth claims for relief) and on defendants Carpenter and Small's first, fourth, and sixth counterclaims. The Big Sky defendants have moved for summary judgment in their favor on each of plaintiffs' claims against them; Daniel, Universal, and Johnson have also moved for summary judgment in their favor on each of plaintiffs' claims and on their counterclaims against plaintiffs for indemnification. The United States has moved to dismiss each of plaintiffs' claims against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Factual Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As the case is before the Court on multiple motions for summary judgment, the following factual recitation is comprised,\n   unless otherwise indicated, of the undisputed portions of the Local Civil Rule 56.1 statements of undisputed material facts filed by the parties. [DE 460; 848; 649; 1018; 1135; 1144].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff U.S. Tobacco Cooperative (U.S. Tobacco) is a member-owned cooperative that purchases tobacco from its member-growers and sells it to domestic and foreign customers. Plaintiff U.S. Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers (U.S. Flue-Cured), a wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S. Tobacco, was formed in 2004 to purchase a cigarette manufacturing facility in Timberlake, North Carolina. U.S. Flue-Cured entered into an exclusive manufacturing agreement with Premier Manufacturing, Inc., under which it manufactured Premier cigarette brands such as \"Wildhorse\"; U.S. Flue-Cured later began to manufacture its own cigarette brands, including \"1839.\" Until May 2011, U.S. Flue-Cured sold its cigarettes through third-party distributors, which included defendants Big South Wholesale and Big South Wholesale-Va., companies owned and operated by defendants Carpenter and Small.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2006 and 2007 respectively, defendants Carpenter and Small began working with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) in confidential roles, assisting ATF with operations that targeted corrupt cigarette retailers, wholesalers, brokers, distributors, and manufacturers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In early 2011, Daniel approached the U.S. Tobacco board of directors and encouraged them to acquire the assets of Big South Wholesale and Big South Wholesale-Va. Plaintiff Big South Distribution was organized as a wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S. Flue-Cured, and defendant Daniel, who was the executive vice president of U.S. Flue-Cured, became the president of Big South Distribution. In approximately December 2011, negotiations between Daniel, Carpenter, and Small began for U.S. Flue-Cured to acquire Big South Wholesale and Big South Wholesale-Va., and Daniel served as U.S. Tobacco's lead negotiator for the purchase of Big South Wholesale and Big South Wholesale-Va.'s assets. While negotiations were ongoing, a meeting was held on March 23, 2011, which included ATF Agent Whittemore,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Carpenter, Small, Daniel, U.S. Tobacco and U.S. Flue-Cured's chairman of the board of directors defendant Johnson, U.S. Tobacco treasurer John Taylor, plaintiffs' outside auditor Clay Worden, U.S. Tobacco president Tommy Bunn, and plaintiffs' outside general counsel Marks Arnold. Agent Wittemore informed the attendees, among other things, that Carpenter and Small's operations with ATF were winding down, and further instructed all attendees about the importance of maintaining as confidential the information that had been discussed at the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Prior to the close of the agreement to purchase assets of Big South Wholesale and Big South Wholesale-Va., there was no disclosure to plaintiffs' full board of directors regarding Carpenter and Small's work with the ATF or that, after the asset purchase, Carpenter and Small planned to form a separate entity called Big Sky International which would sell cigarettes to Big South Distribution at marked-up prices. Also undisclosed to the full board of directors were payments made by Carpenter and Small through Big South Wholesale-Va. to Universal Services First Consulting, a company owned and controlled\n   by Daniel, for $ 2,000 per month from August 2010 to April 2011, totaling $ 18,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Negotiations regarding the acquisition of Big South Wholesale and Big South Wholesale-Va. continued, culminating in an asset purchase agreement (APA) that was entered into on May 1, 2011. Pursuant to the APA, U.S. Tobacco paid Carpenter and Small approximately $ 8.6 million and Big South Distribution acquired assets of Big South Wholesale and Big South Wholesale-Va. On May 2, 2011, Carpenter and Small through Big South Wholesale-Va. made a payment of $ 69,066.67 to Universal First Consulting, and this payment was not disclosed to U.S. Tobacco's full board of directors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As part of the APA, Carpenter was hired as a consultant and Small as an employee of the newly formed Big South Distribution. Under the APA and Carpenter and Small's consulting/employment agreements, a non-competition provision forbade Carpenter and Small from competing with Big South Distribution in the wholesale acquisition and distribution of tobacco products in Alabama, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, South Carolina, and Georgia. Four days prior to the close of the APA, on April 27, 2011, Daniel sent an email to U.S. Tobacco's general counsel Marks Arnold, Carpenter and Small's counsel Henry Long, Carpenter, Small, and John Taylor, in part describing \"concern over business operations that [Carpenter and Small] are involved in and the 'special' nature of certain activities that must be handled with extreme confidentiality.\" [DE 1135-14]. Marks Arnold responded by email the same day stating \"Based on my conversation with Rusty Irby [Big South Wholesale's attorney] this morning, I suggest that we all recognize that the 'special' activities will not violate the non-compete, but not document that fact, for obvious reasons.\" [DE 849 Dep. Ex. 29].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After the APA closed, Carpenter and Small oversaw Big South Distribution's day-to-day operations and controlled the tobacco products that it purchased for wholesale, and were paid annual salaries of more than $ 100,000 per year plus a percentage of profits. Carpenter and Small also continued to operate Big South Wholesale-Va., under the name Big Sky International, out of the Big South Distribution warehouse in Bristol, Virginia. From May 2011 to May 2013, Carpenter and Small sold tobacco products from Big Sky to Big South Distribution, the majority of which were \"Brand B\" cigarettes. These sales exceeded $ 24 million. Between May 2011 and March 2013, Carpenter and Small through Big Sky made payments of over $ 470,000 to Universal First Consulting, and these payments were not disclosed to U.S. Tobacco's full board of directors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 7, 2013, Brandon Moore, an employee at the Bristol, Virginia warehouse, emailed Stuart Thompson, the chief financial officer of U.S. Tobacco, about activities and alleged wrongdoing taking place at the warehouse. [DE 1135-23] Thompson Dep. at 130. The U.S. Tobacco board of directors voted to initiate an internal investigation into Moore's allegations and hired outside counsel. On July 23, 2013, U.S. Tobacco terminated Carpenter's consulting agreement and Small's employment agreement. Both Carpenter's consulting and Small's employment agreement contained early termination penalties where the agreement was terminated without cause. A finding that their respective non-competition agreements have been violated would forfeit any early termination penalties owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I. United States' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On October 12, 2018, plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of their claims against the United States pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. [DE 1125]. Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i) provides a plaintiff with the right to dismiss an action without a court order by filing a notice of dismissal before the opposing party has filed an answer or motion for summary judgment. Although some courts have found that reference to \"an action\" by the rule requires that a plaintiff may not proceed under Rule 41 to dismiss claims against one but not all defendants, \"the sounder view and the weight of judicial authority are to the contrary.\" 9 Charles Alan Wright,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   , Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 2362 (3d ed. 2008) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duke Progress Energy LLC v. 3M Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:08-CV-460-FL,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205603344\">\n    2015 WL 5603344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (E.D.N.C.

Va. July 3, 2014). Accordingly, by operation of the notice of voluntary dismissal, the United States has been dismissed as a defendant in this action. Counts four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, and seventeen of the second amended complaint are therefore dismissed without prejudice, and the United States' motion to dismiss is denied as moot. Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file surreply to the United States' renewed motion to dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II. Big Sky defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendants Carpenter, Small, Big South Wholesale, and Big South Wholesale-Va. have moved for summary judgment in their favor on all claims, which include claims for federal RICO violations and state law claims for breach of contract. A motion for summary judgment may not be granted unless there are no genuine issues of material fact for trial and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).

Plaintiffs primarily challenge application of the Supremacy Clause based upon Carpenter and Small's alleged bad faith. However, it is has been established that the government, and specifically Special Agent Lesnak, was not only aware of the sales of tobacco products to plaintiffs by Big Sky, but also that these sales were integral to ATF investigations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Tobacco Coop.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518069\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/236/\">\n    899 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   253 ; [DE 848] Lesnak Dep. at 209-210. While there has been much ado regarding the propriety of some of the specifics of ATF's engagement with Carpenter and Small, on which plaintiffs rely to attempt to create an issue of material fact, what is important here is that no\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   has been presented by plaintiffs which would create a genuine issue of fact as to whether the Big Sky defendants took action at the direction of Special Agent Lesnak and in good faith reliance on Special Agent Lesnak's instructions. There is further no\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   that Special Agent Lesnak acted outside the scope of his authority as a sworn ATF Agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, even if plaintiffs' state law claims were not displaced by the unique federal interest of investigating and prosecuting unlawful cigarette sales, the acts committed by the Big Sky defendants did not violate their non-competition agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As discussed above, Carpenter and Small were prohibited from engaging in the sale, distribution, or marketing of tobacco products in a five-state area as well as providing services to any person or entity engaged in the tobacco business. Plaintiffs' own expert has agreed that \"conducting undercover operations supporting investigation of corrupt cigarette manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors\" was not a typical commercial business. [DE 1048]; Jennings Dep. at 105. It is fair to conclude, then, that such activities on behalf of ATF would not have been contemplated by Carpenter and Small's non-competition clauses. Indeed, it is undisputed that after the close of the APA, the only work performed by Carpenter and Small that was not on behalf of Big South Distribution was in furtherance of ATF undercover operations; in other words, there is no evidence that Carpenter and Small engaged in any cigarette distribution or purchasing that was in competition with Big South Distribution. Although plaintiffs' rely on the declaration of Special Agent Kaye [DE 648-5] to suggest otherwise, Special Agent Kaye stated that Carpenter and Small's undercover roles\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   them to sell tobacco in four scenarios, to include sales of tobacco products to legitimate customers in non-government directed transactions, and Special Agent Kaye did not specifically address any sales made by Carpenter and Small after the close of the APA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, the plaintiffs waived the applicable non-competition clauses for work Carpenter and Small performed on behalf of the ATF. Section 5.5 of the APA provides that if Carpenter or Small wished to engage in activity otherwise prohibited by the non-competition clause, he could request a waiver of the non-competition clause, which if granted must be set forth in writing and signed by the party allowing the waiver. [DE 461-10 \u00a7\u00a7 5.5, 10.7]. Plaintiffs contend that the merger clause in the APA prohibits consideration of any agreement which is not included in the APA. North Carolina courts recognize an exception to this general rule, however, \"[w]here giving effect to the merger clause would frustrate and distort the parties' true intentions\n   and understanding regarding the contract\".\n   <em>\n    Zinn v.

Ex. 29, 27 April 2011 email]. In response, Carpenter wrote that he had spoken with his counsel and that they \"[felt] comfortable not including the \"special\" activities in any document.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=361%20S.E.2d%20314\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A few days later, the parties entered into the APA. No party disputes that the \"special activities\" referred to in these emails are Carpenter and Small's work for ATF.

At bottom, the result is the same: plaintiffs cannot show that Carpenter and Small's ATF work violated their non-competition clauses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Summary judgment in the Big Sky defendants' favor is also appropriate on plaintiffs' remaining breach of contract claims relating to use of the name \"Big South\" and an alleged violation of \u00a7 3.3 (a) of the APA, as plaintiffs failed to respond to the Big Sky defendants' argument that the undisputed facts demonstrate that summary judgment is appropriate as to these claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Satcher v.

Both Daniel and Carpenter have stated under oath that from August 2010 to April 2011 Daniel was paid $ 2,000 per month for his assistance with the IRS audit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [DE 850] Carpenter Decl. \u00b6 13. Carpenter and Small also decided to split proceeds from\n   two operations which ATF would allow them to retain for their work, for a total of $ 473,932.50 in payments to Daniel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26. Carpenter stated that payments to Daniel were \"unrelated to the [APA] or any other transactions between BSW-Va./Big Sky and BSD.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs have proffered no evidence which contradicts or raises a genuine issue of fact regarding the payments to Daniel. Although Special Agent Kaye declared that Special Agent Lesnak appeared to be the only ATF-employee with knowledge of the payments to Daniel and that ATF did not direct Carpenter and Small to make payments to Daniel, [DE 629] Kaye Decl. \u00b6 4, such statement does not refute that the payments were made in exchange for work that Daniel was performing on the IRS audit and on behalf of ATF investigations. Again, plaintiffs have not proffered evidence that Special Agent Lesnak was acting outside of his authority during his dealings with Carpenter, Small, and Daniel. Additionally, plaintiffs' reliance on the timing and method of the payments to Daniel is insufficient at this stage to demonstrate there is a triable issue as to whether these payments were bribes. In order to successfully oppose a motion for summary judgment, \"the nonmoving party must rely on more than conclusory allegations, mere speculation, the building of one inference upon another, or the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Dash v. Mayweather\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049092\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/731/303/#p311\">\n    731 F.3d 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311 (4th Cir. 2013). If Daniel was not bribed as plaintiffs allege, plaintiffs' theories of liability begin to unravel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiffs' federal RICO claim against Daniel fails because they have not created a genuine issue of fact as to whether Daniel engaged in fraud or any other RICO criminal predicate because the \"kickbacks\" on which they rely were payments made with the approval of Special Agent Lesnakfor ATF-related work. Further, as discussed above, the Supremacy Clause preempts the state law claims against Daniel as it preempts state law liability of parties for actions which were taken at the direction of government agents acting within their authority and in good faith, reasonable reliance on those agents.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11574700\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/188/579/#p587\">\n    188 F.3d at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nor have plaintiffs sufficiently created an issue of fact as to whether Daniel acted in bad faith. Plaintiffs focus on the payments Daniel received from Carpenter and Small after the close of the APA and Daniel's concealment of Big Sky's operations. However, plaintiffs have offered no more than speculation that the payments to Daniel made after the close of the APA were not related to pre-APA work on behalf of the ATF, nor is the decision to follow the instructions of law enforcement that ATF-supported activities be kept confidential evidence of bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Based on the foregoing, Daniel's motion for summary judgment in his favor on plaintiffs' claims is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   V. Johnson's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Johnson is also entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' claims against him for federal and North Carolina RICO violations as well as state law claims for fraud, fraud in the inducement, unfair and deceptive trade practices, breach of fiduciary duty, and civil conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   It is undisputed that Johnson received no compensation or alleged \"kickbacks\" from any of the transactions between Big Sky and Big South Distribution about which plaintiffs complain or otherwise. Plaintiffs' claims against Johnson are generally premised on the following theory: that Johnson violated his duties as a director when he failed to disclose to the full U.S. Tobacco board of directors (1) his knowledge of U.S. Flue-Cured's participation\n   in the government buy program, (2) that Carpenter and Small had worked for the ATF prior to the close of the APA and that they would work for the ATF after the APA, (3) that Carpenter and Small would sell Big South Distribution cigarettes obtained through their ATF work, and (4) that Daniel was performing tax consulting services to Carpenter and Small. Because, however, North Carolina law does not impose on directors the duties plaintiffs allege were violated, plaintiffs' claims against Johnson fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   North Carolina law imposes a duty on directors to make disclosures to the full board of directors in only two circumstances of which this Court is aware: (1) where there is a transaction by the corporation in which the director has a direct or indirect interest and (2) where there are loans from the corporation to a director.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2055-8-31\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 55-8-31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32. As noted above, it is undisputed that Johnson did not receive any compensation for any dealings with the Big Sky defendants and plaintiffs have not identified any conflict of interest involving Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Instead, plaintiffs rely on the general duties imposed on a director, which include acting in good faith, with ordinary care, and in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interest of the corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2055-8-30\">\n    N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 55-8-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). North Carolina law further provides that a director may rely on attorneys, accountants, and other professionals on matters within their competence when acting for the corporation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2055-8-30\">\n    N.C.

Here, as it relates to whether Johnson had a duty to disclose to the full board of directors Carpenter and Small's ATF involvement, of which Johnson became aware in approximately 2008, he was first instructed by law enforcement agents\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to disclose the information to anyone. Second, during negotiations with Carpenter and Small which culminated in the APA, Johnson asked that other members of plaintiffs be involved in a meeting with ATF in order to \"have confidential discussions related to various aspects of our current business operations and current acquisition of Big South Wholesale.\" [DE 849] Dep. Ex. 15. Present at the March 23, 2011, meeting with ATF Agent Whittemore were plaintiffs' treasurer John Taylor, plaintiffs' auditor Clay Worden, U.S. Tobacco Cooperative/U.S. Flue-Cured President Tommy Bunn, and plaintiffs' outside general counsel Marks Arnold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Following the meeting with Agent Whittemore, the APA closed. Johnson had included in the confidential nature of Carpenter and Small's work plaintiffs' president, treasurer, auditor, and outside counsel - though not the full board of directors, a representative group of plaintiffs' interests. Plaintiffs have not complained that any other person present at the 23 March 2011 meeting failed to make additional disclosures regarding Carpenter and Small's ATF activities, and there is a simple reason these other representatives of plaintiffs did not: they had been strictly instructed by a law enforcement agent not to tell anyone about the meeting. Further, outside counsel Arnold did not advise Johnson after the meeting that, despite law enforcement's warning to keep the meeting confidential, he should disclose Carpenter and Small's ATF involvement to the full board of directors. Johnson was under no duty to disclose to the full board, and it was reasonable for him to follow the directives of law enforcement, especially when he had received no contrary instruction from plaintiffs' counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Johnson has testified that he believed he was acting in the best interests of U.S. Tobacco, and plaintiffs have offered no evidence to contradict Johnson's testimony that he believed that the business involving law enforcement was in the best interests\n   of plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   [DE 445] Shear Rep. \u00b6 VI. Moreover, it is undisputed that Johnson voted in favor of conducting an internal investigation of the Bristol, Virginia operations following the allegations made by Brandon Moore, [DE 848 Ex. 11] Plaintiffs' 30(b)(6) Dep. at 243, and plaintiffs have proffered no evidence that Johnson acted without ordinary care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Further, the articles of incorporation of U.S. Flue-Cured and Big South Distribution limit the liability of directors and managers to the extent allowed under North Carolina law, that is for all but those acts or omissions that a director knew or believed at the time to be clearly in conflict with the best interests of the corporation and conduct not in good faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2055-2-02\">\n    N.C.
