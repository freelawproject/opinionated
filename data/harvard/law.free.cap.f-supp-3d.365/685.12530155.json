GOODWIN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Pending before the court is the Common Benefit Fee and Cost Committee's (\"FCC\") Petition for an Award of Common Benefit Attorneys' Fees and Expenses (\"Petition\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [ECF No. 673 ]. In the Petition, the FCC asks the court to grant an award of attorneys' fees and expenses in the amount of 5% of the settlements and judgments subject to the court's ordered common benefit assessment. Following a period for objections, three plaintiffs' firms filed objections to the FCC's Petition, and the FCC replied. The Petition is ripe for consideration because briefing is complete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The seven multidistrict litigations (\"MDLs\") before this court comprise one of the largest multidistrict litigation proceedings in this country's history. This nearly nine-year process is ongoing. What began as 36 plaintiffs suing one company for one allegedly defective pelvic mesh product transformed into over 104,000 individual plaintiffs suing numerous defendants who manufactured many different pelvic mesh products. In addition to these complexities, many individual plaintiffs were implanted with different products manufactured by multiple defendant manufacturers across MDL lines. In tackling these complications, the plaintiffs' leadership organized and proposed to the court a structure for addressing global concerns that impacted cross-MDL issues. This required developing legal theories of liability and finding and vetting experts across the world who specialize in urology, surgery, materials, chemistry, and other specialties. It also required the taking of multitudinous depositions, analyzing, organizing, and storing tens of millions of defendant-produced documents, preparing and briefing hundreds of motions, preparing for and conducting bellwether trials, and eventually assisting many plaintiffs in reaching settlements. The fruits of this efficient process were made available to every plaintiff and their counsel. The court finds that every plaintiff benefited greatly from these efforts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This court is now evaluating whether common benefit counsel are entitled to 5% of all recoveries for their efforts in this litigation. The court must determine if this large group of lawyers acting for the common benefit has earned and is entitled to nearly half a billion dollars when in fact the majority of plaintiffs are individually\n   represented. As is the case in most large multidistrict litigation, the answer is properly found by analyzing several factors, the most important of which is the total recovery received by all plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In making this determination, I start with the commonsense observation that the common benefit work performed by leadership guaranteed that each plaintiff was the beneficiary of well-researched and briefed theories of liability with organized supporting factual resources and carefully vetted and developed expert opinion testimony making the case for general causation of damages resulting from allegedly defective products. Moreover, in the same vein of common-sense observation, I know that the leadership was able to provide informed settlement values to individual counsel as a result of their global experience in dealing with tens of thousands of cases. Finally, of the hundreds of firms representing 104,000 plaintiffs subject to the holdback, only three law firms have objected to the Petition. These objections are either frivolous or untimely. Therefore, and as I will explain further below, after careful examination and after a lodestar cross-check I find that the holdback and award of 5% is reasonable and appropriate in each of these MDLs. Accordingly, the Petition is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The seven pelvic mesh MDLs assigned to this court are virtually unprecedented in size and scope. In 2010, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (\"JPML\") transferred 36 individual pelvic mesh cases concerning the Avaulta line of pelvic organ prolapse repair devices, a device sold by C.R. Bard, Inc. (\"Bard\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As time went on, numerous pelvic mesh cases were filed in different federal courts across the country against different pelvic mesh manufacturers. The plaintiffs' firms leading the litigation around the country discussed an MDL strategy, and in response to the similarity of pelvic mesh injuries allegedly caused by similar but different products manufactured by different defendants, requested that the JPML create three additional MDLs (2:12-md-2325,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   2:12-md-2326,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 2:12-md-2327\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) and send them to this court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In transferring these MDLs, the JPML agreed with plaintiffs' leadership that: \"The actions in each MDL share factual issues arising from allegations of defects in pelvic surgical mesh products manufactured by [the defendants]. Centralization therefore will eliminate duplicative discovery; prevent inconsistent pretrial rulings; and conserve the resources of the parties, their counsel and the judiciary.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Am.

Noting this court's role in presiding over the Bard MDL and its unique opportunity to preside over similar pelvic mesh cases, the JPML also stated: \"[A] number of these actions are brought by plaintiffs who were implanted with multiple products made by multiple manufacturers. Centralization of the ...

Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the JPML sent a fifth MDL in 2012, 2:12-md-2387,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   a sixth in 2013, 2:13-md-2440,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a seventh in 2014, 2:14-md-2511.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To the court's knowledge, the JPML has never assigned seven individual MDLs with different but related products and different manufacturers to a single cross-cutting MDL coordinated proceeding within one court. The plaintiffs' leadership tackled this enormous challenge by accepting the court's guidance and proposing a Plaintiffs' Counsel Organization Structure (\"Proposal Structure\") in 2012, which called for a singular, cross-MDL plaintiffs' leadership structure to address common legal theories, defenses, experts, and scientific and medical claims. This court approved the Proposed Structure that facilitated the cross-MDL development and management of all facets of this litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   It has been this court's goal to promote efficiencies and coordination across MDL lines. \"In its most simplistic form, we have similar pelvic mesh products manufactured by different defendants that allegedly caused a variety of injuries to women. We suspect and hope that there are commonalities among the [multiple] MDLs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Especially for the purposes of pretrial motions and discovery, this court has stated that \"the most efficient way to handle the [multiple] MDLs is to consolidate as much as possible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201407\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Recognizing the challenges of litigating seven MDLs simultaneously, the plaintiffs' leadership proposed (and the court later appointed) a large 61-attorney PSC that was responsible for leading all of the litigation under a coordinated leadership structure. In order to promote the efficiencies, the court entered an order in all seven MDLs that stated: \"It shall be the responsibility of the Coordinating Co-Lead Counsel to work across MDL lines in conjunction with the Executive Committee....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Executive Committee was also responsible for appointing a \"singular PSC to coordinate across MDL lines in the ... separate pelvic mesh MDLs before this court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   This singular PSC worked and collaborated across MDL lines to develop the litigation strategy and theories of liability, depose experts, and absorb the massive litigation costs. The court appointed only one PSC to coordinate and advance all seven of the MDLs. This leadership structure made it possible for the plaintiffs\n   to address common issues that affected all seven of the MDLs and to work with attorneys who were assisting with common benefit efforts. This approach saved money and helped to prevent cross-MDL conflicts and duplicative work. Plaintiffs' leadership and the participating attorneys working for the common benefit of plaintiffs in these MDLs comprise what the court will refer to as common benefit counsel (\"common benefit counsel\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Creating a plaintiffs' leadership organization of considerable size and with extensive experience was necessary. Moreover, the defendants were represented by some of the best law firms in the country. To achieve the goals of multidistrict litigation, I believed that a plaintiffs' leadership team would need to be very experienced, well-funded, and committed. The plaintiffs' leadership would be required to immediately create a structure defining this litigation and capable of the cooperative work of drafting master pleadings, plaintiff profile forms, plaintiff fact sheets, discovery plans, reporting procedures and funding arrangements necessary to achieve sufficient uniformity to allow the plaintiffs to benefit from the efficient cross-cutting MDL process. The PSC also addressed the economic disparity between the individual plaintiffs and the well-funded defendants. Leadership was required to spend tens of millions of dollars without guarantee of success. These costs continue but are a small part of what the common benefit fund was designed to compensate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   It is my opinion that all of the progress and efficiencies in these MDLs would have been impossible without this organizational structure. The FCC has represented that 900,000 hours were submitted by common benefit counsel for work performed for the common benefit of all MDL plaintiffs. Of those hours, the court appointed FCC has, after careful review, represented that 679,191.20 of these hours qualified for the common benefit. Tens of thousands of cases have been resolved, for a total sum to date of $ 7.25 billion. Five-percent (5%) ($ 366,102,875.06) has been paid into the common benefit fund by defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Throughout this process, I issued orders dealing with the compensation to be received by plaintiffs' attorneys who worked on behalf of all the plaintiffs. For example, on October 4, 2012, I entered an Agreed Order Regarding Management of Timekeeping, Cost Reimbursement and Related Common Benefit Issues (\"Management Order\") establishing preliminary procedures and guidelines for submitting applications seeking payment of common benefit fees and expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Management Order appointed a Certified Public Accountant (\"CPA\"), paid with common benefit funds, to review all time and expense records for the MDLs. Pursuant to the Management Order, Chuck Smith, CPA, was required to work with the litigation's Co-Leads to manage the fund and administer payment for attorney expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   I directed attorneys to record their time and expense records for review by the accountant every six weeks. The Management Order explicitly stated that counsel seeking consideration for common benefit compensation must acknowledge this court's \"final, non-appealable authority regarding the award of fees\" and that the parties \"agreed to and therefore will be bound by\n   the court's determination ... [and] knowingly and expressly waive any right to appeal those decisions or the ability to assert the lack of enforceability of this Management Order or to otherwise challenge its adequacy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Every member of the PSC approved this Management Order, and the Management Order was entered in the seven MDLs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 26, 2013, the court entered an \"Agreed Order Establishing ... [a] Fund to Compensate and Reimburse Attorneys for Services Performed and Expenses Incurred for MDL Administration and Common Benefit\" (\"Agreed Order\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Agreed Order was entered in all seven MDLs. There, the court ordered MDL defendants to withhold a 5% assessment on plaintiff recoveries and directed defendants to pay the holdback assessments \"directly into the ... MDL Fund as a credit against the Settlement of Judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court explicitly stated in the \"Assessments and Payments into the MDL 2326 Fund for All Covered Claims\" that \"[n]othing in th[e] Agreed Order is intended to increase the attorneys' fee paid by a client.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   With the 5% assessment paid into the MDL Fund, the court allowed for payment of \"common benefit work and expenses[ ] [u]pon a proper showing and Order of the Court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequent to these two orders, the court appointed attorneys involved in the leadership of this litigation to a committee, the FCC, to receive and analyze common benefit fund requests and make recommendations to the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FCC has filed the instant Petition, and the court now addresses it below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Methodology for Calculating Aggregate Attorneys' Fees Award\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Throughout the history of MDL common fund calculations, courts have employed three approaches when assessing the reasonableness of attorney's fees: (1) the lodestar method, (2) the percentage method, or (3) the blended method which combines the first two approaches. Fallon,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 381. Under the lodestar method, a court multiplies \"the reasonable hours expended on the litigation by an adjusted hourly rate\" to produce a multiplier whereas the percentage method \"compensates attorneys who recovered some identified sum by awarding them a fraction of that sum[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Courts within our district frequently employ a blended approach. They award attorneys' fees based on a reasonable\n   benchmark percentage of the fund verified by a lodestar cross-check.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Dominion Res. Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3414658\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/601/756/#p758\">\n    601 F.Supp.2d 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 758 (S.D.W.Va. 2009). Following this approach, the court will now (1) determine the value of the benefit common benefit counsel has provided to plaintiffs, (2) establish a benchmark percentage that common benefit counsel should be awarded based on awards given in similar MDLs, (3) apply the Fourth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Barber\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   factors to assess the reasonableness of the benchmark percentage award, and (4) verify the reasonableness of the 5% award with a lodestar cross-check.\n   <em>\n    In re Vioxx\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180011\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/760/640/#p647\">\n    760 F.Supp.2d at 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Valuation of the Benefit Received\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The simple question the court is addressing is what percentage of the total recovery by plaintiffs is attributable to the work by common benefit counsel. In making the commonsense observation that common benefit counsel benefited each plaintiff in these MDLs, the court must determine how much that benefit is worth. To answer that question, the court must first determine the total recovery by the plaintiffs and then determine what amount of that total recovery is directly attributable to the efforts of common benefit counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court also notes that to date, not all plaintiffs have resolved their cases. This means that the total amount of recovery the 104,000 plaintiffs will potentially receive is not yet known. However, this court is equipped with sufficient information to make a reasonable estimate as to the total amount of recovery the plaintiffs will receive. Having presided over these MDLs for nearly nine years, the court is intimately aware of the cases that remain, the alleged injuries of the women, and the range of possible verdicts and settlement values available to them. Therefore, for the purposes of evaluating how much common benefit counsel's contributions are worth, the court is uniquely situated to make a reasonable estimate of the final total recovery amount. Because not all of the recoveries have been paid by the defendants, these MDL funds are pay-as-you-go, meaning the payments into the MDL common benefit funds will continue after this court's order is entered. \"Where the settlement provides benefits on a 'pay-as-you-go' basis over a period beyond the point that a common benefit fee is to be awarded, the settlement fund also includes a reasonable estimate of the amount of future payments that will be made to\" the individual plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    In re: Oil Spill by the Oil Rig \"Deepwater Horizon\" in the Gulf of Mex., on April 20, 2010\n   </em>\n   , MDL No. 2179,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206215974\">\n    2016 WL 6215974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15 (E.D.

Common benefit counsel crafted certain consistent themes and legal theories, cross-MDL scientific and medical experts, and coordinated the efforts of developing evidence and legal issues. However, the abundant differences between defendants and individual products necessitated intense and sustained effort over several years by leadership to develop a cross-cutting theory of liability applicable to the dozens of different products while also cultivating the experts necessary to proving general liability for the benefit of plaintiffs' attorneys working across MDL lines. The fact that this coordinated litigation ultimately involved seven MDLs with multiple products and multiple defendants required simultaneous efforts from teams of attorneys, working collaboratively on parallel tracks. The collective work from one product or one MDL aided the process overall while each product required specific focus in terms of liability discovery and pre-trial preparation, expert development, and trial work-up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The opportunity costs and time limitations imposed by the circumstances of these MDLs were likewise onerous. This litigation is not only one of the largest - if not\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   largest - mass tort product liability litigations in this nation's history, but it is the only mass tort products liability litigation in this country that has involved multiple related MDLs, each involving multiple products, coordinated before the same court simultaneously. For a number of years, the amount of time and effort necessary to coordinate this litigation significantly limited involvement in other matters for many of the lawyers responsible for leading this litigation. The burdens of funding this litigation through PSC contributions and tens of millions of dollars in held costs were substantial. The court has no doubt that pursuing this litigation limited, if not precluded, involvement in other litigations for many common benefit attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Novelty and Difficulty of the Issues (Factor 2); The Undesirability of the Case (Factor 10)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As recognized in\n   <em>\n    In re Vioxx\n   </em>\n   , \"all products liability cases pose significant challenges to plaintiffs' counsel\" that are only compounded by the complexity \"unique to the instant litigation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180011\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/760/640/#p647\">\n    760 F.Supp.2d at 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Individually, the cases in these MDLs involve complex prescription medical devices implanted by surgeons through an invasive surgical procedure. Thus, plaintiffs' leadership was not only required to address the difficult legal questions that arise in products liability cases generally but also had to navigate the unique regulatory, scientific and medical\n   issues presented in these cases. There were also significant issues related to the treating physicians, which necessitated understanding and addressing questions such as surgical skill and experience, doctor training, patient selection, and in some cases, medical negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The theory of how mesh allegedly caused injuries was a complex issue that required extensive research. Plaintiffs' leadership had to develop and define theories of liability to create a coherent theory of the problems allegedly caused by mesh implantation. Because each defendant designed varying products, the plaintiffs were tasked with finding experts from different scientific fields, including pelvic repair surgeons, pain specialists, biomaterials experts, polymer scientists, biostatisticians, pathologists, and regulatory experts. The level of detail needed to discover and explain why plaintiffs believed certain products were defective compounded the complexity. The leadership's research provided cross-cutting MDL benefits merely by demonstrating why particular weaves used in a mesh design allegedly caused injuries. Several plaintiffs' experts conducted laboratory testing of the materials and products that resulted in extensive reports explaining their medical and scientific findings and opinions. All these materials were developed into trial strategies, necessarily translating difficult concepts into digestible form. These difficulties were compounded by the number of products and defendants involved in each MDL. The divergent issues presented by multiple products in the seven MDLs mandated an organized effort across all MDLs. Any of the practical concerns that exist in litigating a large group of claims from across the country in a single court were only compounded by the variances presented in the cases unique to each MDL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Given the complexity of these tasks, \"the PSC was required to develop a sophisticated expertise in medical science, the scientific method, an encyclopedic knowledge of vast scientific and medical publications.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Actos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418455\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/274/485/#p517\">\n    274 F.Supp.3d at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs' leadership was subjected to different defense strategies and motions from nationally prominent law firms, which not only required hard work, but also ingenuity in working across MDL lines. Because there were different MDLs, products, and defendants, multitudes of dispositive motions were filed with\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   challenges of nearly all of the plaintiffs' experts, often with multiple motions per expert. This motion practice covered a wide variety of legal and evidentiary issues, such as punitive damages, admissibly of regulatory evidence, and product warnings. Because of the leadership's efforts, these complex legal and factual issues were resolved for all plaintiffs' counsel, for the common benefit in all seven MDLs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   With each round of briefing across different MDLs, new arguments and different evidence yielded distinguishable results. While plaintiffs' leadership was responsible for common benefit work across the MDLs, it also oversaw case-specific preparation on motions and responses to defense motions that were used as templates for future motion practice to the common benefit of all plaintiffs. For each regulatory or scientific issue in these seven MDLs, plaintiffs' leadership had to track \"the statutory and common laws of\" numerous states across the country.\n   <em>\n    Deepwater Horizon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206215974\">\n    2016 WL 6215974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17.

Before 2011, there were only a handful of firms involved in this mesh litigation. The risks and costs\n   associated with leading this litigation have remained onerous from the beginning.

Managing this difficult task necessitated experienced attorneys who specialize in complex litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The court appointed qualified and experienced counsel from across the country to lead plaintiffs' efforts. Many of the leadership law firms specialize in mass tort litigation, which provided leadership with the background necessary to tackle common MDL problems and adapt to new developments unique to prosecuting seven related MDLs. These litigations required dedicated research and study to address the many novel legal, scientific, and medical issues. This meant undertaking enormous document discovery and taking depositions of the individual plaintiffs to develop a general theory of liability for these cases.

Of those cases that have reached settlements or verdicts, roughly $ 7.25 billion has been provided to the plaintiffs as compensation for their injuries with an estimated $ 3.75 billion in future recoveries. As a result of the work by the PSC, plaintiffs have been able to file claims in the seven MDLs and use the already-developed pretrial materials to seek relatively quick resolution of their cases.

Oct. 19, 2012) (upholding a super-mega-fund MDL with a lodestar multiplier of 2.6, noting lower multipliers approved in other cases). Having established an initial benchmark percentage, analyzed common benefit counsels' work under the Fourth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Barber\n   </em>\n   factors, and found all the factors to be reasonable compared against a lodestar cross-check, the court\n   <strong>\n    FINDS\n   </strong>\n   the 5% holdback assessment reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The court notes that this percentage results in a substantial amount of money awarded to common benefit counsel. However, based on the numerous factors discussed above and the awards given in similar\n   MDLs, this court believes that the award given is conservative and serves to justly compensate common benefit counsel for their work without unnecessarily burdening the plaintiffs in this litigation. In return for their effort to produce all the benefits mentioned above, no individual plaintiff was, or ever will be, subject to more than a 5% holdback for all the benefit common benefit counsel created.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On November 26, 2018, one plaintiffs' firm filed objections to the FCC's Petition, arguing that the PSC failed to reach a global settlement with the defendants and that the FCC failed to \"use any particular methodology\" when justifying its request for access to the 5% holdback the court previously ordered. [ECF No. 677 ]. Subsequent to the court's ordered deadline for filing responses to the FCC's Petition, a second firm filed an untimely objection. While the objections are either irrelevant or untimely in evaluating the FCC's Petition, \"the [c]ourt has an independent duty to the [plaintiffs] and the public to ensure that such amounts are reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Deepwater Horizon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206215974\">\n    2016 WL 6215974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Kline &amp; Specter (\"K &amp; S\") Objections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   K &amp; S, the only firm that filed a timely objection to the FCC's Petition, argues the FCC Petition award should be reduced from 5% to 2.5%. In support of the request, K &amp; S makes four arguments that it believes require the court to reduce the common fund award. Of the four, two of K &amp; S's arguments address what it believes to be the FCC's failure to use any specific methodology in its Petition to the court in support of its request for the 5% assessment and the appealability of this court's rulings. This court has already made its own independent finding that the 5% requested holdback is appropriate under the Fourth Circuit's instructions for assessing common benefit fees. As noted above in the initial benchmark analysis, the court determined its own benchmark for awarding fees and is not rubber-stamping the FCC's proposal. K &amp; S then argues that the perceived disparate treatment is exacerbated by the FCC's failure to produce documents that show the FCC's basis for determining allocations between different firms. This argument is premature and does not address the question before the court. Here, this court is making an independent finding of the reasonableness of an aggregate award to common benefit counsel,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the allocation to individual common benefit counsel or firms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   K &amp; S also notes that it has not waived its right to appeal this court's determination of the Petition because the FCC has failed to act transparently, violated the Participation Agreement, and has given disparate treatment when dealing with FCC firms versus non-FCC firms. As K &amp; S correctly acknowledges in its response, and as noted above, the Agreed Order provides that the decision by this court would be final and non-reviewable. Concerns about individual firm awards will be dealt with during the allocation process. Accordingly, these objections are\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    a. No Global Settlement Was Reached\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   K &amp; S next argues that the failure to negotiate a global settlement on behalf of all of the plaintiffs is evidence that the PSC's work did not benefit all the MDL plaintiffs in resolving their cases. In particular, K &amp; S notes that it is the individual work of plaintiffs' counsel negotiating and trying cases that results in victories for their clients. K &amp; S claims that the FCC's analysis of similar percentage awards in establishing its own benchmark percentage\n   fails to recognize that the majority of the FCC's cited litigations resulted in global settlements or court-ordered damages. K &amp; S admits some work was done for the common benefit of the MDLs, but maintains that a lack of a global settlement evidences that much of the PSC's work was not for the common benefit. The court strongly disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Courts have enforced reasonable attorneys' fees awards in MDLs that did not reach global settlements or that involved plaintiffs who settled before the global settlement was reached. In\n   <em>\n    In re Zyprexa Products Liability Litigation\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit affirmed a district court's holdback of common benefit funds from plaintiffs who prosecuted their cases individually and sought exemption from the holdback.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3521913\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/113/#p129\">\n    594 F.3d at 129-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court noted that district courts typically appoint lead counsel for the purposes of assisting with case management and coordinating proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3521913\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/113/#p129\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   There is a \"desirability-indeed, the compelling need-to have pretrial proceedings managed or at least coordinated by lead counsel or a steering or executive committee [which] demands the existence of a source of compensation for their efforts on behalf of all.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3521913\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/113/#p129\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3521913\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/113/#p129\">\n    at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In comparing MDLs to class actions, the court reasoned that \"while individual plaintiffs are separately represented, they typically benefit also-often predominantly-from the work of the lead counsel or committee.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3521913\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/594/113/#p129\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Here, K &amp; S's argument for reducing the fund award ignores the purpose of the common benefit fund. The efforts of plaintiffs' leadership on behalf of the common benefit are in constructing a theory of liability, developing cross-cutting expert testimony that is applicable to general theories of liability in these MDLS, securing pretrial rulings for all plaintiffs, and reducing the bargaining power each defense counsel has in negotiating settlements with individual plaintiffs. This allowed individual counsel to try cases where they felt confident a jury would favorably view their case, or negotiate a settlement for one, or a group of, clients based on the defendants' weakened position. Far from failing to provide a common benefit in the form of a global settlement, the plaintiffs' leadership facilitated the settlement of tens of thousands of cases through its persistent efforts to weaken the defendants' factual and legal standing compared to individual women across the country. Plaintiffs' leadership also provided the MDL plaintiffs with all the work-product they created and educated individual plaintiff attorneys on how to prosecute a pelvic mesh case. These are global benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The purpose of the fund is to compensate counsel for the coordination, management, and performance of mutually beneficial work on behalf of all the plaintiffs. As the court addressed above in applying the\n   <em>\n    Barber\n   </em>\n   factors, common benefit counsel have effectively coordinated and developed a prosecution strategy, defended motions, and deposed key defense witness, including experts for plaintiffs and defendants. That work has benefited all the plaintiffs who are subject to the 5% holdback. The compensation is awarding the efforts of attorneys who worked on global issues affecting the plaintiffs. Therefore, the court finds the lack of a global settlement does not warrant reducing the fee award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Critical Work for the Common Benefit Going Uncompensated\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, K &amp; S asserts that the recommended allocation by the FCC has emphasized its members' contributions at the expense of important work performed by non-FCC attorneys. That objection is irrelevant and premature at this juncture. Again, the court is not making a determination as to the reasonableness of allocation awards to each individual firm at this\n   time. K &amp; S is essentially arguing certain slices of the pie are too small before the court has even issued its order determining the size of the pie. The purpose of this court's order is to evaluate the reasonableness of the aggregate proposed award that will be individually allocated in a later order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In arguing the FCC has treated non-FCC firms unequally, K &amp; S also claims compensation for work in the Covidien\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Coloplast litigation should be denied because no common benefit work was performed. That is incorrect. Common benefit work was performed in these MDLs and participating counsel are entitled to be compensated for their work. Although the amount of contribution in each of the seven MDLs varies, common benefit awards are assessed on the benefit provided by coordinating efforts as a whole.\n   <em>\n    In re Diet Drugs (Phentermine/Fenfluramine/Dexfenfluramine) Prod.

In\n   <em>\n    In re Diet Drugs\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit reasoned that individual plaintiffs who already recovered from the defendant or opted out of the global settlement in favor of an individual settlement were still subject to a common benefit assessment fee.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062410\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/524/#p547\">\n    582 F.3d at 547-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, a substantial benefit was conferred. As the court mentioned at great length above, the leadership oversaw the legal and factual issues regarding all seven MDLs, and developed any evidence or experts necessary to proving general liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Diet Drugs\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit recognized that even if counsel had opted out before a global settlement was reached or refused to use common benefit work product, leadership counsel secured \"favorable discovery and evidentiary rulings that applied on a litigation-wide basis, and it enforced a uniform procedure for\" many filings \"that governed every MDL case against\" the defendant.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062410\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/524/#p547\">\n    582 F.3d at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the defendants knew the plaintiffs had access to the MDL common discovery, all the plaintiffs benefited in the defendant's \"loss of bargaining power due to the [leadership's] efforts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062410\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/524/#p547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at. 548. \"[T]hose plaintiffs stood a better chance of recovery from [the defendant] than they would have absent the [leadership's] efforts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4062410\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/524/#p547\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   There is no material difference in regard to the Bard and Coloplast MDLs. All seven of the MDLs were transferred under this court's jurisdiction to manage the litigation in order to promote efficiencies across all of the MDLs. As the court previously mentioned, there is only one group of Co-Leads that coordinate with each MDL's leadership counsel. The common benefit work generated is broadly applicable to each MDL. Beyond the work already provided, plaintiffs' leadership has a continuing obligation to assist in case management and coordinating efforts of all the MDLs consolidated under this court's jurisdiction. In many instances, the leadership directly assisted individual plaintiff's counsel in settling their cases. That alone subjects all MDL defendants, past and present, to a loss of bargaining power that would not exist absent leadership's efforts. Therefore, a substantial benefit has been conferred in all the MDLs, including the Bard and Coloplast MDLs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Having explained why an assessment for all the MDLs is warranted, it is also necessary\n   to briefly address K &amp; S's claim that no common benefit work was performed in these two MDLs. First, in Coloplast, the FCC's reply to K &amp; S's response correctly identifies numerous requests for document production, Coloplast counsel's responses to production requests, and document review that occurred in 2016. In addition to MDL work performed, K &amp; S's counsel signed the holdback agreement entered in the Coloplast MDL that authorized a 5% assessment on Coloplast MDL settlements and verdicts. Even if K &amp; S had not endorsed the Coloplast MDL assessments since signing the Participation Agreement over five years ago, the Coloplast MDL claimants substantially benefited from the PSC's organizing, managing, and undermining Coloplast's bargaining power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Second, the FCC's reply correctly points to its efforts in reaching a stipulation where the parent company, Covidien, stood behind the judgments of its subsidiaries. This process served as a template for the stipulation reached in the AMS MDL, where Endo Pharmaceuticals stood behind the judgments and settlements of its subsidiary AMS. Beyond the substantial benefit conferred on the Covidien claimants, a Sofradim case was selected to go to trial as a bellwether case. Although the case eventually settled, the work performed to prepare the case for trial required marshalling all the evidence and arguments that would be necessary for a successful showing. K &amp; S cannot both claim that the common benefit conferred in finding, researching, and deposing experts for trial in certain MDLs is worth common benefit compensation, while simultaneously asserting the work prepared for prosecuting Bard defendants amounts to \"no discovery.\" [ECF No. 677 ]. Therefore, K &amp; S's objections to the award have not persuaded the court to reduce the 5% assessment and are\n   <strong>\n    OVERRULED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    2.
