First, it contends that the underlying premise of COPAA's injury-in-fact argument - \"that ED's postponement of the compliance date for the 2016 regulations will result in fewer school districts being identified with significant disproportionality than would have occurred absent the postponement\" - is \"speculative.\" Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 19, ECF No. 14 (\"Defs.'

The essence of the government's argument is that the likelihood of fewer school districts being identified \"depends on the independent actions of entities not before the Court and not parties to this litigation ...,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and those entities have wide latitude in implementing the regulations. In particular, States had three types of discretion in implementing the 2016 Regulations: (1) States could set a reasonable risk ratio threshold applicable to their own schools districts, 81 Fed. Reg. at 92388 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300.647\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 300.647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(i), (b)(1)(iii)(B) ; (2) States had flexibility to determine when there were sufficient children in a particular racial or ethnic group to permit application\n   of the regulations' methodology in the first instance,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300.647\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 300.647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), (4) ; and (3) States had discretion not to identify an LEA as significantly disproportionate if the risk ratio for a racial or ethnic group in the relevant category of analysis had not exceeded the risk ratio threshold for three prior consecutive years or if the district had demonstrated reasonable progress in lowering its risk ratio for the group in the relevant category of analysis in each of the two prior years,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20300.647\">\n    34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 300.647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1), (2). This discretion, the government argues, renders any prediction about whether the 2016 Regulations would have led to more schools being identified as significantly disproportionate as an exercise in speculation. Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In further support of this argument, the government also points to the fact that when it issued the 2016 final regulations, the Department admitted that it was uncertain \"how many LEAs would be newly identified in future years, particularly given the wide flexibilities provided to States in the final regulations,\" 81 Fed. Reg. at 92388, and that it was \"possible that these regulations may not result in any additional LEAs being identified as having significant disproportionality.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92458. Finally, the government argues that Plaintiff has not proffered \"markers or allegations to suggest how the States intended to implement the 2016 Regulations, or how they intend to act following postponement of the compliance date.\" Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The government's own statements undermine its argument that an increase in LEAs being identified as significantly disproportionate is speculative. Indeed, these statements demonstrate that an increase in the number of LEAs found to be significantly disproportionate was likely had the 2016 Regulations gone into effect. Although the Department said that it is possible that these regulations may not result in any additional LEAs being identified as having significant disproportionality, it found this outcome \"unlikely\" and that \"400 LEAs above baseline represents the most reasonable estimate of the likely costs associated with these final rules.\" 81 Fed. Reg. at 92458, 92462. In a similar vein, when the Department promulgated the Delay Regulation, it estimated there would be fewer LEAs identified as having significant disproportionality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   83 Fed. Reg. at 31316 (\"[W]e also estimate that 150 additional LEAs will be identified with significant disproportionately in Year 1 [2018-2019], 220 in Year 2 [2019-2020], and 400 in Year 3 [2020-2021].\"). While the court notes that these projections were not made \"with a high degree of certainty,\" 81 Fed. Reg. at 92388, COPAA's \"burden of proof is not to demonstrate certainty but to show a\n   <em>\n    substantial probability\n   </em>\n   \" of injury.\n   <em>\n    In re Idaho Conservation League\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309970,4082327\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/811/502/\">\n    811 F.3d 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 508 (D.C.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The court finds that the Department of Education violated the APA in two ways. First, it failed to provide a reasoned explanation for delaying the 2016 Regulations. Second, it failed to consider the costs of delay, rendering the Delay Regulation arbitrary and capricious.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Government Failed to Provide a Reasoned Explanation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The government implemented the Delay Regulation because it was concerned that the 2016 Regulations could incentivize LEAs to use racial quotas to avoid findings of significant disproportionality. This decision did not have adequate support in the rulemaking record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The issue of the 2016 Regulations acting as an incentive for racial quotas was thoroughly discussed and dealt with years before 2018, when the government cited it as the basis for implementing the Delay Regulation. In adopting the 2016 Regulations, the government responded to comments arguing that the regulations \"would create an incentive [for LEAs] to not identify children for special education and related services in order to reduce disproportionality numbers,\" 81 Fed. Reg. at 92454, by acknowledging this possibility, but concluded that it was limited to States that selected \"particularly low risk ratio thresholds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (\"[T]he Department recognizes the possibility that, in cases where States select particularly low risk ratio thresholds, LEAs may have an incentive to avoid identifying children from particular racial or ethnic groups in order to avoid a determination of significant disproportionality.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Although the government in 2016 found this danger to be smaller than some commenters proposed, it nonetheless worked to address them in the final regulations. The preamble to the final 2016 Regulations condemned the use of racial quotas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92381 (\"[N]othing in these regulations establishes or authorizes the use of racial or ethnic quotas limiting a child's access to special education and related services.\"). The government expressly stated that the use of quotas violates the IDEA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92393 (\"[I]t is a violation of IDEA for LEAs to attempt to avoid determinations of significant disproportionality by failing to identify otherwise eligible children as children with disabilities.\"). The preamble\n   also warned that the use of quotas would expose an LEA to various forms of legal liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 92381 (\"[A]n LEA's use of quotas to artificially reduce the number of children who are identified as having a disability, in an effort to avoid a finding of significant disproportionality, would almost certainly conflict with their obligations to comply with other Federal statutes, including civil rights laws governing equal access to education.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 92385 (\"[T]he establishment of any such quotas would almost certainly result in legal liability under Federal civil rights laws, including title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Constitution.\"). And the government stated that it had \"added a new \u00a7 300.646(f) to make clear that these regulations do not authorize a State or an LEA to develop or implement policies, practices, or procedures that result in actions that violate any IDEA requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The government implemented additional safeguards beyond these warnings. Because the government found that States which \"select particularly low risk ratio thresholds,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , were most likely to be incentivized to use quotas, the 2016 Final Regulations \"provide[d] States the flexibility to set their own reasonable risk ratio thresholds, with input from stakeholders and State Advisory Panels.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The government explained that \"[a]s part of the process of setting risk ratio thresholds, States must work with stakeholders to identify particular risk ratio thresholds that help States and LEAs to address large racial and ethnic disparities without undermining the appropriate implementation of child find procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Moreover, the government committed to \"monitor States for any use of risk ratio thresholds that may be unreasonable and take steps, as needed, to ensure the States' compliance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92419. The regulations required \"States to report all risk ratio thresholds, minimum cell sizes, minimum n-sizes, standards for measuring reasonable progress, and the rationales for each,\" and these rationales had to \"include a detailed explanation of why the numbers are reasonable and how they ensure appropriate analysis for significant disproportionality.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92460. The government also committed \"to publish guidance to help schools to prevent racial discrimination in the identification of children as children with disabilities, including over-identification, under-identification, and delayed identification of disabilities by race.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92397. Finally, the regulations included monitoring of States and LEAs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92385 (\"[T]he Department intends to conduct an evaluation of the implementation of this regulation to assess its impact, if any, on how LEAs identify children with disabilities.\"). This evaluation would \"include an examination of the extent to which school and LEA personnel incorrectly interpret the risk ratio thresholds and implement racial quotas in an attempt to avoid findings of significant disproportionality by States, contrary to IDEA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92386.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In 2018, the government rejected its prior conclusion that the 2016 Regulations adequately protected against the risk of States using racial quotas to avoid findings of significant disproportionality. However, the government did not explicitly find that the safeguards in the 2016 Regulations\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   insufficient or that the 2016 Regulations\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   result in the use of quotas. Rather, it stated it needed more time to determine whether the regulations \"may\" incentivize quotas. 83 Fed.

Again, the government here provides no such \"reasoned explanation.\" It relies exclusively on data from Texas to justify its change in position regarding the possible use of racial quotas and the adequacy of the safeguards to prevent their use.
