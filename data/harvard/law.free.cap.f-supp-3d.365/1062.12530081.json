Ex. 7, ECF No. 83-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that a reference not included in its invalidity contentions is analogous prior art that supports the '505 Patent being invalid as obvious. This prior art is a newsletter issued by the Clean Washington Center in November 1996 (the \"Clean Washington Newsletter\"). Pl. Ex. 5, ECF No. 83-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court finds that the relevant prior art includes the Georgantas and Arpaio Patents. The Georgantas Patent \"disclos[es] a process for producing an attractive fire from a gas line embedded in a bed of broken, tempered glass pieces, which may be 'abraded or polished so as to smooth over any sharp or pointed edges.' \" Pl. MSJ at 8 (citing ECF No. 98-2, at 7 );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl. Ex. 9. The Arpaio Patent relates to \"a vibratory tumbling machine vessel for burnishing or cleansing metal, plastic or ceramic elements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (citing Pl. Ex. 4). These patents are pertinent to the problem addressed, Defendant cited them as references while prosecuting the '505 Patent before the PTO, and Defendant does not dispute they are relevant prior art references.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Similarly, the Court finds that the ASTM Standard and the GANA Glazing Manual are relevant prior art. Both prior art references describe processes for heating\n   and cooling glass and the relevant specifications for such glass. These are both within the field of endeavor and reasonably pertinent to the problem addressed by the '505 Patent. Moreover, Defendant does not dispute they are relevant prior art.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp'n.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendant does, however, dispute the remaining prior art references. Beginning with Wexler, Defendant argues that \"obviousness cannot be established by combining the teachings of the prior art to produce the claimed invention, absent some teaching, suggestion or incentive supporting the\n   <em>\n    combination.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31 (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Geiger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519392\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/815/686/#p688\">\n    815 F.2d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 688 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ) (emphasis in original). This argument misses the mark. Determining whether there is a suggestion to modify and combine the prior art is not pertinent to whether the art is analogous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Wexler describes in detail the tumbling of gemstones and further describes glass as one of the products capable of being tumbled and polished. Pl. Ex. 3 at 4. Defendant concedes that Wexler shows that the practice of tumbling has occurred for many years to smooth the edges of glass fragments. Def. Opp'n at 30. Because Wexler teaches smoothing the edges of glass fragments, it would have \"commended itself to an inventor's attention in considering\" how to create safe-to-handle tempered glass fragments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Innovention Toys\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196649\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/1314/#p1321\">\n    637 F.3d at 1321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court therefore finds Wexler to be relevant prior art.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, Defendant argues that the McBride Patent is not relevant prior art because it is not in the field of the inventor's endeavor and not reasonably pertinent to the problem the inventor solved.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196649\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/1314/#p1321\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 31 (citing\n   <em>\n    Union Carbide Corp. v.

The '505 Patent describes its field of invention as \"recycling broken, normal tempered glass waste into smooth glass pieces useful in, for example, lapidary construction, art, and functional interior and exterior decorating.\" Pl. Ex. 20 at 1:64-67, ECF No. 83-21. The McBride Patent's field of endeavor is the manufacture of decorative concrete products using a process whereby an \"exposed aggregate\" is embedded in the concrete. Pl. Ex. 8 at 1. The aggregate is decorative in nature and \"consisting at least in part of fragmented glass.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The McBride Patent also discloses that it may be desirable to remove sharp edges by tumbling the glass in a rotating drum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Although both the '505 and McBride Patents pertain, in part, to decorative materials, the Court concludes that the McBride Patent is not in same field of endeavor. Whereas the '505 Patent solely pertains to tempered glass, the McBride Patent primarily concerns decorative concrete fabrication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The McBride Patent, however, does relate to a similar problem addressed by the '505 Patent. The McBride Patent specifically contemplates tumbling recycled glass to remove sharp edges before use as a decorative aggregate in a concrete molding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This addresses an issue similar to that the '505 Patent addresses and logically relates to the inventor's concern, namely, removing sharp edges from decorative glass pieces. This is in accord with the January 16, 2014 PTO re-examination of the '505 patent claims where the PTO considered the Arpaio and Georgantas Patents and found them to be reasonably pertinent to the problem addressed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 23 at 4, ECF No. 83-24 (\"Arpaio teaches a process for smoothing glass.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 9 at 1, ECF No. 83-10 ; Ex. 23 at 11 (Georgantas Patent reasonably pertinent to making smooth tempered glass). The Court therefore finds that the McBride Patent is relevant prior art.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, Defendant argues that the Court should not consider the Clean Washington Newsletter as prior art. Def. Opp'n\n   at 31. Plaintiff does not address the Clean Washington Newsletter in its Reply brief.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply. The newsletter describes in relevant part a process for \"produc[ing] a more aesthetically appealing crushed glass\" by using \"[g]lass processors that have either multiple rows of hammers that beat the glass into cubical shapes or a centrifugal action that tumbles the broken glass on itself to produce an autogenous shape.\" Ex. 5 at 1, ECF No. 83-6. A problem the '505 Patent addresses is making the recycled glass more aesthetically pleasing and, thus, the Court finds the Clean Washington Newsletter is reasonably pertinent to the problem addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendant argues that the Clean Washington Newsletter lacks credibility, lacks foundation, is hearsay, and would likely not be admissible at trial and, thus, is not appropriate for the Court to consider. Def. Opp'n at 31. Defendant fails to support these contentions with any authority or record evidence.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The Court, therefore, is not persuaded by any of Defendant's conclusory legal assertions and finds that these do not create a material factual dispute regarding whether the Clean Washington Newsletter is prior art.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant also argues that, because Plaintiff did not disclose the Clean Washington Newsletter in its invalidity contentions, the Court should exclude it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.

Ex. 20 at 9:63-10:2, 10:33-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Georgantas Patent teaches forming tempered glass fragments from tempered glass. ECF No. 83-1 at 31 (citing Pl. Ex. 9 at 1:30-33, 2:38-41). Plaintiff next argues that the ASTM Standard discloses heat-strengthened glass having a surface compression between 3500 and 7500 PSI.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 32 (citing Pl. Ex. 7 at 4). Finally, Plaintiff points to the GANA Glazing Manual as disclosing that heat-strengthened glass with a surface compression levels in the range of 3500 to 7500 PSI is most desirable for most uses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Pl. Ex. 6 at 4). Defendant, on the other hand, argues that \"absolutely no reference discloses this element.\" Def. Claim Chart at 1 (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court construed \"heat-treated glass\" to mean \"any glass that is processed to create a surface compression such that the fraction pattern of the glass results in many small glass fragments.\" Claim Construction Order at 8, ECF No. 111. \"Heat-treated glass shall refer to, for example, fully tempered glass, heat-strengthened glass (also known as toughened glass), or any other glass heat processed to create a similar fracture pattern.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court also construed \"standard fully tempered glass\" to mean \"(i) having a surface compression of at least 3,500 PSI; (ii) being formed by cooling the heated glass so as to leave a center area of the heated glass hotter than surfaces; (iii) being formed by heating the glass only once to a temperature of at least 1000\u00b0 Fahrenheit and rapidly cooling it to a temperature below 700\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n    at 21-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   For the type of glass used, the Georgantas Patent teaches using tempered glass that is baked three times in a controlled temperature and oxygen environment over a predetermined period of time and then broken to form smooth-edged pieces. Pl. Ex. 9 at 2:35-38. The '505 Patent, on the other hand, teaches using standard tempered glass which is not baked three times. Pl. Ex. 20. The Court finds that the '505 and Georgantas Patents do differ in the type of glass used. The Georgantas Patent concerns specially formulated tempered glass created by baking the glass three times, while the '505 patent does not. Defendant has not, however, shown that this difference is material. Nothing indicates that this difference changes the process for creating the finished products in any way or would cause a person of ordinary skill in the art to not consider these Patents to address the same problem in the same field of endeavor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Concerning the heating and cooling process, the Georgantas Patent teaches rapid cooling of the outer surfaces, while the center is allowed to cool slowly. Pl. Ex. 9 at 3:63-4:1. Specifically, it discloses that the heating process is \"followed by rapid cooling of the outer surfaces via controlled air blasts or an oil-water cooling process, while the center is allowed to cool slowly.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff argues that this method is not actually different form the one described in the '505 Patent. Plaintiff states that \"[t]he use of air to cool heated glass has been known and previously described,\" ECF No. 83-1 at 35, and that \"[i]t is inherent that the center of the glass would be hotter than the surfaces that are cooled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While Plaintiff provides no citation for this statement, the Court agrees. The Georgantas Patent references U.S Patent No. 5,656,558 (the \" '558 Patent\"), which discloses a method for creating fire retardant safety glass. The '558 Patent states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The high coefficient of thermal expansion of these glasses means that such\n   glass panes possess, even at a high compressive stress of 120 N/mm\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n   -irrespective of pane thickness-a temperature difference resistance (TUF), between the\n   <em>\n    cold edge of the pane and the hot center\n   </em>\n   of only about 200 to 220 K. The temperature difference resistance characterizes the property of a pane to\n   <em>\n    withstand the difference in temperature between the hot center of the pane and the cold edge.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   '558 Patent, at 1:59-67 (emphasis added). This is exemplary of a hotter center of glass and cooler edge of glass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As for the temperature and PSI used, the Georgantas Patent teaches that \"glass is preferably from 2.5mm to 20mm in thickness, and is baked at least three times at temperatures of about 1200\u00b0 F for 30 minutes or more.\" Pl. Ex. 9, at 2:35-38. The GANA Glazing Manual teaches heat-treating glass by uniformly heating the glass to approximately 1150\u00b0 Fahrenheit. Pl. Ex. 6 at 8. It also discloses an ideal surface-compression level of 3,500 to 7,500 PSI.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The ASTM Standard specification for heat-treated glass reveals that heat-strengthened glass with a thickness of 1/4\" (6mm) and less will have a surface compression of 3,500 to 7,500 PSI. Pl. Ex. 6, at 4. Each reference discloses a surface compression of at least 3,500 PSI and a temperature that is over 1000\u00b0 Fahrenheit. The Court therefore finds that there are no material differences between these specifications and those found in the '505 patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Next, Defendant argues that no prior art discloses the phrase \"substantially rounded, bead-like shape\" in both claims 1 and 7. Def. Ex. B, at 1, 3, ECF No. 128-3. Plaintiff contends that Wexler; the Arpaio, Georgantas, and McBride Patents; and the Clean Washington Newsletter all disclose this term. Pl. MSJ at 33; Pl. Claim Chart at 18-19, 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court construed the phrase \"substantially rounded, bead-like shape\" as two separate terms. The Court defined \"substantially rounded\" as \"smoothed in such a way that the glass fragments are free of sharp burs and suitable for direct handling.\" Claim Construction Order at 22-25. The Court defined \"bead-like shape\" according to the parties' stipulated construction as \"having varying shapes and sizes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Georgantas Patent teaches that \"[t]he formed pieces of the broken, tempered glass may be washed and sifted to remove any debris, and may be further abraded or polished to form glass pieces without sharp edges, if needed.\" Pl.

Wexler at 4. It\n   teaching that, in the tumbling process, \"[t]he purpose of the first grind is to remove all the rough surfaces, crevices, blemishes, etc. When the grind is completed you should have\n   <em>\n    rounded stones of about the desired size.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Wexler also states that a vibrating tumbler is acceptable for use in lieu of a rotating tumbler.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Finally, the McBride Patent discloses tumbling glass for use in concrete molding. Specifically, it teaches that, \"[b]ecause the glass fragments are exposed at the surface of the finished cast concrete product, ... it may be desirable or necessary for safety reasons for sharp edges of the glass fragments to be removed prior to use.\" Pl. Ex. 8 at 2:27-30. The McBride Patent teaches that the sharp edges \"may be achieved by tumbling of the glass, [e.g.] in a rotating drum, to give the fragments a\n   <em>\n    rounder form\n   </em>\n   with fewer or no sharp edges or points.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n    at 2:30-3:2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As noted, the Court defined \"substantially rounded\" to mean \"smoothed in such a way that the glass fragments are free of sharp burs and suitable for direct handling\" and \"bead-like shape\" to mean \"having varying shapes and sizes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Claim Construction Order at 22. The Court finds that the Georgantas Patent teaches removing sharp edges; the Arpaio Patent specifies that its tumbling process removes burrs from glass; Wexler teaches removing sharp edges, crevices, and blemishes, and the McBride Patent discloses tumbling glass for safety reasons to remove sharp edges. Further Wexler and the Georgantas and McBride Patents all discuss rounded elements. In sum, the prior art teaches smoothing glass to remove burs and create a rounded shape, leaving the glass suitable for direct handling. Therefore, the Court finds no material differences exist between the '505 Patent and the prior art regarding this limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Based on these findings, the Court determines that there are no material differences between the prior art and claims 1 and 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   b. Claims 2 and 8\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Next, Defendant argues that absolutely no reference discloses the elements in claims 2 and 8. Ex. B, at 1, 3. Claim 2 discloses \"[a] method as recited in claim 1, wherein the plurality of heat-treated glass pieces [are] formed from tempered glass that has been heated to a temperature in the range of about 1,200\u00b0 to 1,600\u00b0 Fahrenheit and rapidly cooled to a temperature below 600\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\" '505 Patent, at 10. Claim 8 discloses the same limitation but derives from independent claim 7.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff does not address claims 2 or 8 in its chart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As noted above, several prior art references, including the GANA Glazing Manual and the Georgantas Patent, disclose a process for heating and rapidly cooling the glass. Pl. Ex. 9, at 2:35-38; Pl. Ex. 6 at 8-9. The references do differ from the claims in that the references do not contain the exact temperatures and process for cooling that the '505 Patent claims contain. The Court finds these differences, however, are not material. This difference does not change the process in a meaningful way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   c. Claims 3 and 9\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Defendant contends that no reference discloses claims 3 and 9. Def. Ex. B, at 2-3. Claim 3 states \"[a] method as recited in claim 1, wherein each glass fragment is formed from toughened glass that has a surface compression of at least 4,500 pounds-force per square inch (PSI).\" Pl. Ex. 20 at 10. Claim 9 discloses the same limitation but derives from independent claim 7.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166987\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/383/1/#p17\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As discussed above, both the GANA Glazing Manual and the ASTM Standards disclose heat-treated glass with surface compression between 3,500 and 7,500 PSI. The 4,500 PSI found in claims 3\n   and 9 clearly falls within the range disclosed by the prior art references. Thus, the Court finds no differences between claims 3 and 9 and the prior art.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    3. Level of Ordinary Skill in the Art\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In its Motion for Summary Judgment, Plaintiff does not take any position as to the relevant skill in the art or submit any evidence pertaining to the level of ordinary skill in the art.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.

According to Defendant, nothing in the prior art suggests a person of ordinary skill in the art at the time the Patent issued would have combined the elements. Def. Opp'n at 19-20.

The Court finds that the process for creating the standard tempered glass, breaking that glass, and using it in a decorative fashion described in the '505 Patent is virtually identical to that found in the '360 Patent. The Court agrees with the PTO's numerous findings that this process is obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art. The Georgantas Patent teaches a very similar process for using heat-treated glass, breaking that glass, and using it for decorative purposes--including for use in fire pits. Although the Georgantas Patent teaches using specially formulated tempered glass (created by baking it three times), the Court finds that it would be obvious to a person of ordinary skill to take the teachings as they pertain to this specially formulated glass and to apply them to standard tempered glass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   With this process as a baseline, the Court concludes that it would have been obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the art to tumble the glass pieces to form a substantially rounded, bead-like shape that is safe to handle. The prior art, including the Arpaio Patent and Wexler, clearly teaches the process of tumbling various materials--including glass--to remove sharp edges. Faced with the problem of how to remove sharp edges on the broken tempered glass pieces, an obvious solution for a person of ordinary skill in the art would be to tumble or vibrate those pieces using the processes described in the prior art. Moreover, the obvious shape of those pieces would be rounded pieces of various shapes and sizes. While Defendant vehemently denies this would be obvious, Defendant's only evidence in support of the nonobviousness of the '505 Patent is Mr. Jaunzemis' declaration.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Jaunzemis Decl.

Plaintiff contends that summary judgment is appropriate because the website references only applied to two products out of many and, thus, Defendant's damages are\n   \"de minimus.\" Pl. MSJ at 27. Moreover, according to Plaintiff, Defendant failed to show that this fact would have impacted any consumer's decision to purchase the product.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In searching the case law, the Court is unable to find any authority that absolves a defendant for making literally false statements on the account that they cause only de minimus harm. In addition to the lack of authority, this argument fails because \"an inability to show actual damages does not alone preclude [ ] recovery\" under the Lanham Act.\n   <em>\n    Lindy Pen Co. v.

Importantly, Plaintiff has failed to bring forth any evidence that supports its contention that Defendant suffered no harm and, therefore, Plaintiff has failed to meet its burden to show the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment as to Defendant's counter claims under the Lanham Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Thus, a finding that Defendant's Lanham Act fails \"on the merits\" is conclusive that its state law claims fail as well.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3904813\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/378/652/#p655\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the Lanham Act and the UCL are substantially similar, the Court finds that the same reasoning applies for those claims and therefore\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment as to Defendant's claims under the UCL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Defendant seeks summary judgment as to all of Plaintiff's claims under the Lanham Act and the UCL on the grounds that Plaintiff fails to show that any statements made by Defendant were false, there is no evidence of injury, and there is no evidence of bad faith. Def. MSJ at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

Cir. 1996). Thus, the Ninth Circuit's standard for proving Lanham Act claims applies here. In addition to the five elements normally required to prove a Lanham Act violation, in the Ninth Circuit, \"where Lanham Act claims ... are based on a defendant's representation that someone infringed his patent, plaintiff must show that defendant's representation was made in bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Appliance Recycling Centers of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3904813\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/378/652/#p655\">\n    378 F.

The letters threaten to sue for infringement of the '360 and '505 Patents, stating in relevant part that \"Moderustic is proud to have been issued 2 U.S. Patent Numbers, 7,976,360 (in reconsideration) and 8,419,505.... These patents and applications cover our method of creating tumbled tempered glass for use in fireplaces and fire pits.\" ECF Nos. 12-2, 12-3. Plaintiff contends that these threats constitute false statements that caused its distributors to no longer buy from it, causing Plaintiff harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Court does not find that these statements were literally false. At the time Defendant sent these letters in 2015, the PTO had issued the '505 Patent to Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp'n at 5-6. And although the PTO had rejected the '360 Patent, it was technically being reconsidered by the Federal Circuit at that time the letters were sent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232648\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/530/1063/#p1068\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, these statements are not literally false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \"An advertisement that is not literally false may support a Lanham Act claim only if it is shown 'that the advertisement has misled, confused, or deceived the consuming public.' \"\n   <em>\n    Appliance Recycling Ctrs. of Am.\n   </em>\n   , 378 Fed.

The Court finds that no reasonable jury could find these statements to mislead, confuse, or deceive the consuming public when considered in their overall context. The letter clearly indicates that the '360 Patent is in reconsideration. More importantly, the '505 Patent had been issued at the time the letters were sent, giving Defendant the right to enforce its legal rights as the Patent holder, regardless of the '360 Patent's status. Thus, even if the letter misled the recipient into believing that Defendant had an enforceable right as to the '360 Patent, that right was duplicative of Defendant's right to enforce the '505 Patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The Court also finds that \"Plaintiff[ has not] presented any evidence that defendant[ ] drafted or forwarded the letters in bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Fisher Tool Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232648\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/530/1063/#p1068\">\n    530 F.3d at 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The letters clearly indicate that the '360 Patent was \"in reconsideration\" and, although Plaintiff vehemently disagrees with the PTO's issuance of the '505 Patent, Defendant did in fact have the right to enforce its rights as the patentholder at that time. Without a showing that Defendant had some malicious intent, rather than simply asserting its rights as the patentholder, the Court cannot find bad faith present here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232648\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/530/1063/#p1068\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4232648\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/530/1063/#p1068\">\n    at 1068-1069\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (refusing to infer bad faith where the plaintiffs failed to bring forth any evidence other than the alleged misrepresentation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   summary judgment in favor of Defendant with regard to Plaintiff's Lanham Act claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B.

Because the Court has found the letters insufficient to support Plaintiff's Lanham Act claims,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section II.A., those same letters cannot support Plaintiff's claims under California law.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Appliance Recycling Ctrs. of Am.\n   </em>\n   , 378 Fed.
