Four defendants, Scott McFerran (\"McFerran\"), Laura Wilson (\"Wilson\"), Daron Anderson (\"Anderson\"), and Decatur Advisors LLC (\"Decatur\") (collectively, the \"Moving Defendants\"), move to disqualify the law firm of Vial Fotheringham LLP (\"VF\") from continuing to represent the Association in this action. In an Opinion and Order, United States Magistrate Judge Stacie F. Beckerman granted the motion to disqualify the Association's counsel, and the Association timely objected. After reviewing the record and hearing oral argument, the Court finds the Opinion and Order is contrary to law and denies the motion to disqualify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Federal Magistrates Act grants district courts the authority to delegate certain matters to magistrate judges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

The Court agrees with Defendants. If the Magistrate Judge's decision is upheld, the Association may continue to prosecute all of its claims against each of the Defendants, after obtaining new counsel. Thus, there is nothing in the pending motion to disqualify Plaintiff's counsel that is analogous to any of the motions expressly identified in \u00a7 636(b)(1)(A).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Howe Inv., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11512318\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/96/106/#p113\">\n    96 F.Supp.2d at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a motion to disqualify is a nondispositive matter that a magistrate judge may determine unless the district court referred the matter only for a report and recommendation). Accordingly, the Court will evaluate the Magistrate Judge's factual findings to determine if any are clearly erroneous. More relevant to the pending dispute, however, the Court also will evaluate the Magistrate Judge's legal conclusions to determine if any are contrary to law, which involves a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of those issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A company owned by James Standring (\"Standring\") developed a planned residential community in Washington County, Oregon known as \"Quatama Park Townhomes\" (\"Quatama Park\"). Other companies owned by Standring provided construction and other services for Quatama Park. The construction lender was RBC Real Estate Finance, Inc. (\"RBC\"). In 2011, RBC foreclosed on the Quatama Park project and became the successor declarant for that development. RBC then hired Decatur to manage the completion of the development.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Wilson and Anderson worked for Decatur. RBC appointed Wilson and Anderson as the sole members of the Association's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") until control of Quatama Park would be turned over to the lot owners. In July 2013, Lamplight Capital &amp; Asset Management, LLC (\"Lamplight\") purchased RBC's interest in the project. Lamplight reappointed Wilson and Anderson as the Association's sole directors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In July 2015, the Board hired VF to provide legal services to the Association as outside general counsel. VF's representation agreement was addressed to the Board, which then consisted of only Wilson and Anderson. There were no other officers or managers of the Association, whose activities were solely directed by Wilson and Anderson. Wilson signed VF's representation agreement as the \"Authorized Representative\" of the Association. In August 2015, Anderson resigned from the Board, and Lamplight appointed McFerran to replace him. McFerran also worked for Decatur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In November 2015, the Association engaged VF on a contingent fee basis to file a lawsuit for money damages against Standring's companies and other contractors and sub-contractors, seeking money damages for repairs related to various construction defects. McFerran signed the contingent fee agreement with VF as the \"Authorized Representative\" of the Board. At that time, Wilson and McFerran were the only directors of the Board. Before filing this lawsuit, attorney Ryan Harris (\"Harris\") from VF asked both Wilson and McFerran to provide Harris with \"any other documents showing other potential defendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Also during this time period, Wilson and McFerran were consulting with attorney Eugene Grant of Davis Wright Tremaine LLP (\"Davis Wright\"). In response to a request to Wilson and McFerran from VF sent on November 2, 2015, Eugene Grant of Davis Wright responded to VF as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Thanks for your advice and assistance. I will be consulting with Scott [McFerran] and Laura [Wilson] and the other members of the Lamplight team today and will get back to you ASAP today regarding the assessment allocation method. We understand there are risks whichever way we allocate and assess the unit repair costs, but do not fully agree with your analysis. I will explain more fully our position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ECF 25-1 at 196 (Ex. 44). Wilson and McFerran ultimately did not provide any documents in response to Harris's request. VF filed the\n   <em>\n    Quatama I\n   </em>\n   lawsuit on behalf of the Association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In mid-2016, several homeowners threatened to sue Lamplight, Wilson, and McFerran over repair costs relating to the alleged construction defects. In June 2016, one homeowner sent an email to Harris at VF, suggesting that Wilson and McFerran had breached their fiduciary duties owed to the homeowners by commencing the\n   <em>\n    Quatama I\n   </em>\n   lawsuit for construction defects without adequately determining whether the costs for that litigation would be recovered. Harris forwarded that email to Wilson\n   and McFerran, asking for their response. Harris then responded to the homeowner, commenting that a disagreement over whether to file the lawsuit did not necessarily mean that the Board was breaching its fiduciary duties. During the next two months, Harris met with Wilson and McFerran in person and spoke with them by telephone to discuss the homeowners' allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In August 2016, the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Quatama I\n   </em>\n   , Standring's companies, issued subpoenas to Wilson and Decatur for documents relating to the development. Wilson and McFerran provided their complete files to Harris at VF. Anderson also provided Harris with all of his documents related to the development. At some point in reviewing these files, Harris discovered documents purportedly showing that Wilson, McFerran, or Anderson may have known about the construction defects at the development as early as 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On August 29, 2016, Damon Henrie (\"Henrie\"), an attorney for several homeowners at the Quatama Park development, sent a letter to Harris and counsel for Lamplight and RBC. Henrie's letter placed those counsel on notice that Henrie's clients intended to pursue claims against Lamplight, McFerran, and Wilson. On September 1, 2016, after soliciting comments from Wilson and McFerran, Harris replied to Henrie.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In January 2017, the defendants in the\n   <em>\n    Quatama I\n   </em>\n   lawsuit moved for leave to amend their third-party complaint to assert contribution claims against the Wilson, McFerran, and Anderson. On their behalf, Harris tendered these claims to the Association's Directors and Officers Insurance carrier. In March 2017, Wilson and McFerran resigned from the Board, which then transitioned to homeowner control. Shortly before that transition, however, Harris informed Wilson and McFerran that Harris had received a settlement offer from the\n   <em>\n    Quatama I\n   </em>\n   defendants. Harris stated that he believed \"we can do better\" and recommended that Wilson and McFerran allow the Association's new Board to make that decision. Wilson and McFerran agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In April 2017, the\n   <em>\n    Quatama I\n   </em>\n   defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that the applicable statute of limitations had expired. They presented evidence that the Association's previous directors had known about the construction defects more than two years before the lawsuit was filed. Also in April 2017, Harris exchanged emails with Wilson, McFerran, and Anderson regarding requests for their depositions by the\n   <em>\n    Quatama I\n   </em>\n   defendants. Harris also offered to represent Wilson, McFerran, and Anderson at those depositions. The depositions, however, had not yet occurred when, in May 2017, Harris sent a letter to counsel for RBC stating that the recently-elected directors of the Association (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the homeowners or lot owners) did not believe it was in the Association's best interest to sign a common interest agreement among the Association, Wilson, Decatur, RBC, and Lamplight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On June 19, 2017, Harris sent a letter to Wilson, McFerran, and Anderson, informing them that, if the\n   <em>\n    Quatama I\n   </em>\n   defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted, the Association may file a breach of fiduciary duty lawsuit against Wilson, McFerran, and Anderson, based on their failure timely to authorize the filing of lawsuit after discovering the construction defects. Harris also explained that, after the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Quatama I\n   </em>\n   had requested to take the depositions of the former directors, Harris initially had intended to defend those depositions, but \"as the Association's lawyer, I can no longer do that.\" Harris also advised Wilson, McFerran, and\n   Anderson to consult their own counsel. Wilson, McFerran, and Anderson then retained their own counsel, Kurt Peterson (\"Peterson\"). On July 10, 2017, Peterson told Harris that the three former directors of the Association (Wilson, McFerran, and Anderson) all believed that they each personally had formed an attorney-client relationship with the VF law firm. On July 17, 2018, Peterson wrote to VF, stating that if VF pursued litigation against the former Directors on behalf of the Association, he would move to disqualify VF as Plaintiff's counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In August 2017, the Washington County Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of the\n   <em>\n    Quatama I\n   </em>\n   defendants. On October 5, 2017, the Association, through its counsel VF, filed this lawsuit in state court, alleging claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, and unlawful trade practices. On January 3, 2018, Defendants timely removed the action to federal court. On May 1, 2018, Wilson, McFerran, and Anderson moved to disqualify VF as counsel for the Association. Shortly thereafter Decatur (as well as McFerran) joined that motion. After receiving the parties' briefs and hearing oral argument, Magistrate Judge Beckerman issued her Opinion and Order, granting Defendants' motion to disqualify Plaintiff's law firm. Plaintiff timely objected, seeking review by the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The VF law firm was retained by the Association \"acting through its duly authorized constituents.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RPC 1.13(a).

Thus, as the Ninth Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   , the \"substantial relationship\" test set forth in RPC 1.9 is inapplicable when the purported former secondary clients (the Moving Defendants) would have had no reason to believe that information they gave to VF would not have been disclosed to the law firm's primary (and continuing) client, the Association.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Based on the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Christensen\n   </em>\n   , the Court concludes that it was contrary to law for the Magistrate Judge to apply the substantial relationship test of RPC 1.9 to the facts presented in this case. The Court, however, is not the slightest bit critical of the Magistrate Judge. The fault lies with Plaintiff. As the Magistrate Judge noted in her Opinion and Order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Here, the Association acknowledges that the current matter is substantially related\n   to\n   <em>\n    Quatama I\n   </em>\n   , that the parties are materially adverse, and that therefore a conflict exists if VF formerly represented the Directors. Thus, the only issue for the Court to decide is whether an attorney-client relationship existed between VF and the Directors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   ECF 38 at 9. Before the Magistrate Judge, the Plaintiff never argued that the substantial relationship test is inapplicable based on the rule of\n   <em>\n    Allegaert\n   </em>\n   adopted by the Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Christensen.\n   </em>\n   Had the Plaintiff done so, perhaps the Magistrate Judge would have reached the same conclusion that the Court now holds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The final matter to address is whether Plaintiff has waived the argument that the substantial relationship test is inapplicable based on the rule of\n   <em>\n    Allegaert\n   </em>\n   adopted by the Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Christensen.\n   </em>\n   As\n   <em>\n    Wright &amp; Miller\n   </em>\n   explain:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   As a general proposition, limiting objections to rulings by magistrate judges on nondispositive matters to arguments that the orders are clearly erroneous or contrary to law is not only mandated by the statute and the rule but also by wise policy. Many of these orders are of very limited importance, and permitting litigants regularly to impose their dissatisfaction with the magistrate judge's decisions on the district judge would create an undue risk of wasteful activity that could frustrate the purposes of the Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Wright &amp; Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 3069. As discussed above, however, whether to grant a motion to disqualify opposing counsel is not of \"very limited importance.\" Indeed, as the Ninth Circuit has recognized, the \"cost and inconvenience to clients\" and the risk from \"misuse of the rules for tactical purposes is significant.\"\n   <em>\n    Optyl Eyewear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"23452\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/760/1045/#p1050\">\n    760 F.2d at 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At bottom, the power to review is necessary to avoid constitutional difficulties, and an absolute prohibition on revision by the district judge creates risks of undermining that essential review authority....

Therefore, we express no opinion on the situation where a firm attempts to represent an outside director who is not a member of the firm in litigation against the corporation.\"\n    <em>\n     Christensen\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545263\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/844/694/#p699\">\n     844 F.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    699 n.8. That qualification, however, is irrelevant to the pending dispute because the VF law firm is representing the Association against a former outside director, not the other way around. The\n    <em>\n     Christensen\n    </em>\n    footnote might apply when a law firm continues to represent an entity's former outside director against the entity that was also the former primary client of the law firm.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    That assumption may be cast into doubt because it does not appear that anyone from the Association apart from the Moving Defendants ever consented to dual representation by VF of both the Association and the Moving Defendants.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    RPC 1.13(f) (requiring consent to dual representation by an appropriate official of the organization other than the individual who is to be represented, or by the shareholders). This is further evidence that there was no dual representation, but for purposes of the pending motion the Court will assume there was.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The Court recognizes that\n    <em>\n     Christensen\n    </em>\n    applied California law regarding the California Rules of Professional Conduct. The Oregon Rules of Professional Conduct, however, are not materially different from the California rules on these issues. Further, no party has presented to the Court any legal authority from either the Oregon Supreme Court or the Oregon Court of Appeals indicating that Oregon would not follow the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n    <em>\n     Christensen\n    </em>\n    and adopt the Second Circuit's rule in\n    <em>\n     Allegaert\n    </em>\n    , and the Court is aware of none. In addition, the D.C. Circuit also appears to follow the\n    <em>\n     Allegaert\n    </em>\n    rule.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nat'l.Souvenir Ctr., Inc., v. Historic Figures, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3794057,57572\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/728/503/\">\n     728 F.2d 503\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 517 (D.C. Cir. 1984).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    The Third Circuit has held that when performing a review under the \"clearly erroneous\" standard for reviewing the factual conclusions of a magistrate judge's nondispositive opinion, a district court may not consider evidence outside the record considered by the magistrate judge.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Haines v.
