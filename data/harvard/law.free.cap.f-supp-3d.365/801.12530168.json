Although the INA does not specify when jurisdiction vests in an immigration judge, federal regulations provide that jurisdiction vests when a \"charging document\" is filed with the immigration court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

(Dkt. 8). Before the Court is Defendant Castro-Gomez's Motion to Reconsider. (Dkt. 41). Castro-Gomez asks the Court to reconsider the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment in this action. (Dkt. 40). Castro-Gomez challenges his prior removal order, in light of the Supreme\n   Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), because it did not specify a time or place for his removal hearing. As a result, Castro-Gomez argues that jurisdiction never vested with the immigration judge, and the removal order was issued\n   <em>\n    ultra vires.\n   </em>\n   After thoroughly reviewing the circumstances of Castro-Gomez's case, the arguments raised by both parties in their briefs, and the relevant law, the Court finds that both Castro-Gomez's motion to reconsider and his motion to dismiss the indictment should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Castro-Gomez was indicted with a single count of illegal reentry into the United States, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). (Indictment, Dkt. 8; Gov't. Resp. Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 35, at 2). Specifically, the Government alleges that Castro-Gomez is a noncitizen who was found in the United States on April 3, 2018, and that Castro-Gomez was previously removed from the United States to Mexico on or about July 30, 2004. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Dkt. 1, at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Castro-Gomez is a citizen of Mexico. (Gov't. Resp., Dkt. 35, at 2). He first came to the United States in 1972. (Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 27, at 2-3). Castro-Gomez became a temporary resident under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (\"IRCA\") in 1988, and in 1991, he was admitted as a lawful permanent resident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). On March 6, 2003, Castro-Gomez was convicted of Assault-Family Violence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment, Dkt. 27-3). His offense was enhanced to a third degree felony based on a previous conviction for Assault-Family Violence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 22.01(b)(2)(A). Castro-Gomez pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years' incarceration. (Judgment, Dkt. 27-3, at 12-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2003, immigration authorities served Castro-Gomez with a notice to appear (\"NTA\") at a removal hearing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NTA, Dkt. 27-2, at 2). The NTA charged that Castro-Gomez was subject to removal under \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii), because he was convicted of an aggravated felony: Assault-Family Violence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NTA, Dkt. 27-2, at 2). The NTA did not name a time or place for the hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the hearing, Castro-Gomez was ordered removed, and he waived appeal. (Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 27, at 4; Gov't Resp., Dkt. 35, at 4; Order, Dkt. 27-4). Castro-Gomez was removed from the United States on July 30, 2004 and advised that he could never again apply for permission to return based on his aggravated felony conviction. (Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 27, at 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Warrant Removal, Dkt. 27-5; Warning Alien Removed, Dkt. 27-6). Castro-Gomez's removal order was reinstated on May 3, 2018, when he was found in the United States. (Order, Dkt. 27-7, at 3-4). It is this removal order that forms the basis of Castro-Gomez's illegal reentry indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Castro-Gomez moved to dismiss the illegal reentry indictment, relying on two recent decisions by the Supreme Court:\n   <em>\n    Sessions v. Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), and\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). Castro-Gomez argued that his pending indictment for illegal reentry must be dismissed because his sole prior removal order was invalid under both\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pereira.\n   </em>\n   (Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 27, at 2). First, he contended that, applying\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   retroactively, his conviction for Assault-Family Violence is not an aggravated felony, he was not deportable as charged, and his deportation violated the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. (Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 27, at 1-2). Second, Castro-Gomez argued that he received an\n   NTA that did not indicate the removal hearing's time or place as required by statute, rendering the removal proceeding invalid under\n   <em>\n    Pereira.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9). The Government filed a response. (Resp. Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 28, 2018, this Court denied Castro-Gomez's motion to dismiss. (Order, Dkt. 40). The Court reasoned that because Castro-Gomez had not exhausted his challenge to the NTA in his earlier deportation proceeding, Castro-Gomez could not collaterally attack his conviction under the statutory requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Order, Dkt. 40, at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Castro-Gomez now asks the Court to reconsider that decision, again re-urging his argument that because the NTA did not state a time and place for his removal hearing, he was not served a valid NTA under\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). (Mot. Reconsider, Dkt. 41). As a result, he contends that the immigration court lacked jurisdiction to order him removed, and the original removal order is invalid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). Castro-Gomez also argues that any attempt to challenge the deficient NTA before the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") is futile, because he has no opportunity to do so in current proceedings before the BIA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). Thus, Castro-Gomez asks the Court to reconsider its order denying his motion to dismiss the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Jara-Favela\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051560\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/686/289/#p302\">\n    686 F.3d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 302 (5th Cir. 2012). Only the second element is at issue here: Castro-Gomez argues that he was never served an NTA, so his removal proceedings are void for want of jurisdiction, and he was never \"previously deported.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Reconsider, Dkt. 41, at 1-2). At the core of Castro-Gomez's motion to dismiss is whether he may collaterally attack the underlying removal order that supports his indictment for illegal reentry in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Castro-Gomez makes two arguments that the Court should reconsider its order\n   denying his motion to dismiss. First, he re-urges his position that an NTA that does not state a time and place is invalid for statutory purposes. (Mot. Reconsider, Dkt. 41, at 1). Castro-Gomez was issued an NTA that did not specify a date, time, or place for his removal proceeding, contrary to the definitional requirements under the INA. And without a valid NTA, Castro-Gomez argues that an immigration court lacks jurisdiction. (Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. 27, at 8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   , 138 S.Ct. at 2115 ) ). Second, he argues that he is unable to make this argument to the BIA in a motion to reopen. Although Castro-Gomez is currently appealing the immigration judge's denial of his motion to reopen to the BIA, Castro-Gomez argues that any attempt to challenge the underlying removal order is futile, and thus is not an available administrative remedy. (Mot. Reconsider, Dkt. 41, at 2, 4-5). The Government argues that Castro-Gomez has not presented any new facts or arguments that were unavailable to him in the underlying motion to dismiss, (Resp. Mot. Reconsider, Dkt. 44, at 4), and that the Court correctly applied the statutory requirements under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) in finding that Castro-Gomez had not exhausted his argument before the BIA, (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Court disagrees, and finds it necessary to reconsider Castro-Gomez's motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A defendant charged with illegal reentry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   has a due process right to challenge the removal order upon which the charge is predicated in the criminal proceeding before the district court.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In order to collaterally attack a prior removal order in a criminal proceeding, a defendant typically must demonstrate that: \"(1) the removal hearing was fundamentally unfair; (2) the hearing effectively eliminated the right of the alien to challenge the hearing by means of judicial review of the order; and (3) the procedural deficiencies caused the alien actual prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Under \u00a7 1326(d), a noncitizen may not challenge the validity of a removal order unless the noncitizen establishes that: \"(1) the alien exhausted any administrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief against the order; (2) the deportation proceeding at which the order was issued improperly deprived the alien of the opportunity for judicial review; and (3) the entry of the order was fundamentally\n   unfair.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).

But here, the immigration judge lacked jurisdiction over Castro-Gomez's prior removal proceedings. As a result, that removal order is void. Without a prior removal order, the Government cannot prove an essential element of its case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Castro-Gomez's Motion to Reconsider the Denial of Castro-Gomez's Motion to Dismiss, (Dkt. 41), is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Castro-Gomez's Motion to Dismiss, (Dkt. 27), is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the indictment in this matter, (Dkt. 8), is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   This case is\n   <strong>\n    CLOSED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    The Court also found that since Castro-Gomez's case was closed when he was removed to Mexico in 2004, the change in law announced in\n    <em>\n     Dimaya\n    </em>\n    did not retroactively render his removal fundamentally unfair, and thus cannot support a due process violation. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 8-9). Castro-Gomez does not ask the Court to reconsider its order denying his motion to dismiss the indictment in light of\n    <em>\n     Dimaya.\n    </em>\n    (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot.
