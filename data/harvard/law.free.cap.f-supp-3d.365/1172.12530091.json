As discussed, Wichita Destination has alleged facts sufficient to plausibly state an alter ego claim,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   that upholding the fiction of separate corporate identities would promote injustice. On the facts of this case, to the extent that Wichita Destination also bases its claim on allegations of fraudulent conduct, Focus Hospitality can learn details about the allegations through discovery and will suffer no undue burden as a result thereof.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    UNA Worldwide, LLC v.
