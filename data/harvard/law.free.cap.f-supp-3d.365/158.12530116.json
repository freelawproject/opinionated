Here, the named plaintiff, Lindsey\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dias (\"Dias\"), challenges the removal of her suit from the Massachusetts Superior Court on the ground that the Defendants, Genesco, Inc. and Hatworld, Inc. (collectively, \"Lids\"), miscalculated the damages that her suit seeks. Pl.'s Mot. Remand (\"Mot. Remand\") 1, ECF No. 11. Because the parties' briefing does not reflect the Clarification Act's standards for analyzing the amount in controversy, this Court ORDERS further briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This action arises out of Dias's employment as a store manager at a North Attleboro, Massachusetts retail store, Lids, from January 2015 until September 2015. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4, ECF No. 1-1. In March 2018, Dias filed a putative class action complaint in the Massachusetts Superior Court alleging that Lids failed to pay store managers overtime.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. Dias claims this conduct violated the Massachusetts Overtime Law (the \"Overtime Law\"), Massachusetts General Laws chapter 151, section 1A, and seeks back pay, treble damages, interest, and attorney's fees and costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.

Notice Removal \u00b6 6, ECF No. 1. On April 20, 2018, Dias moved to remand, arguing that her damages fell short of the amount required for diversity jurisdiction. Mot. Remand 1. Although Dias and Lids briefed Dias's motion to remand, neither Dias nor Lids cited the Clarification Act's standards for calculating the amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

This Court heard oral argument on Dias's motion on July 23, 2018 and took the matter under advisement. Electronic Clerk's Notes, ECF No. 29. On September 19, 2018, the parties jointly moved to stay the case for 45 days. Joint Mot. Stay 1, ECF No. 32. The Court granted the motion and administratively closed the case on September 20, 2018.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dias suggests that this Court remand this action to the Superior Court because the amount in controversy does not exceed $75,000. Mot. Remand 1, 3. In response, Lids posits that if Dias were to succeed in her suit, she would be entitled to damages totaling more than $75,000, accounting for the attorney's fees she incurred throughout the suit.

Amount in Controversy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court, at this juncture, cannot make the requisite findings of fact to rule on Dias's motion to remand for several reasons. Dias and Lids neglected to cite the Clarification Act's procedure for assessing whether the case involves a sufficient amount in controversy. The parties erred not by referring to the reasonable probability standard, but by failing to recognize that the Clarification Act requires the Court to make factual findings when the parties dispute the amount in controversy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot.

Indeed, in a pre-\n   <em>\n    Dart\n   </em>\n   case, the First Circuit ruled that it need not defer to the district court's determination of the amount in controversy where the district court made no factual findings at all.\n   <em>\n    Romulus\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    CVS Pharmacy, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266257\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/67/#p82\">\n    770 F.3d 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 82 (1st Cir. 2014) (explaining that a district court may not simply discredit amount-in-controversy evidence as \"speculative\" without pointing to factual reasons why it is so).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court acknowledges that Dias controverts whether, as matter of law, the Court ought ever consider prospective attorney's fees in deciding whether a removed complaint meets the amount in controversy.

The Court reserves ruling on this issue but makes the following two observations:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, if the Court were to rule that it could consider prospective attorney's fees, such a ruling might not provide much succor to removing defendants, who would still carry the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence or reasonable probability, that the case meets the amount-in-controversy requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    Dart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12593418\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/547/#p554\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 553-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, the Court wonders whether the possible short-circuiting of this litigation (thus reducing expenses) may count against the amount in controversy, as a reduced possible recovery gained by a partial grant of summary judgment would not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14AA Charles\n   Alan Wright, Arthur R.

Dias frames the issue differently; she says that the work conducted after removal cannot count in the amount-in-controversy calculation. Pl.'s Reply 3 n.3.

Take, for instance, a complaint for money damages that omits a specific damages demand filed in a state that neither prescribes nor proscribes,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    permits, a damages demand. As such, the complaint would neither be for nonmonetary relief, nor would it be filed where state practice forbids a demand for a specific sum.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(2)(A). Determining the source of the amount in controversy pursuant to the Clarification Act then raises a few questions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    For one, can the second exception in subsection 1446(c)(2)(A)(ii) apply when the complaint lacks a specific demand? The notice of removal may supply the amount in controversy when the complaint seeks a money judgment but \"State practice ... permits recovery of damages in excess of the amount demanded.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 1446(c)(2)(A)(ii).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Two readings of this provision appear to exist, and both readings pose possible problems for courts in this scenario. First, the provision might allow reference to the notice of removal's amount in controversy where the state allows a greater recovery than the specific amount that the complaint demands. This reading raises the possibility that no comparator exists for a court to use to decide whether the plaintiff could recover damages \"in excess of the amount demanded.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Alternatively, a court could treat the complaint as demanding \"zero\" damages, thereby allowing the court to review any such complaint removed from a jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Second, subsection 1446(c)(2)(A)(ii) might refer to whether state rules in general permit a plaintiff to recover greater damages than those sought in a complaint. Put another way, the court's analysis of whether it could look to the notice of removal would turn on the state's civil procedure rules and practices as opposed to the demand in the plaintiff's complaint. Yet there may be a statutory lacuna when state practice binds the plaintiff to the damages demand in the original complaint. In this case, if the plaintiff had not included a damages demand, the Court would seem to be without any statutory procedure for reviewing whether the complaint meets the amount in controversy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The Court would then face a tough decision as to what steps to take in the event that the case falls into a lacuna in the Clarification Act. Sections 1441 and 1446 seem to point in different directions: section 1441 states that defendants \"may\" remove a case when the local federal district court has original jurisdiction, whereas section 1446(c) describes the procedure for determining whether the district court has diversity jurisdiction over a removed case. When section 1446(c) does not provide a procedure, that absence may deprive defendants of their section 1441 right to remove the case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Some authority seems to support that result. For one, a defendant's right to remove \"is entirely a creature of statute,\" not the Constitution, so Congress could validly restrict the universe of cases subject to removal.\n    <em>\n     Syngenta Crop Prot., Inc.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Henson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9190528\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/28/#p32\">\n     537 U.S. 28\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 32,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9190528\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/28/#p32\">\n     123 S.Ct. 366\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9190528\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/28/#p32\">\n     154 L.Ed.2d 368\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2002) (citing\n    <em>\n     Great N.

May 10, 2013). While that might be the best approach where the Clarification Act did not alter past practice, the Court observes that past practice may have limited value in determining how, if at all, a court ought determine the amount in controversy when the action does not conform to the conditions that the Clarification Act governs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The Court need not resolve such complicated questions here. Because the Clarification Act refers to \"State practice,\" the Court takes the statute to instruct it to analyze Massachusetts practice generally, as opposed to this Massachusetts court complaint specifically. This Court thus rules that the Clarification Act allows it to substitute a removing defendant's amount in controversy even where the complaint seeks a money judgment because Massachusetts practice \"permits recovery of damages in excess of the amount demanded.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(2)(A)(ii).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    First, Massachusetts does permit a demand for a specific sum. While Massachusetts generally forbids specific damages demands in the complaint, the Commonwealth makes an exception for liquidated damages and specific demands that the plaintiff supports with an affidavit.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, \u00a7 13B. Consequently, Massachusetts permits a demand for a specific sum, even though it regulates the cases in which a plaintiff can make such a demand.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Second, Massachusetts permits recovery in excess of the damages demanded in the complaint. Massachusetts Rule of Civil Procedure 54(c) provides that \"every final judgment shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded such relief in his pleadings.\" Only where the plaintiff wins a default judgment will a Massachusetts court hold a plaintiff to the specific sum he requested in his complaint.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    This Court thus may consider the amount in controversy propounded by Lids's notice of removal so long as it \"finds, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the amount in controversy exceeds [$75,000].\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(2)(B).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
