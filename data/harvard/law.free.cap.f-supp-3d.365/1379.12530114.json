Nevertheless, for the reasons discussed below, if Commerce determined that Plaintiff's questionnaire response was deficient in some regard, or that Commerce needed clarification of the response regarding the adjustments, the agency should have issued a supplemental questionnaire to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Commerce stated that it was denying certain post-sale price adjustments in the\n   <em>\n    Preliminary Results\n   </em>\n   because Jindal's questionnaire responses \"did not provide information on any of the [ ] factors\" laid out in the\n   <em>\n    Final Modification\n   </em>\n   .

However, this placement of the burden comes with an understanding that a respondent has sufficient notice of what information is considered necessary to allow it to meet its burden. Although the preamble to the\n   <em>\n    Final Modification\n   </em>\n   contained a list of factors Commerce may consider to determine whether to grant a post-sale price adjustment, Commerce indicated that it would apply these factors on a case-by-case basis in light of the evidence and arguments on the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Final Modification\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2015%2C641\">\n    81 Fed.

Under these circumstances, in which Jindal responded to Commerce's questions regarding price adjustments and attempted to address the\n   <em>\n    Final Modification\n   </em>\n   factors, Commerce was obligated to inform Jindal of the nature of any deficiency and, to the extent practicable, provide Jindal with an opportunity to remedy or explain the deficiency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The court is unpersuaded by the Government's argument that section 1677m(d) is inapplicable because Commerce did not specifically request Plaintiff to establish entitlement to these post-sale price adjustments and, thus, Plaintiff's response did not fail to comply with a request for information.

In Section B of the initial questionnaire, Commerce requested that Jindal \"report the unit value of each rebate given,\" \"explain [its] policy and practice for granting rebates,\" and \"describe the terms and conditions of each\n   rebate program and when the terms and conditions are established in the sales process.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sec.
