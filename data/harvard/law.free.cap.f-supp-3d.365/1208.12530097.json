(respectively Doc. 40, &amp; 28), and Lincoln's former motion for summary judgment (Doc. 12) which has now been superseded. This action involves an employer provided insurance policy and is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"ERISA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mr. Harris broke his leg and his leg later became infected, would not heal and had to be amputated. He filed a claim under two group accidental dismemberment insurance policies issued by Lincoln. The policies cover accidental dismemberment and exclude coverage where disease was a contributing cause of the loss. Lincoln denied the claim asserting that Mr. Harris's injury resulted from a bone disease brought on by previous radiation treatment he had undergone to treat cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Harris filed a two count Complaint against Lincoln including: (i) a claim for dismemberment benefits; and (ii) a claim asserting wrongful withholding of documents related to Lincoln's denial of the dismemberment claim. Both Lincoln and Mr. Harris have each separately moved for summary judgment on both claims. (respectively, Doc. 40, &amp; 28.) Lincoln's recently filed reformatted motion (Doc. 40), replaces its previously filed motion (Doc. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons stated below, Lincoln's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 12) is due to be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as superseded, Lincoln's Reformatted Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 40) is due to be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED,\n   </strong>\n   and Mr. Harris's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 28) is due to be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(\"QinetiQ\"). AR 000018, AR 000105.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The policies included one identified as \"Group Insurance Policy No. 00001018133 Providing Life Insurance Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance Dependent Life Insurance,\" AR 000018, which described itself as providing \"Basic Life and AD &amp; D Insurance\" (the \"Basic Policy\"), AR 000023. The other policy is titled \"Group Insurance Policy No. GL 000403002643 Providing Voluntary Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance\" (the \"Voluntary Policy\"). AR 000111.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Basic Policy provides a dismemberment benefit for accidental injuries. AR 000065. The Basic Policy, however, excludes coverage of those losses that resulted from other contributing causes including disease. AR 000065. The Basic Policy provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    DEATH OR DISMEMBERMENT BENEFIT FOR AN INSURED PER\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    SON.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Company will pay the benefit listed below if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) an Insured Person sustains an accidental bodily injury while insured under this provision; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (2) that injury directly causes one of the following losses within 365 days after the date of the accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    The loss must result directly from the injury and from no other causes.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    LIMITATIONS.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Benefits are not payable for any loss to which a contributing cause is\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    disease\n   </em>\n   , bodily or mental infirmity, or medical or surgical treatment of disease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   AR 000065 (underlined emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Similarly, the Voluntary Policy provides a dismemberment benefit for accidental injuries. AR 000130. The Voluntary Policy also excludes coverage of those losses that resulted from other contributing causes including disease. AR 000137. The Voluntary Policy provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    DEATH OR DISMEMBERMENT BENEFIT FOR AN INSURED PERSON.\n   </strong>\n   The Company will pay the benefit listed below if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (1) an Insured Person sustains an accidental bodily injury while insured under this provision; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (2) that injury directly causes one of the following losses within 365 days after the date of the accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    The loss must result directly from the injury and from no other causes.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    EXCLUSIONS.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    No benefit will be paid for loss resulting from\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (6) sickness,\n   <em>\n    disease\n   </em>\n   or bodily infirmity; except for:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (a) a bacterial infection resulting from an accidental cut or wound ; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (b) the accidental ingestion of a poisonous food substance; ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   AR 000130, AR 000137 (underlined emphasis added).

Dr. Holt's inconclusive letter does not negate the fact that radiation necrosis could have been a substantial cause. Moreover, her letter conflicts with her earlier conclusive diagnosis of Mr. Harris's condition. Mr. Harris fails to provide a basis for ignoring or discounting Dr. Reddy's, Dr. Welkert's, and Dr. Grantham's opinions. Thus, Mr. Harris's argument to the extent it relies on Dr. Maples's progress notes (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 51, p. 20-21 (citing AR 003636) ), and Dr. Holt's February 26, 2016, letter (Doc. 51, p. 22 (citing AR 002378), 23-24, 28-29; Doc. 42, p. 13-14) fails to demonstrate that Lincoln's decision was\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   wrong in light of the countervailing opinions of Mr. Harris's other treating physicians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Viewing the record as a whole, the Court lacks a basis to conclude that on this evidence Lincoln was wrong when it denied Mr. Harris's dismemberment claim, because his pre-existing radiation necrosis was, according to his treating physicians, a substantial cause of his loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Mr. Harris argues that the Lincoln's decision was wrong, because Lincoln's nurse reviewers \"were either never informed of Mr. Harris [sic] testimony or ignored it.\" (Doc. 51, p. 20.) Mr. Harris asserts that Lincoln did not provide Mr. Harris's \"testimony\" to its employee reviewer, because (1) the manner in which Nurse Sucha and Nurse Vrbka described\n   Mr. Harris's accident differs from the manner in which Mr. Harris described his accident; and (2) Nurse Vrbka did not list his declaration in her review.

Assuming this is true, Mr. Harris's argument fails to identify how Lincoln's denial of benefits was \"wrong\" in light of Dr. Holt's alleged failure to question him about the circumstances of his break or her alleged failure to permit him to correct errors in medical records. To the extent that Mr. Harris believes that Dr. Holt failed to adequately diagnosis him, Mr. Harris was certainly free to retain other medical providers and submit that evidence to Lincoln in support of his claim. Moreover, the record shows that Mr. Harris informed his medical providers as to the circumstances of his accident. AR 000266-67 (\"I have consistently told my physicians that this is what happened.\"). Given that he informed his physicians as to the circumstances of his accident, it is reasonable that Dr. Holt would not need to question Mr. Harris as to how his accident occurred. Furthermore, Mr. Harris provides no legal basis for his argument that his medical providers should have permitted him to correct medical records regarding the causation of his loss. Mr. Harris does not contend to be a medical provider and appears to have no professional training which would give him a basis upon which he would be professionally justified to correct the medical opinions of his treating physicians. Finally, Mr. Harris does not explain how the particular circumstances of Mr. Harris's leg fracture, whether it was from putting his foot down or having it stop suddenly, would alter his treating physicians' findings that the leg fracture was caused by radiation necrosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Mr. Harris also argues that \"Lincoln is wrong as a matter of law because it relies upon the underlying suggestion that the injury must be the 'sole cause' of the injury for benefits to be paid.\" (Doc. 51, p. 25-27;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 42, p 10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bradshaw\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=707%20Fed.%20Appx.%20599\">\n    707 Fed.Appx. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   606-07 ;\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9151599\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/389/1179/#p1183\">\n    389 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1183 ).)

Lincoln's reliance on the opinions of these physicians does not constitute a failure on Lincoln's part to consider how the injury occurred or a demonstration of disregard to Mr. Harris's declaration of his other physicians.

(Doc. 51, p. 21-22.) Mr. Harris's argument relies upon an unproven factual assumption that Lincoln did not provide its reviewers with his declaration or Dr. Maples's opinion. The failure of Lincoln's employees to recite the facts of how Mr. Harris broke his leg, consistent with the manner he provided in his declaration,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   n. 16; AR 002597; AR 000170, did, however, demonstrate a lack of diligence on the part of Lincoln and its employees to review that declaration. Yet, his declaration could not be construed to demonstrate persuasive evidence of medical causation worthy of the same weight afforded to that of a medical professional. Lincoln's employees' reliance on the opinions of Mr. Harris's medical providers over his own declaration statement was reasonable. Thus, Mr. Harris's contention, with regards to his own declaration, has little bearing on whether Lincoln had reasonable grounds to support its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Thus, even if the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of Lincoln's decision demonstrated that Lincoln's decision was wrong, other reasonable grounds supported Lincoln's decision. Nevertheless, the Court finds that Lincoln's determination of benefits was not\n   wrong, but rather it was\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   correct.

(Doc. 51, p. 32.) Mr. Harris's assertion is a mischaracterization of the Policies. The Policies grant Lincoln authority to administer \"claims.\" Thus, his argument, premised on a misrepresenting the Policies' terms, lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Mr. Harris argues that Lincoln is the Plan Administrator, because \"[o]nly Lincoln has the authority to establish and enforce procedures for administering the policies....\" (Doc. 51, p. 32.) Mr. Harris fails to prove or even attempt to demonstrate the argument's underlying assumption that \"only\" Lincoln has this authority. The Court need not search the record to find evidence to support Mr. Harris's claim for him. Given that the argument is premised on an unproven assumption, Mr. Harris's argument lacks persuasive force. Regardless, even if Mr. Harris had proven this assumption, Section 1002(16)(A)(1) does not define an \"administrator\" as someone with sole authority over establishing and enforcing policy administration procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Mr. Harris argues that the Summary Plan Description information is inapplicable because: \"The policies are the instruments that govern the operation of the Plans the [Summary Plan Descriptions]'s expressly state so.\" (Doc. 51, p. 32 (citing AR 000107; AR 000166).) The Summary Plan Descriptions state: \"This Summary Plan Description is only intended to provide an outline of the Plan's benefits. The Plan Document will govern if there is any discrepancy between the information contained in this Description and the Plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   AR 000107; AR 000166. Mr. Harris fails to identify any discrepancy in the plan documents with regards to the identification of the Plan Administrator that would make the identification of QinetiQ as Plan Administrator inapplicable or questionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Mr. Harris also argues that the Summary Plans Descriptions \"create an issue as to whether more than one person has been designated as an administrator....\" (Doc. 51, p. 32-33.) He relies on language in the Summary Plan Descriptions that state: \"The Lincoln National Life Insurance Company has the sole discretionary authority to determine eligibility and to administer claims in accord with its interpretation of the policy provisions on the Plan Administrator's behalf.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing AR 000107; AR 000166).) Mr. Harris has not cited any authority for the proposition that Lincoln's determination and eligibility and administration of claims makes Lincoln the Plan Administrator especially in this context where the Plan Administrator has been designated as QinetiQ. In essence, Mr. Harris is arguing that this policy language makes Lincoln a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   plan administrator. But, that argument fails because Lincoln is not Mr. Harris's employer and the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   plan administrator doctrine only applies to employers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oliver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3615788\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/497/1181/#p1195\">\n    497 F.3d at 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Mr. Harris makes another variation of the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   plan administrator argument stating that: \"Lincoln's exclusive control over the policies and the payment of benefits when coupled with its financial responsibility clearly support the finding that Lincoln is a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   administrator.\" (Doc. 51, p. 34-36;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 51, p. 37 (arguing that QinetiQ is a \"nominal administrator\").)

The Court, however, chooses not to rely on these consulting nurses in reviewing the cause of Mr. Harris's loss, because as employees of Lincoln they had no incentive to provide an independent medical review of his claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-235\">\n    Lincoln acknowledges that these nurses were Lincoln employees, but also argues that they were independent. (Doc. 54, p. 15.) Lincoln provided a declaration of Thomas Vargo, Lincoln's Director of Risk. (Doc. 46-1.) In his declaration, Mr. Vargo asserts that: \"Lincoln maintains its life claims department and appeals unit as separate and independent entities[;]\" \"Each decision-maker in Lincoln's appeals unit is charged with making an independent assessment of the adverse benefits determination based on the relevant provisions in the governing policy and upon all of the information submitted, considered, and generated during the claims process[;]\" Lincoln \"does not compensate claims and appeals department employees based on the outcome of claims, in order to reduce potential bias, promote accuracy and ensure a full and fair review of life/AD &amp; D claims[;]\" \"Lincoln does not provide financial or other incentives to its employees to deny or close claims[;]\" \"Employees in Lincoln's claims and appeals units are paid fixed salaries and they may be eligible for an annual bonus[;]\" \"Annual bonuses are based on the overall financial performance of Lincoln and its related entities for all areas of Lincoln's business[;]\" \"The consulting nurses are not given any authority to make claims decisions.\" (Doc. 46-1, p. 2-3.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-236\">\n    Lincoln, however, provides no authority that such working conditions make a Lincoln employee independent of Lincoln. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 54, p. 15.) To the contrary, these consulting nurses are admittedly Lincoln employees and their compensation is structured in such a way to encourage them to recommend the denial of claims. Given that their bonuses are based on the overall financial performance of the company, they have an incentive to deny benefits that the company would pay out so that Lincoln will have a better financial performance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    In her Clinical Response, Nurse Sucha wrote: \"The records indicate the claimant took a step and heard a snap, and then fell.

These statements are consistent with Mr. Harris's own initial description of his injury, and Mr. Harris is correct that these descriptions do not reflect his description of his injury as he described it in his declaration.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    AR 000266-67.
