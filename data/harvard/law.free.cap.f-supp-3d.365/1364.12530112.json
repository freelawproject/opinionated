Reg. at 45,404 ;\n   <em>\n    CVD Order\n   </em>\n   , 73 Fed. Reg. at 45,405. From the outset, remand is required for Commerce to address Carlson's argument that the merchandising bar and adjustable welded mounting bar kit are outside of the scope based on the lack of a uniform cross-section. Although Commerce is correct that \"[p]roducts that meet the description of subject merchandise in the scope are covered unless explicitly excluded from the scope,\" Final Scope Ruling at 7-8, Commerce incorrectly assumed that Carlson's products met the description of subject merchandise and then proceeded to consider whether the scope contained exclusionary language based on further processing or end use,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8 (\"[A]ny exclusion\n   <em>\n    for [Carlson's] LWR pipes and tubes\n   </em>\n   would have to be clearly articulated.\") (emphasis added). Commerce, thus, did not consider the correct question:\n   <em>\n    Do Carlson's merchandising bar and adjustable welded mounting bar kit products, as imported, meet the description of the scope notwithstanding their lack of a uniform cross-section\n   </em>\n   ? Without more, the court cannot ensure that Commerce has not interpreted the scope of the\n   <em>\n    Orders\n   </em>\n   \"in a manner contrary to its terms.\"\n   <em>\n    Eckstrom Indus.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11092815\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/254/1068/#p1071\">\n    254 F.3d at 1072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant's assertion that Commerce's consideration of this argument and rationale for dismissing it are discernable is not persuasive. Commerce's statement that \"the scope of the\n   <em>\n    Orders\n   </em>\n   does not limit coverage based on whether products have undergone further processing,\n   <em>\n    such as perforation\n   </em>\n   , either before importation or after importation,\" Final Scope Ruling at 8 (emphasis added), provides no indication that Commerce considered the extent to which products must exhibit a rectangular or square cross-section in order to be covered by the plain language of the scope. This is a distinct issue that is not encompassed by Commerce's consideration of the degree to which products may be further processed while still being in scope. Defendant's assertion that the scope requires products to exhibit a rectangular cross-section \"in most parts\" is simply a\n   <em>\n    post hoc\n   </em>\n   attempt to interpret the scope language, using language that does not appear in the scope, which is impermissible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

Commerce asserted that Carlson's products are not \"outside of the scope of the\n   <em>\n    Orders\n   </em>\n   because they may be used, or are intended to be used, in 'certain finished components of refrigerated merchandising and display structures.' \" Final Scope Ruling at 8. Carlson argued, however, that its products\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   \"certain finished components of refrigerated merchandising and display structures,\" Scope Req. at 1, and, thus, consisted of \"\n   <em>\n    downstream products\n   </em>\n   dedicated to particular uses as components of refrigerated merchandising and display structures,\" Suppl. Scope Req. at 9 (emphasis added). Carlson did not argue that its products are outside of the scope based on their end-use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 9. For that reason, Commerce's-and, by extension, the Government's-reliance on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit's holding that \"end-use restrictions do not apply to [antidumping duty orders] unless the [ ] order at issue includes clear exclusionary language\" is unavailing. Final Scope Ruling at 8 &amp; n.60 (quoting\n   <em>\n    King Supply\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049389\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/1343/#p1348\">\n    674 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1349 ); Def.'s Resp. at 12 (same).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Commerce's conclusory assessment of the (k)(1) factors does not save its determination.

Defendant's assertion that the petitioners' listing of potential end-uses reflects an intention to include downstream products,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. at 16, is speculative, at best.

The ITC's discussion of the types of end-use products in which LWR pipe and tube is used is not reasonably read to suggest that all LWR pipe and tube further manufactured for one of the identified uses remains within the scope no matter the downstream product's shape or the degree of further manufacturing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Commerce's scope determination is remanded for reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In accordance with the foregoing, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Commerce's Final Scope Ruling is remanded to the agency for further consideration in accordance with the terms of this opinion; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that the agency shall file its redetermination on remand on or before June 3, 2019; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that subsequent proceedings shall be governed by USCIT Rule 56.2(h) ; and it is further\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that any comments or responsive comments must not exceed 6,000 words.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The administrative record filed in connection with the Final Scope Ruling is divided into a Public Administrative Record (\"PR\"), ECF No. 12-2, and a Confidential Administrative Record (\"CR\"), ECF No. 12-1.

Because Commerce did not, the logical reading of the\n    <em>\n     Orders\n    </em>\n    ' scope is that covered products must only form a rectangle in most parts.\"). Preliminarily, when scope language is ambiguous, the law requires Commerce to interpret the language using the sources set forth in\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.225\">\n     19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.225\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (k).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Meridian Prods.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277944\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/851/1375/#p1381\">\n     851 F.3d at 1381\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It is not the Government's role-in litigation-to interpret ambiguous scope language in the first instance. Moreover, although Commerce did not explicitly include a uniform cross-section requirement, it did provide for a \"rectangular (including square) cross section.\"\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     AD Order\n    </em>\n    , 73 Fed. Reg. at 45,404. The court notes that the HTSUS subheadings referenced in the scope language are contained in Chapter 73 of the HTSUS. As Plaintiff points out, the Explanatory Notes to Chapter 73 describe \"tubes and pipes,\" as,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , \"[c]oncentric hollow products, of\n    <em>\n     uniform cross-section\n    </em>\n    .\" World Customs Organization, Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System, Explanatory Notes 4th Ed.

Thus, Commerce's inclusion of Chapter 73 tariff provisions, even if provided for convenience and, thus, not dispositive, undermines Defendant's argument that Commerce did not intend for covered products to have a uniform cross-section.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The scope at issue in\n    <em>\n     King Supply\n    </em>\n    covered \"carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings ...\n    <em>\n     used to\n    </em>\n    join sections in piping systems where conditions require permanent, welded connections.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049389\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/1343/#p1348\">\n     674 F.3d at 1346\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citation omitted) (emphasis added). The plaintiff argued that its butt-weld pipe fittings were excluded from the scope because they were used for purposes other than those stated in the scope.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049389\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/1343/#p1348\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049389\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/674/1343/#p1348\">\n     at 1347\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citation omitted).

This case is distinct from\n    <em>\n     King Supply\n    </em>\n    because, here, the issue is whether Carlson's further manufactured products continue to meet the physical description of the products described by the scope, not whether they are excluded based on their use.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
