Here, the agreement provides that benefits continue \"so long as the individual remains retired from the Company or receives a Surviving Spouse's benefit, notwithstanding the expiration of this Agreement.\" In other words, retired employees are entitled to lifetime benefits even after the agreement expires. This language is sufficient to vest the benefits provided by the agreement, absent language to the contrary, such as a reservation of rights clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants argue that the agreement contains language limiting the lifetime benefits provided in section 6. Defendants point out that section 6 is conditioned by the phrase \"except as the Company and the Union may agree otherwise.\" Defendants argue that this exception works to incorporate section 7 which permits unilateral termination of the agreement. Despite section 7's provision for termination of the \"agreement,\" Defendants repeatedly assert that section 7 provides for termination of \"coverage\" or \"benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 30 at 1 (\"The agreement here says nothing about vesting. Instead it establishes 'the right of either party ... to terminate' health-insurance\n   <em>\n    benefits.\n   </em>\n   \") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (\"The termination provision then reiterates the default setting-coverage will continue until expiration 'and thereafter'-but then specifies when\n   <em>\n    coverage\n   </em>\n   may be ended.\") (emphasis added). But section 7 does not mention termination of benefits, only termination of the agreement. And the Supreme Court has held that benefits that vest during the term of an agreement, \"as a general rule, survive termination of the agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Litton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107959\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/190/#p207\">\n    501 U.S. at 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107959\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/190/#p207\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants do not identify any other \"agreement\" by the parties to terminate benefits that could serve as an \"exception\" to the lifetime benefits provided by section 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants contend, however, that the Seventh Circuit has held that termination provisions like section 7 serve to limit \"lifetime\" benefits to the term of the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy v.

But contrary to Defendants' argument, the provisions at issue in those cases are different from the termination provision at issue here.
