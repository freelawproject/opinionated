BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   action concerns Defendant One Fossilized Tyrannosaurus Bataar Skull (the \"Bataar Skull\"), a skull fossil of the dinosaur species Tyrannosaurus Bataar, or Tarbosaurus Bataar, a close relative of the well-known Tyrannosaurus Rex. Bataars were large carnivorous animals that lived in present day Asia approximately seventy million years ago.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first known Bataar fossils were discovered in the Nemegt Formation of the Gobi Desert in the 1940's. The Nemegt formation is a two-thousand square mile area of the Gobi Desert-entirely contained within the borders of Mongolia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Over the past decade, the illicit trade of Mongolian Bataar fossils gained notoriety. In June 2012, the Government initiated a high-profile judicial forfeiture proceeding against a full Bataar Skeleton offered for sale at an auction in New York City. Later that year, the Government arrested the seller, Eric Prokopi, on charges associated with illegal dinosaur fossil smuggling. Prokopi eventually pled guilty and helped the Government identify a number of Mongolian fossils later recovered through uncontested civil forfeiture proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In this case, Richard Rolater co-owns a store named \"By Nature Gallery\" with Francis Rolater and Claimant. Richard Rolater deals in fossils, including imported Mongolian Fossils. Notably, in 2012, Rolater considered purchasing the Bataar Skeleton put up for auction by Prokopi in New\n   York City. In January 2012, By Nature Gallery purchased Defendant Bataar Skull from a trader named Brock Sisson. Sisson previously purchased the skull from a trader named George Heslep. Claimant Godwin ultimately purchased Defendant Bataar Skull from By Nature Gallery in February 2012 for a price of $ 190,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 15, 2012, the Government received a tip about a Bataar Skull displayed for sale at By Nature Gallery and began an investigation. On June 26, 2012, investigators interviewed Rolater-who provided information about five or six Bataar skulls sold by By Nature Gallery-and demanded he turn over records of other fossils imported into the United States. On July 18, 2012, Rolater emailed the Government 335 pages of records relating to various fossils sold at By Nature Gallery. The Government confirmed receipt of the records the same day. Included in those records were ten pages of records relating to the Defendant Bataar Skull.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On or about July 20, 2012, the Government's investigator and Rolater discussed the July 18 document production. Then, on July 23, 2012, Rolater emailed the investigator a list of nine bates ranges identifying page numbers of documents in the production that specifically related to nine different fossils. On August 1, 2012, the Government interviewed Rolater again and searched his home pursuant to a warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 23, 2013, the United States obtained a warrant and seized Defendant Bataar Skull from Claimant's home in Wichita Falls, Texas. In March 2014, Rolater entered a guilty plea on a charge of conspiracy to smuggle Chinese fossils into the United States contrary to statute. The Government thereafter seized a Bataar skull, as well as a Gallimimus foot, from Rolater's residence in Colarado and obtained a forfeiture judgment by default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 1, 2017, the Government filed this\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   asset forfeiture proceeding against Defendant Bataar Skull under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure G. Compl. 1, ECF No. 1.

An NSPA violation includes three requirements: (1) transportation in interstate or foreign commerce of property; (2) valued at $ 5,000 or more; (3) with knowledge that the property was stolen, converted, or taken by fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202314\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 2315 ;\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740136\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/84/\">\n    648 F.3d at 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Pl.'s Br. 39, ECF No. 50. The Government also argues the value of the Defendant Bataar is well over the $ 5,000 threshold required by the NSPA because the skull was appraised at $ 225,000 and sold to Godwin for $ 190,000.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740136\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/648/84/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Claimant concedes that the Bataar Skull was transported in foreign or interstate commerce and does not refute that the Bataar skull is valued at more than $ 5,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. 37-41, ECF No. 56.

Pl.'s Br. 33-45, ECF No. 50. The Government relies on the fact that all known Bataar fossils originated from the Nemegt Basin in Mongolia, that Mongolia asserts ownership over fossils found within its borders, and that the Mongolian government did not grant permission to export the Defendant Bataar Skull.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-38. Therefore, the Government argues, the Defendant Bataar Skull must necessarily be stolen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Claimant argues that the Government cannot prove that the Bataar Skull was stolen or that it was transported with knowledge that it was stolen.

Here, the totality of the circumstances established probable cause for forfeiture because the Government found a privately owned Bataar skull within the United States, Bataar discoveries are common in Mongolia, no confirmed Bataar skull discoveries have occurred outside of Mongolia, and Mongolia asserts a claim of ownership over Bataar skulls found within its borders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. 1-3, ECF No. 53 (\"One such Bataar died in what is now known as the Nemegt Formation, a portion of the Gobi desert that is located in Mongolia, and its fossilized skull is the defendant in this case.\"); Def.'s Resp.
