Conclusion...27\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In May 2015, the District of Columbia-area health insurer CareFirst announced that it had suffered a data breach that compromised the personal information of millions of its policyholders. Plaintiffs in this putative class action are among those whose data was accessed. They seek compensation for the breach through both tort- and contract-based claims under District of Columbia law, as well as statutory claims under several D.C., Maryland, and Virginia consumer-protection laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Common to all of plaintiffs' claims is the assertion that they have been injured by CareFirst's failure to protect their personal information from exposure. The alleged injuries do not, for the most part, involve actual misuse of their personal information. Plaintiffs instead claim that the data breach resulted in an increased\n   <em>\n    risk\n   </em>\n   of identity theft and the need for prophylactic expenditures-on credit monitoring services and the like-to reduce that risk. They also contend that CareFirst's failure to protect their personal information resulted in a contractual injury because they did not receive the full value of the policies they purchased. And they say they have suffered emotional distress in dealing with the breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court previously dismissed plaintiffs' claims for lack of Article III standing, finding that they had failed to allege a non-speculative injury-in-fact. The D.C. Circuit reversed and remanded. CareFirst now moves to dismiss the operative second amended complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court will grant the motion in large part. After briefly recounting the factual and procedural background, the Court will begin by confirming that it has diversity jurisdiction over the case pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). It will then explain its conclusion that, while plaintiffs' alleged injuries may be enough to establish standing at the pleading stage of the case, they are largely insufficient to satisfy the \"actual damages\" element of nine of their state-law causes of action. The Court will then move to the interplay between plaintiffs' tort and contract claims, finding that the parties' non-fiduciary contractual relationship independently forecloses tort liability based on the allegations in the complaint. Finally, the Court will address issues specific to plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   unjust enrichment claim and their claims under the District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act and the Maryland Consumer Protection Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the end of the day, the Court will dismiss all of plaintiffs' claims except for a breach of contract claim and a Maryland Consumer Protection Act claim brought by the only two plaintiffs (Kurt and Connie Tringler of Maryland) who have plausibly alleged actual misuse of personal information resulting from the data breach. In reaching this outcome, the Court acknowledges the difficulty of applying traditional tort and contract principles in the contemporary context of data security. It also recognizes that courts across the country have divided on a number of important legal issues that frequently arise in data breach litigation. The Court has attempted to illuminate some of these divisions in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Court granted the 12(b)(1) motion on the ground that plaintiffs had not identified an \"actual or imminent\" injury as is necessary\n   to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of constitutional standing. In so doing, the Court observed that most of the plaintiffs had not alleged that their personal information had actually been misused in any way. Nor had they explained how the information taken (which CareFirst averred did not include financial information or social security numbers) could readily be used to assume their identities. Based on these factors, the Court adopted the principle that most other courts have followed in similar cases, including a Maryland federal class action brought by another set of CareFirst customers stemming from the same breach: \"Absent facts demonstrating a substantial risk that stolen data has been or will be misused in a harmful manner, merely having one's personal information stolen in a data breach is insufficient to establish standing to sue the entity from wh[ich] the information was taken.\"\n   <em>\n    Attias v.

The Court further held that plaintiffs' other asserted injuries were also insufficient to meet the injury-in-fact requirement of standing. Those harms included (1) expenditures on credit-monitoring services to prevent future identity theft; (2) some indeterminate overpayment for their insurance coverage; (3) loss of the intrinsic value of the stolen personal information; and (4) violation of their statutory rights under various consumer protection laws.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175797\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/199/193/#p197\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175797\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/199/193/#p197\">\n    at 202-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The D.C.

Beginning with the first requirement, plaintiffs estimate that there are more than one million class and sub-class members, SAC \u00b6 63, and CareFirst does not contest that number for purposes of this motion, Hr'g Tr. at 3:2-3:14. Second, the parties are minimally diverse because \"any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a State different from any defendant,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A) : The plaintiffs are residents of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia and have sued CareFirst and its affiliates doing business in those three places. And third, the amount in controversy almost certainly exceeds the $ 5 million threshold. Under CAFA, the Court aggregates the individual claims of class members. Here, even if individual class members' claims are worth just $ 5 each, they would satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement. But it's likely that the value of their claims is much more.

Instead, they incorrectly describe\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   as a case about \"the law of standing.\" Opp'n at 10 n.4. Although the lower court did conclude that the\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs lacked standing, the D.C.

And, because this Court sitting in diversity is charged with determining how the D.C. Court of Appeals would rule in the absence of a case directly on point, the Court concludes that the D.C. Court of Appeals would likely hold, consistent with\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   , that the mere threat of misuse of personal information would not be sufficient to state a claim for actual damages under the remaining seven claims not addressed in that decision. Thus, under District of Columbia law, only the Tringlers have alleged actual damages under this first theory of damages-misuse of exposed personal information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   b. Benefit of the bargain theory of damages\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend that they were harmed by \"a loss of the benefit of the bargain.\" Opp'n at 5-6. Under this theory, plaintiffs allege that they \"provided payment to Defendants for certain services, including health insurance coverage, part of which was intended to pay administrative costs of securing their [sensitive personal information].\" SAC \u00b6 25.

CareFirst asserts that plaintiffs cannot recover in tort for breach of duties that merely restate CareFirst's alleged contractual duties. According to CareFirst, because plaintiffs have failed to allege an independent common-law duty to reasonably safeguard personal information separate from any contractual one, they cannot \"double dip\" with claims sounding in tort. And even if there is such a duty, CareFirst asserts that the \"economic loss rule\" bars recovery here because, in the absence of a \"special relationship\" between parties, plaintiffs may not recover purely economic loses in tort. Finally, CareFirst contends that insurers and insureds do not have a fiduciary relationship that would support plaintiffs' claim for breach of a duty of confidentiality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court starts and stops with the independent duty rule.

The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has not confronted this question. And jurisdictions across the country are divided as to whether there is a common law duty to provide data security. The courts that have recognized such a duty have rooted it in one, or a combination, of three theories: an affirmative duty to refrain from causing others harm, the foreseeability of harm, or the nature of the parties' relationship. The Court considers these theories in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   First, some courts have recognized a duty to provide reasonable data security under the \"basic principle\" of tort law that \"everyone has a duty to refrain from affirmative acts that unreasonably expose others to a risk of harm.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sony Gaming Networks &amp; Customer Data Sec.

The MCPA expressly states that its provisions do not apply to the \"professional services\" of an \"insurance company.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Com.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2013-104\">\n    Md.

The court also considered the legislative history of another exemption directed specifically at health care services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1194. Finally, the court identified other areas of the law that distinguish between the ancillary services of a medical office like billing and the more direct services like treating a wound or implanting a dental filling. For example, professionals are generally licensed based on specialized training and expertise directly related to their profession.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1195-96.

Rather, gathering and storing consumers' private information is ancillary to the provision of health insurance coverage much like billing is ancillary to the provision of medical care. Other areas of Maryland law reinforce the conclusion that an insurance company's data-security practices are not exempt as a professional service.
