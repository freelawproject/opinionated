Plaintiff Patricia Wilson's (\"Ms. Wilson\") husband Walter\n   Wilson Jr. (\"Mr. Wilson\") took out a reverse mortgage that was insured by HUD on their home. Now Mr. Wilson has passed away and, as a result, Ms. Wilson is facing foreclosure. The foreclosure led Ms. Wilson to bring suit against HUD under the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.,\n   </em>\n   asserting that HUD's implementation of its insurance program caused the foreclosure action. For convenience of the reader, the Court will provide a brief overview of reverse mortgages and HUD's insurance program before turning to the specific facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Reverse Mortgages and the HUD Regulation at Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Reverse mortgages are a form of equity release in which a mortgage lender makes payments to a borrower based on the borrower's accumulated equity in his or her home. The lender provides the borrower with a lump sum or periodic payments, and the borrower need not repay the outstanding loan balance until certain \"trigger\" events occur (such as the death of the borrower or the sale of the home). Because borrowers can typically defer repayment until death, reverse mortgages function as a way for elderly homeowners to receive funds based on their home equity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Reverse mortgages are \"non-recourse\" loans, meaning that if a borrower fails to repay the loan when due and the sale of the home is insufficient to cover the balance, the lender has no recourse to any of the borrower's other assets. The only routes to repayment are voluntary payment of the loan in exchange for release of the mortgage, voluntary conveyance of the residence, or foreclosure. If the proceeds resulting from a foreclosure are insufficient to cover the loan balance, the lender cannot seek a deficiency judgment against the borrower or their estate. This feature is favorable to borrowers but carries significant risk for lenders. If the borrower elects to receive regular disbursements rather than a lump sum, the disbursements can continue until the borrower's death. If the borrower lives longer than expected, and the disbursements exceed the value of the home equity, lenders can face a significant financial loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Congress, concerned that this risk to lenders was deterring them from issuing reverse mortgages, amended Title II of the National Housing Act to authorize HUD to administer an insurance program for reverse mortgages. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-20 (\"authorizing statute\"). HUD, through its component agency the Federal Housing Administration (\"FHA\"), is authorized to provide insurance to private lenders who offer qualifying reverse mortgages to elderly homeowners. Borrowers must be at least 62 years of age to qualify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-20(b)(1). To prevent a lender from incurring uninsured losses after reaching the maximum loan amount, the lender can elect to assign the reverse mortgage to the FHA when the reverse mortgage reaches 98% of the maximum loan amount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.107\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). If the lender makes that election, HUD takes on responsibility for servicing the loan until a trigger event occurs; when such an event occurs HUD may foreclose the home if necessary. The insurance program also compensates lenders for some or all their loss when the proceeds from the sale of a house are less than the outstanding loan balance. In exchange, lenders must comply with HUD regulations and pay a monthly mortgage insurance premium (\"MIP\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.27\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7). Lenders generally pass the MIP costs directly on to the borrowers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   But Congress wanted to do more than just incentivize lenders. It also created the reverse mortgage insurance program to \"meet the special needs of elderly homeowners by reducing the effect of the economic\n   hardship caused by the increasing costs of meeting health, housing and subsistence needs at a time of reduced income.\" 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-20(a). The section of the authorizing statute at the heart of this case, titled \"Safeguard to prevent displacement of homeowner,\" states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Secretary may not insure a home equity conversion mortgage under this section unless such mortgage provides that the homeowner's obligation to satisfy the loan obligation is deferred until the homeowner's death, the sale of the home, or the occurrence of other events specified in regulations of the Secretary.\n   <em>\n    For purposes of this subsection, the term 'homeowner' includes the spouse of a homeowner.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-20(j) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   HUD promulgated regulations to implement the Act. Until September 2017, one of those regulations required insured reverse mortgages to state that the mortgage balance \"will be due and payable in full if a\n   <em>\n    mortgagor\n   </em>\n   dies and the property is not the principal residence of at least one surviving\n   <em>\n    mortgagor ...\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.27\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (1996) (since amended) (emphasis added). And HUD regulation\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.3\">\n    24 CFR \u00a7 206.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (until September of 2017) defined \"mortgagor\" as \"each original borrower under a mortgage. The term does not include successors or assigns of a borrower.\" By substituting \"mortgagor\" for \"homeowner,\" HUD's regulations required lenders to issue reverse mortgages that required foreclosure when the borrowing spouse dies, despite the authorizing statute's clear mandate that HUD not insure reverse mortgages unless they deferred foreclosure until both spouses died. One such reverse mortgage is at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Legal challenges to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.27\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) led HUD to take action in an attempt to change the effect of its regulations on surviving spouses. HUD first fashioned prospective relief in a \"Mortgagee Letter\" directed to participating private lenders, requiring all reverse mortgages issued after August 4, 2014, to include a Deferral Period. ML 2014-07 (April 24, 2014). The Deferral Period postpones a reverse mortgage's due and payable status (and subsequent foreclosure) until the death of the last eligible non-borrowing spouse. HUD later amended its regulations to codify this forward-looking relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.27\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 206.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), 206.55 (effective September 19, 2017). Thus, HUD implemented the anti-displacement intent of the authorizing statute for all reverse mortgages prospectively. However, reverse mortgages issued before August 4, 2014, still lacked protection for surviving spouses. In an attempt to address this gap, HUD issued additional requirements in Mortgagee Letter 2015-15. ML 2015-15 (June 12, 2015). ML 2015-15 created the Mortgagee Optional Election (\"MOE\") that is still in effect (prior versions of the MOE will be discussed below). The MOE allows a reverse-mortgage lender, at its election, to assign the reverse mortgage to FHA when the last surviving borrower dies, and the lender has met certain criteria. Once the reverse mortgage is assigned to HUD, the surviving spouse would be protected from displacement as long as they continue to maintain eligibility (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   they must continue to reside in the property secured by the reverse mortgage). The MOE applies to all HUD-insured reverse mortgages that were issued prior to August 4, 2014. However, there are several restrictions on eligibility for the ML 2015-15 MOE, one of which is at issue in this case: lenders must elect to assign the reverse mortgage within 120 days of the borrower's death. If that deadline is not met, lenders are required to foreclose on the subject property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ML 2015-15 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Bennett\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Plunkett\n    </em>\n    , and Progeny\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Before turning to the facts of this case, the Court will briefly note other U.S. district court cases that have dealt with the consequences of HUD's reverse mortgage regulations on surviving spouses. The first legal challenge took place in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett v. Donovan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196802\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/797/69/\">\n    797 F.Supp.2d 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2011) (\"\n   <em>\n    Bennett I\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <em>\n    rev'd\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869656,3661386\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/582/\">\n    703 F.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2013). In\n   <em>\n    Bennett I\n   </em>\n   , surviving spouses brought suit against HUD under the APA, claiming the original\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.27\">\n    24 CFR \u00a7 206.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) violated the APA because it was inconsistent with the authorizing statute. The court dismissed the case for lack of standing, finding that the complaint lacked redressability because it hinged on the independent choices of a third party regulated by HUD-the reverse mortgage lender.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.27\">\n    at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The D.C. Circuit reversed\n   <em>\n    Bennett I,\n   </em>\n   finding that plaintiffs did have a redressable injury to the extent that their requested relief depended on the actions of HUD.\n   <em>\n    Bennett v. Donovan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869656,3661386\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/582/\">\n    703 F.3d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 590 (D.C. Cir. 2013). The circuit court found that HUD had the capacity to provide relief to the plaintiffs under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-20(i), eliminating the uncertainty of third party lender action. On remand, the district court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs, finding that the HUD regulation was invalid as applied to plaintiffs because it violated the authorizing statute.\n   <em>\n    Bennett v. Donovan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4140821\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/4/5/#p12\">\n    4 F.Supp.3d 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12-15 (D.D.C. 2013) (\"\n   <em>\n    Bennett II\n   </em>\n   \"). The court remanded the case to HUD to fashion relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   While\n   <em>\n    Bennett II\n   </em>\n   was on remand to HUD, litigants filed\n   <em>\n    Plunkett v. Castro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193022\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/1/\">\n    67 F.Supp.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2014). The\n   <em>\n    Plunkett\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs were surviving non-borrowing spouses facing foreclosure, alleging identical violations of the authorizing statute as the\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs, as well as a claim that HUD's failure to act as a result of\n   <em>\n    Bennett II\n   </em>\n   violated the APA. The court consolidated\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Plunkett\n   </em>\n   . In summary judgment briefing, HUD argued to the court that plaintiffs did not have standing because the \"automatic result\" of the\n   <em>\n    Bennett II\n   </em>\n   ruling was that the death of the borrowing spouse was not a \"triggering\" event that requires foreclosure under \u00a7 206.27(c)(1). HUD termed this effect the \"Trigger Inapplicability Decision\" (\"TID\"). HUD reasoned that because of the TID, foreclosure on the reverse mortgage was not required for the six\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Plunkett\n   </em>\n   named plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Plunkett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193022\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/1/\">\n    67 F.Supp.3d at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court, however, held that the plaintiffs still had standing despite HUD's TID stance, because the TID did not provide them with all relief allegedly within HUD's power.\n   <em>\n    Plunkett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193022\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/1/\">\n    67 F.Supp.3d at 11-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Merely providing some redress does not negate plaintiffs' standing.\"). The court also found that the TID did not render plaintiffs' claims moot because it was not a \"final agency action\" under the APA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193022\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193022\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/1/\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the court held that HUD's failure to apply the TID remedy to all similarly situated, eligible surviving non-borrowing spouses, instead of just the six named\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Plunkett\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs, was arbitrary and capricious. The court again remanded the case to HUD to consider whether the TID remedy applied to surviving non-borrowing spouses other than the named plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193022\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193022\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/1/\">\n    at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Courts have reached a variety of outcomes in subsequent cases brought by surviving non-borrowing spouses.

The\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   court rejected HUD's attempt to dismiss the case as moot and entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff, holding that the plaintiff's husband's death \"was not a triggering event for purposes of HUD's reverse mortgage regulations and the\n   [subject] loan documents incorporating language from those regulations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.27\">\n    at *8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mar. 19, 2015), the court declined to hold the HUD regulation invalid. The\n   <em>\n    Bombet\n   </em>\n   court found that a prior version of the MOE, which HUD initiated in Mortgagee Letter 2015-03 (ML 2015-03 (Jan. 29, 2015) ), placed surviving non-borrowing spouses with pre-August 4, 2014, loans in a substantially similar position as those with loans issued thereafter. The ML 2015-03 MOE had substantial differences from the current ML 2015-15 MOE; for example, its deadline to make the election ran from the date of the loan servicer receiving notice of the borrower's death, rather than the date of the borrower's death. In\n   <em>\n    Federal National Mortgage Association v.

The\n   <em>\n    Takas\n   </em>\n   court found there was no further action HUD could take to force such an assignment. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    In re: Larman\n   </em>\n   , No. 16-71624,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203575860\">\n    2017 WL 3575860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *10 (Bankr.

The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Larman\n   </em>\n   did not claim that the policy provisions of ML 2015-15 were the cause of the denial.

The reverse mortgage contains the provision required by HUD regulation\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.27\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), which states that the loan is due and payable in full upon the borrower's (Mr. Wilson's) death. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9(a)(1).) Mr. Wilson died intestate on November 22, 2015. Under the intestacy laws of Illinois, Ms. Wilson inherited a one-half interest in the property and Mr. Wilson's six surviving children and one granddaughter inherited the remaining one-half interest. All seven of Mr. Wilson's other heirs are willing to quit claim their interest to Ms. Wilson. (Am. Answer \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.) Mr. Wilson's death constituted a triggering event pursuant to \u00a7 206.27(c)(1) and began the 120-day clock for RMS to elect to assign the loan to FHA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ms. Wilson did not know that she was required to inform RMS of Mr. Wilson's\n   death. In July of 2016, RMS sent Ms. Wilson a letter, which sought confirmation that Mr. Wilson continued to reside in their home. The same day, Ms. Wilson called RMS to inform it that Mr. Wilson had died. RMS asked Ms. Wilson to send in documents that could qualify her for a program to remain in her home, which she did. (Am. Answer \u00b6\u00b6 8-12.) Meanwhile, on September 23, 2016, RMS filed the underlying foreclosure action against Ms. Wilson and HUD in the Circuit Court of Cook County. (Second Am. Compl., Ex. A to Not. of Removal, Dkt. No. 1.) On October 19, 2016, RMS informed Ms. Wilson that it could not allow her to remain in the home because she had not informed RMS of Mr. Wilson's death within 120 days thereof. Ms. Wilson continues to live in the home and is current on all housing expenses, including taxes, insurance, and utilities; she is eligible for assignment under the 2015-15 MOE in every way except for meeting the 120-day deadline.

Accordingly, HUD argues that RMS's actions and the terms of the subject reverse mortgage, not HUD regulations, caused Ms. Wilson's injury. As such, HUD contends that Ms. Wilson lacks standing for both her regulation challenges and deadline challenges. The Court will address each type of challenge separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First,\n   <em>\n    HUD argues Ms. Wilson cannot demonstrate causation for the regulation challenges because\n   </em>\n   \"the terms of the mortgage contract-\n   <em>\n    not the regulations\n   </em>\n   -control when the mortgage becomes due.\" (Def.'s Mot. at 14.) The Court is not persuaded. It is true that an independent action of a third party not before the Court is insufficient to establish causation.\n   <em>\n    Bennett v. Spear\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p169\">\n    520 U.S. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 169,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p169\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p169\">\n    137 L.Ed.2d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) (citation omitted). However, causation can be established when an injury is produced by a \"determinative or coercive effect upon the action of someone else.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p169\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is the case here. HUD's regulations set the terms of the subject reverse mortgage, and HUD's regulations required RMS to foreclose upon Ms. Wilson.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.125\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The mortgagee shall commence foreclosure of the mortgage within six months of the due date defined in \u00a7 206.129(d)(1).\"); ML 2015-15. If the lender fails to foreclose in time, HUD imposes a financial penalty: withholding any further\n   interest the lender could have earned on the loan.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.129\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 206.129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(x). HUD's regulatory scheme is sufficiently \"determinative\" upon RMS to meet the causation standard. Thus Ms. Wilson has adequately alleged causation for her regulation challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Next, HUD argues that Ms. Wilson has not demonstrated causation for the deadline challenges because RMS's actions, not the 120-day MOE deadline, caused her injury. In support of this argument, HUD points to the fact that other HUD regulations require insured reverse mortgage lenders to notify HUD within 60 days of the death of the last surviving borrower.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.125\">\n    24 CFR \u00a7 206.125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; ML 2015-15. Therefore, HUD claims RMS should have been aware that Mr. Wilson had passed away and \"should have had plenty of time to make an MOE.\" (Def.'s Mot. at 15.) Whether the 120-day MOE deadline is reasonable in light of the 60-day notification deadline goes to the merits of Ms. Wilson's challenge, which is better left for summary judgment. For now, it suffices to say that one HUD regulation will not defeat causation for an injury allegedly caused by another HUD regulation. Ms. Wilson alleges RMS was unable to utilize the MOE assignment only because of the 120-day deadline; this is sufficient to allege her injury was \"fairly traceable\" to the deadline. The Court thus finds that Ms. Wilson has sufficiently alleged causation for her deadline challenges. Accordingly, both the regulation and deadline challenges pass muster as to causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court next turns to redressability. To satisfy redressability, Ms. Wilson must demonstrate that a favorable decision from the Court is likely to redress her injury. HUD's redressability arguments are concerned with what relief exactly the Court is able to order in this case. Therefore, by way of background, the Court will note that \"redressability\" can be limited in the context of an APA claim. Ms. Wilson asks this Court to \"hold unlawful and set aside\" agency actions under \u00a7 706(2) of the APA. If the Court agrees with Ms. Wilson that HUD's regulations and/or 120-day MOE deadline are arbitrary and capricious, or otherwise not in accordance with law, the Court would not dictate to HUD what the precise remedy would be. Rather, it would remand to HUD for proceedings consistent with its legal determination. It is generally the prerogative of the agency to decide in the first instance how best to provide relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fla. Power &amp; Light Co. v.

Thus, the Court recognizes that even if the Court issues a decision favorable to Ms. Wilson, and remands to HUD, she has no\n   <em>\n    guaranty\n   </em>\n   of relief because HUD may decide that no relief is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

(Def.'s Mot. at 16.) HUD is correct that the subject reverse mortgage is already fully formed, and the Court cannot alter its\n   terms. If RMS were the only party with the discretion to avoid foreclosure, Ms. Wilson's challenges would face the problem of \"merely speculative relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 561\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, HUD argues that Ms. Wilson's regulation challenges are moot for three reasons: (1) HUD has formally amended the challenged regulations, bringing them into compliance with the authorizing statute; (2) ML 2015-15 \"effectively amended\" the regulations, bringing them into compliance with the statute; and (3) HUD is a government actor that should be granted additional deference under the voluntary cessation doctrine. The Court will discuss each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, the Court addresses HUD's claim that the regulation challenges are moot because\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.27\">\n    24 CFR \u00a7 206.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) was amended by a HUD Final Rule, 82 FR 7094 (Jan. 19, 2017). The Final Rule amended \u00a7 206.27(c) to require\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   reverse mortgages to include a provision deferring the due and payable status for eligible non-borrowing spouses when their borrower spouses die (functionally codifying the provisions of ML 2014-07).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.27\">\n    24 CFR \u00a7 206.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3) (effective September 19, 2017). According to HUD, after this amendment, the regulations are no longer inconsistent with the authorizing statute. This argument, however, ignores the fact\n   that the newly amended regulation has no effect on the subject reverse mortgage because it was issued in 2009. Ms. Wilson is alleging that the newly amended regulation, as applied to her, still violates the \"anti-displacement\" provision of the authorizing statute. Therefore, the HUD regulations still present a \"live\" controversy for the Court to consider. HUD's argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   HUD's argument that the regulation challenges are mooted by ML 2015-15 fare no better. The Court currently need not resolve the parties' dispute over whether Mortgagee Letters can \"amend\" federal regulations for purposes of the APA. Even assuming Mortgagee Letters can amend regulations, Ms. Wilson is alleging that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20206.27\">\n    24 CFR \u00a7 206.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) as \"amended\" by ML 2015-15 is still in violation of the authorizing statute. She supports this contention with the allegation that the regulation as amended, and the mortgagee letter, still operate to require lenders to foreclose on a surviving spouse in contravention of the statutory requirement. HUD's argument thus misses the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Finally, HUD argues that the regulation challenges are moot because HUD voluntarily ceased the offending conduct. Generally, a case can be mooted by the defendant's voluntary conduct only if subsequent events \"made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to occur.\"\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p185\">\n    528 U.S. at 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p185\">\n    120 S.Ct. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court uses a more deferential standard when the defendant voluntarily ceasing unlawful conduct is a government entity-the Court will place \"greater stock in\" a government act of self-correction, so long as it appears genuine.\n   <em>\n    Fed'n of Advert.

The Court need not examine whether HUD met the burden of establishing mootness by voluntary cessation, however, because ultimately that argument is inapplicable in the context of Ms. Wilson's regulation challenges. Ms. Wilson is alleging that HUD has not \"ceased\" the \"conduct\" of \u00a7\u00a7 206.27(c)(1) and 206.3 as applied to her. This is evident in the fact that the regulations still operate to require RMS to foreclose on Ms. Wilson due to the fact that her husband passed away. Accordingly, this final argument fails, and the Court finds that Ms. Wilson's regulation challenges are not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.

Second, the action must be one by which \"rights or obligations have been determined,\" or from which \"legal consequences will flow.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p169\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Port of Boston Marine Terminal Assn. v.

However, as will be discussed below, the finality inquiry is misplaced in this context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, regarding HUD's argument that ML 2015-15's MOE effectively \"amended\" \u00a7 206.27(c), the Court will note again that it will not now settle the parties' dispute over whether mortgagee letters can amend federal regulations for APA purposes. Regardless, HUD claims that because ML 2015-15 \"amended\" \u00a7 206.27(c), that regulation is no longer a final agency action subject to APA challenge. In support of this argument, HUD points to the fact that the District Court of D.C. found a prior version of the MOE to be a \"reasonable\" program, not arbitrary or capricious.\n   <em>\n    Plunkett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193022\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/1/\">\n    67 F.Supp.3d at 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That decision, however, is not binding on this court; nor is it persuasive. The opinion does not support the contention that \u00a7 206.27(c) is unreviewable under the APA because it has been \"amended\" by the ML 2015-15 MOE. Judicial reviewability of \u00a7 206.27(c) was not at issue in\n   <em>\n    Plunkett\n   </em>\n   . Rather,\n   <em>\n    Plunkett\n   </em>\n   held that an earlier version of the MOE (extended only to the\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Plunkett\n   </em>\n   named plaintiffs)\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   judicially reviewable under the APA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193022\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4193022\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/67/1/\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the MOE was judicially reviewable and subjecting the MOE to arbitrary and capricious review). Moreover, the opinion addresses a version of the MOE that did not include a 120-day election deadline, which differs from the MOE Ms. Wilson is currently challenging. Thus, this argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Next, HUD asserts that because \u00a7 206.27(c) was formally amended in 2017, the prior version of the regulation is unreviewable. Both of HUD's finality arguments seem to assume that Ms. Wilson is challenging only the\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   version of \u00a7 206.27(c). But Ms. Wilson argues that even after its 2017 amendment, \u00a7 206.27(c) as applied to the subject reverse mortgage still violates the authorizing statute. Thus, the finality inquiry is inappropriate in this context, and these arguments fail. The Court finds that judicial review under \u00a7 706(A) and \u00a7 706(C) of the APA is proper for Ms. Wilson's regulation claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Having established that this Court has jurisdiction to hear Ms. Wilson's APA challenges, the Court turns next to whether Ms. Wilson has stated a claim upon which relief can be granted.
