MOORE, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At issue is whether Defendants Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (\"Ocwen\") and HSBC Bank USA, N.A., as Trustee on behalf of Ace Securities Corp. Home Equity Loan Trust and for the Registered Holders of Ace Securities Corp. Home Equity Loan Trust, Series 20070HE2, Asset Backed Pass-Through Certificates, (\"HSBC\") (Ocwen and HSBC, collectively, \"Defendants\") wrongly assessed charges and fees, and claimed default, on a loan made to Plaintiff Carlee C. Carson (\"Carson\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Defendants' Revised Motion for Summary Judgment (the \"Motion\") (ECF No. 66 ) seeking summary judgment in their favor on the remaining five claims in this case. Plaintiff Carlee C. Carson (\"Carson\") has filed a Response in Opposition (the \"Response\") (ECF No. 76 ), to which Defendants have filed a Reply in Support (the \"Reply\") (ECF No. 79 ). The matter is ripe for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2006, Carson borrowed $ 136,000 from People's Choice Home Loan, Inc. to purchase property in Palmer Lake, Colorado (the \"Property\"). The loan was secured by a Promissory Note (the \"Note\") and Deed of Trust (the \"DOT\") (collectively, the \"Mortgage Loan\"). The Mortgage Loan contains provisions which, as relevant here, covered assessment of charges and fees, insufficient payments, escrow for taxes and insurance, and defaults. Payments were due on the first day of each month beginning October 1, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 1, 2006, Ocwen acquired servicing rights to the Mortgage Loan. By January 2007, Carson began receiving phone calls from Ocwen claiming the Mortgage Loan was in default by failing to make the monthly payments due. The parties dispute whether Ms. Carson was in default as Ocwen claimed. By March 2011, Carson retained an attorney to assist with her disputes with Defendants over the Mortgage Loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In or about July 2011, Carson entered into a Loan Modification Agreement (the \"Modification Agreement\"). The Modification Agreement required an initial down payment of $ 812.42, which Carson paid, and payment of principal and interest (\"PI\") of $ 655.40 thereafter. The parties dispute\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   Carson's obligation to make payments would begin - Ocwen asserts the regular payment obligation would begin on August 1, 2011 (as provided in the Modification Agreement), while Carson asserts that it was not to begin until she received a fully executed Modification Agreement. It is, however, undisputed that Carson did not pay until November 2011, after she received the fully executed Modification Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Modification Agreement did not set forth what amounts, if any, were required to be escrowed for taxes and insurance. However, prior to the receipt of the executed Modification Agreement, Carson received an Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement Projections for Coming Year (\"Escrow Statement\") dated September 9, 2011, for the upcoming escrow year (November 2011 to October 2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 66-11, pp. 4-7.) The Escrow Statement provided that beginning November 1, 2011, Carson's monthly mortgage payment would increase to $ 944.90, consisting of $ 655.40 in PI and $ 289.50 in taxes and insurance (collectively, \"PITI\"), due to an anticipated escrow shortage for the coming\n   escrow year. Carson, however, did not always pay this amount; she sometimes paid less. Many of Carson's payments for the escrow year was also late. Ocwen declared Carson's account to be in default and held Carson's payments in a suspense account because they were insufficient to cover the monthly $ 944.90 PITI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Ocwen thereafter sent Carson other annual escrow statements, calculating the PITI for the upcoming escrow year, based on the projected escrow needed for taxes and insurance. Carson contends that she did not receive many of the annual escrow statements. Nonetheless, Carson did make payments, though they were generally not for the amounts Ocwen calculated as due and were generally not timely made. Carson admits she \"consistently\" received monthly statements from Ocwen, but asserts the statements were inconsistent in the amounts stated to be due and owing. The Court has not been provided with copies of all the disputed monthly statements. The few monthly statements that were provided show the\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   amounts did vary from month to month, apparently due to the assessment of fees and other costs, but the monthly PITI did not. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 79-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At some point in time, Carson, through counsel, requested information to support fees and costs Defendants assessed on the Mortgage Loan (as modified). Defendants provided information to Carson but the parties dispute the sufficiency of the information provided. It is unclear to the Court exactly what was requested and what was provided.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Beginning in 2009, Carson filed several disputes with the credit reporting agencies, who then notified Defendants. Defendants assert they properly investigated Carson's credit disputes but did not report the account as disputed. This lawsuit followed on December 2, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In December 2016, during the pendency of this case, Carson sold the Property. At that time, Carson paid the amounts Defendants claimed were due and owing under the Mortgage Loan, as modified, but disputed the amounts claimed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Carson raised several claims in this action but some have been dismissed. The claims which remain are: (1) breach of contract - Defendants allegedly failed to adhere to their obligations and comply with the terms and conditions of the Mortgage Loan; (2) breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing implied in the Mortgage Loan; (3) violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\"FCRA\"); (4) violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"); and (5) unjust enrichment. Defendants seek summary judgment on all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Once the moving party meets its initial burden of demonstrating an absence of a genuine dispute of material fact, the burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to demonstrate the existence of a genuine dispute of material fact to be resolved at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    1-800-Contacts, Inc. v.

The parties do not dispute the following limitations of actions apply: (1) one-year for the FDCPA claim; (2) two-year for the FCRA; and (3) three-year for unjust enrichment. The parties dispute whether the three-year statute of limitations (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-80-101\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-80-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a) ) or the six-year statute of limitations (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-80-103.5\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-80-103.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) applies to the breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claims. Defendants contend it is the three-year statute while Carson contends it is the six-year statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court finds that, based on the arguments of the parties and the claims asserted, the six-year statute of limitations under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Colo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2013-80-103.5\">\n    Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-80-103.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a) applies for two reasons. First, \"[i]n the absence of a clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary, a statute of limitations specifically addressing a particular class of cases will control over a more general or catch-all statute of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    Mortgage Inv. Corp. v. Battle Mountain Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9120589\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/70/1176/#p1185\">\n    70 P.3d 1176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1185 (Colo. 2003) (citation omitted). Section 13-80-101(1)(a), upon which Defendants rely, is the more general statute of the two at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, \u00a7 13-80-101(1)(a) specifically\n   <em>\n    excepts\n   </em>\n   actions which fall within \u00a7 13-80-103.5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Actions which fall within \u00a7 13-80-103.5(1)(a) include those \"for the enforcement of rights set forth in any instrument securing the payment of or evidencing any debt.\" Here, Carson's claims, as pled, are for the enforcement of rights afforded under the Mortgage Loan,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , for fees to be assessed only if she is in default, and only for fees permitted under the loan documents. Accordingly, the six-year statute applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mortgage Inv. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9120589\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/70/1176/#p1185\">\n    70 P.3d at 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (action for default on promissory note is six-years);\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castle Rock Bank v.

App. 2012) (applying six-year statute of limitation to lender's action to recover under two promissory notes, where parties did not dispute its application).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants cite to a few cases applying a three-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 13-80-101(1)(a) but the Court finds them\n   inapposite. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Clementson v. Countrywide Fin. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5731848,4118822\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/464/706/\">\n    464 F. App'x 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2012), the contract at issue was not the mortgage loan but an alleged agreement to provide the borrower with a loan modification.\n   <em>\n    Clementson v. Countrywide Fin. Corp.\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-cv-01956-WYD-KMT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201884715\">\n    2011 WL 1884715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2-3 (D. Colo. Jan. 27, 2011),\n   <em>\n    recommendation adopted\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201884627\">\n    2011 WL 1884627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Colo. May 18, 2011). Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Grillo v. JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-cv-03233-RBJ-KLM,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204470439\">\n    2014 WL 4470439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Colo. Sept. 8, 2014), Grillo's contract claim was based on requests for corrections to alleged erroneous reporting to credit bureaus. And, in\n   <em>\n    Davidson v. Bank of America, N.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-cv-01578,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20922872\">\n    2016 WL 922872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Colo. Mar. 11, 2016), Davidson's claims were based on the mortgage documents but he did not challenge whether the three-year statute of limitations applied. In summary, the Court agrees with Carson that the six-year statute of limitations applies to the breach of contract and breach of good faith and fair dealing claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Carson's alleged Default on or after December 2, 2012\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants assert that Carson's alleged default after December 2, 2012 must result in judgment in their favor on\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   claims. The Court rejects that assertion for several reasons. First, as a six-year statute of limitations applies, alleged events before December 2, 2012 may also be at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, as Carson argues, even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , she did default after December 2, 2012, she challenges the validity of the interest, fees, and costs assessed. And, Defendants do not contend that, under the terms of the Mortgage Loan, they are free to assess whatever they wish.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, Defendants provide sweeping arguments but fail to address the elements of the five claims and how any alleged default renders Carson unable to establish any of such claims. Finally, the Court finds there are genuine issues of material fact as to Carson's alleged default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Specifically, Defendants assert Carson has been in default under the Modification Agreement since October 2011. The Court, however, finds there are genuine issues of material fact concerning such default. For example, there is a triable issue of fact as to\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   Carson defaulted and, accordingly, the validity of the assessments at issue. While the facts show Carson received the September 9, 2011 Escrow Statement informing her of the amount of the PITI starting November 1, 2011, Carson argues the Modification Agreement was not effective unless she received an executed copy of the agreement. Her argument is supported by the terms of the Modification Agreement which states the Mortgage Loan \"will not be modified unless and until (1) you receive from Ocwen a copy of this Agreement signed by Ocwen....\" (ECF No. 66-10, p. 2, par. 1.) Here, Carson's declaration states she did not receive an executed agreement until after October 2011, i.e., sometime in November 2011. If so, Defendants' arguments fail to show how Carson could be, or that Carson was, in default prior to November 2011. Accordingly, summary judgment may not be had based on Defendants' default argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Good Faith and fair Dealing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants argue that Carson's claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing fails because she does not allege that Defendants were granted discretion\n   in the Mortgage Loan or used conferred discretion improperly. Carson responds that Defendants exercised discretion in how they applied payments when they were either more or less than the required amount, and that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether Defendants \"subverted\" her \"justified expectation\" as to how her payments were to be applied. Defendants reply that the implied duty of good faith and fair dealing is not breached unless a party \" 'uses discretion conferred by the contract to act dishonestly or outside the scope of commercial practices to deprive the other party of the benefit of the contract.' \" (ECF No. 79, p. 6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    ADT Sec. Servs., Inc. v. Premier Home Prot., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8378014\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/181/288/#p293\">\n    181 P.3d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 293 (Colo. App. 2007) ).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Defendants contend, the parties specifically agreed Defendants could hold insufficient payments in suspense. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Assuming the Mortgage Loan conferred Defendants discretion, Carson fails to argue - must less show there are genuine issues of material fact - that Defendants acted dishonestly or outside the scope of accepted commercial practices. Instead, Carson's argument hinges on her disagreement as to how her payments were applied (or not applied) as they were contrary to\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   expectations.

Colo. 2013) (collecting cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Here, the undisputed material facts show that Ocwen was the servicer; they also show it acquired the servicing rights to the Mortgage Loan before default. Specifically, Ocwen acquired servicing rights on November 1, 2006. Carson argues that she was not in default when such servicing rights were acquired. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SUMF \u00b6 37.) But, more importantly, Ocwen did not consider Carson to be in default until after November 1, 2006, when she allegedly failed to make her November or December 2006 payments. This is shown by Ocwen's written communications to Carson addressing such payments, and by when Carson began receiving calls from Ocwen - in January 2007. (ECF Nos. 79-2, 79-3; SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 38, 56.) On this record, Carson fails to meet her burden of establishing a triable issue of material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Based on the foregoing, Defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Carson responds that she notified the CRAs of her dispute, and notwithstanding the CRAs' notification to Defendants of Carson's dispute, Defendants failed to report a bona fide dispute existed. Defendants counter with the contention that Carson's dispute cannot be bona fide because she defaulted on the Mortgage Loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Facially, Defendants' argument appears to have merit: Carson defaulted on the Mortgage Loan sometime after it was entered. The problem, however, is that the Court does not know\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   Defendants reported and, accordingly, whether the information was provided in \"a manner as to create a materially misleading impression.\"\n   <em>\n    Llewellyn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804025\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/1173/#p1178\">\n    711 F.3d at 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, Defendants apparently rely on what occurred after the Loan Modification in 2011, but, as discussed above, there is a material factual dispute as to\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   default occurred. Accordingly,\n   on this record, Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

Carson asserts her unjust enrichment claim covers conduct outside the express contracts; therefore, it falls within the exception to the \"express contract\" rule.\n   <em>\n    Pulte Home Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12189030\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/382/821/#p833\">\n    382 P.3d at 833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court finds otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, the alleged conduct raised by Carson are Defendants' use of suspense accounts and the assessment of charges. The undisputed facts, however, show the Deed of Trust directly addresses Defendants' use of suspense accounts and the assessment of charges. (ECF No. 66-2, pp. 5, 11 ; SUMF \u00b6\u00b6 7, 50.)
