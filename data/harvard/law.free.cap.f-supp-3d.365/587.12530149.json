The underlying facts and circumstances concern the alleged misconduct of law enforcement officers from multiple agencies-Defendant City of Johnstown Police Department (\"Defendant Johnstown\") and its police officers Angelo Cancelliere (\"Cancelliere\") and Lawrence Wagner (\"Wagner\"); Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Merrill Brant (\"Brant\") and Pennsylvania State Police forensic scientist supervisor Scott Ermlick (\"Ermlick\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; Cambria County's District Attorney's Office (\"Defendant Cambria County\") and its Assistant District Attorneys David Tulowitzki (\"Tulowitzki\") and Daniel Lovette (\"Lovette\"). These named Defendants allegedly caused the wrongful conviction and incarceration of Plaintiff Kevin Siehl (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Siehl\") for the murder of his wife in 1991 for which he spent 25 years in prison. On July 14, 2016, Plaintiff's conviction was vacated and the criminal charges against him were dismissed. For the reasons discussed below, the Motion to Dismiss filed by Defendants Cambria County, Tulowitzki, and Lovette (ECF No. 24 ) will be denied. The Motion to Dismiss filed by Defendants Brant and Ermlick (ECF No. 28 ) will be denied. All Motions to Dismiss on the grounds of absolute or qualified immunity will be denied without prejudice to raising the issue again after the close of discovery on summary judgment.

They made this decision despite the fact they were aware of at least two other people who had motives to harm Christine Siehl: Frank Willis, a man who had been in a relationship with Christine Siehl while she was married to Plaintiff; and Robert \"Bobby\" Prebahalla, Plaintiff's nephew, who was known to have stated that he would kill Christine Siehl if she ever did anything to hurt Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

They relied on three pieces of evidence. First, Defendant Brant issued a report stating that the latent print found on the showerhead belonged to Siehl, and later, Brant informed the other Defendants that because the fingerprint had not deteriorated it must have been left within the 24 to 36 hours before it was found.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 35-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This assertion concerning the timing as to when the fingerprint was left was critical to the investigating officers as they believed Christine Siehl was killed at approximately 1:30 a.m. on July 13, a time closely approximating Defendant Brant's conclusion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 68-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Expert analysis conducted during Siehl's post-conviction proceedings confirmed that there is no scientific support for the proposition that a non-deteriorated latent print must be of recent origin, and in any event, the print found on the showerhead was not a match to Siehl.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 37, 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Second, Defendant Ermlick, a forensic scientist supervisor in the Pennsylvania State Police Greensburg Regional Laboratory, issued a report stating that one of the blood samples found on the bathroom door frame matched Siehl's blood.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 42-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Ermlick's assertion, however, was false. Similar to the latent print left on the showerhead, expert analysis during Siehl's post-conviction proceedings showed that, given the orientation of the blood spatter, found in a nearly perfect parallel left-to-right configuration on the doorframe next to a blood stain attributed to Christine Siehl, the stain could not have come from Siehl.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The third piece of forensic evidence was Siehl's L.A.

Ermlick followed their directive and his findings would have been very helpful to the defense. Yet, in direct violation of the court's order, Defendant prosecutors failed to turn over these new forensic testing results to the defense, nor did they alert the court or the defense that this additional testing had been conducted. In addition, the prosecutors further directed Ermlick not to write a formal report regarding the new findings.

Defendants continue that \"[f]reedom from wrong opinions is not a right at all,\" and that no reasonable officer under the circumstances \"would have understood or realized that making a mistake in testing evidence, or issuing a conclusion that was questionable or wrong ... would amount to a constitutional violation.\" (ECF No. 29 at 12-13.)

Plaintiff alleges that Defendants acted intentionally, or at a minimum, recklessly, in reporting false forensic conclusions to support the prosecution's theory of the case. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges with sufficient specificity why Brant's report on thumbprint deterioration was intentionally or recklessly false (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 37-41 ). Plaintiff further details why Ermlick's report on blood spatter evidence was intentionally or recklessly false (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 44-49 ). Likewise, Plaintiff sufficiently alleges why Ermlick's report that the presumptive blood stain on Plaintiff's tennis shoes was intentionally or recklessly false (ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 56-60 ). Moreover, Plaintiff's allegation that Brant knowingly violated a court order and Ermlick's silence when prosecutors lied to the trial judge as to whether any additional testing was done, support Plaintiff's contentions that both Defendants acted knowingly, intentionally and maliciously and in bad faith in providing prosecutors with false forensic\n   conclusions. Taking all of Plaintiff's allegations as true, and granting Plaintiff every favorable inference therefrom, Plaintiff has alleged plausible claims for malicious prosecution and fabrication of evidence pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants advance no argument as to the second prong of the qualified immunity analysis-was there clearly established law-in light of their argument that there was no constitutional violation. In evaluating the second prong of the analysis, the Court must deny qualified immunity at this stage of the proceedings. In support of his claims for malicious prosecution and fabrication of evidence, Plaintiff describes Defendants' conduct that supported the initiation of charges against him: 1) Brant's communication of the statement, knowing it was false, that the latent print on the showerhead was left 24-36 hours before it was located, and the subsequent report that the print was left by Plaintiff; 2) Ermlick's false report that the blood stain on the doorframe was left by Plaintiff; and 3) Ermlick's false report that there was a \"presumptive\" blood stain on Plaintiff's shoes. If Plaintiff's allegations are proved to be true through discovery or at trial, Defendants' conduct would constitute the violation of clearly established law that would have been apparent to reasonable police forensic investigators and scientists in 1991: the right to be free from arrest except on probable cause.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Orsatti v. New Jersey State Police\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414376\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/71/480/#p483\">\n    71 F.3d 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 483 (3d Cir. 1995) (as of 1989, \"the right to be free from arrest except on probable cause was clearly established.\").\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilson v.

Counts III and IV-\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and Fair Trial Violations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   In support of their Motion to Dismiss Counts III and IV (\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   and fair trial violations), Defendants argue that they are protected by qualified immunity because police officers were not subject to\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the time of Plaintiff's trial and conviction in 1991 and 1992. In addition, Defendants argue that they have been unable to locate a decision that would put Defendant Brant on notice that his alleged observations during the criminal defense expert's (Bennett) forensic evaluation violated the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Plaintiff responds that both of Defendants' arguments are incorrect. Plaintiff concedes that\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   did not apply to police officers at the time of Plaintiff's trial and conviction. Plaintiff contends, however, that\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   is not the source of Plaintiff's claims against Brant and Ermlick. Instead, Plaintiff argues that he relies on long established precedent establishing that the Due Process Clause prohibits officers from engaging in deliberate deception and suppression of evidence, citing\n   <em>\n    Mooney v.

According to the Complaint, Brant knew that his conclusion regarding the showerhead fingerprint was false. Ermlick knew that his conclusions regarding the blood splatter and presumptive bloodstains on Plaintiff's shoes were false, along with his mid-trial testing showing that the tennis shoes actually corroborated Plaintiff's statement to police. Although Plaintiff invokes\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   in Count III, he also invokes his due process protections under the Fourteenth Amendment which is sufficient to state a claim pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Mooney\n   </em>\n   and its progeny. Therefore, Plaintiff's allegations, if true, would constitute a violation of clearly established law that would have been apparent to a reasonable officer in 1991.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   With regard to Defendants' statement that they could uncover no precedent that would have put Defendant Brant on notice that his alleged observations during the Bennett forensic examination violated the Constitution, Plaintiff directs the Court to Third Circuit caselaw holding that the government may not interfere with confidential communications between members of the defense team, citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rispo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1326510\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/460/965/#p976\">\n    460 F.2d 965\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 976-78 (1972) and\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Rispo\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   the Third Circuit held that intrusion by the government into the attorney-client relationship violated due process where a paid government informant participated in a joint trial as a \"sham\" defendant, and the informer's court-appointed counsel (who was not aware of the deception) conferred with the co-defendants' counsel concerning trial strategy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 977-78. In\n   <em>\n    Levy\n   </em>\n   , the United States Court of Appeals held that the criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated when a government informant codefendant disclosed defense strategy to the government.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Crow Dog\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10598225\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/532/1182/#p1197\">\n    532 F.2d 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1197-98 (8th Cir. 1976) (quoting and adopting\n   <em>\n    UnitedStates v.

Neb. 1975) (violation of Sixth Amendment right to counsel where government informant gains information relating to charge against criminal defendant by intruding into attorney-client relationship) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Therefore, the Court must deny qualified immunity at this stage of the proceedings on Plaintiff's claim that these Defendants interfered with the defense team by closely observing the criminal defense expert's forensic evaluation and providing confidential information about that evaluation\n   to the prosecution. In light of this third Circuit precedent, these allegations, if true, would constitute a violation of clearly established law that would have been apparent to a reasonable officer in 1991.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   c. Count V-Fair Trial Right under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Finally, Defendants move to dismiss Count V directed to Defendant Ermlick. Count V concerns Ermlick's consumption of all forensic evidence before it could be submitted for DNA testing \"knowing that doing so would preclude Mr. Siehl from obtaining evidence which would have exonerated him.\" (ECF No. 1 \u00b6 150.) Again, Defendants contend that they could uncover no caselaw dealing with facts where a forensic examiner working with small blood samplings violated a criminal defendant's constitutional rights when he used up the evidence in the course of other biological testing. (ECF No. 29 at 16.) Plaintiff responds that as early as 1988, the United States Supreme Court addressed this issue holding that due process is violated when a law enforcement officer fails to preserve biological evidence in \"bad faith\" citing\n   <em>\n    Arizona v. Youngblood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1495598\" index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/51/#p57\">\n    488 U.S. 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1495598\" index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/51/#p57\">\n    109 S.Ct. 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1495598\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/488/51/#p57\">\n    102 L.Ed.2d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). Plaintiff's averments describe Ermlick's understanding of the importance of DNA testing when he suggested to Wagner that some of the samples should undergo DNA testing. (Complaint \u00b6 63.) Yet, Ermlick \"deliberately and recklessly consumed all of the blood samples in his non-DNA testing.\" (Id. \u00b6 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Here, taking all of Plaintiff's allegations as true, a reasonable officer in 1991 would have known that failing to preserve biological evidence in \"bad faith\" violated a criminal defendant's constitutional rights. At this stage of the proceedings, the Court must deny qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   For the reasons discussed above, the Motion to Dismiss filed by Defendants Cambria County, Tulowitzki, and Lovette (ECF No. 24 ) will be denied. The Motion to Dismiss filed by Defendants Brant and Ermlick (ECF No. 28 ) will be denied.
