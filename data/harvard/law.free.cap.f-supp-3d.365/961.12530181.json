Tostrud, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Wanda Micks (\"Micks\") co-signed a student loan (the \"Loan\") for a friend in 2006, and she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy the following year. The parties dispute whether Micks's obligation under the Loan might have been among those debts discharged through her bankruptcy. Her friend later stopped making payments on the Loan, and in 2015, Defendant Gurstel Law Firm, P.C. (\"Gurstel\"), as counsel for the owner of the Loan, obtained a judgment against Micks and her friend in Hennepin County District Court for the unpaid balance. Soon after, Gurstel began garnishing Micks's wages to collect on that judgment. Micks, seeking relief from the garnishment, applied with the Hennepin County District Court to have the judgment against her vacated. Micks properly served Gurstel with her application to vacate the judgment. Gurstel received Micks's application but mistakenly failed to timely object to it. Having received no response from Gurstel, the state court vacated the judgment against Micks in July 2017. Gurstel was informed of the state-court order vacating the judgment, but nonetheless continued garnishing Micks's wages to collect on the (now-vacated) judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Micks filed this lawsuit. Her Amended Complaint alleges that Gurstel's actions violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and constituted the common-law tort of conversion. ECF No. 10. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment. ECF Nos. 31, 36. Micks confirmed at the hearing that she was moving for summary judgment only as to liability on her FDCPA claim and not as to damages on that claim or on any aspect of her conversion claim. Gurstel represented at the hearing that it seeks summary judgment on all aspects of both of Micks's claims. Gurstel also has moved for sanctions against Micks and her counsel stemming from Micks's alleged abuse of the related state-court proceedings. ECF No. 55. Micks's summary-judgment motion will be granted because the law and the facts establish beyond reasonable dispute that Gurstel violated the FDCPA and that Gurstel's FDCPA violations did not result from a \"bona fide error,\" as the FDCPA uses those terms. Gurstel's motions for summary judgment and sanctions will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The facts giving rise to this dispute begin long before the alleged FDCPA violations occurred.

She cites a number of facts on which she based that understanding. First, the Loan was listed in her July 2007 bankruptcy petition,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Murray Decl. Ex. 3 at 16, and as her bankruptcy case proceeded she specifically expressed to her attorney the importance of having that specific Loan discharged,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 (\"I wanted to know if you can make sure if they\n   <em>\n    can release me\n   </em>\n   on the attached student loan that I co-signed for? I won't be able to pay for this especially since I haven't even started paying for my own student loan.\" (emphasis in original) ). Second, she received updates from her bankruptcy attorney as that proceeding unfolded, and she understood from her lawyer that, although other creditors had appeared in court, no one had appeared for the Loan creditors. Micks Dep. at 172. Third, she also understood from her bankruptcy attorney that in a \"discussion with the legal team from the bankruptcy court ... [t]hey were talking about the dismissal of the [L]oan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    at 173-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a result of those discussions, Micks understood, her bankruptcy attorney wrote a letter to the Loan creditor \"saying that he was including it in the bankruptcy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    at 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Fourth, correspondence from her bankruptcy attorney to the Loan creditor represented that because Micks was a \"co-maker\" on the loan and did not receive the loan funds herself, the debt was included in her discharge and\n   further collection efforts on the Loan would be prohibited following discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Murray Decl.

Edwards Aff. Ex. D (\"Wald Interrog. Dep.\") [ECF No. 34-1 at 109-11 ] at Ans. to Interrog. No. 1. Specifically, Wald believes he advised Micks that \"generally it is necessary to bring a lawsuit known as an 'adversary proceeding' in bankruptcy court to prove 'undue hardship' to discharge a student loan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Ans. to Interrog.

C (\"Wald Dep.\") at 18 [ECF No. 34-1 at 87-08 ]. Wald further recalls advising her as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Before the bankruptcy petition was filed with the court, I believe that I told Wanda Micks that student loans are not ordinarily discharged in bankruptcy, but that a minority of courts had ruled that co-signed debts could be discharged without a finding of \"undue hardship\", and we could at least make an argument to the student loan lender that the debt should be considered discharged based on her co-debtor status. She could then make further decisions about the student loan after the student loan lender replied to our assertion of dischargeability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Wald Interrog.

The FDCPA defines a \"debt\" as \"any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay money arising out of a transaction in which the money, property, insurance, or services which are the subject of the transaction are primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, whether or not such obligation has been reduced to judgment.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Gurstel argues that it was not collecting a \"debt\" as that term is defined by statute, and that Micks's FDCPA claim therefore fails. Specifically, it contends that because Micks and Birts were \"mere acquaintances who had not seen nor spoken to one another for five years at the time Micks agreed to co-sign for Birts'[s] student loans,\" Gurstel SJ Br. at 13, Micks did not co-sign the loans \"for personal, family, or household purposes,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(5), and therefore she did not incur a \"debt\" that could be subject to the FDCPA's protections.

Generally speaking, the existence or non-existence of a fraud exception to the FDCPA has been litigated in contexts where the debt at issue resulted from the consumer having paid for a consumer purchase with a bad check. But the rationale of those cases, and the Eighth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   decision in particular, lead here to the conclusion that, even if Micks acted fraudulently in asking the state court to discharge NCSLT's judgment, the FDCPA nevertheless provides her a civil remedy for debt-collection activities that violate the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As the Eighth Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   , \"courts generally will not create a fraud exception where none exists in the text of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11516885\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/96/968/#p975\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1124 (citing\n   <em>\n    Bass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11916424\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/111/1322/#p1329\">\n    111 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1329-30 ). \"[T]he wrong occasioned by debtor fraud is more appropriately redressed under the statutory and common law remedies already in place, not by a judicially-created exception that selectively gives a green light to the very abuses proscribed by the Act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11916424\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/111/1322/#p1329\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Bass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11916424\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/111/1322/#p1329\">\n    111 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1330 ). The plain text of the FDCPA contains no fraud exception, and if Gurstel believes that Micks acted fraudulently in applying to have NCSLT's judgment discharged, Minnesota law provides remedies to address that alleged fraud. Gurstel could have filed objections to her application on behalf of NCSLT (which it did not do), and it can seek to have its judgment reinstated (which it currently is pursuing on NCSLT's behalf in Hennepin County District Court). Applying a fraud exception here would do what the Eighth Circuit held inappropriate in\n   <em>\n    Duffy\n   </em>\n   : giving a pass or \"green light\" to conduct the FDCPA forbids.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Even if a fraud exception existed under the FDCPA, the law and facts would not permit summary judgment in favor of Gurstel on this basis. A fraud-on-the-court claim requires an intentional misrepresentation.\n   <em>\n    In re C.M.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10698093\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nw2d/557/353/#p358\">\n    557 N.W.2d at 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, by filing her application for discharge of judgment, Micks is said to have intentionally misrepresented to the state court that the Loan was discharged as part of her bankruptcy proceedings, and she is accused of intentionally pursuing a legal procedure she knew to be improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A reasonable jury could conclude that Micks believed the Loan had been, or at least may have been, discharged in her bankruptcy. Ample evidence exists in the record that Micks was genuinely confused about the effect of her bankruptcy discharge on her obligations under the Loan, at the beginning, middle, and end of her 2017 communications with her bankruptcy attorney.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Sec. I.D. Many areas of the law can be confusing to laypeople, and bankruptcy law in particular can be difficult, even for lawyers. Although nothing in Micks's communications with her bankruptcy attorney suggests that he gave her anything but competent and professional counsel, a reasonable jury could conclude that Micks became distrustful of his advice, such that she simply did not believe her only option was to pay a second retainer to the lawyer she thought had settled the matter the first time around.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Micks Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 4-6. For these same reasons, a jury reasonably could find that Micks did not file her state-court application to discharge her obligations under the Loan knowing the procedure to be improper. Notably, although the state court granted NCSLT relief from the order vacating the judgment against Micks, it specifically declined to reinstate that judgment because, \"[b]ased on the record, [it could] not determine whether or not the debt at issue has in fact been discharged.\" Edwards Aff. Ex. Q at 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   It also seems worth observing that, if Micks had intended to defraud the state court, she went about it in a way that was almost certain to result in immediate disclosure of her alleged fraud: she served Gurstel with her application. (Micks had nothing to do with Gurstel's failure to respond.) In that sense, the fraud on the court alleged to exist here seems unique. Most fraud-on-the-court cases involve allegations of concealment where, for example, one party accuses another of hiding or not disclosing evidence, and perhaps misrepresenting the nature of the undisclosed evidence. So far as can be gleaned from the record, Micks is accused of concealing nothing. Also, the state-court discharge of judgment did not result from anything Micks did following the filing of her Application. Minnesota law required the state court to summarily discharge NCSLT's judgment against Micks when NCSLT failed to file any objection.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20548.181\">\n    Minn.

To summarize, there appears to be no factual dispute that Gurstel garnished Micks's wages pursuant to a judgment that had been vacated and, in doing so, made certain statements about that judgment that were not true; similarly, there appears to be no dispute that the garnishment and the untrue statements constituted debt-collection practices prohibited under \u00a7 1692e and \u00a7 1692f of the FDCPA.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Micks SJ Br. at 14-17 [ECF No. 38 ];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Murray Decl.

Gurstel contends that it has established the defense as a matter of law, entitling it to summary judgment. Alternatively, Gurstel contends that fact disputes concerning the defense preclude summary judgment for Micks. Micks argues that Gurstel is unable as a matter of law to establish the bona fide error defense. According to Micks, this means summary judgment should be entered in her favor, at least with respect to liability on her FDCPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Section 1692k(c) of the FDCPA provides that \"[a] debt collector may not be held liable ... if the debt collector shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(c). \"The bona fide error defense exists as an exception to the strict liability imposed upon debt collectors by the FDCPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Picht v.

A failure as to any one of these elements is dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Here, Gurstel's briefing addresses two errors-or perhaps sets of errors-that might form the basis for its bona fide error defense. First, Gurstel identifies its failure to follow its \"policies and procedures governing the handling of bankruptcy mail, specifically including applications for discharge of judgment like the one filed by Micks with the state court\" and says that its failure to follow these procedures led to its failure to object to Micks's application. Gurstel SJ Reply Br. at 11-12 [ECF No. 45 ]. Second, Gurstel addresses its handling of the two telephone calls from Micks's employer and the fact that it continued to believe after those calls that the state-court judgment against Micks remained valid when in fact it had been discharged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14.

Gurstel no doubt has identified evidence from which a\n   reasonable juror could conclude it made an \"error\": it mishandled and thus did not respond to Micks's state-court application. There is no evidence that the mistake was not made in good faith or was contrived. This makes sense. Gurstel had every reason to object to Micks's application. But as sometimes happens, someone at Gurstel erred, and the application did not reach the individual responsible for coordinating Gurstel's response. Gurstel also has cited record evidence showing that it maintained internal policies and procedures governing the handling of case-related mail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gurtsel SJ Reply at 11-12 (citing Second Edwards Aff. Ex. T (containing what appear to be excerpts from Gurstel's written procedures for certain bankruptcy files) and Goltz Dep. at 24). Again, Micks disputes none of this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The question of whether a reasonable juror could conclude that Gurstel's FDCPA violations \"resulted from\" its mishandling of Micks's application to vacate the judgment is more difficult. Start with the law. The FDCPA does not define the phrase \"resulted from,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a, and-it seems-no case addresses this causation issue directly.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilhelm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3551446\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/416/#p420\">\n    519 F.3d at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the court \"ha[d] no difficulty concluding\" the FDCPA violation \"was caused by a bona fide error\" without analyzing the element of causation). \"Where there is no textual or contextual indication to the contrary, courts regularly read phrases like 'results from' to require but-for causality.\"\n   <em>\n    Burrage v.

Consider a baseball game in which the visiting team's leadoff batter hits a home run in the top of the first inning. If the visiting team goes on to win by a score of 1 to 0, every person competent in the English language and familiar with the American pastime would agree that the victory resulted from the home run. This is so because it is natural to say that one event is the outcome or consequence of another when the former would not have occurred but for the latter. It is beside the point that the victory also resulted from a host of\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   necessary causes, such as skillful pitching, the coach's decision to put the leadoff batter in the lineup, and the league's decision to schedule the game. By contrast, it makes little sense to say that an event resulted from or was the outcome of some earlier action if the action merely played a nonessential contributing role in producing the event. If the visiting team wound up winning 5 to 2 rather than 1 to 0, one would be surprised to read in the sports page that the victory resulted from the leadoff batter's early, non-dispositive home run.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701986\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/204/#p212\">\n    571 U.S. at 211-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12585952,12701986\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/881/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Concluding that Gurstel's FDCPA violations would not have occurred had it not\n   mishandled Micks's state-court application to vacate the judgment requires accepting a series of inferences. Gurstel advocates for this path in its reply brief when it says: \"Had Goltz received the Application, she would have consulted with Gurstel's client and objected to the Application.\" Gurstel SJ Reply Br. at 12. Gurstel seems to suggest that, if it had objected, then the judgment against Micks would have remained in effect, leaving Gurstel free to continue garnishing her wages and creating circumstances in which its FDCPA violations could not have occurred. To put it another way, Gurstel is saying that it would not have mistakenly believed that the state-court judgment remained valid after it had been discharged if the judgment hadn't been discharged in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Whether an objection would have prompted the state court to deny Micks's application is debatable. It certainly is true that an objection should have prevented an immediate entry of judgment discharging the Loan, but how the state court might ultimately have resolved any objection is not clear. These are roughly the same issues the state court is adjudicating now, and as mentioned earlier, although the state court granted NCSLT relief from the order vacating the judgment against Micks, it specifically declined to reinstate that judgment because, \"[b]ased on the record, [it could not] determine whether or not the debt at issue has in fact been discharged.\" Edwards Aff. Ex. Q at 8. Predicting how a hypothetical state of affairs develops from that point requires conjecture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   More importantly, although Gurstel's mishandling of Micks's application certainly set up a state of affairs leading up to Gurstel's FDCPA violations (and beyond), it seems unreasonable to say that this error \"resulted in\" Gurstel's FDCPA violations. As a practical matter, this error and the violations are several steps removed from each other. The mishandling of Micks's state-court application was not itself an FDCPA violation. Neither was Gurstel's failure to object to Micks's application. The mishandling of Micks's application did not make Gurstel's violations inevitable or even probable, at least insofar as the record shows. Other facts occurred in between-Gurstel not receiving the state-court order vacating the judgment, the telephone calls from Micks's employer, and Gurstel's responses to those calls-that are tied much more closely to Gurstel's FDCPA violations. Viewed in this light, Gurstel's mishandling of Micks's application is like the scheduling of the baseball game described in\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   : just as scheduling the game set in motion events that made it possible for one team to win, the mishandling of Micks's application set up a state of affairs that made it possible for Gurstel to violate the FDCPA. In other words, because Gurstel's error merely played a nonessential contributing role in the violations' occurrence, it is not reasonable to say that Gurstel's FDCPA violations \"resulted from\" its error in mishandling its incoming mail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burrage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12701986\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/571/204/#p212\">\n    571 U.S. at 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12585952,12701986\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/881/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]t makes little sense to say that an event resulted from or was the outcome of some earlier action if the action merely played a nonessential contributing role in producing the event.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Now for the second error that Gurstel suggests could form the basis for its bona fide error defense: its handling of the two telephone calls from Micks's employer questioning the propriety of Gurstel's continued garnishment. Gurstel did not receive notice from the state court that the NCSLT judgment against Micks had been discharged. Micks SJ Brief at 18. But shortly after that state-court order was entered, Gurstel did receive two telephone\n   calls from Micks's employer telling Gurstel that the employer had received information indicating that Micks's debt had been discharged. Micks SJ Br. at 18-19. The parties dispute whether Gurstel's continued erroneous belief that the state-court judgment against Micks remained valid after it had been discharged resulted from a bona fide error in Gurstel's handling of the two telephone calls from Micks's employer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Micks SJ Br. at 18-21; Gurstel SJ Reply Br. at 12-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   There are two possible ways of characterizing Gurstel's mistaken belief that the state-court judgment against Micks remained valid after it received these telephone calls. One possibility is that it was primarily a mistake of law-that is, Gurstel believed, as it argues here in support of its summary-judgment motion, that any state-court order discharging the judgment against Micks was of no legal effect because of the circumstances under which it was obtained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gurstel SJ Reply Br. at 13-14 (\"[C]ritically, the debt\n   <em>\n    had not been legally discharged\n   </em>\n   , because Micks had never filed an adversary proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code.... [T]he subject debt had not been discharged through appropriate legal means ... [and Micks's employer's] phone calls do not change the fact that no legally-valid discharged of the underlying debt had occurred.\" (emphasis in original) ). The other possibility is that it was primarily a mistake of fact-that is, Gurstel did not realize that the state court had issued an order vacating the judgment under which it was garnishing Micks's wages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (\"Gurstel had not received any written notification from the state court or anyone else that the debt had been discharged....\"). Whether it was a mistake of law or fact, this alleged error does not satisfy the bona fide error defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   To the extent Gurstel made a mistake of law, such mistakes are not protected by the bona fide error defense.\n   <em>\n    Picht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11164399\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/446/#p451\">\n    236 F.3d at 451-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of note, the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Jerman v. Carlisle, McNellie, Rini, Kramer &amp; Ulrich LPA\n   </em>\n   that the bona fide mistake defense does not shield a debt collector from liability for violations committed as a result of the debt collector's misinterpretation of the FDCPA's requirements.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448255,3582239\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/573/\">\n    559 U.S. 573\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 582-87,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582239,12448255\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1605/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582239,12448255\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1605/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). It is true that\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   specifically declined to consider whether \u00a7 1692k(c)'s bona fide mistake defense applies \"when a violation results from a debt collector's misinterpretation of the legal requirements of state law or federal law other than the FDCPA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582239,12448255\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1605/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 580 n.4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582239,12448255\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1605/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, in declining to address that question,\n   <em>\n    Jerman\n   </em>\n   explicitly let stand the Eighth Circuit's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Picht v. Jon R. Hawks, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   that \u00a7 1692k(c) does not preclude FDCPA liability resulting from a creditor's mistaken legal interpretation of Minnesota's garnishment statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582239,12448255\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/1605/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Picht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11164399\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/446/#p451\">\n    236 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   451-452 ). It is thus clear, at least within the Eighth Circuit, that a debt collector's mistake of law-whether as to the FDCPA or as to some other state or federal law implicated by its debt-collection activities-does not provide it safe harbor under \u00a7 1692k(c).\n   <em>\n    Picht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11164399\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/446/#p451\">\n    236 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   451-52 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hulshizer v.

As a matter of law, Gurstel's mistake of fact was not objectively reasonable given the information it received from Micks's employer. After being\n   told on July 31 that Micks had provided the employer with documents from a court relating to bankruptcy discharge and court release, Gurstel's only investigation was for a paralegal to check PACER for any relevant bankruptcy filings. Goltz Dep. at 46-48. After receiving a second call from the employer on August 9 stating that it had received paperwork from a court showing that Micks was not supposed to be garnished, Gurstel points to no evidence in the record that it conducted any factual investigation at all.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 70-76 (describing events relating to the employer's second call).

Similarly, Gurstel has not identified any evidence that anyone on its staff checked the state-court docket to confirm whether the judgment was still in effect. Gurstel's own internal notes reflect that the calls it received specifically referenced that the employer's concerns about the propriety of the garnishment were based not merely on Micks's own representations but also on the employer's receipt and review of court documents relating to bankruptcy discharge, court release, and the fact that Micks was not supposed to be garnished. Under those circumstances, it was not objectively reasonable for Gurstel to persist in its mistaken belief that the judgment remained valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Because the law and undisputed facts establish that Gurstel violated the FDCPA, and because the bona fide error defense is unavailable to Gurstel as a matter of law, Micks's motion for summary judgment will be granted and Gurstel's motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   No party's briefing addresses the law or facts that might be relevant to Micks's conversion claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

Gurstel argued at the hearing that the conversion and FDCPA claims are sufficiently alike that, unless the Court ruled for Gurstel based solely on the FDCPA's definition of the word \"debt,\" liability on the conversion claim survives or falls with liability on the FDCPA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Gurstel has not shown that it is entitled to summary-judgment on the conversion claim. Either that claim overlaps with the FDCPA claim sufficiently, such that the denial of Gurstel's summary-judgment motion on the FDCPA claim necessarily requires a denial of summary judgment on the conversion claim, or the two claims differ enough that Micks will have to prove a somewhat different set of facts to prevail on each claim, in which case Gurstel did not carry its burden of showing that \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.
