All Defendants have moved to dismiss Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each of these motions to dismiss, except for the School District's motion, has been converted to a motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Court will grant the motions for summary judgment and the School District's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff's claims arise from Defendants' actions toward, and treatment of, Plaintiff and his teenaged son, D.H., in the juvenile proceedings brought against D.H. for damaging a car. Upon D.H.'s arrest in Chester County, Pennsylvania, police officers from Defendant Easttown Township Police Department held D.H. at the scene while they called the home where Plaintiff, D.H., and Beverly Miles (D.H.'s grandmother and Plaintiff's mother) lived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff was not home, but Miles responded to the scene\n   and brought D.H. home to 1000 Townsend Circle, Wayne, Pennsylvania.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff asserts that Miles was later contacted by the police, who told her that if she did not pay for the damage that D.H. caused to the car, charges would be brought against D.H.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Miles was unable to pay for the damage. Plaintiff complains that, because he was never personally notified of this complaint against his son, he was unable to pay the injured party himself and was therefore deprived of the opportunity to prevent charges from being filed against his son.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff claims that the resulting juvenile proceedings against his son were faulty because he and his wife, Andrea Howard, who is D.H.'s mother, were never notified of the proceedings against their son.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   He asserts that Defendant Chester County Office of Juvenile Probation and Juvenile Court Probation Officer Melissa Creedon improperly issued a summons for Miles, rather than Plaintiff, to bring D.H. to court for juvenile proceedings. In response to the summons, Miles sent a letter to Creedon, explaining that she was not D.H.'s guardian and that Plaintiff was, but this letter did not provide contact information for Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleges that his sister, Kimberly Brunson, also called Creedon with the same information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff asserts that he and D.H. were in Maryland at the time the summons was issued, and that Kimberly Brunson and her husband, John Brunson, brought D.H. from Maryland to Pennsylvania to attend the initial hearing \"against [Plaintiff's] wishes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that Defendants improperly allowed the proceedings to continue against his son, despite knowing that Plaintiff should have been properly and formally notified of them. Plaintiff claims that, at the first hearing, Defendant Creedon hid the fact that Miles was not D.H.'s guardian from the hearing officer and proceeded with the case knowing that Plaintiff was not personally notified. At the second hearing, Plaintiff claims that Creedon, along with Defendant Keith DiFabio, a lawyer from Defendant law firm Platt, DiGiorgio and DiFabio, failed to inform the hearing officer that Plaintiff was D.H.'s guardian.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to his claims related to lack of notice, Plaintiff asserts that Defendant Tredyffrin Easttown School District (\"the School District\") improperly provided Defendant Chester County Office of Juvenile Probation with information related to D.H.'s Individualized Education Program (\"IEP\"). Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that, without his consent, Miles signed off on the School District's continued use of an IEP for D.H., as well as the release of this IEP to Creedon for use in D.H.'s juvenile proceedings. According to Plaintiff, this was improper because Miles, D.H.'s grandmother, is a \"third party,\" and as D.H.'s father, Plaintiff should have been consulted on decisions related to D.H.'s IEP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff, through his Third Amended Complaint, asserts causes of action under the United States Constitution, federal statutes, the Pennsylvania Constitution, and common law. Plaintiff also filed for preliminary injunctive relief, seeking to enjoin Defendants Chester County Office of Juvenile Probation and Parole, and Probation Officers Melissa Creedon and Jamie Durning, from taking any further actions against his son, D.H.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court held a hearing on August 14, 2018, at which witnesses, including Plaintiff, Beverly Miles, and Andrea Howard, testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In contrast to Plaintiff's conclusory allegations against Defendants, the evidence and testimony presented at the hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction and documents appended to the parties' briefs, show that Plaintiff was afforded every opportunity to participate in his son's hearings but that he refused to do so. While Plaintiff testified that he was upset that he was not being \"involved in any of the decisions that have been made\" regarding his son, he also testified that he decided, on his own, to not be involved because he was \"angry about the fact that [he] was never notified\" of his son's arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, Plaintiff admitted that he knew about most, if not all of D.H.'s hearings, including the initial intake hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   which Andrea Howard explained \"everybody\" attended including herself, D.H.'s aunt and uncles, and Miles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Plaintiff alleges that the Office of Juvenile Probation and individual probation officers did not try to involve D.H.'s parents in the matter, Andrea Howard testified that, at that initial hearing, the officers \"wanted to know who was all in the room,\" and that \"they knew [she] was there, they knew [she] was a parent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Andrea Howard further explained that she gave the Office of Juvenile Probation her contact information at that same hearing, after which she received notice for each of D.H.'s court dates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both Andrea Howard and Miles testified that they attended all but one court date, and Plaintiff admitted that his sister and brother-in-law, despite having no more information than he did, went to at least one hearing and hired D.H. an attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff, on the other hand, did not attend a single hearing, despite being aware of them, and even sought to prevent his son from attending the initial intake hearing; D.H. was only able to attend because Plaintiff's sister brought him there \"against [Plaintiff's] will and knowledge.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Plaintiff never provided the Office of Juvenile Probation with his contact information as Andrea Howard had done, and instead asked Miles to write a letter to the Office,\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   which stated D.H. and Plaintiff moved and their location was \"unknown at th[at] time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even when the Office of Juvenile Probation ultimately obtained Plaintiff's contact information and sent him formal notice, he refused to attend his son's hearing, because he \"didn't\n   want to be involved,\" in the process he determined was \"illegal.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   All Defendants moved to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, to which Plaintiff has responded. On December 7, 2018, the Court directed the parties to file statements as to whether any of the motions to dismiss should be converted to motions for summary judgment in order to allow the Court to consider the evidence and testimony presented at the hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction. All parties, except Plaintiff, filed a statement as directed by the Court. All Defendants, except the School District, requested that their motions be converted to summary judgment motions, and on January 3, 2019, all motions, excluding the School District's motion, were so converted. The parties were then permitted to submit materials in support of, or in opposition to, summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A court will award summary judgment on a claim or part of a claim where there is \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   A fact is \"material\" if resolving the dispute over the fact \"might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing [substantive] law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   A dispute is \"genuine\" if \"the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In evaluating a summary judgment motion, a court \"must view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party,\" and make every reasonable inference in that party's favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, a court may not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, the party opposing summary judgment must support each essential element of the opposition with concrete evidence in the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"If the evidence is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   This requirement upholds the \"underlying purpose of summary judgment [which] is to avoid a pointless trial in cases where it is unnecessary and would only cause delay and expense.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, if, after making all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party, the court determines that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact, summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a plaintiff must plead \"factual content that\n   allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"enough facts to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence of the necessary element\" of a claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, \"[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level...on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact)....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   The question is not whether the plaintiff ultimately will prevail but whether the complaint is \"sufficient to cross the federal court's threshold.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In evaluating a challenged complaint, a court must \"accept all factual allegations as true, construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and determine whether, under any reasonable reading of the complaint, the plaintiff may be entitled to relief.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Court must draw all reasonable inferences from the allegations in favor of the plaintiff,\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   it \"need not accept as true 'unsupported conclusions and unwarranted inferences,' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   or the plaintiff's \"bald assertions\" or \"legal conclusions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In evaluating a motion to dismiss, courts may not consider matters extraneous to the pleadings, other than \"document[s] integral to or explicitly relied upon in the complaint.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, this Court analyzes the School District's motions to dismiss without consideration of the testimony presented at the hearing on Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Plaintiff separately asserts violations of the Sixth Amendment against the Platt, DiGiorgio and DiFabio Law Firm and attorneys Vincent DiFabio and Keith DiFabio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiff's claim under the Eighth Amendment must be dismissed for lack of standing, because the injuries Plaintiff refers to are not personal to Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleges that his rights under the Eighth Amendment were violated by Defendants' actions that injure D.H., including \"scarring him for life,\" making him miss his senior prom, incarceration, and \"other forms of punishment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   In general, \"[i]njuries to a parent resulting from violations of their child's constitutional rights are not sufficiently personal for purposes of the parent's individual standing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Plaintiff has only alleged injury to his son, and not to himself, he cannot sue based on this alleged harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Additionally, all of Plaintiff's constitutional claims against the Chester County Office of Juvenile Probation, and the probation officers in their official capacity, must be dismissed because these Defendants are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity. The Eleventh Amendment provides immunity to \"subunits of the State,\" which, according to the Third Circuit, includes the County Probation and Parole Departments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because a suit against a state officer in his or her official capacity is \"no different from a suit against the state itself,\" the probation officers are also afforded this Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   This immunity shields the Chester County Office of Juvenile Probation and the probation officers in their official capacity from Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court will address the remaining claims against Defendants who have moved for summary judgment, including Creedon and Durning in their individual capacities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    a. Easttown Township Police Department and Officer Kevin Price\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff claims that the police violated his constitutional rights when they failed to notify Plaintiff that his son was\n   accused of damaging a car. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that this lack of notice deprived him of the ability to reconcile with the aggrieved party.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Police Department and Officer Price argue that Plaintiff has failed to specify what recognized right or privilege the police violated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff has not alleged a violation of his constitutional rights. According to Plaintiff's own allegations, the police called the home where D.H. and Plaintiff resided\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   and then released D.H. to his grandmother to take D.H. to that home, rather than taking him into juvenile detention. According to Miles, when she picked up D.H., she told the police \"that [she] was the grandmother and [D.H.] did live with [her].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Plaintiff has not identified a recognized constitutionally protected right to reconcile with the aggrieved party. Therefore, Plaintiff may not maintain a \u00a7 1983 action based on such a claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    b. Platt, DiGiorgio and DiFabio Law Firm, Vincent DiFabio, and Keith DiFabio\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff states that attorneys Vincent DiFabio and Keith DiFabio (privately retained by Miles, Kimberly Brunson, and John Brunson), as well as their law firm, violated Plaintiff's constitutional rights, including his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, by failing to inform the hearing officer at D.H.'s juvenile proceedings that Plaintiff, not Miles, was D.H.'s guardian.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the attorneys did not act under color of state law, a \u00a7 1983 suit cannot be brought against them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    c. Probation Officers Melissa Creedon and Jamie Durning in Their Individual Capacities\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Creedon and Durning, in their individual capacities, violated his rights under the United States Constitution when they failed to formally notify Plaintiff of the complaint against his son and allowed the juvenile proceedings against his son to continue despite this lack of notice. Defendants Creedon and Durning argue that qualified immunity shields them from these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Qualified immunity protects government officials from liability \"for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable\n   person would have known.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   A \"clearly established right\" is one that is \"sufficiently clear that every reasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   To be sufficiently clear, existing precedent must place the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   This standard gives government officials \"ample room for mistaken judgments,\" protecting \"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   When determining whether a clearly established right was violated, the courts should look, not to a high level of generality, but to the specific context in which the alleged violations occurred. The inquiry, therefore, is \"whether the violative nature of\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   conduct is clearly established,\" and, consequently, whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his or her conduct was unlawful under the circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   For a defendant government official to be on notice that his or her conduct is constitutionally prohibited, there must be \"sufficient precedent ... factually similar to the plaintiff's allegations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   With regard to Plaintiff's allegations, it is certainly true that the parent-child relationship is afforded constitutional protection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rights relating to the parent-child relationship arise, by and large, in the context of the permanent termination of such relationships, such as in adoption or where the state takes custody of a child. Even in such situations, though, the rights of parents relating to raising their children are not absolute, nor are they \"beyond regulation [by the state] in the public interest.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The particular circumstances of this case do not provide any basis for Plaintiff's constitutional claims against Creedon or Durning. Plaintiff asserts that Creedon improperly proceeded with D.H.'s case, knowing that \"no notification was given to the custodian parent (plaintiff) or any parent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, even if, as Plaintiff alleges, Creedon was informed that Plaintiff was the proper guardian, Plaintiff did not provide the probation office with a\n   phone number or address by which to reach him,\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the letter that Miles provided to the probation office stated that D.H. and Plaintiff moved and their location was \"unknown at this time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, although Plaintiff alleges that he was not notified, he admits that notice was sent to the address where he resided with D.H. and Miles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also testified that he was made aware of many, if not all, of D.H.'s court hearings before they occurred, and chose not to attend because he thought the process should be invalidated and was \"angry about the fact that [he] was never notified.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather than attend his son's hearings, Plaintiff's testimony made clear that he was preoccupied with what he interpreted as inadequate communication by the police who allowed D.H. to go home with his grandmother, and that as a result, he \"didn't think about ... the hearing\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"none of that stuff mattered - none of that stuff counted.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In contrast, D.H.'s mother, Andrea Howard, who Plaintiff acknowledges also had \"control over the care, custody and control\" of D.H.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   attended at least two of D.H.'s hearings\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   and explained that she received notices for D.H.'s hearings because she provided her address and phone number at D.H.'s intake hearing, which she attended in person.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, Andrea Howard testified that, at the intake hearing, someone from the Juvenile Probation and Parole Department asked if a parent was there, and that they \"knew [she] was there, they knew [she] was a parent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Furthermore, Plaintiff's parental rights were not terminated by the state; rather, his son was prosecuted as a juvenile delinquent in juvenile court proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   These juvenile proceedings were open to D.H.'s family members which could, and did, participate in them, except for Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Plaintiff cannot prevail on his constitutional claim in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Even if the constitutional protection of the parent-child relationship extended to the circumstances of Plaintiff's case, it cannot be viewed as \"clearly established\" so as to deprive Defendants of qualified immunity. The level of family support at the hearings for D.H., the fact that notice of the hearings were sent to the address where Plaintiff was living with D.H. and Miles, and the lack of any alternative means to contact Plaintiff, establish that there is no basis for determining that a \"reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates\" any right alleged by Plaintiff.

THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S MOTION TO DISMISS ALL COUNTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The factual allegations involving the School District are few, and concern only its alleged disclosure of information related to D.H.'s IEP to other Defendants, and the continued use of an IEP for D.H. at school.

Additionally, although Plaintiff asserts that his claims under the Pennsylvania Constitution are against \"all Defendants,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    109\n   </footnotemark>\n   he has not alleged that the School District engaged in any conduct that could conceivably be interpreted as an unreasonable search or seizure or as discrimination against Plaintiff, and such claims will not be entertained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    1.
