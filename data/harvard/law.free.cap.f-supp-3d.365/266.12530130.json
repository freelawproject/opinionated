Schult (\"Warden Shult\"), Warden Russell Perdue (\"Warden Perdue\"), and Counselor Jackii Sepanek (\"Counselor Sepanek\") (collectively \"defendants\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   forced Walker to endure hazardous, unsanitary conditions in a dangerous, overcrowded prison cell at the Federal Correctional Institution in Ray Brook, New York (\"FCI Ray Brook\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On August 25, 2011, defendants moved to dismiss Walker's complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6). Defendants argued that plaintiff failed to: (1) exhaust his administrative remedies; (2) adequately plead an Eighth Amendment claim; or (3) sufficiently allege the personal involvement of the named defendants. Defendants further argued that qualified immunity shielded them from liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On January 20, 2012, U.S. Magistrate Judge Randolph F. Treece filed a Report-Recommendation and Order in which he: (1) construed plaintiff's complaint as one filed under\n   <em>\n    Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    403 U.S. 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    91 S.Ct. 1999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027206\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/388/\">\n    29 L.Ed.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1971)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (2) declined to conclude plaintiff failed to administratively exhaust; but nevertheless (3) agreed that plaintiff failed to state an Eighth Amendment claim, concluding in the alternative that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity as to some of the conduct alleged.\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Schult\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201037441\">\n    2012 WL 1037441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 20, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On February 27, 2012, still pro se, Walker filed several objections to Judge Treece's Report-Recommendation and Order. Those objections were overruled by Senior U.S. District Judge Lawrence E. Kahn, who adopted in full the Report-Recommendation and Order and dismissed plaintiff's complaint.\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Schult\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201037442\">\n    2012 WL 1037442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.N.Y. Mar. 27, 2012). Plaintiff appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On May 23, 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the dismissal of Walker's complaint.\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Schult\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576253\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/119/\">\n    717 F.3d 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2013). As relevant here, the panel held that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   the district court erred by dismissing Walker's complaint for failure to state a claim. First, he plausibly alleged conditions that, perhaps alone and certainly in combination, deprived him of a minimal civilized measure of life's necessities. Second, he plausibly alleged that defendants were deliberately indifferent to this deprivation. Third, he plausibly alleged violations of clearly established rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576253\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/119/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576253\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/119/\">\n    . at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On June 11, 2014, following limited discovery, defendants moved under Rule 56 for partial summary judgment on the basis that Walker failed to exhaust his administrative remedies in accordance with the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), which requires a plaintiff to comply with available prison grievance procedures as a precondition to bringing suit. Notably, defendants' briefing advanced the notion that plaintiff failed to properly exhaust each of\n   <em>\n    twelve\n   </em>\n   distinct claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On October 15, 2014, Judge Treece filed a Report-Recommendation and Order rejecting defendants' characterization of Walker's complaint, observing that the \"stirring description\" of cell conditions set forth by plaintiff was not \"merely an array of discrete allegations and independent claims\" but instead \"one overarching Eighth Amendment conditions of confinement claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Judge Treece therefore recommended denying defendants' motion because Walker \"procedurally and substantively complied\" with the grievance process as to this single, overarching claim even though he did not individually \"grieve every single fact or issue he encountered stemming from or exacerbated by his incarceration in an overcrowded cell.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On November 3, 2014, defendants objected to the portion of Judge Treece's Report-Recommendation and Order that concluded Walker asserted, and then properly exhausted, \"one overarching conditions-of-confinement claim.\" Those objections were overruled by Judge Kahn, who adopted in full the Report-Recommendation and Order and denied defendants' motion for partial summary judgment on exhaustion.\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Schult\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207014674\">\n    2014 WL 7014674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 11, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On November 30, 2015, following the remainder of discovery, defendants again moved under Rule 56 seeking summary judgment. This time around, defendants argued Walker failed to marshal sufficient evidence to succeed on the merits of his Eighth Amendment conditions-of-confinement claim. In the alternative, defendants renewed their assertion that qualified immunity shielded them from individual liability. Judge Kahn rejected those arguments and denied defendants' motion.\n   <em>\n    Walker v. Schult\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204203536\">\n    2016 WL 4203536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On October 11, 2016, defendants noticed an interlocutory appeal from Judge Kahn's Memorandum-Decision &amp; Order denying summary judgment (presumably on the immunity issue), but later moved to voluntarily dismiss that appeal in favor of taking the case to trial.\n   <em>\n    Schult v. Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%209819317\">\n    2016 WL 9819317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. Oct. 18, 2016). Thereafter, Judge Kahn transferred the matter to Senior U.S. District Judge Thomas J. McAvoy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On September 27, 2017, Walker's case was reassigned to this Court. The parties have filed or renewed motions seeking various rulings in advance of the trial, which is now re-set for May 13, 2019 in Utica, New York. The motions have been fully briefed and will be considered on the basis of the submissions without oral argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   On November 18, 2008, Walker arrived at FCI Ray Brook, where Counselor Sepanek assigned him to the top bunk of a bed in Cell 127 in the Mohawk Unit B building. Although intended to house only four adult male inmates, defendants used Cell 127 to hold six men for most of the roughly two and a half years plaintiff spent confined at the facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   During this period, Walker shared the overcrowded accommodations in Cell 127 with a rotating cast of cellmates. According to plaintiff, the fully occupied cell afforded each man fewer than seventeen square feet of space, a number which falls significantly below the relevant minimum standards outlined by the American Correctional Association (\"ACA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Walker claims the taxing conditions in Cell 127 led to violence, sleep deprivation, and sanitation problems. According to plaintiff, inadequate ventilation and extreme swings in temperature exacerbated this state of affairs. Plaintiff alleges that even though he repeatedly complained about the conditions in Cell 127, no named defendant ever investigated the matter or took meaningful steps to remedy the problems. Instead, plaintiff received boilerplate denials to his written grievances, including two signed by Warden Schult and Counselor Sepanek. Plaintiff's ordeal ended in April 2011, when authorities transferred him to another facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants see things differently, of course. They claim that virtually all of the conditions about which Walker complains were standard features of BOP-run prisons that the named defendants were powerless to change. And while they acknowledge he spent time at FCI Ray Brook in Cell 127 with various other inmates, they insist plaintiff must be exaggerating his story-after all, he waited well over a year before he filed any grievances about the conditions in his cell. They also note that although all the remaining defendants were employed at FCI Ray Brook for at least\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of the relevant time period, Warden Perdue only overlapped with the final few weeks of plaintiff's stay. According to defendants, only Counselor Sepanek actually worked in plaintiff's housing unit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARDS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Motions in limine\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \"As a general matter, all relevant evidence is admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence unless specifically excluded.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To review, the Second Circuit concluded plaintiff pleaded a viable Eighth Amendment conditions-of-confinement claim based on his allegations that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   for approximately twenty-eight months, he was confined in a cell with five other men, with inadequate space and ventilation, stifling heat in the summer and freezing cold in the winter, unsanitary conditions, including urine and feces splattered on the floor, insufficient cleaning supplies, a mattress too narrow for him to lie on flat, and noisy, crowded conditions that made sleep difficult and place him at constant risk of violence and serious harm from cellmates.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576253\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/119/\">\n    717 F.3d at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In the Second Circuit's view, these factual allegations were sufficient to state an Eighth Amendment claim for four principal reasons. As the panel explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   First, it is well settled that exposing prisoners to extreme temperatures without adequate ventilation may violate the Eighth Amendment .... Second, sleep is critical to human existence, and conditions that prevent sleep have been held to violate the Eighth Amendment .... Third, we have long recognize that unsanitary conditions in a prison cell can, in egregious circumstances, rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment .... Indeed, unsanitary conditions lasting for mere days may constitute and Eighth Amendment violation .... Further, the failure to provide prisoners with toiletries and other hygienic materials may rise to the level of a constitutional violation .... Fourth, conditions that place a prisoner at a 'substantial risk of serious harm' from other inmates may constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576253\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/119/\">\n    717 F.3d at 127-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (cleaned up).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For the most part, these allegations were later substantiated as testimonial evidence by Walker in opposition to defendants' motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204203536\">\n    2016 WL 4203536\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-*5. As a result, Judge Kahn held that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   if Plaintiff proves all of the facts he alleges, he would prove multiple deprivations of the sort of necessities recognized by higher courts.

To the extent that testimony, documents, or other evidence might tend to undermine plaintiff's version of events, defendants can and should examine Dr. Gilligan about how those changed circumstances would alter or otherwise undermine his expert opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   Defendants next argue that Dr. Gilligan improperly proposes to opine on whether Walker suffered cruel and unusual punishment at FCI Ray Brook. According to defendants, Dr. Gilligan essentially intends to \"recite the facts of the case\" and then offer a conclusion \"about how the law should be applied to those facts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   Walker responds that this characterization of Dr. Gilligan's report is inaccurate. As plaintiff explains, Dr. Gilligan proposes to opine that the conditions alleged by plaintiff, if true, amount to psychological \"torture\" or \"cruel, degrading and inhumane treatment\" within the meaning of, and based upon, generally accepted medical and psychiatric standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Defendants argue that permitting Dr. Gilligan to use the word \"torture\" in his testimony will unfairly prejudice their defense because it will mislead the jury into believing this case is about torture, which defendants claim is a \"well-known concept, easy for jurors to understand and condemn.\" According to defendants, the jury will fail to understand the \"more complicated claim Plaintiff has actually brought for unlawful conditions of confinement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   This argument is also rejected. To be sure, the word \"torture\" is one freighted with strong emotion. But Dr. Gilligan's report indicates that \"[c]onditions such as prolonged sleep deprivation, exposure to extreme temperatures and severe overcrowding have long been considered forms of torture within the international community of mental health professionals,\" of which he is a part. In other words, this appears to be a medical opinion, not a legal one, and it is based on Dr. Gilligan's academic and professional expertise in the fields of psychology and medicine and his work experience in and around the prison setting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   In sum, after considering the parties' arguments and upon review of Dr. Gilligan's expert report in light of the governing standard,\n   <em>\n    defendants' motion to preclude his expert testimony will be denied. As with this and every other evidentiary issue, the Court will exercise its authority during trial to prevent superfluous, cumulative, or otherwise inappropriate testimony.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Jury Visit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Defendants request authorization for a jury visit of FCI Ray Brook, either in person or through use of recorded video. Dkt. No. 192. Defendants argue that the jury will better understand Walker's \"overall living conditions\" if they are treated to an in-person view of Cell 127, the adjacent common areas, the housing unit, and the prison complex. According to defendants, mere photographs of the cell \"cannot adequately portray the 'space' in which Plaintiff was living.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Walker responds that this request should be denied because it would mislead the jury. As plaintiff explains, it is imperative that the jury be provided with an accurate description of the conditions in Cell 127 as they were at the time plaintiff lived there, not as they might be now, nearly a decade later. Plaintiff asserts that photographs reveal that defendants have already taken \"significant steps\" to alter the appearance of the cell, including thoroughly cleaning the cell, removing certain furniture, and even possibly repainting the walls. According to plaintiff, showing the jury a pristine, vacant cell would be unhelpful in resolving the issues in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   The Second Circuit has not said very much about how a trial court should evaluate a party's request for a jury visit. In a per curiam opinion handed down in 1953, the Second Circuit concluded the trial court had properly denied a visit where witness testimony and photographs adequately described the scene of the crime.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pagano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"564966\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/207/884/\">\n    207 F.2d 884\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , (2d Cir. 1953) (per curiam) (reviewing denial of jury visit for abuse of discretion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Since\n   <em>\n    Pagano\n   </em>\n   , at least one district court in our Circuit confronted with the issue of whether to permit a jury visit has found guidance elsewhere.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

June 10, 2010). In\n   <em>\n    Praisner\n   </em>\n   , the trial court evaluated several factors identified by the First Circuit in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Crochiere\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11894049\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/129/233/#p236\">\n    129 F.3d 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 236 (1st Cir. 1997), including: \"(1) the orderliness of the trial; (2) whether the jury would be confused or misled; (3) whether it would be time-consuming or logistically difficult; and (4) whether cross-examination had been permitted regarding the details of the scene.\"\n   <em>\n    Praisner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%202574087\">\n    2010 WL 2574087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Defendants acknowledge that bussing the jury to Ray Brook would likely involve a full day, but argue that any logistical concerns would be \"greatly outweighed by the benefit to the jury of seeing the prison first-hand,\" and would help \"avoid any confusion that may arise with describing the facility with witness testimony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Walker responds that a visit cannot replicate the the reality of \"six men living in a single cell with the doors closed for hours on end.\" According to plaintiff, \"the air quality, ventilation, and temperature in the cell will hardly be representative of the conditions\" he endured. To the contrary, a pre-planned visit to a \"staged cell\" will have the opposite effect-it will permit defendants to present a \"rosy version\" of FCI Ray Brook.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Walker has the better of this argument, and it is not a close call. A jury visit would impose significant logistical hurdles with little payoff and huge risks. First, the trip from Utica to Ray Brook is neither short nor direct. Second, this case poses security headaches above and beyond those already inherent in safeguarding a jury outside the confines of a federal courthouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Rather than visiting a discrete location in a public space, such as the scene of a particular crime, defendants seek a tour of FCI Ray Brook, a large prison complex that holds a population of federal inmates. As Walker points out, it is likely that prison officials would relocate inmates away from areas shown to the jurors. This would provide an inaccurate representation of those common spaces, since Walker did not have the prison to himself during the time period at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   That fact, of course, leads into another reason a visit would be unwarranted, in-person or otherwise. The jury will see a version of Cell 127 that will look, feel, and smell nothing like Walker testified it did when he shared the space with five other men. Rather than enhance the jury's understanding of the issues, a visit to FCI Ray Brook now, in 2019, is likely to form in their minds an image of the facility that reflects testimony of only one side of the case: defendants' side.\n   <em>\n    Marquez v.

According to plaintiff, the parties have already stipulated to the measurements necessary to calculate these amounts. Defendants do not oppose the mathematical calculations but object to plaintiff's usage of \"unencumbered\" and explain that the \"per inmate\" description of the space is not entirely accurate. According to defendants, trial evidence will show that the cell did not always house six inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Second, Walker requests judicial notice of the ACA standards that are relevant to this case. These include, among other things, the ACA's standards for how many inmates can be safely housed in a prison facility, the organization's definition of \"unencumbered space,\" and its formula for making that calculation on a \"per inmate\" basis. Defendants oppose this request as an improper subject for judicial notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Third, Walker request judicial notice of the daily temperatures at FCI Ray Brook from November 18, 2008 to April 18, 2011 using weather records. Defendants object to this request as ambiguous and possibly irrelevant. As defendants point out, the temperature outside the facility is not\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   relevant with how warm or cold the space inside the facility might be. However, they agree that it would be proper to take judicial notice of the \"actual daily high and low temperatures\" during that time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Fourth, Walker request judicial notice of certain \"lockdown\" periods that took place at FCI Ray Brook. Plaintiff argues these \"lockdown\" periods are documented in a decision of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (\"FLRA\") and a newspaper article. Defendants object because plaintiff's description of the FLRA's written decision is inaccurate. Further, defendants object to plaintiff's characterization of what these \"lockdown\" periods entailed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <em>\n    Upon review, this motion is granted in part and denied in part. The Court will take judicial notice of the actual high and low temperatures in the Ray Brook area during the relevant time period.
