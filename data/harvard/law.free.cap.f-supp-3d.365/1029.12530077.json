BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September 2010, the Office of the Attorney General for the State of California (\"OAG\"), as part of its responsibility for regulating charitable entities, approved\n   Plaintiff Deanco Healthcare, LLC's attempt to purchase Mission Community Hospital from a nonprofit organization. (Compl. \u00b6 30, ECF No. 1.) As a condition of the approval, the OAG required Plaintiff to provide a minimum amount of charity care to indigent and uninsured individuals, or to provide financial support to nonprofit organizations in Plaintiff's area that do (hereinafter, the \"Charity Care Condition\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.) In July 2013, when the purchase \"closed,\" Plaintiff confirmed its commitment to comply with the conditions of purchase for the next six years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff now claims that, as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"Affordable Care Act\") and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, from 2013 to 2017, the number of uninsured individuals in California dropped from 17.2% to 7.2%. (Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss (\"Opp'n) 1, ECF No. 25.) Plaintiff complains that instead of enjoying the success of the Affordable Care Act, it \"has been punished by every individual since 2010 who has procured health insurance.\" (Compl. \u00b6 10.) As a result of more individuals having insurance, the demand for charity care at Plaintiff's hospital decreased, resulting in Plaintiff's alleged inability to comply with the Charity Care Condition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2016, Plaintiff requested that Defendants modify the threshold for the Charity Care Condition due to the impact of the Affordable Care Act. (Compl. \u00b6 46.) In response, Defendants commissioned a third-party consultant to conduct a study of the charity care needs in Plaintiff's hospital's community, and, on March 9, 2018, held a public hearing on Plaintiff's request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58, 59.) Following the study and public hearing, on April 13, 2018, Defendants denied Plaintiff's request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 10, 2018, Plaintiff filed the instant suit seeking to invalidate the Charity Care Condition on the basis that it is preempted by federal law. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.)

(Opp'n 5.) Plaintiff identifies three factors that the Court should consider before stripping immunity from state agencies: \"(1) whether the agency performs 'essentially governmental' functions, (2) whether the agency has the right to sue on its own behalf and (3) whether the agency has power to take and hold property in its own name.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff has not met its burden. Plaintiff's Complaint contains no facts in support of any of these factors that would warrant stripping the OAG of its immunity. Additionally, Plaintiff provides no authority where a court has stripped the OAG of its immunity. The OAG is undoubtedly an arm of the state. \"The Eleventh Amendment protects the State from the\n   <em>\n    risk\n   </em>\n   of adverse judgments ....\"\n   <em>\n    Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v.

Field preemption can be inferred from a regulation that is \"so pervasive ... that Congress left no room for the [s]tates to supplement it or where there is a federal interest ... so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709171\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/732/1006/#p1022\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3709171\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/732/1006/#p1022\">\n    at 1022-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiff does not identify the field that Congress intended to occupy through EMTALA. Thus, the Court is left to speculate what field Plaintiff believes Congress intended to occupy through EMTALA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montalvo v. Spirit Airlines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046822\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/464/#p470\">\n    508 F.3d 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 470 (9th Cir. 2007) (identifying a field in which Congress intended to occupy for the purposes of field preemption).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Additionally, EMTALA is explicit regarding preemption. EMTALA contains a statement indicating a general congressional intent not to preempt state law: \"[t]he provisions of this section do not preempt any State or local law requirement, except to the extent that the requirement directly conflicts with a requirement of this section.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395dd(f). The text of the statute is unambiguous that EMTALA would preempt state law only if the state requirement directly conflicted with the requirements of EMTALA. Accordingly, \"[w]hen Congress has considered the issue of preemption and has included ... a provision explicitly addressing that issue ... there is no need to infer congressional intent to preempt state laws from the substantive provisions of the legislation.\"\n   <em>\n    Draper v.

In fact, as it relates to EMTALA, Plaintiff freely admits that \"[d]uring all relevant times herein, [Plaintiff] has complied with its obligations under 42 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 1395dd,\" and Plaintiff makes no allegation that the Charity Care Condition obstructs the accomplishment and execution of EMTALA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Additionally, as it relates to Medicaid and Medicaid Expansion, Plaintiff does not allege conflict preemption. Instead, Plaintiff's allegation is that the Charity Care Condition makes it less lucrative to comply with Medicaid law, specifically that the Charity Care Condition penalizes Plaintiff and that \"the incentives created by Congress become pyrrhic at best.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) Like EMTALA, Plaintiff is able to comply with its Medicaid obligations and meet the Charity Care Condition; it just may not be as profitable as it once was. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90.) Moreover, Plaintiff makes no claim that the Charity Care Condition hindered Congress's intent behind Medicaid and Medicaid Expansion or that the Charity Care Condition negatively affected Congress's ability to subsidize medical services to needy individuals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587457\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1378/#p1382\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1382,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12587457\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1378/#p1382\">\n    191 L.Ed.2d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (\"Medicaid is a federal program that subsidizes the States' provision of medical services ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The crux of Plaintiff's claim is that there are more individuals who have medical insurance and less individuals who need charity care because of the Affordable Care Act, and as a result, Plaintiff cannot meet the minimum amount of charity care as set forth in the Charity Care Condition without having to drive the streets \"looking for those most ill among the homeless population.\" (Opp'n 2, 21.) Even if there are more people who have medical insurance as a result of the Affordable Care Act, this does not explain why Plaintiff cannot comply with the other component of the Charity Care Condition, specifically, providing financial support to nonprofit organizations in Plaintiff's area that do provide charity care. Simply because it is more difficult for Plaintiff to comply with the Charity Care Condition does not mean that the Charity Care Condition has been preempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiff has failed to identify how the Charity Care Condition stands as an obstacle to the full purposes and objectives of Congress when it enacted the ACA. Although the Court appreciates the history lesson of the different federal statutes and the purpose of charity care, neither the Opposition nor the Complaint explains how the Charity Care Condition contravenes Congress's objective or intent. Plaintiff's Complaint actually alleges that the Charity Care Condition has\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   affected Congress' goal in enacting the ACA, namely to decrease the number of uninsured individuals. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 57.) Defendants are correct that Plaintiff has it backwards, \"[a]lthough [Plaintiff] alleges that its compliance with federal law makes it more difficult (or most costly) to meet its charity care condition, it does not ... allege that the charity care condition has\n   any impact whatsoever on its ability to comply with federal law.\" (Mot. 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    V. LEAVE TO AMEND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As a general rule, a court should freely give leave to amend a complaint that has been dismissed. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). But a court may deny leave to amend when \"the court determines that the allegation of other facts consistent with the challenged pleading could not possibly cure the deficiency.\"\n   <em>\n    Schreiber Distrib.

Amendment would be futile as it could not possibly cure the deficiencies in Plaintiff's Complaint. No amendment could change the fact, as alleged in Plaintiff's Complaint, that Plaintiff continues to meet both its obligations under the federal laws discussed above and the Charity Care Condition, and that the Charity Care Condition does not stand as an obstacle to the federal laws previously discussed.
