The first stage is bifurcated to address two separate questions posed by 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(1)(B), namely, whether (i) there are significant price differences and (ii) there is a pattern to the price differences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 11; Decision Mem. for the Prelim.

It is these two determinations-whether price differences are significant and whether those differences form a pattern-that SeAH argues are factual findings embedded in Commerce's differential pricing analysis and for which substantial evidence must be proffered on every record. However, what SeAH refers to as factual findings embedded in the differential pricing analysis are actually interpretative choices Commerce made to implement 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(1)(B) because the statutory terms \"significant\" and \"pattern\" are undefined and are ambiguous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Congress delegates discretion to the\n   agency to make such interpretive choices when the terms of the statute are ambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p843\">\n    467 U.S. at 843-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p843\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has found that all components of the differential pricing analysis are reasonable mechanisms for Commerce to satisfy the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, the court did not, as SeAH contends, \"h[o]ld that the substantial evidence requirement did not apply in this case because the 'Differential Pricing Analysis' is simply an interpretation of a statutory provision, which must be upheld if the Court finds that it is 'reasonable.' \" SeAH's Mot. at 5 (citing\n   <em>\n    Stupp I\n   </em>\n   , 43 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12529576\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/359/1293/#p1299\">\n    359 F.Supp.3d at 1302-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). SeAH's characterization of the holding reveals its misunderstanding of when this Court applies the substantial evidence standard. The Court reviews whether the outputs of Commerce's methodology are supported by substantial evidence on this record; as it did in\n   <em>\n    Stupp I\n   </em>\n   . The Court does not review whether Commerce's methodology, which is an interpretation of a statute, is supported by substantial evidence. Instead, the court evaluates whether the methodology reasonably implements a given statutory directive. SeAH's reading of the court's holding is likely colored by its position, which is based on a false premise, that the differential pricing analysis is merely a general policy statement and as such, \"must be reviewed as if the policy had never been adopted.\" SeAH's Mot. at 2-3 (citing and quoting\n   <em>\n    Pac.

The differential pricing analysis is not a policy; it is the result of Commerce interpreting 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(1)(B) and devising a methodology to effectuate that interpretation. The statute affords Commerce the ability to interpret the statutory terms absent rule making.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Apex\n   </em>\n   , 40 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5915544\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/1308/#p1316\">\n    144 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1320-21 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p843\">\n    467 U.S. at 843-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/#p843\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It would be inappropriate to review the methodology itself pursuant to the substantial evidence standard.
