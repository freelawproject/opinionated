(collectively, Defendants), for professional negligence and breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both claims are based on allegations of legal malpractice. Defendants filed Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (Motion), which is fully briefed, in which they contend that Plaintiff's claims are time-barred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court agrees and will grant the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 19, 2006, Plaintiff underwent a pelvic ultrasound at Lovelace Women's Hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico, after she sought treatment there for pelvic pain. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. The ultrasound revealed a potentially cancerous mass on her ovary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. However, Plaintiff was not informed of this report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   On August 8, 2006, Plaintiff went to a follow-up consultation with Dr. John D. Berryman, who was employed by Sandia OB/GYN Associates, P.C., and had an office located inside Lovelace\n   Women's Hospital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Dr. Berryman informed Plaintiff that she had ovarian cysts that were \"nothing to worry about.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. He diagnosed Plaintiff with endometriosis and did not schedule a biopsy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 22, 2008, Plaintiff sought further treatment in Jackson, Wyoming, for the same pelvic pain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. A CT scan revealed an \"extensive abnormality in the pelvis with what appears to be a large, multilobulated complex cystic mass.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Soon after this, Plaintiff was diagnosed with ovarian cancer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. She underwent a total hysterectomy, an omentumectomy, removal of both ovaries, removal of fifty-four lymph nodes, and extensive scraping of her diaphragm and colon to remove the cancer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 1, 2008, Plaintiff retained Defendants to pursue a medical malpractice suit against Lovelace Health Systems and the doctors who failed to notify Plaintiff of the ovarian mass shown on her May 19, 2006 ultrasound.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. However, Plaintiff could not recall Dr. Berryman's name or the exact date of her consultation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. On April 10, 2009, Defendants filed a complaint for medical malpractice in Bernalillo County District Court on Plaintiff's behalf, naming as defendants Lovelace Health Systems, four doctors, and one physician assistant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15; Mot. Undisputed Material Facts (UMF) \u00b6 1. Defendants also named a \"John Doe\" physician as a placeholder for Dr. Berryman, explaining that his \"identity cannot be ascertained at this time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendants identified Dr. Berryman on July 1, 2010, through discovery produced by Lovelace. UMF \u00b6 4. Plaintiff knew at this time that the statute of limitations might be an issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   UMF \u00b6\u00b6 5-6, Resp. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. On July 9, 2010, Defendants amended the medical malpractice complaint and named Dr. Berryman as an individual defendant. UMF \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 13, 2011, Dr. Berryman moved for summary judgment, arguing that Plaintiff's claims against him were barred by the three-year statute of repose contained in the New Mexico Medical Malpractice Act (MMA), NMSA 1978 \u00a7 41-5-13. UMF \u00b6 10. The district court denied Dr. Berryman's motion. UMF \u00b6 10. Although the repose period specified in the MMA had expired on August 8, 2009, the district court applied a due process exception to allow Plaintiff's claim to proceed, \"concluding that application of the statutory bar would violate [Plaintiff's] right to due process as guaranteed by the United States and New Mexico Constitutions.\"\n   <em>\n    Cahn v. Berryman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018-NMSC-002\">\n    2018-NMSC-002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=408%20P.3d%201012\">\n    408 P.3d 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1014 (2017). The district court then denied Dr. Berryman's motion to reconsider this decision, but it certified its order for interlocutory appeal. Plaintiff's\n   Statement of Material Facts (PMF) \u00b6 26; Doc. 38-3, Ex. C. In September 2012, Dr. Berryman filed an Application for Interlocutory Appeal contesting the district court's denial of his motion for summary judgment. UMF \u00b6 12. The Application, which Plaintiff reviewed, alleged that Plaintiff and Defendants could have identified Dr. Berryman sooner through available discovery procedures but failed to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   UMF \u00b6\u00b6 13-15. The New Mexico Court of Appeals declined to consider the interlocutory appeal. PMF \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Consequently, in June 2013 Dr. Berryman and Plaintiff stipulated to a conditional directed verdict and final judgment. UMF \u00b6 17. In the stipulated judgment Dr. Berryman admitted his liability to Plaintiff in the amount of $ 700,000 for malpractice but reserved his right to appeal the judgment on the ground that Plaintiff's claims against him were time-barred. UMF \u00b6 17. When Plaintiff agreed to the conditional stipulated judgment, she understood that Dr. Berryman would appeal the statute of repose issue, and she would not receive any of the judgment amount if the appellate court determined that her claims against Dr. Berryman were time-barred. UMF \u00b6\u00b6 18-19. Around the time the stipulated verdict was entered, Plaintiff understood that another attorney had taken over her case from Defendants. UMF \u00b6 20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also at about this time, Plaintiff learned that Defendants had previously sued the clinic that employed Dr. Berryman in an unrelated lawsuit, and she believed Defendants had made a mistake in failing to identify Dr. Berryman sooner. UMF \u00b6 21.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dr. Berryman appealed the judgment based on the statute of repose, and on April 30, 2015, the New Mexico Court of Appeals overturned the district court and held that the due process exception did not apply and Plaintiff's malpractice claims against Dr. Berryman were untimely.

Accordingly, Plaintiff's claim is untimely if it accrued before April 27, 2014.

Plaintiff was aware of this loss; she knew that Dr. Berryman had been named as a defendant after the expiration of the statutory period, and by January 2011 she knew that he had asserted his right to avoid her claim in his motion for summary judgment. New Mexico does not require that Plaintiff be aware of the extent or permanence of her injury to trigger the start of the limitations period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sharts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994-NMSC-114\">\n    1994-NMSC-114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563439\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/118/721/\">\n    118 N.M. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563439\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/118/721/\">\n    885 P.2d 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff was given a copy of Dr. Berryman's Application for interlocutory appeal after the district court denied Dr. Berryman's motion. The Application alleged that Defendants had made mistakes that caused the untimeliness, and it outlined several ways Defendants could have identified Dr. Berryman earlier to name him as a defendant in a timely manner. Accordingly, the Court finds as a matter of law that by the time of the September 2012 Application, Plaintiff was aware, or should have been aware, that Defendants had erred in failing to identify Dr. Berryman earlier and that Defendants' actions had caused her actual injury. Further, by June 2013 Plaintiff knew that Dr. Berryman was appealing the timeliness issue, and Plaintiff testified in deposition that around this time she believed Defendants had made a mistake in not identifying Dr. Berryman sooner. The Court therefore concludes that Plaintiff's legal malpractice claim accrued by June 2013 at the latest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff asks the Court to toll the statute of limitations based on the continuous representation doctrine, arguing that Defendants were still representing her through at least the end of 2014. \"Under the continuous representation doctrine, running of the statute of limitations is tolled until the representation terminates with respect to the matters that underlie the malpractice action.\"\n   <em>\n    Sharts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1994-NMSC-114\">\n    1994-NMSC-114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563439\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/118/721/\">\n    118 N.M. 721\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563439\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/118/721/\">\n    885 P.2d 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The purpose of the doctrine is to avoid unnecessarily disrupting the attorney-client relationship.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1563439\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/118/721/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It is not clear that application of the continuous representation doctrine would toll the statute of limitations here.

Especially under these circumstances, the Court is reluctant to adopt the continuous\n   representation doctrine when New Mexico courts have declined to do so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spencer v.
