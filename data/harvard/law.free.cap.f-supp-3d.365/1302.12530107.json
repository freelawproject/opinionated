It argues that any purported deficiencies must go \"to the heart of ... corporate ownership and control\" for Commerce to deny a separate rate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Further, Hubbell argues that, although Commerce was not made aware that Jinn-Well produced potentially-subject merchandise, its status as Gem-Year's affiliate was clear from a timely-submitted organizational chart.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n    at 17-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the chart, Jinn-Well is a fully-owned subsidiary of Gem-Year and Chin-Champ Enterprise Co., Ltd., which in turn can both be traced back to the same four Taiwanese-national owners (members\n   of the Tsai Family) and public shareholders.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n    at 18-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Gem-Year Section A. Questionnaire Response, Ex. 10 \"Investment Relation Chart of Gem-Year,\" C.R. 11 (Aug. 22, 2014) (\"Gem-Year Org. Chart\"). Because Commerce assessed government control of Gem-Year and the Tsai Family, and had received at least some of Jinn-Well's financial records, Hubbell argues that Commerce ignored significant evidence showing a lack of government control that entitled it to a separate rate. Hubbell Br. at 18-20. Hubbell also stresses that the Jinn-Well merchandise constituted a very small fraction of Gem-Year's exports and that there was no indication that this merchandise was exported to the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Hubbell challenges Commerce's imposition of the PRC-wide rate resulting from an adverse inference, arguing that it is untethered to the record and punitive given Gem-Year's active participation in the review.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n    at 22-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant United States (\"the government\") and Defendant-Intervenor Vulcan Threaded Products Inc.

The government states that \"this case presents unusual circumstances in which Commerce received some separate rate information and sought to verify that information, but discovered at verification that the separate rate information was incomplete.\" Def. Br. at 13. Because Gem-Year omitted the information about Jinn-Well's production, Commerce determined that Gem-Year \"failed to cooperate to the best of its ability,\" which in turn led Commerce to disregard all of Gem-Year's proffered information as unreliable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government disagrees with claims that the information necessary to evaluate government control of Jinn-Well was on the record, pointing out in its briefing before the Court missing information, such as business licenses and plans, and Commerce's inability to verify such information given the late notice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n    at 16-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the government argues that Commerce was unable to assess \"the Chinese government's involvement in Jinn-Well's business decisions, its purchases and price-setting, or the appointment of its management.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The government claims that absent verification, it cannot validate Hubbell's assertions that the Jinn-Well merchandise was only a small fraction of relevant exports and may not have been shipped to the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n    at 22-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government emphasizes that \"Commerce did not assign Gem-Year an adverse facts available\n   <em>\n    margin\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis in original), but rather \"as adverse facts available, Commerce rejected all of Gem-Year's separate rate information and included Gem-Year in the China-wide entity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n    at 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Vulcan largely agrees with the government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Vulcan Br. at 11-32. It also stresses the validity of Commerce's rebuttable presumption of state control in non-market economies (\"NME\") and that those seeking a separate rate must prove lack of de jure and de facto control rather than Commerce proving control.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C809\">\n    at 11-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In its reply, Hubbell essentially contends that if Commerce needed additional information to verify a lack of government control of Jinn-Well, then it should have requested it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply Br. in Supp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   of Mot. for J. on the Agency R. Pursuant to Rule 56.2, Doc. No. 50 (\"Hubbell Reply Br.\"). Hubbell also claims that as all subject merchandise for this review was produced in 2009 and because Commerce previously found a lack of government control during the first administrative review covering 2008-2010, Commerce should have explained why the previous finding of independence fails to alter the outcome here.

In contrast, the government understands Commerce to have made its decision not based on Jinn-Well's production of in-scope merchandise per se, but because it found that the failure to mention this production until the end of verification undermined the reliability of Gem-Year's entire separate rate application. Def. Br. at 13-15. Although the latter understanding best comports with Commerce's reasoning in its issues and decision memo,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    I&amp;D Memo\n   </em>\n   at 25-28, as detailed below, even under a more generous reading of Commerce's rationale, the resulting decision is not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (\"CAFC\") has consistently upheld Commerce's use of a rebuttal presumption of state control such that entities in NMEs are assigned the state-wide AD duty rate unless they demonstrate eligibility for a separate rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Diamond Sawblades Mfrs.

Additionally, Commerce has broad discretion in choosing an AFA rate, which the rate applied to the China-wide entity is. It need only act reasonably in the light of the record, but this discretion is not boundless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F.lli De Cecco Di Filippo Fara S. Martino S.p.A. v.

As indicated, Hubbell asserts that the previous finding of lack of PRC control for 2009, the production year, should dictate the result here. Government control can arise, however, at other points in the exportation process, for instance, in price setting or contract negotiation. Thus, although this information is something that Commerce could have considered in deciding whether to grant Gem-Year's separate rate application, lack of consideration of this information is not dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Hubbell Reply Br. at 5-10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Gem-Year Org. Chart. Thus, it argues, Commerce is at fault for any failure to investigate Jinn-Well. The court is not persuaded. The chart contains numerous affiliates-some fully-owned by Gem-Year, some not-that, under Hubbell's logic, Commerce would have been required to investigate without any indication from Gem-Year that these affiliates had produced subject merchandise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gem-Year Org.

Rather than engage in this potentially-lengthy undertaking, Commerce reasonably asked Gem-Year to identify those affiliates that produced subject merchandise and then set out to investigate those affiliates. This is administratively practicable and saves all parties time and effort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Nonetheless, the imposition of China's total AFA rate in response to Gem-Year's failure to timely reveal Jinn-Well's production of some small amount of subject merchandise appears unduly punitive or arbitrary given the extensive factual information that remained on the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F.lli De Cecco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11218246\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/216/1027/#p1032\">\n    216 F.3d at 1032\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b) does not sanction imposing \"punitive, aberrational, or uncorroborated margins,\" but rather incentivizes cooperation).

Here, the production data deficiencies do not relate to the threshold determination of government control, but rather impact Commerce's ability to set an accurate dumping rate.

On remand, Commerce should recognize Gem-Year as a separate rate entity or clearly specify what material gaps in information as to Jinn-Well's status remain and how that undermines Gem-Year's claim to separate rate status.
