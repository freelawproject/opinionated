Plaintiff alleges that her postal carrier failed to deliver packages and letters to her address, resulting in economic harm to her and her family. The United States counters that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because claims against United States Postal Service employees related to the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of mail are exempt from the Federal Tort Claims Act and are thus barred by sovereign immunity. After considering the submissions of the parties and relevant law, the Court will\n   <strong>\n    grant\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint and\n   <strong>\n    grant\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 29, 2018, Plaintiff filed suit against Patricia Chacon, her mail carrier, in Santa Fe County Magistrate Court in Santa Fe, New Mexico. (Doc. 1-1 at 2-4.) The original complaint alleged that Ms. Chacon \"started picking and choosing what packages to deliver and what packages to send back,\" and that Plaintiff lost money after packages were returned to the sender as undelivered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) She alleged that Ms. Chacon \"has been tampering with our mail\" and \"refused to deliver mail to my address.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Plaintiff also stated that she filed two complaints with the United States Postal Service (USPS), but the USPS failed to investigate the claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The United States removed the action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) because it had been brought \"against a federal employee acting under the color of office ...

Thus, it \"is an action over which the United States District Court has exclusive jurisdiction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Following certification by the United States Attorney that Ms. Chacon was acting within the scope of her federal employment at the time of the events alleged in the Complaint, the United States was substituted as the proper party defendant pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docs. 4 at 1-2; 4-1 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 2, 2018, the United States (Defendant) moved to dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). (Doc. 5 at 1.) Defendant argues that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Complaint for two reasons: (1) Plaintiff's claims fall under the \"postal matter\" exception to the FTCA and are thus barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n    at 1-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ); and (2) even if Plaintiff's claims did fall properly under the FTCA, she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies before bringing suit as required by the FTCA (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n    at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Plaintiff did not respond to the Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 17, 2018, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint. (Doc. 10.) The Amended Complaint reemphasizes the allegations that Ms. Chacon \"knowingly [and] willingly failed to deliver packages to Plaintiff's address which caused financial loss.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) It also includes copies of two online complaints (labelled Exhibits 1 and 2) that Plaintiff submitted to the USPS Office of Inspector General Hotline, which include more specific details describing Ms. Chacon's alleged misconduct. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n    at 4-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Exhibit 1 alleges that Ms. Chacon refused to deliver mail addressed to anyone in the household other than Plaintiff, and as a result Plaintiff lost $ 180 because Ms. Chacon twice returned a package containing auto parts to the sender because they were addressed to Plaintiff's husband, and the auto parts were nonrefundable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Plaintiff also alleges that she and her husband confronted Ms. Chacon about her failure to deliver their mail and following that interaction, Ms. Chacon retaliated against them by only delivering mail that was addressed to Plaintiff's mother. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202679\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The Amended Complaint elaborates on Plaintiff's claim that she reported the incidents to the USPS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2 (\"USPS was contacted by myself over a dozen times in hopes to resolve matters. I was ignored ....\").) Exhibit 2 is a copy of a subsequent email to USPS requesting a response to her initial complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Approximately one month after filing the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff filed a belated Motion for Leave to File an Amended Complaint (Doc. 12) and Memorandum\n   in Support (Doc. 13), stating that she \"did not fully understand the legal implications of [her] pro se responsibility in filing an Amended Complaint.\" (Doc. 12 at 1.) Defendant does not oppose Plaintiff's motion to refile the Amended Complaint as the operative complaint. (Doc. 14 at 1.) A party seeking leave to amend its pleading outside the time allowed for amendments as a matter of course may do so \"only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Rule 15(a)(2) provides that \"[t]he court should freely give leave when justice so requires[,]\" to allow \"the maximum opportunity for each claim to be decided on its merits rather than on procedural niceties.\"\n   <em>\n    Hardin v. Manitowoc-Forsythe Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1478136\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/691/449/#p456\">\n    691 F.2d 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 456 (10th Cir. 1982) (citation omitted). As Defendant has provided its written consent and the Amended Complaint more thoroughly lays out Plaintiff's claims for the Court to consider in assessing the jurisdictional question presented in Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, the Court will grant Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to File Amended Complaint (Doc. 12). Plaintiff's Amended Complaint (Doc. 10) is thus the operative complaint in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff's claims all fall under the \"postal matter\" exception because they are rooted in \"injuries arising, directly or consequentially, because mail ... fails to arrive at all ....\"\n   <em>\n    Dolan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991514\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/481/#p489\">\n    546 U.S. at 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5991514\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/481/#p489\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The more specific narrative detailing her claims that Plaintiff provides as Exhibit 1 to the Amended Complaint further illustrates that the alleged injuries fall within the \"postal matter\" exception. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 10 at 4-6.) Plaintiff alleges that she purchased parts for her husband's truck online, and the package was twice returned by Ms. Chacon to the sender as undeliverable because it was addressed to Plaintiff's husband rather than Plaintiff and Ms. Chacon did not recognize his name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) The company that sent the auto parts informed Plaintiff that it could only attempt to send the package twice, and the items were not refundable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, Plaintiff and her husband suffered a $ 180 loss when they failed to receive the parts due to Ms. Chacon's negligence, or, as Plaintiff labels it, \"mail tampering\" and \"incompetence and lack of ethic.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) The Court finds that this claim, accepted as true, is still based directly on the \"loss\" and \"negligent transmission\" of Plaintiff's package. It is thus properly excluded from the FTCA under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 also alleges that, following the package incident described above, Ms. Chacon began harassing her family and discriminating against her husband and his sons due to their race by purposefully not delivering their mail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff claims that her husband approached Ms. Chacon and explained that he was awaiting the delivery of time-sensitive citizenship paperwork, and Ms. Chacon called the police and falsely claimed that he threatened her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that she left a list in her mailbox explaining which individuals could receive mail at that address, as instructed by a USPS supervisor, and Ms. Chacon threw the list away and placed a \"vacant\" sign on the box. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff does not explain how these additional allegations are connected to specific damages or claims in her Amended Complaint beyond referencing \"emotional and mental distress.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, to the extent that they are valid factual allegations, accepted as true by the Court in this facial attack to subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1), the Court finds that these additional allegations are also all related to the non-delivery of mail-which falls squarely under the \"postal matter\" exception to the FTCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As a result, each of the claims in Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, construed liberally, relate to alleged non-delivery of mail and packages by Ms. Chacon in her official capacity as a mail carrier. They thus arise \"out of the loss, miscarriage, or negligent transmission of letters or postal matter\" and are not claims for which the United States has waived sovereign immunity under the FTCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). As such, the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the claims and the Amended Complaint must be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Garling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277994\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/1289/#p1294\">\n    849 F.3d at 1294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff did not exhaust administrative remedies under the FTCA.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff's Amended Complaint is properly dismissed because her claims are\n   barred by sovereign immunity, so the Court need not reach Defendant's second argument for dismissal-that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiff has not exhausted administrative remedies under the FTCA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 5 at 3-4.) However, because Plaintiff devotes a substantial portion of her Amended Complaint to arguing that she\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   exhaust administrative remedies by filing two online complaints with the USPS Office of Inspector General Hotline, the Court will briefly explain why, even if Plaintiff's claims did not fall under the \"postal matter\" exception to the FTCA, the Court would still lack subject matter jurisdiction because she did not formally exhaust her administrate remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The FTCA \"provides that an 'action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the United States for money damages' unless the claimant has first exhausted his administrative remedies.\"\n   <em>\n    McNeil v.
