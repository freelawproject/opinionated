Before the court is the Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 14] filed by claimant Katie Lee Osborn. She contends,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction because the lake is not a \"navigable waterway\" for purposes of federal admiralty jurisdiction. For the reasons set forth below, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On April 26, 2018, petitioner Larry A. Riley filed a Complaint in Admiralty for Exoneration From or Limitation of Liability pursuant to the Vessel Owner's Limitation of Liability Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030501\">\n    46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 2]. According to the allegations in his Complaint, Riley piloted a recreational\n   vessel on Tenkiller Ferry Lake (also known as Lake Tenkiller) on or about June 24, 2017. He seeks exoneration from or limitation of liability for all claims arising out of or resulting from the voyage. He asserts that this case falls within the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States and that this court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201333\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He expressly alleges that Lake Tenkiller is a part of the navigable waters of the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 14, 2018, the court issued a Notice of Complaint stating,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Riley had filed a complaint for exoneration from or limitation of liability, and that all claims were required to be asserted as specified in the notice by July 9, 2018, or be defaulted. [Doc. 13]. On July, 8, 2018, Osborn filed the instant motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, as well as an Answer and Claim. [Doc. 14; Doc. 16]. No other claimants came forth before the July 9 deadline. On July 16, 2018, Osborn filed, with leave of court, an Amended Answer and Claim. [Doc. 22]. She alleges that, on June 27, 2017, Riley took her and others \"tubing\" behind the boat he was operating, and that Riley failed to slow the boat to a reasonable speed, causing her to be thrown from the tube and to suffer serious bodily injury. She seeks actual and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Riley filed a response in opposition to the instant motion to dismiss on July 27, 2018 [Doc. 24], and Osborn filed a reply thereafter [Doc. 25].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Tenkiller Ferry Lake is a reservoir in eastern Oklahoma formed by the damming of the Illinois River upstream from its confluence with the Arkansas River. It is uncontested that the bounds of the lake are within the State of Oklahoma, and that a dam blocks off the southern end of the lake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Riley asserts that the dam that created the lake \"merely cuts off traffic in one direction,\" and that \"one can travel by boat from Lake Tenkiller, up the Illinois River, and into Arkansas.\" [Doc. 24, pp. 1, 9]. In support of these assertions, Riley cites two exhibits. First, he submitted a screenshot of a Google Maps satellite image purportedly showing the point at which the Illinois River crosses into Oklahoma from Arkansas. [Doc. 24-1]. Second, he submitted a \"Vicinity map indicating approximate limit of jurisdiction under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 (RHA)\" obtained from the website of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which states, \"All down stream waters of the Illinois River to include Lake Tenkiller are subject to Section 10 RHA Regulation.\" [Doc. 24-2]. Additionally, Riley lists links to the websites of six businesses that offer recreational \"raft, canoe, and kayak trips on the Illinois River upstream of Lake Tenkiller.\" [Doc. 24, p. 9].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Osborn asserts that Lake Tenkiller is used for flood control and recreational purposes and does not have any commercial or interstate shipping, \"as the lake is dammed with no way for commercial boats to exit the lake beyond the dam into a different body of water.\" [Doc. 14, pp. 2, 5]. She maintains that \"it is virtually impossible to go to or from Lake Tenkiller ... from/to the Illinois River with a watercraft due to narrow, shallow, and effectively impassible stretches in between the Illinois and Tenkiller.\" [Doc. 25, p. 4]. In particular, she asserts that, near Town Branch Guest Ranch, where the Illinois River begins to flow into Lake Tenkiller, there is a large sandbar and barely a trickle of water flows through to Lake Tenkiller. [Doc. 25, p. 3]. In support of this assertion, she has submitted a satellite image depicting the area around the sandbar, which appears to leave only a small stream of water. [Doc. 25, p. 4]. She concedes that \"it may be\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   for small watercrafts to travel through connecting rivers and streams from state to state, ending up in Tenkiller Lake,\" but contends that \"the amount of limited activity cannot possibly amount to finding the lake 'susceptible or capable of being used as an interstate highway of commerce, either as it is presently used or as it may be susceptible to future use.' \" [Doc. 14, p. 7 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lynch v. McFarland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3838523\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/808/559/#p562\">\n    808 F.Supp. 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 562 (W.D.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In her motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, Osborn goes beyond the allegations in the complaint and challenges the underlying jurisdictional facts-namely, Riley's allegation that Lake Tenkiller is navigable for purposes of admiralty jurisdiction. As the party invoking federal jurisdiction, Riley bears the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that this court has subject-matter jurisdiction. Riley contends that Lake Tenkiller is a part of the navigable waters of the United States \"because it is\n   possible to travel continuously by water from the Lake to another state in the service of a commercial venture.\" [Doc. 24, p. 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Supreme Court articulated a test of navigability in\n   <em>\n    The Daniel Ball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3436246\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/77/557/\">\n    77 U.S. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3436246\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/77/557/\">\n    10 Wall. 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3436246\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/77/557/\">\n    19 L.Ed. 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1870), as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Those rivers must be regarded as public navigable rivers in law which are navigable in fact.

Thus, the question is whether, in its present condition, Lake Tenkiller is\n   <em>\n    capable of\n   </em>\n   supporting interstate commercial activity. Riley offers virtually no evidence on this question-other than evidence that the Illinois River crosses the Arkansas-Oklahoma border and that several businesses offer recreational raft, canoe, and kayak trips on portions of the Illinois River upstream of Lake Tenkiller. For purposes of deciding the instant motion, the court will assume it is possible to navigate by small raft, canoe, or kayak from Arkansas, down the Illinois River, into Lake Tenkiller. The question then becomes whether such limited capability is sufficient to make Lake Tenkiller a potential highway of interstate commerce for purposes of establishing admiralty jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Several decisions by other federal courts are instructive.

The first, Tenkiller Ferry Dam at river mile 12.8, forms Lake Tenkiller Ferry within Oklahoma, and the other dam forms Lake Francis at the Oklahoma-Arkansas border. These features alone make interstate commerce impossible.
