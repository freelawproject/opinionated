Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This case arises out of a challenge to Local Rule 1.3(a) of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York's \"sponsor affidavit requirement.\" Applicants to the bar of the Eastern District of New York must submit an affidavit from a current member of the bar,\n   <em>\n    who has known the applicant for a minimum of one year\n   </em>\n   , stating what the attorney knows of the applicant's character and experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff Robert Doyle brings this action against the Clerk of the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York. He seeks both a declaration that the sponsor affidavit requirement is unconstitutional and a writ of mandamus to allow plaintiff to apply for admission to the Eastern District of the New York bar without complying with the sponsor affidavit requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendant moves to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. The Rule 12(b)(6) motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff challenges the foundation of the federal courts' authority to adopt rules governing the admission of attorneys by arguing that Local Rule 1.3(a)'s sponsor affidavit requirement is the result of an unconstitutional delegation of power by Congress to the Judiciary.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , he claims that the sponsor affidavit requirement contravenes the Fifth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses.\n   <em>\n    Third,\n   </em>\n   he alleges that it violates his rights under the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   None of these claims have merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"[A] district court has discretion to adopt local rules that are necessary to carry out the conduct of its business.

The court reasonably depends upon a lawyer's veracity and good faith and is therefore entitled to investigate the character of those who seek to practice before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Relevant is a review of the local rules for the United States courts.\n   <em>\n    See, infra\n   </em>\n   , Section V(A); Exhibit A (table summarizing court's survey of federal courts' rules). It demonstrated that admission requirements similar to the sponsor affidavit requirement of the Eastern District have been widely adopted by federal courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. A (finding that 47 of 94 district courts require a sponsoring attorney to state what she or he knows of the applicant's character and/or experience at the bar; 6 require the sponsoring attorney know the applicant for at least one year). In Exhibit A, attached, those courts requiring the sponsoring attorney know the applicant for at least a fixed amount of time are marked with an asterisk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court reviewed the admission materials for each federal court. But, the application forms for several district courts-Western District of Arkansas, Central District of California, Eastern District of California, Southern District of California, District of Colorado, Northern District of Florida, Southern District of Florida, District of Kansas, District of Massachusetts, District of Nebraska, District of North Dakota, Western District of Wisconsin-were not readily accessible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   There is no legal basis for the elimination of the sponsor affidavit requirement, but it may, in some few instances, make it more difficult to gain admission. For this reason, the requirement that the sponsoring attorney know the applicant for a year should probably be eliminated. Most courts do not require the sponsor to have known the applicant for any amount of time prior to commenting on their character and experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Factual Allegations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff is an attorney admitted to practice in the State of New York.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 11:1-5, Feb. 19, 2019. He allegedly wishes to become a member of the bar in the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Am. Compl. \u00b6 23. But, he contends he cannot comply with the sponsor affidavit requirement without compromising his beliefs or his self-identity.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23, 29, 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   To enable a current member of the bar to provide a reasonably accurate assessment of his character, Doyle alleges that he must engage in certain \"necessary activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. They include the \"disclosure, to a [s]ponsor, of [his] beliefs regarding philosophical, religious, political, social, moral, and ethical matters ... [and] of a\n   sufficient number of experiences of [his] that demonstrate consistency, or inconsistency, with any of [his] [p]ersonal [b]eliefs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. He contends that it \"would be virtually impossible for [him] to engage in the [n]ecessary [a]ctivities to a degree that would avoid the non-negligible risk ... that the [s]ponsor would be untruthful in 'stating what [he] knows of [his] character.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. He believes that taking this \"risk\" is immoral and claims that this belief is \"fundamental to his self-identity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33, 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   A. Survey of Federal Courts' Local Rules\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   A review of the local rules for the 94 United States district courts, the 12 United States circuit courts, and the United States Supreme Court was made under this court's direction\n   <em>\n    ex mero motu, see\n   </em>\n   Ex. A (survey of federal courts' local rules).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 201(b)(2) (courts may take judicial notice of facts that can be readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot be reasonably questioned). The survey revealed that Local Rule 1.3(a)'s sponsor affidavit requirement is, in general, consistent with the admission requirements of other federal courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   United States courts have largely adopted their own sponsor requirements: 47 district courts, 8 circuit courts, and the Supreme Court require a sponsoring attorney to affirm that the applicant possesses good moral and professional character.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. A. 24 district courts and the Supreme Court require affirmation from two or more sponsors.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267773\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/754/474/#p479\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Relatively rare is the Eastern District's Local Rule 1.3(a)'s requirement that the sponsor has known the applicant for at least one year.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267773\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/754/474/#p479\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Only 5 other district courts impose a similar condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267773\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/754/474/#p479\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (finding that the District for District of Columbia, Northern District of Illinois, District of Maryland, Southern District of New York, and Southern District of Texas require that the sponsor knows the applicant for at least one year; the District of Connecticut and District of Vermont for at least 6 months). This requirement appears unnecessary. A sponsoring lawyer should not need to know an applicant for a year to fairly assess his or her character and experience. It creates avoidable problems for first-time applicants, as well for those attorneys new to the New York area, who may not have access to the same networks as many of their peers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   It is recommended that the judges of the Eastern District of New York revise Local Rule 1.3(a) by removing the condition that the sponsoring attorney must have known the applicant for a minimum of one year. If the change is made, it is probably desirable to coordinate the shift with the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York whose local rules mirror those of the Eastern District. On a rare occasion, the one-year requirement may needlessly exclude a worthy attorney who lacks the requisite professional or social connections. In our unequal society, we should be encouraging those on the lower end of the socioeconomic ladder, with less acquaintanceships with lawyers, to enter the legal profession as a means to move up in status and to support themselves and their families-as well as to help others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   B. Constitutional Delegation of Power by Congress to the Judiciary\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Doyle claims that Local Rule 1.3(a)'s sponsor affidavit requirement is unlawful because it is the result of an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the federal courts. The crux of his argument is that Congress cannot delegate the power to enact a rule like the sponsor affidavit requirement because it does not have the power to enact such a rule itself \"whose application ... in a particular district court is not based upon the presence or absence of any particular rationale of factors.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem.

As part of the power to make necessary regulations in establishing a lower court system, Congress can prescribe rules for practice and procedure in those courts. Congress has not exercised this power directly, however, but has instead delegated the rule-making authority to the courts themselves....
