The named defendants in that case include the DA Defendants, the NYPD Defendants, the Corporate Defendants, the Con Edison Defendants, and the City of New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The 1800 Complaint alleges that in 2007, Plaintiff \"was informally doing business under the nom de guerre 'Ron Iron' providing advertising and web development services to escort, therapeutic and adult-oriented businesses.\" (1800 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 22). Subsequently, in 2008, Plaintiff began working as a technician for Con Edison. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23). In 2009, an individual who had been convicted of promoting prostitution allegedly \"vindictively\" forwarded to law enforcement false information implicating Plaintiff in illegal activity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25). Plaintiff alleges that, in consequence, law enforcement officers: (i) induced a minor to work as a confidential informant and prostitute to manufacture evidence against Plaintiff; (ii) tampered with advertisements appearing on Backpage.com by \"altering 'AdOId' posted by other individuals, or created by the defendants\"; and (iii) used fabricated evidence to obtain court orders, subpoenas, and warrants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 27-29, 37-41). Accordingly, it is alleged that despite using a warrant, \"defendants had no probable cause\" to obtain access to Plaintiff's accounts; to search his apartment and office at Con Edison; or to seize his cell phones, electronic media, and credit cards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 47-48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that he \"has not been provided with any court orders, subpoenas, warrants or notices in relation to any of these disclosures.\" (1800 Compl. \u00b6 26). Backpage.com is further alleged to have \"aided and abetted\" law enforcement \"by granting them unlimited access to password-protected accounts without the proper legal authority,\" while other of the Corporate Defendants are alleged to have provided law enforcement with Plaintiff's records, emails, and instant messages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 38, 60-62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Initially, Plaintiff was charged by the Office of the District Attorney for New York County (the \"DANY\") in New York County Supreme Court. However, the state charges were dismissed on February 1, 2013. (1800 Compl. \u00b6 46). Instead, Plaintiff was prosecuted federally by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (the \"USAO\"). (9621 Compl. \u00b6 49). He was indicted in this District on January 22, 2013, and a superseding indictment was returned on October\n   10, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Corley\n   </em>\n   , No. 13 Cr. 48 (RPP/AJN) (S.D.N.Y.). Plaintiff was ultimately convicted of child exploitation and child pornography offenses in April 2014; his conviction was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on February 9, 2017,\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Corley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12392104\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/679/1/\">\n    679 F.

Plaintiff asserts claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , false arrest, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, unlawful search and seizure, malicious abuse of process, conspiracy to violate due process, fabrication of evidence, and violations of the rights to a speedy trial and to privacy, as well as state-law claims of negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and fraud. (1800 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 72-84, 95-99). Broadly speaking, Plaintiff alleges that private individuals and corporations (i) conspired with state actors to violate his constitutional rights and (ii) failed to train their employees properly with respect to the release of customer information. Plaintiff further asserts that the private defendants violated federal statutes that limit disclosure of electronic records and communications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 60-63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 8, 2015, Plaintiff filed a second complaint, this one against New York State Supreme Court Justice Bonnie G. Wittner, the judge who presided over Plaintiff's state prosecution; Michael J. Barry, Plaintiff's appointed counsel in that case; criminal investigator Glenn F. Hardy and his company, Ports &amp; Files, Inc., also appointed to assist in Plaintiff's defense; several members of the DANY; and the City of New York. (9621 Dkt. # 2). Whereas the 1800 Complaint focused on the investigative work undertaken preliminary to Plaintiff's 2012 arrest, the 9621 Complaint focused on the conduct of those involved in Plaintiff's state prosecution from its inception until the case was turned over to federal prosecutors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the 9621 Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that Justice Wittner and representatives of the DANY conspired (i) to establish a \"quasi-grand jury\" for the purpose of accessing, illegally, Plaintiff's communications and records (9621 Compl. \u00b6 17); (ii) to \"coerce or entice\" an underage female to participate in an illegal sting operation against Plaintiff that would \"manufacture\" state-court jurisdiction over him (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 24); (iii) to circumvent case assignment procedures so that Plaintiff's criminal case would be assigned to Justice Wittner (who, it is alleged, would then cover up the putative co-conspirators' prior misconduct,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ); and (iv) to solicit the USAO to prosecute Plaintiff (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 39-41, 46-49). Plaintiff further alleges that his attorney and criminal investigator publicized private information concerning Plaintiff and his case \"for the purpose of financial gain and promoting their professional practices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 50-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Indeed, according to Plaintiff, attorney Barry and investigator Hardy actively promoted Plaintiff's case in the media in order to \"entic[e] the U.S. Attorney to take the case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The procedural history of each case spans more than four years, although each was stayed several times. First, on January 13, 2015, Plaintiff initiated the 1800 action. (1800 Dkt. # 1). On June 22, 2015, after reviewing the 1800 Complaint pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B) and 1915A(b), the Court issued an Order to\n   Amend, addressing, in detail, what it perceived to be the legal and factual impediments to mounting Plaintiff's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vance\n   </em>\n   , No. 15 Civ. 1800 (KPF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204164377\">\n    2015 WL 4164377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-9 (S.D.N.Y. June 22, 2015). The Court warned Plaintiff that most of the counts in his Complaint might be subject to dismissal on the bases identified in the Order and provided Plaintiff with the opportunity to amend his pleading within 60 days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff declined to amend the 1800 Complaint, and the Court dismissed it on December 2, 2015, for failure to comply with the Court's orders, with leave to replead within 30 days. (1800 Dkt. # 20). In lieu of repleading, Plaintiff appealed the Court's Order of Dismissal to the Second Circuit. (1800 Dkt. # 21). On May 6, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the Order of Dismissal and remanded the case, ordering this Court to consider the 1800 Complaint on the merits. (1800 Dkt. # 23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Several months later, the 9621 case, which had initially been assigned to United States District Judge John G. Koeltl, was transferred to this Court. Upon motion, both cases were stayed by the Court by orders dated September 16, 2016, so that Plaintiff could pursue his appeal from his criminal conviction. (1800 Dkt. # 97; 9621 Dkt. # 60). At the time these stays were entered, several of the defendants in the 9621 case - specifically, Defendants Hardy, Vance, Stuart, Temple, and Weiss - had filed motions to dismiss. (9621 Dkt. # 32, 43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As previously stated, the Supreme Court denied Plaintiff's petition for certiorari in October 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612808,12612809,12612810,12612811,12612812,12612813\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/205/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By orders dated November 1, 2017, the Court lifted the stays in the 1800 and 9621 cases and scheduled a series of conference calls with the parties in order to discuss next steps. (1800 Dkt. # 135; 9621 Dkt. # 67). As detailed in several Court orders, technical and logistical difficulties foiled the Court's efforts to convene the parties telephonically. (1800 Dkt. # 144, 148; 9621 Dkt. # 72, 78). However, before the February 12, 2018 conference came to its premature end, the Court learned that Plaintiff wished to renew a previously-filed motion for the Court's recusal in both cases. The Court reimposed the stays and ordered Plaintiff to refile his recusal motion (1800 Dkt. # 148; 9621 Dkt. # 78), which Plaintiff did on or about February 26, 2018 (1800 Dkt. # 150; 9621 Dkt. # 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On June 19, 2018, the Court denied the motion for recusal, lifted the stays, and scheduled motion practice to occur concurrently in both matters. (1800 Dkt. # 152; 9621 Dkt. # 83). In September 2018, Plaintiff requested a 90-day extension to file his Opposition, from September 21, 2018, until December 20, 2018. (1800 Dkt. # 233; 9621 Dkt. # 107). The Court granted the request and ordered Defendants to respond to the Opposition on or before January 7, 2019. (1800 Dkt. # 234; 9621 Dkt. # 108). By letter dated December 12, 2018, Plaintiff again requested, and the Court again granted, an extension to file his Opposition, this time until January 25, 2019. (1800 Dkt. # 256-57; 9621 Dkt. # 114-15). Plaintiff's third request for an extension was denied on January 11, 2019. (1800 Dkt. # 262). Accordingly, Plaintiff filed his Opposition in late January 2019 (1800 Dkt. # 267-69; 9621 Dkt. # 117-19), and Defendants timely filed their briefs in reply (1800 Dkt. # 271-78; 9621 Dkt. # 120-26).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

To begin, \"as an incarcerated\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigant proceeding\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   , [Plaintiff] was entitled to rely on service by the U.S. Marshals.\"\n   <em>\n    Romandette\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Weetabix Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1649828\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/807/309/#p311\">\n    807 F.2d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311 (2d Cir. 1986) (citing Fed.

The Second Circuit has further cautioned that, when deciding service issues in\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   cases, district courts must construe Rule 4 generously:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   As we observed in\n   <em>\n    Grammenos\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lemos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"733937\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/457/1067/#p1070\">\n    457 F.2d 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1070 (2d Cir. 1972), Rule 4 of the Federal Rules is to be construed liberally \"to further the purpose of finding personal jurisdiction in cases in which the party has received actual notice.\" We further noted that \"incomplete or improper service will lead the court to dismiss the action unless it appears that proper service may still be obtained.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"733937\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/457/1067/#p1070\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Jaiyeola\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carrier Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"144510\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/73/492/#p494\">\n    73 F.

Here, not only do all of the DA Defendants have actual notice of the 1800 Complaint, but, more importantly, \"proper service\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   been obtained in the instant case,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"144510\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/73/492/#p494\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , with respect to all but one of the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In addition, the Court must \"weigh the plaintiff's reasonable efforts and diligence against the prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay.\"\n   <em>\n    DeLuca\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4023542\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/695/54/#p64\">\n    695 F.Supp.2d at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The DA Defendants\n   argue that, despite being entitled to rely on the Marshals, Plaintiff alone is at fault for the delay in effecting service. (1800 DA Br. 29-30). Specifically, these Defendants claim that Plaintiff \"is the source of confusion over the failure to serve the complaint [because] Plaintiff filed a document labeled as a 'complaint supplement' which can be readily confused with the complaint.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The DA Defendants were served with the Complaint Supplement, but not the Complaint, on September 27, 2016. (1800 Dkt. # 98).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   They promptly notified the Court of this deficiency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, in their briefing, the DA Defendants ignore the fact that Plaintiff made repeated attempts to remedy any service errors. On October 19, 2016, Plaintiff submitted a response to the Court seeking clarification from the Marshals as to how, and with what documents, each DA Defendant had been served. (1800 Dkt. # 110). Because the case was then stayed pending resolution of Plaintiff's appeal of his underlying criminal conviction, the Court did not immediately resolve the issue. (1800 Dkt. # 114).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Given Plaintiff's diligence in communicating with the Court, he will not be found at fault for any service delays. Over the past four years, Plaintiff has repeatedly written to the Court providing service updates or seeking to verify the status of his service requests. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 1800 Dkt. # 28, 43, 84, 110, 122, 128, 141, 153, 246, 251, 270).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meilleur\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Strong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3892278\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/56/#p63\">\n    682 F.3d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63 (2d Cir. 2012) (finding no abuse of discretion by district court in dismissing case when plaintiff did not raise the issue of pending service with the court). The Court itself has noted that other factors, including the two stays in the case, may have complicated Plaintiff's attempts to effect timely service. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1800 Dkt. # 155 (\"[G]iven the lengthy stay in this case, it is possible that service attempts were interrupted or otherwise failed.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Undeterred, the DA Defendants cite to\n   <em>\n    Meilleur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3892278\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/56/#p63\">\n    682 F.3d at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where the Second Circuit found that the district court's dismissal of a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   case for failure to achieve timely service was not reversible error. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1800 DA Br. 29-30). Although\n   <em>\n    Meilleur\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the instant action - the\n   <em>\n    Meilleur\n   </em>\n   plaintiff did not apprise the court of status of process or request an extension - the Second Circuit's language is illuminating. Even while affirming the district court, the Second Circuit noted that the lower court's holding was \"harsh and we might well have exercised discretion differently were it for us to decide in the first instance.\"\n   <em>\n    Meilleur\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3892278\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/682/56/#p63\">\n    682 F.3d at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, for the reasons set forth here, the DA Defendants' motion to dismiss the 1800 Complaint against them for insufficient service of process under Rule 12(b)(5) is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Court Dismisses Some, But Not All, of the Claims in the 1800 Complaint Pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The remaining arguments of the Moving Defendants are made pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), and concern Plaintiff's alleged failures to state a claim. The Court therefore proceeds to consider these claims on the merits, beginning with Plaintiff's claims in the 1800 Complaint, which focus on conduct before and immediately following Plaintiff's 2012 arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff brings a combination of constitutional, statutory, and state-law claims, many of which the Court previously addressed\n   in its 2015 Order to Amend. (1800 Dkt. # 15). The Court will address each category of claims in turn, ultimately dismissing all of the claims in the 1800 Complaint with the exceptions of certain of Plaintiff's claims for malicious abuse of process and unlawful search and seizure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Therefore, in order to survive a motion to dismiss, Plaintiff must allege government conduct that \"is so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.\"\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Levy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9171662\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/401/75/#p93\">\n    401 F.3d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 93 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiff's claim for substantive due process includes ample factual allegations, including five additional pages of briefing on the issue in his Opposition. (1800 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27-33; 1800 Pl. Opp. 13-17). Length, however, does not equal substance: Plaintiff's briefing, even liberally read, distills to allegations that the Government Defendants used informants in the course of undercover operations. Specifically, Plaintiff claims that the Government Defendants worked with alleged prostitutes as confidential informants, while investigating alleged pimps and \"individuals they believed to be associated with the Plaintiff.\" (1800 Compl. \u00b6 30). Plaintiff does not indicate that the Government's conduct affected him. To the contrary, he asserts that he \"declin[ed] to do any business\" with any of the alleged informants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The conduct alleged to have been undertaken by the Government Defendants does not shock the contemporary conscience.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matican\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3822789\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/524/151/#p159\">\n    524 F.3d 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 159 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding that law enforcement's design of sting operation, including participation of informant, did not shock the conscience). Nor do Plaintiff's sweeping statements that Defendants \"forc[ed] an underage girl to engage in prostitution in order to fraudulently arrest her pimp\" (1800 Pl. Opp. 13), or that they \"encouraged and promoted prostitution\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17), cure the 1800 Complaint's deficiencies. Plaintiff's factual basis for these statements is that the Government Defendants simultaneously pursued investigations into suspected prostitution while\n   meeting with potential informants who may have been prostitutes, some of whom may have been underage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). If true, that conduct is neither inconsistent nor illegal, much less outrageous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff's harassment claim lacks any factual development. Plaintiff merely claims that the Government Defendants \"engag[ed] in a systematic and intentional pattern of harassment by abusing legal process to deliberately invade Plaintiff's privacy without probable cause[.]\" (1800 Compl. \u00b6 74). Although it reads Plaintiff's claims to raise the strongest arguments they suggest, the Court is not obligated to accept as true legal conclusions masquerading as factual allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rolon\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Henneman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5870343\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/517/140/#p148\">\n    517 F.3d 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 148-49 (2d Cir. 2008). Without any supporting factual allegations, Plaintiff's claim of harassment does not suffice to save his due process claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Counts I and III of the 1800 Complaint are dismissed by reason of this analysis. By extension, Count II, which alleges conspiracy to violate Plaintiff's substantive due process rights, also fails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Curley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vill. of Suffern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1949956\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/268/65/#p72\">\n    268 F.3d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 72 (2d Cir. 2001) (finding that plaintiffs may not maintain a \u00a7 1983 claim for conspiracy if they cannot establish the underlying constitutional violation). Plaintiff's conspiracy claim relies on the same due process allegations - that the Government Defendants engaged in undercover operations to root out prostitution of underage victims and met with informants in furtherance of that process. (1800 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 34-36). Because Plaintiff has not plausibly alleged a constitutional violation of his due process rights, his conspiracy claim is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Plaintiff's Claim for Malicious Abuse of Process Survives in Part and Fails in Part\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In Counts IX and X of the 1800 Complaint, Plaintiff advances two claims for malicious abuse of process. (1800 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 80-81).\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff alleges that the Government Defendants \"arrest[ed] Plaintiff to compel his cooperation in Nuisance Abatement proceedings\" (1800 Pl. Opp. 19), against \"numerous Manhattan property owners\" (1800 Compl. \u00b6 50). Specifically, Plaintiff claims that during an interrogation in January 2012, one of the Government Defendants, Detective Woods, informed Plaintiff that the DA Defendants were \"interested in Plaintiff's cooperation regarding the owners of apartment buildings alleged to be involved with illegal activities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49). When Plaintiff declined to cooperate, the Government Defendants arrested him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff claims that the Government Defendants, with knowledge that Plaintiff was seeking proof of employment with Con Edison to obtain lower bail, \"disclos[ed] Grand Jury evidence to [Con Edison] which effectively caused his termination.\" (1800 Pl. Opp. 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   To state a claim for malicious abuse of process under New York law, Plaintiff must allege \"that defendant [i] employed regularly issued legal process to compel performance or forbearance of some act, [ii] with the intent to do harm without excuse or justification, and [iii] in order to obtain a collateral objective that is outside the legitimate ends of the process.\"\n   <em>\n    Arrington\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057583\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/628/46/#p49\">\n    628 F.

To raise this claim under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege an abuse of the criminal process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sheldon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7407644\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/41/73/#p80\">\n    41 F.3d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 80 (2d Cir. 1994). What is more, in the criminal context, a plaintiff must allege \"a collateral purpose beyond or in addition to his criminal prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Savino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110734\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/63/#p76\">\n    331 F.3d at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Plaintiff plausibly alleges the Government Defendants' collateral objective as to his first claim, but not his second. With regards to his first claim, Plaintiff has alleged that the Government Defendants \"had an ulterior purpose or objective in facilitating his prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Savino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9110734\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/63/#p76\">\n    331 F.3d at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As alleged, the Government Defendants suggested to Plaintiff that if he agreed to do something for them, he would not be arrested. In contrast, Plaintiff's second claim does not allege a collateral purpose. While Plaintiff does allege that the Government Defendants were aware that he was seeking lower bail - as they necessarily would be - he does not allege that they unlawfully disclosed grand jury evidence with the purpose of getting him fired. (1800 Compl. \u00b6 51). There is, therefore, no indication in the 1800 Complaint that the Government Defendants sought to achieve a collateral purpose \"beyond or in addition to his criminal prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Corso\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    City of New York\n   </em>\n   , No. 17 Civ. 6096 (NRB),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204538899\">\n    2018 WL 4538899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (S.D.N.Y.

(1800 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66-67). However, the Complaint is bereft of any factual allegations explaining how municipal liability is established, with two exceptions: Plaintiff's allegations that (i) the City and the Government Defendants \"have created a policy and custom of deliberately implementing unconstitutional sting operations to aid in the enforcement of nuisance abatement proceedings,\" and (ii) the Government Defendants \"adopted a practice of coercing individuals to engage in prostitution to facilitate the investigation of suspected promoters.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Beginning with the second alleged policy, Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim is dismissed. The Court has already found that, even construing the pleadings liberally, the Government Defendants' alleged practice of \"facilitating prostitution\" merely amounts to allegations that these Defendants met with alleged prostitutes and used, or considered using, them as confidential informants in their criminal investigations. Because the Court has already determined that Plaintiff failed adequately to plead an underlying constitutional violation involving the alleged coercion of individuals into prostitution, Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim on this same theory fails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferguson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cai\n   </em>\n   , No. 11 Civ. 6181 (PAE),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%202865474\">\n    2012 WL 2865474\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (S.D.N.Y.

Therefore, his claims for municipal liability regarding the City's use of sting operations for nuisance proceedings cannot be dismissed for lack of an underlying constitutional violation. However, this claim fails for a different reason: the \"official policy\" allegations do not include, and cannot be amended to include, factual detail. The 1800 Complaint offers nothing beyond the bald assertion that the \"[Government Defendants] have created a policy\n   and custom of deliberately implementing unconstitutional sting operations to aid in the enforcement of nuisance abatement proceedings under N.Y.C.

(1800 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 86, 88). In addition, Plaintiff alleges that certain of the Corporate Defendants - including T-Mobile, Facebook, Google, TWC, MCU, Capital One, and Chase - were complicit in this process and knowingly divulged his records to the Government Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 87, 89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Plaintiff's threadbare allegations that the Government Defendants violated the ECPA and SCA are not sufficiently detailed to survive a motion to dismiss. Plaintiff paints in broad strokes - alleging that the Government Defendants intercepted his communications \"through\" the Corporate Defendants, and then altered some of those communications \"without the required warrant, notice with administrative subpoena or court order, or other appropriate legal authority[.]\" (1800\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 86, 88). Plaintiff claims to have become aware of these violations in June 2013 \"from federal discovery disclosures,\" presumably related to his criminal case. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Significantly, however, Plaintiff's proffered evidence does not support his allegations. Indeed, in the 1800 Complaint, rather than \"plead[ing] factual content that allows the court to draw the inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged,\" Plaintiff merely regurgitates the elements of each statute.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(1800 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 88). Instead, Plaintiff states that he \"has not been provided with any court orders, subpoenas, warrants or notices in relation to any of these disclosures.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). Although Government entities are subject to notice requirements under the ECPA and the SCA, those obligations vary depending on the category of information being sought.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Orin S. Kerr,\n   <em>\n    A User's Guide to the Stored Communications Act, and A Legislator's Guide to Amending It\n   </em>\n   , 72 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 1208, 1222 (2004).

Without additional factual allegations, the Court cannot find that the Government Defendants were subject to - much less in violation of - any notice requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Similarly, Plaintiff's claims against the Corporate Defendants lack sufficient detail. Here again, Plaintiff merely recites the statutory language, alleging that the service providers unlawfully disclosed his subscriber records without the required legal process or notice. (1800 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 86, 89). The Corporate Defendants argue, as suggested by this Court in its prior Order, that the statutes contain defenses for releasing information pursuant to a court order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   T-Mobile Br. 9-10; TWC Br. 2-6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204164377\">\n    2015 WL 4164377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7. However, upon closer review, the Court understands that Plaintiff does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   allege that the Corporate Defendants complied with a court order, but instead brings his claims pursuant to Section 2702, which governs whether a provider can disclose information to the Government voluntarily. (1800 Compl. \u00b6 89).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   For this reason, any good faith defense or court order compliance exception is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Under Section 2702, a provider \"may divulge the contents of a communication\" to a law enforcement agency, if the contents \"appear to pertain to the commission of a crime.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"267\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202702\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7). The problem for Plaintiff is that he fails to make any factual allegations regarding any Corporate Defendant's violation of this provision. Instead, Plaintiff summarily asserts that all of the Corporate Defendants\n   voluntarily disclosed his information to law enforcement, during the period of time that he was under investigation by those agencies. (1800 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 87, 89). Because the Complaint does not sufficiently allege how the Corporate Defendants' violated the ECPA and SCA in the course of any disclosures they may have made, the claims against them are dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Right to Financial Privacy Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Next, Plaintiff argues that the DA Defendants, with the assistance of Corporate Defendants MCU, Capital One, and Chase (collectively, the \"RFPA Defendants\"), violated his right to privacy under the RFPA. (1800 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 90-91). The RFPA is intended to protect the privacy of customer's financial records held by banks and other financial institutions. To that end, the statute curbs access to financial records by government entities, while protecting the Government's interest in obtaining records relevant to a legitimate law enforcement investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203402\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Similar to his ECPA claims, Plaintiff alleges that the DA Defendants improperly accessed his financial records without proper legal process, and that the RFPA Defendants improperly disclosed those records to the City of New York. (1800 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 90-91). As a threshold matter, the RFPA Defendants argue that Plaintiff's RFPA claim fails because the statute does not apply to state authorities. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chase Br. 9-10; Capital One Br. 9-10). \"[T]he RFPA only governs and protects against the disclosure of financial records to the\n   <em>\n    federal government\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Barroga-Hayes\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Susan D.

(1800 Compl. \u00b6 91).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   In his Opposition, Plaintiff \"concedes that the RFPA allegations are deficient because the Complaint is silent regarding a federal authority\" (1800 Pl. Opp. 21), but makes additional factual allegations that this Court will consider,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576253\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/119/\">\n    717 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   122 n.1.

As proof of his claim, Plaintiff includes the detective's NYPD and FBI email addresses, as provided to Plaintiff through FOIA disclosures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

For instance, Plaintiff alleges that the Government Defendants \"knowingly accessed and obtained copies of the information contained in the financial records of [Plaintiff] from financial institutions,\" (1800 Compl. \u00b6 90), but provides no facts about this allegedly unlawful access.

Indeed, there is nothing to suggest that the website is anything other than a legitimate, third-party site.

In this regard, Plaintiff alleges that Justice Wittner and the DA Defendants \"established a quasi-grand jury to issue subpoenas, court orders, etc.; with the intent to illegally obtain access to Plaintiff's personal electronic communications, bank records, phone records and conversations, etc.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The DA Defendants argue that \"Plaintiff fails to allege what is a 'Quasi Grand Jury,' the difference between a Grand Jury and a 'Quasi Grand Jury,' how the 'Quasi Grand Jury' violated the laws of New York governing Grand Juries, and what was the 'personal information' that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in.\" (9621 DA Br. 8). The Court agrees that allegations detailing the existence and characteristics of Quasi Grand Juries, and detailing the precise information injuriously disclosed, would be necessary for Plaintiff's claim to survive, and are absent here. More pointedly, nothing in Plaintiff's Complaint or Opposition suggests that he could advance plausible, non-conclusory allegations that Justice Wittner and the DA Defendants concocted a faux grand jury solely, or even principally, to obtain information about Plaintiff illegally; the progress and resolution of his prosecutions suggests that the necessary probable cause for such requests was always present. Once again, Plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege a claim, and Count I of the 9621 Complaint is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiff's Substantive Due Process Claims Fail\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   At his request, the Court construes Plaintiff's claims for outrageous government conduct, obstruction of justice, and equal protection as substantive due process claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9621 Pl. Opp. 19 (\"Treatment of Count II (Outrageous Government Conduct) as a 'substantive due process' claim is most appropriate[.]\"); 9621 Compl. \u00b6 63 (pleading obstruction of justice claim as a violation of Plaintiff's right to due process); 9621 Pl. Opp. 19 (\"With respect to Count V (Equal Protection), this claim is obviously an 'equal protection' claim that is clearly alleged. However it is also a 'substantive due process' claim because it also deals with 'Plaintiff's vindictive federal prosecution[.]' \") ). These allegations, taken together, form the heart of the 9621 Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   To review, \"[t]o establish a violation of substantive due process rights, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the state action was so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Okin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Vill. of Cornwall-On-Hudson Police Dep't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4043449\" index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/577/415/#p431\">\n    577 F.3d 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 431 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Plaintiff's substantive due process allegations begin with a regurgitation of his claims in the 1800 Complaint that the DA Defendants improperly used informants in the course of\n   undercover operations. (9621 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-24). In point of fact, Plaintiff's opposition papers in both cases are identical on this point. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   1800 Pl. Opp. 13-17,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   9621 Pl. Opp. 20-23). As discussed above, these allegations, even construed liberally, do not shock the contemporary conscience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Plaintiff offers one slight tweak to his factual allegations in the 9621 Complaint: He alleges that Justice Wittner \"induced [an alleged confidential informant who had been apprehended on prostitution charges] to engage in prostitution,\" by threatening her with prosecution, an unfavorable disposition, or offering her something of value. (9621 Compl. \u00b6 18). While these allegations disturb the Court, they are conclusorily, and thus insufficiently, pleaded. The 9621 Complaint includes 11 paragraphs related to the conduct of the DA Defendants, but only a few assertions regarding Justice Wittner's involvement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18-28). Additional factual allegations would be needed to \"nudge [Plaintiff's] claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Elevator Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   , 502 F.3d at 50. On the record before it, which includes the factual arguments made by Plaintiff in opposition to these motions, the Court finds that Plaintiff has not alleged, and cannot plausibly allege, that Justice Wittner and the DA Defendants compelled a prostitute to engage in prostitution - as distinguished from engaging in sting operations in which she may have held herself out as a prostitute. This claim is therefore dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Next, Plaintiff alleges that the DA Defendants and Justice Wittner solicited the USAO to prosecute him. (9621 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 36-49). And when the USAO declined to prosecute, ostensibly for \"lack of interest\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40), Plaintiff's defense counsel, Glenn Hardy, is alleged to have hired private investigator Michael Barry \"to publicize Plaintiff's case, with the intent of enticing the U.S. Attorney to take the case\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41). In his Opposition, Plaintiff also claims that \"[t]he goal was to embarrass the Plaintiff in the media hoping that he would quickly plead guilty to get the matter over with.\" (9621 Pl. Opp. 24). Barry visited Plaintiff while he was incarcerated, but then, allegedly, sold Plaintiff's story to the media. (9621 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-43). Shortly thereafter, it is alleged, the USAO expressed an interest in Plaintiff's case, and the DA Defendants arranged to transfer prosecution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Plaintiff's substantive due process allegations related to this sequence of events fail for a number of reasons. To begin, the allegations do not withstand scrutiny and implicate, even more than some of Plaintiff's other allegations, the plausibility inquiry that inheres in Rule 12(b)(6). As clarified by Defendants, and as not disputed by Plaintiff, Hardy was assigned to Corley's case through the New York County Assigned Counsel Defender Plan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hardy Br. 3). Barry, in turn, was an investigator assigned through the same program to assist Hardy in preparing Plaintiff's defense. (Gotlin Decl. \u00b6 3). Plaintiff's conclusory allegations that his defense team acted at the behest of Justice Wittner and the DA Defendants are neither well pleaded nor tethered to logic and common sense. Among other things, Plaintiff is unable to explain why Hardy would have any interest in securing Plaintiff's prompt guilty plea or piquing the interest of the USAO; indeed, the two goals are mutually contradictory. Plaintiff is similarly unable to tie Barry, whose job required him to visit Plaintiff in jail, to the publication of an article about Plaintiff's case. Without more, Plaintiff's attempt to link together - and ascribe constitutionally violative motives to - a multitude of seemingly unrelated occurrences fails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McNaughton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    de Blasio\n   </em>\n   , No. 14 Civ. 221 (KPF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20468890\">\n    2015 WL 468890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y.

Instead, Plaintiff merely alleges that, \"motivated by [the DA Defendants] and Justice Wittner, Mr. Hardy hired private investigator Michael J. Barry[.]\" (9621 Compl. \u00b6 41). Any further allegations regarding the DA Defendants' or Justice Wittner's roles in this process are fairly benign, and plainly insufficient to plead a conspiracy to violate Plaintiff's constitutional rights. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46 (alleging that Judge Wittner \"discussed the logistics of transferring evidence\"),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 47-48 (alleging that the DA Defendants offered Plaintiff a plea deal) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff alleges that the DA Defendants maintained a racist policy of prosecution, which policy he claims to be the reason for his arrest and imprisonment. (9621 Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54-55). In his Opposition, Plaintiff clarifies that this set of facts also alleges \"a 'substantive due process' claim because it deals with 'Plaintiff's vindictive federal prosecution.' \" (9621 Pl.

(1800 Pl. Opp. 30; 9621 Pl. Opp. 38). His request, however, overlooks the procedural history of his cases, particularly with regards to the 1800 action. As discussed above, the Court, on multiple occasions, ordered Plaintiff to file an amended 1800 complaint to correct the identified deficiencies. (1800 Dkt. # 15, 18). Plaintiff elected to stand on his original complaint. (1800 Dkt. # 19). Many of the identified deficiencies merited dismissal of Plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   The Court is mindful of what the Second Circuit has identified as courts' \"strong preference for resolving disputes on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Loreley Fin.

For this reason, the Court has considered the supplemental arguments and evidence that Plaintiff presented in his submissions to the Court, including his Opposition. The Court has discussed these arguments and evidence throughout its Opinion; and, as presaged by these discussions, the Court is confident that any attempt by Plaintiff to replead the claims the Court has dismissed would be futile.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cuoco\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Moritsugu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11239681\" index=\"362\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/222/99/#p112\">\n    222 F.3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 112 (2d Cir. 2000) (affirming denial of motion to amend where complaint's deficiencies were \"substantive\" and thus repleading was futile);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ganley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"363\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=734%20F.%20App%27x%20784\">\n    734 F.

Opp. 38), and \"all unknown parties\" in the 1800 action (1800 Pl. Opp. 30). With regards to the 9621 action, Plaintiff's allegations were insufficient to state a viable \u00a7 1983 claim. Therefore, \"it would be futile to permit amendment of the complaint [to include names of additional defendants] (and, by extension, to issue a Valentin order).\"\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Westchester Cty.

Jan. 30, 2015). Turning to the 1800 action, the Court previously issued a\n   <em>\n    Valentin\n   </em>\n   Order on September 13, 2016. (1800 Dkt. # 92). Defendants complied with that Order and sent Plaintiff additional information about the individuals involved in his case. (1800 Dkt. # 128). Plaintiff has not alleged why an additional\n   <em>\n    Valentin\n   </em>\n   Order is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   <strong>\n    H. The Court Denies Plaintiff's Cross-Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   As part of his opposition briefing, Plaintiff includes a multitude of \"cross motions.\" (1800 Pl. Opp. 23-30; 9621 Pl. Opp. 31-38). Many are not appropriate for inclusion in\n   his opposition papers. However, given Plaintiff's status, the Court considers each of them here and finds none to be meritorious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Default Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   In his first cross-motion, Plaintiff renews his April 18, 2018 request for the entry of default judgments against Defendants Wittner, Barry, and the City of New York. (9621 Pl. Opp. 31-33;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   9621 Dkt. # 81). On May 17, 2018, the Court denied his request. (9621 Dkt. # 82). Once again, Plaintiff advances the same argument: Defendants failed to answer the 9621 Complaint in a timely fashion. (9621 Pl. Opp. 31-33). In its prior Order, the Court declined to grant Plaintiff's request, explaining:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n   Each of the defendants against whom Plaintiff seeks an entry of default has, in fact, responded by submitting letters requesting pre-motion conferences or leave to file motions to dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 54, 76 in No. 15 Civ. 9621, and Dkt. # 138 in No. 15 Civ. 1800). Rule 4.A of the Court's Individual Rules of Practice in Civil Cases establishes that the \"submission of a pre-motion letter concerning a motion to dismiss will stay the defendant's time to answer or otherwise move with respect to the Complaint.\" Because each of the defendants has submitted pre-motion letters concerning anticipated motions to dismiss, their time to answer the Complaint has been stayed. Plaintiff's request for an entry of default is therefore denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   (9621 Dkt. # 82). Plaintiff advances no new arguments or factual allegations. As such, the Court adheres to its initial decision and denies Plaintiff's request for entry of default judgment for the same reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Sanctions on MCU\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Separately Plaintiff alleges MCU committed fraud upon the Court when it represented in its motion papers that its only disclosure to the DA Defendants was pursuant to one grand jury subpoena on January 12, 2012, \"despite clear evidence of prior disclosures.\" (1800 Pl. Opp. 2-3, 23).\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff urges the Court to impose sanctions on MCU pursuant to the Court's inherent powers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). In particular, he seeks sanctions in the amount of $ 1,000 and asks the Court to strike MCU's pleadings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Plaintiff's claim for sanctions ostensibly flows from MCU's motion papers. In support of its motion to dismiss, MCU submitted a declaration that stated that the company had replied to a Grand Jury Subpoena from ADA David Smith on January 12, 2019. (Birnbach Decl. \u00b6 6 (1800 Dkt. # 215-12) ). Contrary to Plaintiff's current claims, MCU did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   state that this was the one and only instance in which MCU had provided documents to law enforcement or other governmental entities related to Plaintiff's account information. (Birnbach Supp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6 (1800 Dkt. # 273) ). Instead, MCU indicated that a search of its records for Plaintiff's account information yielded only the January 12, 2012 subpoena. (Birnbach Supp. \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   However, as a result of the discovery produced in his criminal case, Plaintiff came into possession of a \"Business Record Certification,\" executed on August 31, 2011, by an MCU employee. (1800 Pl. Opp. 23). The document indicated that MCU\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   had made at least one additional disclosure of information concerning Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff notified MCU, which conducted a search of several archived systems and records that were not directly related to Plaintiff. (Birnbach Supp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-11). During the course of the search, MCU located, as Plaintiff suspected, an additional grand jury subpoena requesting Plaintiff's records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This subpoena was not directly related to Plaintiff or the criminal investigation that led to his conviction, and therefore had not been discovered in MCU's initial search. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   After notifying Plaintiff that its representatives had located the information he sought, MCU asked that, if Plaintiff was \"in possession of any additional information regarding purportedly improper disclosure of records, please advise as soon as possible so we can resolve any potential issues.\" (1800 Pl. Opp. 23). Plaintiff has not identified any further issues, but instead contends that MCU's offer of assistance is \"a game of 'discovery tag' to burden the Plaintiff with revealing further disclosures, before they admit to additional ones.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Having carefully considered the parties' submissions, the Court concludes that sanctions are not warranted. The Court finds no evidence that MCU misled the Court in its motion papers. To the contrary, the parties' submissions make plain that MCU acted in the normal course of business in conducting an initial search; this search did not uncover the 2011 subpoena because the subpoena was located in an archived system and was part of an unrelated case. Upon receipt of Plaintiff's request, MCU acted diligently to conduct a second search, and promptly provided Plaintiff with the resulting information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   On the record before it, the Court cannot find that any of the statements or \"material omissions\" attributed to MCU was false, much less that any statement was fraudulent or intended to cause unnecessary delays or increase the cost of litigation. The Second Circuit has explained that, under Rule 11, a factual statement \"can give rise to the imposition of sanctions only when the particular allegation is utterly lacking in support.\"\n   <em>\n    Kiobel\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Millson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5687839\" index=\"366\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/78/#p81\">\n    592 F.3d 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 81 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). It has further explained that \"[b]ad faith is the touchstone of an award under [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"367\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ],\" and that district courts should exercise their inherent power where a party has \"acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, AFL-CIO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1859429\" index=\"368\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/948/1338/#p1345\">\n    948 F.2d 1338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1345 (2d Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because the Court believes that MCU's statements to the Court were not made in bad faith, the Court will not impose sanctions on MCU. Accordingly, Plaintiff's motion for sanctions is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiff's Cross-Motions for Partial Judgment on the Pleadings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   In both the 1800 and 9621 actions, via his Opposition, Plaintiff moves for partial judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c). (1800 Pl. Opp. 26-29; 9621 Pl. Opp. 33-37). As a preliminary matter, Plaintiff cannot file such a motion until Defendants file answers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5C Charles A. Wright and Arthur R. Miller, FED. PRAC. &amp; PROC. \u00a7 1367 (3d ed.) (noting that \"the plaintiff cannot move under Rule 12(c) until after an answer has been filed\"). In addition, Plaintiff's motions fail to comply with the Court's Individual Rules of Practice in Civil Cases, which require pre-motion submissions for any motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff's motions for judgment on the pleadings are largely a rehash of\n   arguments that he has raised, and that the Court has rejected, in opposing Defendants' motions to dismiss. The Court finds no reason to reconsider these arguments, or its findings, simply because Plaintiff has recast them as separate dispositive motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   With regard to Case No. 15 Civ. 9621, Defendants' motions to dismiss are GRANTED, and Plaintiff's 9621 Complaint is dismissed in its entirety.
