This Court's Order granting the Motion to Dismiss is therefore incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Arteaga also contends that, even if his indictment should not have been dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, he nevertheless satisfies the factors of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), which governs collateral challenges to removal orders in criminal proceedings for illegal reentry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 47.
