In 2001, at the age of twelve, he came to the United States without documents to live with his sister in Miami, Florida. He subsequently moved to Massachusetts. On March 17, 2011, he was arrested in connection with a burglary in Lynn, Massachusetts. Two months later, he pled guilty and was sentenced to six months of imprisonment. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") removed Gomez-Ramirez from the country on November 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In June 2013, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") encountered Gomez-Ramirez attempting to reenter the United States in Texas. CBP reinstated his 2011 removal order and removed him again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Gomez-Ramirez then returned to the United States for a third time. ICE detained him in Lynn, Massachusetts on November 25, 2015. He was handed an NTA on the same date. The NTA stated that he was ordered to appear before an immigration judge in Boston \"on [date] To be set at [time] To be set.\" Dkt. No. 38-7 at 1. Gomez-Ramirez and an ICE officer attested on the second page of the NTA that Gomez-Ramirez was personally served with the NTA and given a list of attorneys providing free legal services. After a hearing that he attended, Gomez-Ramirez was ordered removed on December 17, 2015, and he waived his right to an appeal. On the same day, he was indicted for illegal reentry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He entered a guilty plea in February 2016 and was sentenced to time served and three years of supervised release. On June 3, 2016, Gomez-Ramirez was removed to Guatemala.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Gomez-Ramirez returned a fourth time. The government encountered him back in Lynn, Massachusetts on July 1, 2017. On April 26, 2018, he was indicted again for illegal reentry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   based on his 2015 removal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Gomez-Ramirez moves to dismiss the indictment on the basis that his 2015 removal order was entered without jurisdiction because the NTA filed with the immigration court in his case did not include the date and time of his removal hearing. He relies on the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Pereira v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   , which held that an NTA without the date and time of the removal hearing was not a valid NTA under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201229\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and did not trigger\n   the stop-time rule for cancellation of removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 2110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because Gomez-Ramirez's NTA did not include the date and time of his hearing, he contends it was invalid under\n   <em>\n    Pereira\n   </em>\n   and did not vest the immigration court with jurisdiction to order his removal. He alleges his prior removal order is therefore void and cannot support an illegal reentry charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b)(1), a defendant \"may raise by pretrial motion any defense ... that the court can determine without a trial on the merits.\" Pure questions of law are properly considered on a pretrial motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Although Gomez-Ramirez did not sign the removal order, he does not provide any evidence that his waiver was not knowing and intelligent. At the hearing, his attorneys argued that he has little formal education and cannot understand English and therefore did not comprehend the proceedings. Even if true (and there is no evidence on this point), he was given access to a list of attorneys along with his NTA. The mere fact that Gomez-Ramirez did not have an attorney at his removal hearing, without more, does not render his waiver infirm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Soto-Mateo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339853\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/117/#p120\">\n    799 F.3d at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because he waived his right to appeal, Gomez-Ramirez also cannot show that he was deprived of the opportunity to seek judicial review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Roque-Espinoza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105157\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/338/724/#p728\">\n    338 F.3d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 728-29 (7th Cir. 2003).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition, Gomez-Ramirez has failed to demonstrate that the entry of his prior removal order was fundamentally unfair. He argues that his removal proceedings were fundamentally unfair because the absence of the date and time of the hearing on his NTA deprived the immigration court of jurisdiction. Even if the immigration court did lack jurisdiction, a failure to give the time and date in the NTA does not by itself render removal proceedings fundamentally unfair when the alien was actually present for his hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lopez-Ortiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313876\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/313/225/#p230\">\n    313 F.3d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230 (5th Cir. 2002) (noting that \"[f]undamental fairness is a question of procedure\" that focuses on whether the defendant had notice, a hearing, and a fair opportunity to be heard). Gomez-Ramirez's attorneys stated at the hearing that he did not receive any notice of his removal hearing and was simply transported to the immigration court where he was ordered removed. The inability to adequately prepare a defense due to a lack of sufficient advance notice may constitute fundamental unfairness in some circumstances. Here, however, Gomez-Ramirez, has not met his burden of demonstrating that his defective NTA interfered with his ability to defend himself against removal, exhaust administrative remedies, or obtain judicial review. The record is devoid of the details of the timing or circumstances of Gomez-Ramirez's removal proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Gomez-Ramirez's motion to dismiss the indictment (Docket No. 38) is\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DENIED\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   SO ORDERED\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Before Gomez-Ramirez was removed, an immigration judge offered him voluntary departure. Gomez-Ramirez claims that the government kept him in custody without allowing him to leave the country during the thirty-day window authorized by the immigration judge. He also points out that the NTA from his 2011 removal proceedings did not include the date and time of his hearing. Because the indictment charges him with illegal reentry based on his 2015 removal order, Gomez-Ramirez conceded at the hearing that any defects in his 2011 removal proceedings, as well as the 2013 reinstatement of the 2011 removal order, are irrelevant to his motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    The stop-time rule helps determine whether an alien has been continuously present in the United States long enough to be eligible for cancellation of removal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(d)(1) ;\n    <em>\n     Pereira\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12612847\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2105/\">\n     138 S.Ct. at 2110\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Although a litigant cannot waive an argument about the subject matter jurisdiction of an Article III court,\n    <em>\n     Gonzalez v.
