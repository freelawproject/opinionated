KOELTL, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The plaintiffs, R.F.M., T.D., S.W., D.A.F.A., and O.M.S., are young immigrants who have been determined by the New York State Family Court (\"New York Family Court\" or \"Family Court\") to have been abused, abandoned, or neglected by one or both of their parents. Each plaintiff has sought Special Immigrant Juvenile (\"SIJ\") status -- a form of immigration relief that provides a path to lawful permanent residence in the United States\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -- and received a denial. The plaintiffs allege that in early 2018 the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"), the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"), and individual officers of those agencies\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (collectively \"the defendants\") adopted a new policy without notice, and that prior to this policy change, the plaintiffs' SIJ applications would have been granted. The plaintiffs seek to enjoin the agency's reliance on that policy, arguing that the policy violates the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and is based on an erroneous understanding of federal and New York State law. The defendants counter that there is no new policy but merely a centralization of the SIJ adjudication process coupled with a clarification of the SIJ statute and that, in any event, their interpretation of the SIJ statute accords with federal and state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiffs move to certify a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and for leave to proceed with this litigation anonymously. The defendants move to dismiss this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), and the parties cross-move for summary judgment\n   under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 on all of their legal claims. The plaintiffs previously moved for a preliminary injunction but have withdrawn that motion as moot because the Court is promptly deciding the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, which are based on the same issues that were briefed in the preliminary injunction motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 7, 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   It is plain that the defendants, contrary to their prior practice, and in contravention of federal law, are now following a policy whereby the New York Family Court cannot issue the necessary findings to juvenile immigrants between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one to enable them to obtain SIJ status. That effectively precludes those immigrants in New York State from obtaining SIJ status despite the fact that the immigration statute otherwise provides that relief. If the immigration laws are to be changed in that way, the change must come from Congress and not from the immigration authorities. Therefore, the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment should be granted, and the plaintiffs' motion for class certification should also be granted and they should be allowed to proceed anonymously. The defendants' motions should be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In defending against a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), the plaintiffs bear the burden of proving the Court's jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Makarova v.

The named plaintiffs belong to the subcategory of the class involving those who have been issued decisions denying SIJ status, but the class\n   also includes individuals whose SIJ petitions are still pending and individuals whose SIJ status was revoked after January 1, 2016. The defendants contend that typicality is not satisfied because (1) the plaintiffs whose petitions are still pending do not have ripe claims and (2) the Court lacks jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(ii) to review claims by the plaintiffs who have received SIJ status revocations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The defendants' argument again incorrectly assumes that the plaintiffs seek review of their individual claims. The plaintiffs do not seek to litigate individual claims but rather a policy the agency uses to adjudicate those claims. The policy challenged by the plaintiffs poses the same \"risk of an injury\" to all members of the class, even those who have not yet received a final decision on their SIJ petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baby Neal for and by Kanter v.

Moreover, the plaintiffs' vulnerability is evidenced by the fact that they have been declared dependent on the New York Family Court.

Any risk of prejudice to the defendants is slight.

In this case, the plaintiffs have retained their anonymity, which weighs in favor of allowing the plaintiffs to continue proceeding anonymously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The eighth and ninth factors ask the Court to weigh the public's interest in disclosure. Here, there is a weak public interest in knowing the plaintiffs' identities because this case is based purely on questions of law. The particular identities of the plaintiffs have \"little bearing on the nature of the dispute or the merits of the case,\" and the issue of the plaintiffs' identities is \"largely irrelevant to the public concern with the nature of the process.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

One such measure has already been taken: the plaintiffs have disclosed their identities to the defendants so that the government could retrieve all of the relevant administrative records. The defendants suggest that rather than allowing the plaintiffs to proceed anonymously, the Court should allow certain documents in this case to be filed in redacted form or under seal. However, there is no reason to think that redacted documents would further the public's interest in disclosure any more than documents identifying the plaintiffs by their initials and, as previously discussed, risk of prejudice to the defendants has been mitigated because the plaintiffs have disclosed their identities to the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Having weighed and considered all the relevant factors, the balance of considerations tilts decidedly in favor of allowing the plaintiffs to proceed anonymously.

Rather, they contest the agency policy on which the revocation decisions rest. They seek to prevent the agency from denying SIJ status to juveniles based on a policy that prevents the New York Family Court from being considered a juvenile court for purposes of issuing findings for SIJ status. And there is no assertion by the defendants that the agency policy was promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 1155 or any other of the statutory provisions to which \u00a7 1252's jurisdictional bar applies.

According to the defendants, because there is no new policy, and because this portion of the plaintiff class has not received a final decision on their SIJ petitions, there is no reviewable agency action under \u00a7 704 of the APA. The plaintiffs argue that there has been a fundamental policy change. Specifically, the plaintiffs contend that for several years the USCIS has routinely granted SIJ status to petitioners in New York between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one who received the necessary findings from the New York\n   Family Court, Am. Compl. \u00b6 6, but that because of a recent change in policy, the USCIS has consistently denied SIJ status to virtually all petitioners in New York between those ages on the ground that the Family Court is not a \"juvenile court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The USCIS does not dispute that until early 2018, it regularly approved SIJ applications by petitioners who were older than eighteen when they received a Special Findings Order from a New York Family Court, and that after early 2018 it began denying virtually all such petitions on the grounds that the Family Court was not acting as a \"juvenile court.\" The USCIS attributes its sudden departure from its past practice to a November 2016 decision to centralize the adjudication of SIJ petitions. Before November 2016, SIJ decisions were made by individual field offices. In November 2016, the USCIS centralized its processing of SIJ petitions at its National Benefits Center in Missouri. AR 621, 650, 655.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As part of this centralization, the USCIS provided training to its National Benefits Center adjudicators and updated the USCIS Policy Manual.

The administrative record shows that the agency's Office of Chief Counsel undertook\n   a review process and issued a directive in February 2018 instructing its employees on how to interpret the SIJ statute. The USCIS itself describes the process undertaken to reach this policy in its briefs. According to the USCIS, after SIJ adjudications were centralized in the National Benefits Center, the National Benefits Center and the USCIS Field Office Directorate both requested additional guidance from the USCIS Office of Chief Counsel regarding cases where a state court issued a Special Findings Order during guardianship proceedings for those between eighteen and twenty-one years of age. The February 2018 Legal Guidance was issued in response to that request. The agency paused its adjudication of pending cases that would be affected by the legal guidance. It was only after the February 2018 Legal Guidance was issued that the agency began adjudicating these cases again, and it did so in accordance with the February 2018 guidance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

This argument is simply wrong. The denials and prospective denials of SIJ status are based on the agency's allegedly incorrect interpretation of the SIJ statute based on its new statutory interpretation and not on the statute itself. The stark departure in the agency's evaluation of New York-based SIJ petitions cannot be explained by the agency's assertion that the plaintiffs' denials flowed from the regulations and SIJ statute itself, because neither the regulations nor the statute changed in early 2018. The only change explaining the departure was the new policy set forth in the agency's February 2018 Legal Guidance. It was not until the agency issued the guidance that SIJ status denials for plaintiffs in New York State between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one who had received Special Findings Orders from the New York Family Court became the norm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Accordingly, both prongs of\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   are satisfied, and the policy is reviewable under the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The plaintiffs and defendants both move for summary judgment on the issues of whether the agency's new policy is arbitrary, capricious, in excess of statutory jurisdiction, and contrary to law, and whether the agency was required to provide public notice of its policy change under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Courts are required to set aside agency actions that are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A).

The defendants argue that the agency's positions as expressed in the February 2018 Legal Guidance are reasonable and in accordance with the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The dispute centers on the questions of whether, to qualify as a juvenile court, the New York Family Court must have (1) jurisdiction over the custody of the petitioners, and (2) the authority to order reunification between the juvenile and an unfit parent. The agency's new policy answers both of these questions in the affirmative. However, as explained below, these requirements go beyond the scope of the SIJ statute and lack a reasoned explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The first basis for the agency's conclusion that the New York Family Court is not a \"juvenile court\" when it exercises jurisdiction over juveniles who are between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one is that, according to the agency, the Family Court lacks jurisdiction to grant custodial rights over juveniles older than eighteen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The agency's implementing regulations define a \"juvenile court\" as a court \"having jurisdiction under State law to make judicial determinations about the custody and care of juveniles.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.11\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Based on this regulation, the agency maintains that to be a juvenile court for purposes of the SIJ statute, the Family Court must have jurisdiction over the individual juvenile's custody. According to the agency, when a state court lacks authority to make custody determinations over an individual juvenile, the state court is not a \"juvenile court\" under the SIJ statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The agency's requirement -- that to be a juvenile court the state court must have jurisdiction to make custody determinations --is inconsistent with the SIJ statute's plain language, which requires that a juvenile be declared dependent on a juvenile court\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   placed in a qualifying custody arrangement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(27)(J)(i) (An SIJ is an immigrant \"who has been declared dependent on a juvenile court ...\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   whom such a court has legally committed to, or placed under the custody of, an agency or department of a State, or an individual ....\" (emphasis added) ). Congress expressly listed any SIJ prerequisites dealing with custody in the disjunctive, such that a custody order cannot be required in cases where the juvenile has been declared dependent on the juvenile court. The disjunctive nature of the statute is particularly important in this case, because the USCIS concedes that under New York law, a Family Court guardianship order is a dependency order under the SIJ statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 77 at 16 n.6. Accordingly, the plain language of the SIJ statute dictates that the Family Court need not have the authority to make a custody determination in cases where it appoints a guardian. And indeed for each of the named plaintiffs in this case, the Family Court appointed a guardian for the plaintiff and thus the plaintiff satisfied the statute because the plaintiff was dependent on the Family Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   In making its argument that the Family Court must nevertheless have authority over the juvenile's custody, the agency relies on its implementing regulation found in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.11\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). That regulation defines a juvenile court as \"a court located in the United States having jurisdiction under State law to make judicial determinations about the custody and care of juveniles.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.11\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). But this language is a relic of the agency's interpretation of the statute when the statute required that the juvenile be eligible for long-term foster care as a prerequisite for a finding of SIJ status. That requirement was removed in 2008, but the regulations were not changed. Moreover, the agency's interpretation of the term \"juvenile court\" is contrary to the plain language of the SIJ statute. By interpreting the term \"juvenile court\" to require that the Family Court have authority to make custody determinations, the agency imposes a requirement that is contrary to the plain text of the statute. While agencies have the authority to construe ambiguous statutes reasonably, they do not have the authority to change the statute's plain language chosen by Congress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morton v.

This argument is belied by the record. The record makes clear that the plaintiffs' Special Findings Orders were based on state law and that under state law the plaintiffs were declared \"dependent\" on the juvenile court. R.F.M.'s Special Findings Order, for example, states that the Family Court has jurisdiction over R.F.M. until she turns twenty-one under New York Family Court Act \u00a7 661(a) and Surrogate Court's Procedure Act \u00a7\u00a7 103(27) and 1700\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   AR 343-44.

Indeed, such a broad use of the consent function contravenes the directives in the agency's Consolidated Handbook of Adjudication Procedures, which instructs that the USCIS \"should defer to the juvenile court's interpretation of the relevant state laws\" and, accordingly, \"a petition should not be denied based on USCIS' interpretation of the relevant state laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 728;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527970\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/341/1048/#p1055\">\n    341 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1061 n.6 (explaining that even if \"the statute's consent requirement requires it to review SIJ petitions to determine whether the juvenile court order is bona fide, ... whether a juvenile court order is bona fide has no bearing on whether the issuing court had jurisdiction\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The plaintiffs also argue that the agency's policy is procedurally defective because the agency failed to provide adequate notice under \u00a7 706 of the APA, which requires courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be \"without observance of procedure required by law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(D).

However, the USCIS's narrow interpretation of the New York Family Court's jurisdiction to issue Special Findings Orders for petitioners over the age of eighteen -- which was the dispositive factor in the denial of each named plaintiff's SIJ petition -- cannot be found in the Policy Manual. At oral argument, the defendants stated that Section J.D.2 of its Policy Manual explains its policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 54. That section, however, merely states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   [t]he juvenile court must find that reunification with one or both parents is not viable due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis under the relevant state child welfare laws.
