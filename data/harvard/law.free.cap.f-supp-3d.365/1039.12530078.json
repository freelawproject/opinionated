The mere fact that the Copyrighted Material has a business purpose of collecting and disseminating information does not render it unprotectable. The exclusion of functional works from copyright protection is intended to prevent the copyrighting of a method or process that is dictated by the purpose served. It is not intended to block copyright protection of expressive works. While the \"contents\" of the Copyrighted Material and liability disclaimer are unprotectable ideas, copyright does protect the manner of their presentation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Affiliated Hosp.

While the Court is not aware of\n   any corresponding case law applying the same approach to a \"virtually identical\" determination for materials protected only by a thin copyright, it is not an unreasonable extension of existing law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   However, the Court cannot conclude from the pleadings alone that merger or sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire apply.

It is not readily apparent from the FAC that there are sufficiently few means of expressing the ideas in the disclaimer such that the ideas and expressions merge, or that the language of a disclaimer is akin, in the legal profession, to a stock scene or character. Defendants offer no authority suggesting that disclaimers of this sort can only be crafted in one or two ways. Instead, Defendants attempt to shift the burden of showing that there are many ways of expressing the idea of a liability disclaimer onto Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 25 at 5. Once the presumption of copyrightability has been established by the existence of a copyright registration certificate, it is the burden of the party challenging copyrightability to show that an exception applies. Moreover, on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) the Court assumes the truth of well pled allegations and does not engage in factual determinations. There is a marked and conspicuous similarity in the two disclaimers, including word choice and phrasing, but it is not readily apparent from the complaint that the similarities are owed to the nature of a disclaimer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Even if the Copyrighted Material is a functional work, or merger or sc\u00e8nes \u00e0 faire applied, it is still entitled to thin protection. The Court cannot conclude as a matter of law that thin protection would not bar the alleged infringement. A reasonable finder of fact could conclude that the disclaimer of liability contained within Defendants' form is virtually identical to its opposite number in the Copyrighted Material. Notable is the identical wording in the salutation and first sentence, the first clause of which is non-functional as a disclaimer in that it expresses in \"advertising speech\" the intention to provide excellent service. The only changes, apart from those mandated by the layout, are the alteration of the word \"best\" to all-caps, the addition in Defendants' disclaimer of a comma between \"service\" and \"and,\" the replacement of underlining with all-caps and the deletion of the word \"any\" in the phrase \"necessary for us to disclaim any and all damages,\" and omissions to the list of specific types of damage for which liability is disclaimed. Defendants' sheet also includes a bolded statement to the effect that car wash employees are not permitted to remove child seats or other child restraints. ECF No. 18-1 at 4.
