Madison does not allege that he never was able to order a drink or that he never had his coat hung. Instead, Madison claims \"that Courtney did not\n   <em>\n    offer\n   </em>\n   to hang his heavy wool 'pea coat' when she\n   <em>\n    offered\n   </em>\n   to hang the light blazer of the Caucasian gentleman seated next to him, and\n   <em>\n    offered\n   </em>\n   to hang the coats of all of the other First Class passengers.\" Pl.'s Resp. 22, ECF No. 66 (emphasis added). Madison therefore claims he was denied a privilege and benefit of the first-class ticket that no white passenger was denied-an\n   <em>\n    offer\n   </em>\n   to hang any outer garments. Next, Madison claims \"Courtney took drink orders from all of the first class passengers except Plaintiff,\" Compl. \u00b6 9, ECF No. 1, and that after Madison requested a beverage-and after Courtney responded mockingly-Courtney returned with a beverage that contained mucus,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10-12. This raises two potential incidents of discrimination: (1) Madison was never\n   <em>\n    offered\n   </em>\n   drink service and (2) Madison was served an adulterated beverage while no white first-class passenger was.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In other words, Madison alleges that, in multiple contexts, he was denied \"the\n   <em>\n    same right\n   </em>\n   ... to make and enforce contracts ... as ... enjoyed by white citizens ... includ[ing] ... the enjoyment of\n   <em>\n    all benefits [and] privileges\n   </em>\n   ... of the contractual relationship.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and (b) (emphasis added). As the undisputed evidence shows, Madison's first-class ticket entitled him to an\n   <em>\n    offer\n   </em>\n   of coat service and an\n   <em>\n    offer\n   </em>\n   of beverage service-both of which he claims he did not receive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. App. 24, ECF No. 67. That is, Madison does not simply claim he received poor service, but that he was denied the full benefits of the relevant contractual relationship while all white first-class passengers were afforded the full benefits of the relevant contractual relationship. This distinguishes Madison's claims from the retail cases cited by the Defendants, which involved retail contracts-contracts that do not promise a particular level or type of service and instead implicate only a transaction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arguello v.

Br. Supp. 9, ECF No. 63. Under the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework, Madison bears the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of contract discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Fahim v. Marriott Hotel Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5750956\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/551/344/\">\n    551 F.3d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2008), offers an instructive formulation of the elements of a prima facie contract-discrimination case. In\n   <em>\n    Fahim\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit adopted the district court's framework, which provided that the plaintiff could meet her initial burden under\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   by showing \"that (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she attempted to contract for the services of a public accommodation; (3) she was denied those services; and (4) the services were made available to similarly situated persons outside her protected class.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5750956\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/551/344/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5750956\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/551/344/\">\n    at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rephrasing the\n   <em>\n    Fahim\n   </em>\n   elements, Madison may establish a prima facie case by offering evidence that (1) he is a member of a protected class, (2) he attempted to enjoy certain privileges and benefits of his first-class ticket, (3) he was denied those privileges and benefits, and (4) those benefits and privileges were made available to similarly situated persons outside his protected class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   There is no dispute here as to the first prong. As to the remaining prongs, Madison alleges four separate facts to support his claim that he was denied privileges and benefits offered to similarly situated individuals: (1) he was not offered coat service while all other first-class passengers were, (2) he was not offered drink service while all other first-class passengers were, (3) Courtney spit in his drink, and (4) he was not permitted to file a formal complaint with the gate agent. As an initial matter, the Court finds Madison's fourth factual allegation-that he was not permitted to file a formal complaint-cannot support a claim under \u00a7 1981 as a matter of law. The Defendants point out it is American's policy that passengers lodge formal complaints online, not with gate agents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Br. Supp. 17, ECF No. 63. Madison does not-and seemingly cannot-dispute this policy or otherwise demonstrate that any similarly situated individual outside Madison's protected class was permitted to submit a formal complaint with the gate agent. The Court therefore finds that the Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Madison's claim that his inability to file an immediate complaint with the gate agent demonstrates a \u00a7 1981 violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   With respect to the remaining three factual incidents alleged, the Court finds that Madison has satisfied his initial prima facie burden. \"The burden of establishing a prima facie case of disparate treatment is not onerous.\"\n   <em>\n    Burdine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184064\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/248/#p254\">\n    450 U.S. at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184064\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/248/#p254\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Madison has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) he was denied the customary coat service,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) he was denied the customary beverage service,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) a foreign substance resembling mucus was found in the drink he did receive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In response to these alleged instances of discrimination, the Defendants offer a series of justifications they claim are legitimate and nondiscriminatory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burdine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184064\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/248/#p254\">\n    450 U.S. at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184064\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/248/#p254\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting a defendant may \"rebut the presumption of discrimination by producing evidence that the\" perceived discriminatory treatment was justified by \"a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\"). For example, with respect to Madison's claim that Courtney did not offer to hang Madison's coat, the Defendants respond that \"[t]he boarding process is one of the busiest times of the flight for flight attendants, especially when working the first-class section of the aircraft\" and that, for this reason, \"Courtney may have offered to hang some jackets and then was alerted that there was a problem in another cabin that needed her attention.\" Defs.' Br. Supp. 12-13, ECF No. 63. With respect to Madison's claim that Courtney skipped Madison during beverage service, the Defendants respond that \"Courtney saw that Plaintiff was working on his laptop, with his headphones on, followed her training, and did not interrupt him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Finally, the Defendants deny that the substance in Madison's drink was mucus and deny that it came from Courtney.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Whether there was mucus in Madison's drink and, if so, where it came from are disputed material facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

And assuming the Defendants have met their burden to offer competent evidence of legitimate, nondiscriminatory justifications for delayed coat and beverage service,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court finds the Defendants fail to demonstrate there is no genuine dispute about any fact material to Madison's ability to prove the Defendants' nondiscriminatory justifications are unworthy of credence or are mere pretext.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burdine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184064\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/248/#p254\">\n    450 U.S. at 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184064\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/248/#p254\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[S]hould the defendant carry this burden, the plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.\"). For example, the Defendants assert Courtney ultimately hung Madison's coat. Defs.' Br. Supp. 14 ECF No. 63 (\"When Plaintiff wanted his jacket hung, he got Courtney's attention, requested that she hang up his jacket, and she did so,\n   without incident.\"). Madison claims she did not.

Defendants argue that Madison was distracted during beverage service and that Courtney followed her training to move on. Madison argues Courtney continued to deliberately avoid serving him.
