Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Petitioner presents several grounds upon which his defense counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance, thereby undermining his knowing entry of a guilty plea. First, he contends that counsel failed to adequately explain the consequences of the appeal waiver in the plea agreement. Instead, counsel incorrectly explained \"that there was no benefit from filing an appeal even without the waiver.\"\n   <strong>\n    ECF\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    No. 1\n   </strong>\n   at 4.

Moreover, petitioner is mistaken in believing (1) that access to court-appointed counsel ceased at sentencing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

July 7, 1999) (collecting cases indicating when an indigent criminal defendant is afforded a right to court-appointed counsel); (2) that the appeal waiver would foreclose him from raising retroactively applicable Supreme Court cases,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3) (noting that a section 2255 petition may be filed within one year of a relevant, retroactively-applicable Supreme Court decision); and (3) that failing to appeal somehow imposed a financial cost on him,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Loc.

But, he does not indicate how this constitutes ineffective assistance in terms of what he may have requested counsel to do in response to his dissatisfaction. Petitioner's personal expression of disappointment does not, alone, sustain a claim for ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Last, he argues that counsel performed deficiently by failing to inform him that, by pleading guilty, the \"disputed facts in the presentence report\" (\"PSR\") regarding the \"exact drug weight and his role [in the conspiracy] would be made permanent and virtually unchallengeable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court concluded that the PSR accurately portrayed the evidence proffered describing petitioner's \"leadership role.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 16-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court invited petitioner to raise further objections to the PSR or\n   elaborate on those raised by counsel, but he declined.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 26-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, there is no basis to conclude that defense counsel performed deficiently for failing to object to the quantity of drugs involved where there is no indication that petitioner actually expressed any concerns with that information prior to his present petition to vacate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
