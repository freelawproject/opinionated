The Court need not reach that question, however, for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, plaintiffs' allegations supporting their \u00a7 1983 claim against Mann are entirely conclusory. The only reference to Mann in connection with that claim is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Because DCPS authorized Dale Mann to place Wilson[ ] in classrooms composed of children from outside the John Eaton boundary area for the purpose of causing those children to disenroll and thereby create more seats for children of affluent families residing within the Cleveland Park neighborhood, and because Morgan and the African-American students at the school almost entirely resided outside the boundary area, DCPS' conduct violated Plaintiff's rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment to be free from discrimination on the basis of his sex and race.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   SAC \u00b6 210. These assertions focus on DCPS's conduct, not Mann's.

This section would appear relevant to the parties' dispute about the scope of Mann and Anderson's authority to supervise or terminate Wilson: Plaintiffs argue that principals and vice-principals have at least the authority to investigate and discipline teachers such as Wilson in response to complaints or sexual harassment, and the school officials respond that it is the superintendent and her designees, not the principal or vice-principal, who have the power to terminate a teacher like Wilson.

Mann and Anderson argue that they did not have \"reasonable cause to suspect\" that Morgan was in any danger of abuse based on Doe's reports, let alone immediate danger. M/A MTD at 15. But, as they recognize, the Court rejected a similar argument when plaintiffs moved to file their second amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Op. at 8 (\"At this early stage in the litigation, these alleged reports were not too vague to implicate the reporting requirements of section 4-1321.02.\").

SAC \u00b6\u00b6 83-92, 234. That suffices for purposes of this motion. Therefore, the Court will also deny Mann and Anderson's motion to dismiss with respect to plaintiffs' negligence\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Other Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, Wilson asks the Court to strike from plaintiffs' prayers for relief their request that the District of Columbia be ordered to revoke Wilson's teaching license and enter his name into a national database that helps guard against educators charged with or convicted of a sexual offense from returning to the classroom. Wilson MTD at 11-12. Wilson cites District of Columbia regulations, and associated agency guidance, which require the D.C. Office of the State Superintendent of Education (\"OSSE\") to revoke the credential of a teacher charged with or convicted of certain offenses, including a sexual offense involving a minor, and report that teacher's name to other states. D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 5A, \u00a7\u00a7 1607.1(b)(4) &amp; 1607.5 ; OSSE Educator Credential Denial, Suspension, and Revocation Procedures Guidebook (April 2018) (citing D.C. Mun. Regs. tit. 5A, \u00a7 1607 ). Wilson says there is no basis for this requested relief because plaintiffs concede that he has not been charged with nor convicted of any crime relating to Morgan. Wilson MTD at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Wilson may well be correct that the cited regulation would not authorize the OSSE to take the actions plaintiffs seek. And it bears emphasizing that Wilson has not been charged with or convicted of any crime in connection with the events leading to this lawsuit. But the Court sees no reason to relinquish its own equitable powers prior to any findings of liability in the case.

Regs. tit. 5E, \u00a7 1402.1, the District's student grievance procedures require a principal to initiate an investigation into complaints of sexual harassment by teachers and to produce a written report that includes \"a description of any follow up actions taken or to be taken, including any intervention or disciplinary action,\" D.C.
