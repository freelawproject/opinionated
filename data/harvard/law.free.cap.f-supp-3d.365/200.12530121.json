While the specification refers to \"error detection bits\" or an \"error detection code,\" the language in the claims are not limited to a code for detection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p750\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at col. 16, ll. 50-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   IV points out that throughout the '442 patent, interfaces appear to use error correction codes to detect errors in data and trigger a retry protocol.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302102\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/742/#p750\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at col. 16, ll. 51-56 (\"The ecc[7:0] field provides error DETECTION coverage over the full packet ...\"); col. 19, ll. 3-5 (The CIB logic \"must generate ECC, detect errors, and invoke a retry procedure for error recovery.\"); col. 19, ll. 55-56 (\"ECC error detection will put the CIB logic in 'error retry' mode.\"). However, \"[t]he claims, not specification embodiments, define the scope of patent protection.

Moreover, going back to the preferred embodiment in the specification, \"[a]lthough [the] error detection code actually does provide information for single bit error correction, this is not used for Channel data.\" '442 patent at col. 16, ll. 52-54. Thus, the specification confirms that the code has the ability to correct data, not just detect errors. Therefore, \"error correction code\" is construed to mean \"a code that can be used to correct erroneous data.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court construes the disputed terms as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \u2022 \"packet\" is \"a basic unit of transport over a channel\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   \u2022 \"error correction\" is \"correcting errors in data by at least reconstructing erroneous data\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   \u2022 \"error correction code\" is \"a code that can be used to correct erroneous data.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Lenovo Group Ltd., Lenovo (United States) Inc., LenovoEMC Products USA, LLC, EMC Corp., and NetApp, Inc.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The '442 patent's claims refer to the use of \"ECC.\" Both parties agree that ECC means \"error correction code.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The magistrate judge ultimately adopted IV's position holding that error correction means \"reconstruction of erroneous data\" but rejected HCC's position that error correction had to be performed with \"error correction codes.\" HCC Litigation R &amp; R at 8.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
