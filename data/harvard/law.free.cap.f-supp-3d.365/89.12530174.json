INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the early morning hours of May 6, 2018, Officers Dennis Sfoglia and Nizam Ahmed of the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (\"MPD\") arrived at the scene of a suspected drive-by shooting to find Defendant Harshia Johnson lying in the street. By the time the officers had gotten out of their squad car, Johnson was on his feet and walking away, but the officers noticed that he was leaning slightly to his left and that his left arm was tucked against his side. Fearing that Johnson may have been shot, the officers' initial response was perfectly sensible. They approached Johnson and instructed him to come toward them, which he did. They asked Johnson if he had been shot; he responded that he had not. They looked at Johnson's hands and arms; they saw no signs of a gunshot wound. Nonetheless, within seconds, instead of asking Johnson additional questions to ensure he was uninjured, one of the officers proceeded to grab and pull on Johnson's left arm-the arm that was pressed against his side. Eventually, the officer succeeded in moving Johnson's arm outward and away from his body, which exposed Johnson's inner jacket pocket, as well as the gun held inside of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For purposes of the Fourth Amendment, this was a search-and one that, as the Court will explain below, lacked objective justification. Indeed, the government has failed to demonstrate that the search was a reasonable exercise of the officers' community caretaking functions, or that it was based on a reasonable suspicion that Johnson was armed and dangerous. The Court therefore concludes that the search was unconstitutional and grants Johnson's motion to suppress all physical evidence subsequently obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At around 1:10 am on May 6, Officer Sfoglia and Officer Ahmed were in their squad car when Officer Ahmed received a notification on his phone from an installed Shot Spotter application, designed to alert MPD officers when the sounds of gunshots have been detected in their assigned areas of patrol.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rough Transcript of Nov. 18, 2018 Hearing (\"Hearing Tr.\") at 6, 8, 11. This particular alert indicated that three distinct shots had been heard on the 3700 block of Horner Place SE-just a few blocks away from Officer Sfoglia and Officer Ahmed's location at the time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15. Then as the officers began to drive to Horner Place, they received a radio call from their district dispatcher reiterating that three gunshots had been detected on Horner's 3700 block.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-17; Audio of Radio Call, Gov't's Ex. 5. The dispatcher added that, based on the Shot Spotter application's sensors, the source of the\n   gunshots appeared to be moving at twenty-eight miles per hour, indicating that this had been a drive-by. Hearing Tr. at 17; Audio of Radio Call, Gov't's Ex. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Officer Sfoglia and Officer Ahmed arrived at the scene within a few minutes, and as they pulled up, they claim to have seen a man-later identified as Harshia Johnson-lying in the street and \"in the process of getting up.\" Hearing Tr. at 18;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 50. For purposes of Johnson's motion to suppress, this is the only factual issue in dispute: Johnson denies ever being on the ground.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-54, 63. Both Officer Sfoglia's and Officer Ahmed's body camera footage from this time is available, but it is of no use on this issue because, as both officers were still seated in the squad car at the time, the footage shows only the car's interior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The body camera footage does, however, make clear that, by the time the officers exited the car, Johnson was on his feet and walking away from them across the street.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ahmed Body-Worn Camera Footage (\"Ahmed BWC\") at 2:00-2:04, Gov't's Ex. 2. Johnson was, according to Officer Ahmed's later testimony, leaning slightly to his left and holding his left forearm at roughly a ninety degree-angle, with his left elbow tucked closely to his side.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hearing Tr. at 20. As Officer Ahmed put it, \"it appeared as if [Johnson] was shot in the arm.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At this time, the body camera footage shows that Officer Sfoglia began to follow Johnson across the street and said, \"Yo, come here for a second.\" Ahmed BWC at 2:00-2:04. Officer Ahmed, who was walking behind Officer Sfoglia, then briefly shined his flashlight on Johnson, and as he did so, Officer Sfoglia said, \"Hey\"-raising the volume of his voice a touch.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:04. As Johnson began to turn around, Officer Sfoglia repeated, \"Come here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:05. Johnson responded by taking a few steps toward the officers, during which time Officer Sfoglia said, \"Let me see your hands,\" following up a second later with, \"Did you get shot?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:08.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Johnson responded, \"No, I didn't,\" and he and Officer Sfoglia continued to walk toward one another.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:08-2:10. By the time Officer Sfoglia replied, \"You didn't?,\" he and Johnson were just a few feet apart. Sfoglia Body-Worn Camera Footage (\"Sfoglia BWC\") at 00:15, Gov't's Ex. 1. Officer Ahmed joined them within a couple of seconds and stood to Officer Sfoglia's left.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ahmed BWC at 2:14. In compliance with Officer Sfoglia's earlier instruction, Johnson had stretched out his right hand so that the officers could examine it. Sfoglia BWC at 00:16. He was wearing an unzipped, black leather jacket over a black t-shirt. Officer Sfoglia briefly put his left hand on the outside of Johnson's jacket at the right bicep, looked at the right hand, then pointed to Johnson's left arm, and repeated, \"Let me see your hand.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 00:16-00:20. Johnson responded by turning his body so that Officer Sfoglia could see his left side.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 00:20-22. His left arm remained in the same position the officers had noticed when they got out of their car-elbow tucked into his side and forearm at roughly a ninety-degree angle. Ahmed BWC at 2:15-2:16. With his hand unclenched and resting several inches in front of his abdomen, it was as if Johnson was wearing an invisible sling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As soon as Johnson showed his left arm, Officer Sfoglia began pulling on Johnson's jacket sleeve at the wrist while Officer Ahmed shined his flashlight on Johnson's left side.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:16. Johnson resisted this pulling and kept his arm in the same position, after which Officer Sfoglia asked, \"You can't put the hand down?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:17. Officer Sfoglia continued to tug at Johnson's sleeve, and eventually, Johnson's arm moved outward.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:17-2:19. When\n   Johnson's arm shifted, the area on his left side between his jacket and shirt became visible to Officer Ahmed. His flashlight still on, Officer Ahmed's eyes \"locked onto the handle of [a] gun\" held in Johnson's inner jacket pocket. Hearing Tr. at 24; Ahmed BWC at 2:18-2:19. As this happened, the pulling on Johnson's sleeve also caused his torso to rotate to his left, exposing the inside of Johnson's left side to Officer Sfoglia. Ahmed BWC at 2:18-2:20. Noticing Officer Ahmed's reaction, Officer Sfoglia looked down, saw the gun himself, and yelled \"gun\" four times.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The two officers then together took Johnson to the ground and arrested him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:25-2:26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the officers handcuffed Johnson, they recovered the gun that they had spotted-a loaded Glock 19, 9mm semi-automatic pistol.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 1, ECF No. 1. Johnson also later underwent a search incident to his arrest, during which a pill bottle containing multiple clear bags of cocaine was found on his person, in addition to around 370 dollars in cash. Ultimately, Johnson was indicted on three counts: (1) unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition by a person convicted of a felony, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) ; (2) possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (b)(1)(C) ; and (3) using, carrying, and possessing a firearm during a drug trafficking offense, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Presently before the Court is Johnson's motion to suppress all physical evidence seized during his encounter with the police on May 6. As Johnson sees it, Officer Sfoglia and Officer Ahmed violated his Fourth Amendment rights when they stopped and searched him on the street without a warrant. Johnson therefore contends that the gun that was recovered must be excluded, because it constitutes evidence obtained as a direct result of the officer's illegal actions. And because the gun is what provided the officers probable cause to arrest him, Johnson argues that the arrest was illegal too, meaning the evidence recovered during his arrest-the pill bottle, drug evidence, and cash-must be excluded as \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Utah v.

The gun, Johnson asserts, is primary evidence obtained directly from the illegal conduct, while the remaining evidence-the pill bottle, the drug evidence, and the cash-constitute fruit of the poisonous tree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In response, the government argues that two different exceptions justify the officers' conduct during their initial interaction with Johnson. The first is the infrequently invoked \"community caretaking exception,\" which has been described, in general terms, as \"a catchall\" that can be used to justify police action taken pursuant to the \"wide range of responsibilities that ... officers must discharge aside from their criminal enforcement activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Matalon v.

The second is the far more familiar\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   exception, which permits a police officer to (1) briefly stop and detain a person for investigative purposes if the officer has a reasonable suspicion that \"criminal activity may be afoot,\" and (2) conduct a limited pat-down search if the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the person is \"armed and presently dangerous to the officer or to others.\"\n   <em>\n    Minnesota v.

No search or seizure occurred in this case, the government contends, because Johnson consented to his encounter with the officers up until the point that the gun was discovered in plain view, at which time probable cause arose to lawfully arrest him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As explained below, none of the government's arguments are persuasive.

Once physical contact was initiated, Johnson's freedom of movement was restricted, and no reasonable person would have felt free to leave. No later than that moment of first physical contact, Johnson became seized for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325148,12310423\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/625/\">\n    825 F.3d at 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that individual was seized when officer \"touched\" him on his arm, \"instructed him to 'hold on,' \" and individual complied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The officers' search of Johnson then quickly followed. As an initial matter, contrary to the government's assertions, the gun was never in plain view. As the body camera footage and Officer Ahmed's testimony both make clear, the gun became visible only after Officer Sfoglia had grabbed Johnson's left arm and lifted it up. The footage shows that Officer Sfoglia pulled on Johnson's jacket sleeve at the wrist until the arm moved outward, exposing the area between his jacket and t-shirt, including his inner jacket pocket, which held the gun. Ahmed BWC at 2:16-2:20. And Officer Ahmed testified that \"[i]t was after the left arm was raised up, [when] ... Johnson's jacket flared open, [that] [he] observed the handle of the firearm.\" Hearing Tr. at 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The question, then, is whether pulling at Johnson's sleeve and moving his arm constituted a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment-or, in other words, whether doing so infringed on \"an expectation of privacy that society is prepared to consider reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173220,4340628\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/799/1097/\">\n    799 F.3d at 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Jacobsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194938\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/109/#p113\">\n    466 U.S. at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6194938\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/109/#p113\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The answer to that question is easy. As the D.C. Circuit has said, \"[w]hen a government agent unfastens, lifts, pulls down, pats, or otherwise manipulates clothing to reveal or determine what lies underneath, that manipulation necessarily involves the sort of 'probing into an individual's private life' \" that is indicative of a search, even if the physical intrusion is only \"minimal.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Reasonableness of the Seizure and Search\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   With the Court having concluded that a warrantless seizure and search occurred here, the burden is on the government to demonstrate that its conduct was reasonable for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. The critical issue, of course, is the legality of the search, as it was the search that led directly to the officers' discovery of the gun. The constitutionality of the seizure is not irrelevant to the analysis, however. Under the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine mentioned above, evidence obtained following an illegal seizure generally must be excluded unless the government shows (1) that the evidence would have been discovered inevitably, (2) that the evidence was discovered from a separate, independent source, or (3) that the discovery of the evidence was so attenuated from the illegal seizure that the taint of the unlawful police conduct was dissipated.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strieff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597903\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2056/#p2061\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2061 ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cir. 2007). There is no basis for concluding that any of these three exceptions apply in this case, and the government makes no such argument. Thus, for purposes of Johnson's motion to suppress, the government must establish that\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the initial seizure and the subsequent search were constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    1.

According to Officer Ahmed's testimony-which the Court credits-the officers arrived on the scene of a suspected drive-by shooting to find Johnson lying in the street. Hearing Tr. at 18. And after Johnson got to his feet, the officers observed him holding his left arm in a manner suggesting that he may have been shot. Hearing Tr. at 20. Under these circumstances, it was reasonable for the officers to approach Johnson and briefly question him to ensure that he was not injured, even if Johnson himself did not want to talk. It likely would have been irresponsible, actually, for the officers to ignore the situation, as they had an obligation to protect the safety of members of the community.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Given the evidence presented, the Court is unable to conclude that it was reasonable for the officers to start grabbing Johnson's clothing and moving his arm within seconds. Everything the officers had learned during the initial stop had indicated that Johnson was not shot: Johnson had said that he was not shot, and there were no signs of a gunshot wound anywhere on the outside of his clothing. In other words, based on the brief seizure, the officers' concern for Johnson's safety should have begun to diminish-not dissipate entirely, but diminish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Also, assuming Johnson had been shot or that he was injured in some other way, it is the government's burden to show that moving Johnson's arm was a reasonable exercise of the officers' community caretaking responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4227422\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/142/49/#p56\">\n    142 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   56 (citing\n   <em>\n    Jeffers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"640927\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/342/48/#p51\">\n    342 U.S. at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"640927\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/342/48/#p51\">\n    72 S.Ct. 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). But in opposing Johnson's motion, the government did not even have the officer who initiated the search-Officer Sfoglia-testify. And when Officer Ahmed-the officer who did testify-was asked why Officer Sfoglia had pulled on Johnson's arm, he answered that he was \"not sure.\" Hearing Tr. at 25-26. Without more, the Court is left hypothesizing as to what medical purpose this search served. That shows that the government has not met its burden. On this record, the Court thinks that it would have been reasonable for the officers to ask further questions to ensure that Johnson was uninjured. But the Court is unable to see how, as an exercise of the officers' community caretaking functions, it was reasonable to ratchet things up and move Johnson's arm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In fact, the Court is aware of no case that supports such a broad conception of the community caretaking exception. Even the courts that have applied the exception more liberally have stressed that it is not a blank check. Rather, it requires\n   courts to \"balance the governmental interest in the police officer's exercise of his or her 'community caretaking function' and the individual's interest in being free from arbitrary government interference.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

At the risk of stating the obvious, here, Johnson was not unconscious, so the risk that the officers were addressing was not nearly as serious as that at issue in\n   <em>\n    Vauss.\n   </em>\n   And as the Court has already said, everything the officers initially learned from Johnson should have led them to become\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   concerned about his wellbeing, whereas in\n   <em>\n    Vauss\n   </em>\n   , the officers surely would have become more concerned after they were unable to awaken the defendant. Thus, it was reasonable in\n   <em>\n    Vauss\n   </em>\n   for the officers to ramp up the\n   encounter and perform a limited search. Here, it was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The government also relies on the Eight Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , but that case involved an unconscious person as well. The individual at issue there was found asleep in the middle of the day at a bus station with a gun \"sliding\" out of his pants pocket.\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179526\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/1013/#p1017\">\n    747 F.3d at 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Without even conducting a search, then, the police officers had reason to be \"[c]oncerned that the man might wake up and attempt to use the handgun or that the handgun could fall out of the man's pants pocket and accidentally discharge.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179526\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/1013/#p1017\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The officers therefore removed the gun from the man's pocket before waking him up.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179526\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/1013/#p1017\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This response was reasonable, the Eight Circuit held, \"[i]n light of the risks [the] exposed and unguarded firearm posed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179526\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/1013/#p1017\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4179526\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/1013/#p1017\">\n    at 1018-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, of course, Johnson did not pose the same kind of risk to himself or degree of danger to others: he was neither unconscious nor mishandling a firearm in plain view. And yet, Officer Sfoglia and Officer Ahmed undertook a more invasive search than the officers in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   performed. Thus, if anything,\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   actually supports Johnson's position here.

Gov't Resp. at 12;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hearing Tr. at 67. Beginning with the first fact, that all of this occurred in a high crime neighborhood is undoubtedly relevant, but \"an individual's presence in such an area, 'standing alone, is not [even] enough to support reasonable, particularized suspicion that the person is committing a crime' \"-which is obviously a less demanding standard than showing that the person is armed and dangerous.\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530096,3702034\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/1161/\">\n    334 F.3d at 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Illinois v.

Indeed, \"[e]ven in high crime areas, where the possibility that any given individual is armed is significant,\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   requires reasonable, individualized suspicion before a frisk for weapons can be conducted.\"\n   <em>\n    Maryland v.

As for the government's argument that a suspected shooting had just taken place in the area, its probative value is limited under the facts of this case too. By all indications, the recent shooting had been a drive-by. The officers therefore had no reason to believe that Johnson himself was the shooter-that person had likely already fled the scene. Thus, while it is no doubt relevant that this was a high-crime neighborhood where a suspected crime had recently taken place, the government needs more to justify the officers' search. It needs facts that are particularized to Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To that end, the government contends that Johnson initially tried to flee when the officers arrived. But the Court finds that argument unsupported by the evidence. Although the beginning of the body camera footage shows Johnson walking away, he was not moving very fast, and he promptly turned around to acknowledge the officers after the flashlight was shone on him. In his testimony, Officer Ahmed did not characterize this as an attempt to flee, and the Court would not characterize it as an attempt to flee either. Without more, the Court is left with this: \"Merely walking away, even quickly ... upon the arrival of [a] uniformed police officer\" does not \"provide articulable suspicion of criminal wrongdoing.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It moves the needle even less in a case like this, where the government's burden is to show reasonable suspicion that Johnson was armed and dangerous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The positioning of Johnson's arm is admittedly a more challenging subject. It was certainly awkward-looking, and with the benefit of hindsight, one can see how it may have had the effect of concealing Johnson's inside pocket.

The question is whether, based on the information available at the time, an objectively reasonable officer would have found Johnson's\n   arm positioning indicative of concealment. And, again, it is the government's burden to make that showing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325148,12310423\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/625/\">\n    825 F.3d at 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, the Court is presented with little to no evidence that a reasonable officer would have, based on training and expertise, viewed this position as suggestive of someone concealing a weapon. Instead, all indications are that a reasonable officer would have thought Johnson was injured. Officer Ahmed, in fact, repeatedly testified that he and Officer Sfoglia did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   interpret the position of Johnson's arm to be indicative of concealment.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Hearing Tr. at 21, 23, 27.

As the Court has said, the officers' subjective motives are not dispositive, but in this case, Officer Ahmed's testimony is essentially the only evidence the Court has of what an objectively reasonable police officer would have thought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   That Johnson's arm position had an apparent, wholly innocent explanation distinguishes this case from others where reasonable suspicion was present based on possible concealment.

Here, by contrast, there was a highly plausible innocent explanation for the only particularized fact on which the government is able to rely. Thus, although the positioning of Johnson's arm certainly has some relevance, it was not sufficient, under the totality of these circumstances, to create reasonable suspicion to believe that Johnson was armed and dangerous. The officers therefore were not justified in searching Johnson under\n   <em>\n    Terry.\n   </em>\n   The search was a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Application of the Exclusionary Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Having concluded that a Fourth Amendment violation occurred here, the Court's only remaining task is to determine what evidence is subject to the exclusionary rule. As the Court said earlier, the rule applies to both the primary evidence obtained directly from the illegal search and the evidence subsequently obtained that is \"derivative of [the] illegality.\"\n   <em>\n    Strieff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597903\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2056/#p2061\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Segura\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340278\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/796/#p804\">\n    468 U.S. at 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340278\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/796/#p804\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In this case, the government makes no argument against application of the exclusionary\n   rule, and that is for good reason. The gun undeniably constitutes primary evidence obtained as a direct result of the unconstitutional search. It therefore must be suppressed. Meanwhile, the government's remaining evidence-the pill bottle, drug evidence, and cash-is derivative of the illegality. If not for the improperly obtained gun, the officers would not have had probable cause to arrest Johnson, which means that they would not have had the legal justification to perform the second search that resulted in the unearthing of the other evidence. In other words, the illegal first search was the \"but-for cause of the discovery\" of the remaining evidence.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cir. 2011). But, here, the only fact from which the Court could possibly infer Johnson's consent to a search would be that he did not vocally resist the search.

The Court imposes no such requirement. Here, for example, it is possible that the officers may have been able to accomplish their community caretaking duties without seizing Johnson at all. They could have at least attempted, for instance, to get Johnson's attention and speak to him without demonstrating a \"show of authority.\" But the Court does not require that the government establish that a seizure was\n    <em>\n     necessary\n    </em>\n    here.

Instead,\n    <em>\n     Garner\n    </em>\n    involved the prolonged seizure of an intoxicated man who had been found lying down in a field.
