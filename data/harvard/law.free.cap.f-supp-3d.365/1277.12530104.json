Seen in light of the record evidence on the whole, the Department's finding appears to describe the use of the flange only after the flange has become a component in the downstream product resulting from post-importation processing, i.e., a pipe to which a fabricator has added one or more flanges. That product, however, is not the subject of the Scope Ruling Request and is not within the scope of the Order (which applies only to pipe fittings, not pipes or assemblies containing pipes).

Because ductile flanged fittings are excluded from the scope of the domestic like product (which the ITC defined as identical to the scope of the investigation), it cannot be concluded that the ITC reached an affirmative injury or threat determination as to them. This aspect of the ITC's investigation strongly cautions against an interpretation of the scope language to include ductile flanged fittings, of any specification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atkore Steel Components, Inc. v.

That question is how, if ductile iron flanged\n   <em>\n    fittings\n   </em>\n   were excluded from the scope of the antidumping duty investigation, ductile iron\n   <em>\n    flanges\n   </em>\n   nevertheless were intended to be treated as subject merchandise during that investigation. Commerce reached the conclusion that ductile iron flanges are within the scope even though the ITC Report makes no mention of ductile iron flanges (or non-malleable iron flanges, for that matter) and even though the ITC Report presents a detailed discussion of the various types of merchandise that are within the scope (and, therefore, within the domestic like product, which the ITC made equivalent to, and not broader than, the scope of the investigation).\n   <em>\n    See ITC Report\n   </em>\n   I-1 to I-9. The absence of any mention of ductile iron flanges, as opposed to ductile flanged fittings, in the ITC Report (and, according to plaintiff, in the petition) casts doubt on the premise that ductile iron flanges were contemplated as part of either the scope of the investigation or the scope of the domestic like product. The Final Scope Ruling does not analyze the issue of the physical and functional differences between ductile iron flanges and the examples of \"subject fittings\" listed in the scope language.\n   <em>\n    See Order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016%2C765\">\n    68 Fed.

The inclusion of certain \"unfinished\" articles in the scope does not support the placement of Star Pipe's flanges within the scope. Here, the record evidence is that the flange is imported in a finished form ready for attachment to a pipe by a pipe fabricator, with a threaded hub and other physical characteristics meeting AWWA C115.\n    <em>\n     See Scope Ruling Request\n    </em>\n    Ex. 3, Sec. 4.3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    One of the prior scope rulings on which Commerce relied in placing Star Pipe's flanges within the scope of the Order is\n    <em>\n     Final Scope Ruling on the Black Cast Iron Flange, Green Ductile Flange, and the Twin Tee\n    </em>\n    (Sept. 19, 2008) (\"\n    <em>\n     Taco Ruling\n    </em>\n    \"),\n    <em>\n     appended to Final Scope Ruling\n    </em>\n    as Attachment 4.\n    <em>\n     Final Scope Ruling\n    </em>\n    10. In that ruling, Commerce found that the black and green flanges at issue in that proceeding were \"flanged fittings\"; Commerce reached this finding \"because they are fittings that are cast with an integral rim, or flange, at the end of the fitting.\"\n    <em>\n     Taco Ruling\n    </em>\n    9;\n    <em>\n     cf. Final Scope Ruling\n    </em>\n    11 (noting that the ITC's statement demonstrates that flanges are different from flanged fittings). Commerce also relied upon\n    <em>\n     Final Scope Ruling on the Antidumping Duty Order on Finished and Unfinished Non-Malleable Cast Iron Pipe Fittings from the People's Republic of China: Request by Napac for Flanged Fittings\n    </em>\n    (Sept. 19, 2016) (\"\n    <em>\n     Napac Ruling\n    </em>\n    \"),\n    <em>\n     appended to Final Scope Ruling\n    </em>\n    as Attachment 2, for the proposition that Star Pipe's flanges have the same physical characteristics as the products at issue in that ruling.\n    <em>\n     Final Scope Ruling\n    </em>\n    12. Some of the articles at issue in the Napac Ruling were described as gray iron flanged fittings,\n    <em>\n     Napac Ruling\n    </em>\n    3, and the court is unable to conclude from the descriptions therein that the remaining articles were identical to Star Pipe's flanges.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
