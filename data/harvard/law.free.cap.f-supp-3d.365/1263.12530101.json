ALTONAGA, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS CAUSE\n   </strong>\n   came before the Court on a review of Defendants' Motion to Compel Arbitration and Stay Proceedings [ECF No. 18 ], filed June 8, 2018. The relief Defendants seek is evident from the title of their Motion. In their Response [ECF No. 34 ], Plaintiffs insist they are entitled to bring this case seeking damages under the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"), 29 U.S.C. section 201, because: (1) the \"Arbitration Agreements\" Defendants submitted to the Court contain signatures that are not Plaintiffs'; (2) Plaintiffs never agreed to any arbitration agreements whether verbally or in writing; and (3) the signatures on the Arbitration Agreements are forgeries, consistent with Defendants' practice of forging at least one Plaintiff's signatures in a number of documents and of fabricating weekly payroll reports. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Resp.). Plaintiffs submit their Affidavits [ECF Nos. 34-1 and 34-2] to their denials and serious accusations leveled at Defendants, as well as supporting exhibits. Defendants have not filed a reply memorandum addressing Plaintiffs' arguments in opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \"The threshold question of whether an arbitration agreement exists at all is 'simply a matter of contract.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    Bazemore v.
