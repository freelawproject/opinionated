Further, Commerce rejected petitioner's claim that the Indian GTA data was not a broad market average because it contained data points from only three countries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. Commerce did not find the amount of imports insignificant and noted that one would expect the Indian dataset to contain a lesser quantity than the Bangladeshi dataset as the latter contained both warmwater and coldwater shrimp.\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 20.

Accordingly, Commerce's selection of the Indian GTA import data for HTS 0306.17 to value the frozen shrimp input is reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Commerce's Denial of an Offset for Packaging Scrap\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On remand, Commerce continued to deny an offset for packaging scrap and further explained its practice for evaluating byproduct offset claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 10-13. Respondents contend that the agency did not adhere to the court's remand order to further explain the reasonableness of its practice and merely reasserted its position from the final determination, and that the remand redetermination is not supported by substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Respondents' Remand Comments at 1-4. For the following reasons, Commerce sufficiently explained its practice and its decision to deny an offset is sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Pursuant to the relevant statute, in a non-market economy Commerce will calculate the normal value of a given product by valuing \"the factors of production utilized in producing the good[.]\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(1)(A)-(B). The statute, however, does not direct how Commerce is to determine which products qualify for the byproduct offset and no regulation exists to fill the gap. In such a situation, Commerce has the discretion to set the standards by which items qualify for a byproduct offset, so long as Commerce's selection satisfies the overall purpose of the ADD statute, to calculate accurate dumping margins and is reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rhone Poulenc, Inc. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536793\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/899/1185/#p1191\">\n    899 F.2d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1191 (Fed.

Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The agency explains that because the statute is silent on how byproducts should be treated when calculating normal value, it adopted a practice pursuant to which only the sales income of materials consumed during the production process will qualify for a byproduct offset.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 9-10; Final Decision Memo at 67-68. On remand, the agency provides further explanation of its practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   at 10-13, 22-24. Specifically, it explains that, consistent with generally acceptable accounting practices, revenue generated from activities unrelated to production is recorded as miscellaneous income that generally offsets selling, general and administrative costs, as opposed to costs of goods sold.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11. Indeed, Commerce notes that Stapimex records packaging sales revenue in a trade receivables account associated with miscellaneous income and not in the main sales revenue account for shrimp sales/production activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. Accordingly, although Commerce agrees that revenue from sales of scrap should be offset,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, Commerce determined it would be improper for that revenue to offset the cost of manufacturing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12. Rather,\n   Commerce presumes that the proper offsets are captured in the surrogate financial statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Respondents do not point to any record evidence detracting from the reasonableness of Commerce's presumption. On remand, Commerce complied with the court's order in\n   <em>\n    Soc Trang\n   </em>\n   and its explanation is in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the\n   <em>\n    Remand Results\n   </em>\n   comply with the court's order in\n   <em>\n    Soc Trang\n   </em>\n   , are in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence, and are sustained.
