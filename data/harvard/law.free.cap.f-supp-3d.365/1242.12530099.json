Turtle is a member of the Seminole Tribe of Florida who resides on the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation. (Doc. 1). The Government alleges that Turtle sold 3,996 eggs collected on the Reservation between June 19, 2015, and July 30, 2016, for $ 19,980. (Doc. 43). Turtle now moves to dismiss the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Fed. R. Crim. P. 12 allows a defendant to challenge an indictment as defective for failure to state an offense. Fed. R.

The Court thus assumes the allegations in the Information are true and will determine whether they implicate Turtle for the charged crimes as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Information charging Turtle tracks the language of the ESA and the Lacey Act.

He instead focuses on the authority of the U.S. and Florida governments to impose their laws on members of the Seminole Tribe. Turtle argues the Tribe has traditional sovereign hunting and fishing rights never relinquished by treaty, and any statutes restricting those rights are void and unenforceable. (Doc. 38). The Government concedes that the Tribe has implicit usufructuary rights but questions whether those rights include the right to sell wildlife. If they do, the Government argues that the Tribe still must comply with the ESA based on two alternative theories: that Congress abrogated Turtle's right to collect alligator eggs when it passed the ESA and the Lacey Act, and that, if not, the ESA and Lacey Act are still enforceable against the Tribe as reasonable and necessary conservation measures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

At the hearing on the Motion, Turtle's Counsel repeatedly argued that the U.S. Government's only legitimate method of regulating Indian tribes is through treaties. But in fact, Congress abandoned the practice of signing treaties with Indian tribes in 1871.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2071\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"No Indian nation or tribe within the territory of the United States shall be acknowledged or recognized as an independent nation, tribe, or power with whom the United States may contract by treaty[.]\").

Turtle asserts that the Seminoles retain their traditional hunting, gathering, and fishing rights, but his Memorandum of Law is silent on a traditional right to sell wildlife. (Doc. 38). For its part, the Government concedes that the Tribe has implicit hunting and fishing rights, but not the right to sell wildlife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Government cites several cases that address whether tribes' treaty-guaranteed usufructuary rights included the right to sell parts of the animals they hunted. Those cases hinged on whether the tribes traditionally engaged in the sale of wildlife parts. For example, both the Eighth and Ninth Circuits have held that tribal members did not have treaty rights to sell eagle feathers because their tribes historically deplored the sale of eagle parts and thus would not have understood the treaties to reserve such a right.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The legislative history of these bills does not shed much light on Congress' intent on Indian treaty rights, so the\n   <em>\n    Billie\n   </em>\n   court turned to hearings on predecessor bills considered by the 92nd Congress, where abrogation was discussed.\n   <em>\n    Billie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5739200\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/667/1485/\">\n    667 F.Supp. at 1490-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But this evidence, even assuming it is probative to the intent of the 93rd Congress, is equivocal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For example, in a hearing on House Bill 13081, an Interior Department official advised that American Indians \"enjoy treaty-secured hunting and fishing rights\" and that if Congress wished to extinguish those rights, it must do so expressly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Predatory Mammals and Endangered Species: Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Fisheries and Wildlife Conservation of the Comm. on Merchant Marine and Fisheries,\n   </em>\n   92d Cong., 2d Sess. 144 (1972). The official explained that Congress could preserve tribal rights by remaining silent on the issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5739200\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/667/1485/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Interior Official's comments also demonstrate why the ESA's inclusion of an express exception for Alaskan natives is not necessarily evidence that Congress intended to abrogate the rights of other indigenous people. He stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Although American Indians enjoy treaty-secured hunting and fishing rights over areas in which endangered species are found, no such rights are recognized for Aleuts and Eskimos. Moreover, section 3 of the Alaska Native Claims Act extinguished any claims they may have asserted to immunity from Federal hunting and fishing laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Fed.%20Reg.%2021%2C059\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Congress ultimately included in the ESA a limited exception for takings by \"any Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo who is an Alaskan Native who resides in Alaska\" and residents \"of an Alaskan native village.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201539\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Perhaps Congress limited this exception to Alaskan natives in recognition of their unique reliance on endangered species for cultural and subsistence purposes. Or perhaps Congress believed Alaskan natives had a unique need for an exception because they lacked the treaty rights enjoyed by Indians in other states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   All in all, interpreting the ESA liberally in favor of the Seminoles, the Court does not find clear and convincing evidence that Congress chose to abrogate the Tribe's usufructuary rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The Government argues the\n   <em>\n    Puyallup\n   </em>\n   test, which the Supreme Court devised for state statutes, should also apply to federal laws. The Court agrees. In fact, because Congress has plenary power over Indian tribes, the scrutiny applied to its policy decisions need not be as rigorous as in\n   <em>\n    Puyallup\n   </em>\n   . Here, the Government has sufficiently shown that regulating the selling of American alligator eggs is for reasonable and necessary conservation and does not discriminate against the Seminole Tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In 1980, the Office of the Solicitor for the Department of the Interior issued an\n   opinion to address whether the ESA \"applies to Native Americans in their exercise of any hunting or fishing rights pursuant to a treaty with the United States or pursuant to a statutory or aboriginal right, or an executive order.\" Dep't of the Interior, Office of the Solicitor, Opinion Letter on Application of the Endangered Species Act to Native Americans with Treaty Hunting and Fishing Rights,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20Interior%20Dec.%20525\">\n    87 Interior Dec. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 525-526 (Nov. 4, 1980).The upshot of the opinion is that the ESA is enforceable against Indians because it is not incompatible with Indian treaty rights. The Interior Solicitor relied mainly on the Supreme Court's three Puyallup decisions \"concerning a chronic dispute between a number of tribes and the State of Washington over treaty hunting and fishing rights.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20Interior%20Dec.%20525\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20Interior%20Dec.%20525\">\n    at 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
