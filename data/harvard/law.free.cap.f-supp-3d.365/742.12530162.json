Some background is necessary to explain the motion currently before the court. On September 7, 2018, the plaintiff Med-Cert Home Care, L.L.C. (\"Med-Cert\") filed its complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint (docket entry 1). Three days later, on September 10, Med-Cert filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order, in which Med-Cert sought to enjoin the defendants Alex M. Azar, II, Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and Seema Verma, Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"), from withholding reimbursement of Med-Cert's Medicare claims. Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order at 1-3 (docket entry 6). The court held a hearing on Med-Cert's motion for temporary restraining order on September 19, 2018. Order Regarding Emergency Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (docket entry 9); Electronic Minute Entry for Motion Hearing (docket entry 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the same date, the court issued two orders. First, the court issued an order denying Med-Cert's motion for a temporary restraining order. Order Denying Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (docket entry 15). Second, the court issued an order setting a briefing schedule on plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. Order (docket entry 13). Both parties have submitted their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law; Med-Cert's motion for preliminary injunction is thus ripe for decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Proposed\n   Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law (\"Findings\") (docket entry 18); Response (docket entry 19); Reply (docket entry 25).

Exhibit J of Plaintiff's Additional Attachments at 1-48 (docket entry 4). As part of its review, the QIC evaluated Med-Cert's extensive case file, including the patient clinical files, Med-Cert's expert report, a nurse summary from Med-Cert's Administrator and Director of Nursing, documentation from both the MAC and ZPIC, and extrapolations/statistical sampling documentation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.904\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.904\">\n    at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its letter notifying Med-Cert of the decision, the QIC informed Med-Cert that it had the right to appeal the determination to an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.904\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.904\">\n    at 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to the plaintiff's filings, the plaintiff relied on Medicare reimbursements for approximately 94% of its revenue stream.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Furthermore, after recoupment of the plaintiff's alleged overpayments began, the plaintiff had to lay off 89% of its staff and terminate the healthcare services for a majority of its patients in order to subsist off a small fraction of its usual revenue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3, *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   After laying out these facts, Judge Kinkeade observed that while \"[a] healthcare agency may be able to float its expenses and survive for the statutorily imposed 90-day period for an ALJ to hear and decide\n   the appeal even while its alleged overpayments are in recoupment.... it is unreasonable to expect a healthcare agency to scrape by for three to five years waiting for a hearing and decision while CMS recoups the alleged overpayments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. Moreover, Judge Kinkeade determined that \"[w]hile the statute allows CMS to begin recouping the alleged overpayments before the ALJ renders a decision, Congress likely did not anticipate that decision being delayed much longer than the statutorily prescribed 90 days and certainly not a delay of three to five years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, based on these facts, Judge Kinkeade found that allowing recoupment to continue during the pendency of the plaintiff's ALJ hearing \"effectively forces [the plaintiff] to close its business without providing the statutorily mandated procedural due process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Consequently, Judge Kinkeade concluded, \"forcing [the plaintiff] to wait three to five years for a hearing while overpayments are in recoupment creates a high risk of erroneous deprivation of [the plaintiff's] property interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, Med-Cert's filings demonstrate that Med-Cert is a home health provider which obtains the vast majority of its revenue from \"services provided to Medicare beneficiaries and paid for by the federal Medicare program.\" Affidavit of Mathew John at 2 \u00b6 4. The same filings show that since CMS began recoupment: (1) Med-Cert's gross revenue has decreased by over 60%; (2) its net revenue has decreased by 95%; (3) it has had to reduce its staff by approximately 89% (from 18 to 2); and (4) that ultimately-if recoupment is to continue during the pendency of Med-Cert's ALJ appeal-Med-Cert will be forced to shut down.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. Consequently, this court concludes, similarly to Judge Kinkeade in\n   <em>\n    Family Rehabilitation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , that forcing Med-Cert to wait two to four years for a hearing before an ALJ while CMS recoups Med-Cert's Medicare payments creates a high risk of erroneous deprivation of Med-Cert's property interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The defendants argue that \"Med-Cert faces a low risk of erroneous deprivation of [its] property interest, as it can escalate its appeal and receive the protections of Article III review.\" Response at 20. The court must therefore determine whether escalation provides Med-Cert sufficient procedural due process for the defendants to begin recoupment of Med-Cert's alleged overpayments before an ALJ decides Med-Cert's\n   appeal. Accordingly, a review of the appeals process is necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As noted by the Fifth Circuit, to appeal an overpayment determination a provider must go through a four-level appeals process:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   First, it may submit to the MAC [Medicare Administrative Contractor] a claim for redetermination of the overpayment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(a)(3)(A).

United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173878\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/80/#p89\">\n    425 U.S. 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 89-90,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173878\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/80/#p89\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173878\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/80/#p89\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976) (\"Skillful cross-examination could develop a record....). Accordingly, the court cannot agree with the defendants' claim that an ALJ hearing offers no additional protection because a hearing will not result in a substantial change in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Nor can the court agree with the defendants' contention that escalation of Med-Cert's appeal to a district court will provide Med-Cert with sufficient procedural due process to mitigate the risk of erroneous deprivation of Med-Cert's property. First, even if Med-Cert escalates its claim from the ALJ level to the Council, there is no guarantee that Med-Cert will be able to escalate its appeal to a district court. For Med-Cert to escalate its appeal to a district court, it must be the case that the Council has not completed its review of the ALJ's or QIC's decision within the applicable adjudication period.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1136\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Second, the standard of review exercised by a district court on appeal would be different than that of an ALJ. The ALJ must exercise\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1000\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1000\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). In contrast, a district court's review of a QIC's decision is more deferential. See\n   <em>\n    Superior Home Health Services, LLC v. Azar\n   </em>\n   , No. 5:15-CV-000636-RCL,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203717121\">\n    2018 WL 3717121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (W.D.

For these reasons, the court does not believe that escalation of Med-Cert's appeal to a district court would provide Med-Cert with sufficient procedural due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Since the court has concluded that Med-Cert has a property interest, and that there is a high risk of erroneous deprivation of this interest, the court must now consider the third\n   <em>\n    Eldridge\n   </em>\n   factor. Here, the court finds that the defendants' interest in recouping Med-Cert's alleged overpayments will not be adversely affected by delaying the recoupment until after the ALJ's determination because the defendants will still be able to recoup the overpayment amount if the ALJ determination is in their favor. The defendants argue that if recoupment is delayed until after the ALJ's determination, it is likely that Med-Cert will declare bankruptcy and not pay the alleged overpayments. Response at 11. As Med-Cert pointed out at the hearing on its motion for temporary restraining order, Medicare recoupments are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.

Even further, as Judge Kinkeade stated in\n   <em>\n    Family Rehabilitation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the defendants' argument \"makes a number of assumptions and does not outweigh [the plaintiff's] ongoing deprivation of its property interest without sufficient procedural due process.\"\n   <em>\n    Family Rehabilitation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203155911\">\n    2018 WL 3155911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Because the court has found that Med-Cert satisfies all three of the\n   <em>\n    Eldridge\n   </em>\n   factors, it concludes that Med-Cert has established a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its procedural due process claim.

Plaintiff's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 9 \u00b6 23. Specifically, Med-Cert maintains that to keep its Medicare Provider Number it must continue patient services for at least one patient during the pendency of its appeal, which it cannot do.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205264244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Med-Cert further avers that losing its Medicare Provider Number constitutes irreparable injury because the regional Medicare office in Dallas has issued a freeze on issuing new CMS provider numbers for home health agencies in Texas, meaning that if Med-Cert loses its number it will not be able to obtain a new one.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205264244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 9 \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The defendants make multiple arguments as to why Med-Cert will not be irreparably injured if recoupment continues during the pendency of Med-Cert's appeal. First, the defendants allege that Med-Cert has failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that it will shut down if recoupment continues while Med-Cert's ALJ appeal is pending. Response at 19. As\n   discussed above, the court disagrees.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   n. 4. Med-Cert's claims are supported by the affidavit of Med-Cert's Chief Financial Officer, Mathew John, and are sufficient to support Med-Cert's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, the defendants maintain that Med-Cert faces no risk of irreparable injury because if Med-Cert escalated its appeal it could have either resolved the appeal before the Medicare Appeals Council, or could be in federal district court litigating the overpayment determination. Response at 22. Escalation does not establish that Med-Cert has no substantial threat of irreparably injury, however. See\n   <em>\n    Family Rehabilitation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203155911\">\n    2018 WL 3155911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (\"Neither of these options, however, establishes that [the plaintiff] has no substantial threat of irreparable injury.\"). As discussed above, escalation deprives Med-Cert of an evidentiary hearing and offers inadequate procedural due process. Moreover, as Judge Kinkeade noted in\n   <em>\n    Family Rehabilitation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , \"[u]nder [the] [d]efendants' theory, what is an alternative appeals process under the statute would instead become a mandatory appeals process, which was not the intended purpose of escalation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203155911\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ff(d)(3)(A) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Third, the defendants argue that Med-Cert is not at risk of losing its Medicare Provider Number. Response at 21-22. Specifically, the defendants maintain that to keep its Medicare Provider Number Med-Cert only needs to provide services to one Medicare beneficiary every twelve months pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20424.540\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20424.540\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The defendants claim that Med-Cert can provide services to at least one beneficiary before this court decides Med-Cert's due process claim, thus ensuring that Med-Cert will not lose its Medicare Provider Number. Moreover, the defendants allege that even if Med-Cert loses its Medicare Provider Number, it will be unaffected by the freeze on new Medicare Provider Numbers because Med-Cert will only need to reactivate their existing provider number, rather than obtain a new number. Response at 22; Appendix to Defendants' Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, Declaration of Alisha Sanders at 2 \u00b6\u00b6 4-6 (docket entry 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This court disagrees. If Med-Cert wishes to keep its Medicare Provider Number, it must continue providing patient services to at least one Medicare beneficiary every twelve months.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20424.540\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). This means that to keep its Medicare Provider Number, Med-Cert will have to pay staff to care for Medicare patients without receiving reimbursement payments from CMS, which Med-Cert cannot do. Reply at 13; Affidavit of Mathew John at 2. Moreover, the freeze on new Medicare Provider Numbers will likely affect Med-Cert, because Med-Cert will not simply be able to reactive their existing provider number as the defendants argue. If Med-Cert loses its Medicare Provider Number and later seeks to reactivate its Medicare billing privileges, Med-Cert must maintain a valid Texas license.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20424.540\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(I). \"For each license period, an agency must provide services to at least one client to be eligible to renew its license.\" 40 TEX. ADMINISTRATIVE CODE \u00a7 97.17(c). Therefore, for Med-Cert to keep its license so that it may reactivate its Medicare Provider Number later, Med-Cert will have to pay staff to care for patients without receiving reimbursement from CMS, which it cannot do. Reply at 13. Consequently, if recoupment continues during the pendency of Med-Cert's ALJ appeal, Med-Cert will be unable to pay staff to provide services for Medicare beneficiaries, thereby jeopardizing Med-Cert's business, its Texas license, and ultimately its Medicare Provider Number.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Fourth, the defendants aver that Med-Cert will not be irreparably injured if recoupment\n   continues because Med-Cert can continue to provide services to Medicare beneficiaries and non-Medicare beneficiaries alike. Response at 22. Again, the court disagrees. Med-Cert's primary income is from Medicare reimbursements, Plaintiff's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 9 \u00b6 24, meaning if the reimbursements are withheld as recoupment, Med-Cert will be unable to afford to pay employees or provide services to Medicare beneficiaries and non-Medicare beneficiaries alike. The defendants further maintain that because Med-Cert chose to structure its business around Medicare beneficiaries, Med-Cert knew it was subject to post-payment audits and the possibility of recoupment and thus cannot complain when an overpayment determination is made and recoupment begins. Response at 22-23. Although Med-Cert knew that recoupment was a possibility, Med-Cert did not know that a future appeal before an ALJ would take years, or that while waiting for a decision on its appeal Med-Cert would have to close its doors due to recoupment. The court finds that the defendants' argument fails to establish that Med-Cert has no substantial threat of irreparable injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For the reasons stated above, this court finds that Med-Cert has sufficiently established a substantial threat of immediate and irreparable harm for which no adequate remedy at law exists. Consequently, the court finds that the second preliminary injunction factor weighs in favor of granting injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Threatened Injury to Med-Cert Outweighs the Threatened Harm to the Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In addition to showing a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of its claim as well as a substantial threat of irreparable injury, to obtain a preliminary injunction Med-Cert \"must show that the injury [it] will suffer if the court denies injunctive relief is greater than the injury the defendants will suffer if the relief is granted.\"\n   <em>\n    Bennigan's Franchising Co., L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20603370\">\n    2007 WL 603370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   If the preliminary injunction is not granted, Med-Cert will have to shut its doors, its remaining employees will lose their jobs, and Med-Cert's remaining patients will lose access to a unique home healthcare provider that provides services in the patient's specific southeast Asian language or dialect. The defendants allege that granting the preliminary injunction will cause them greater harm, since an injunction would disrupt the required administration of the Medicare program and a delay would increase the odds that they will be unable to recoup Med-Cert's overpayment. Response at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The court disagrees with the defendants and concludes that they will not be prejudiced by a delay. While an injunction will delay the government's ability to recoup any overpayments, the government will nevertheless be able to recoup the overpayment amount if the ALJ rules in its favor, especially since, as discussed above, recoupment is not easily dischargeable in bankruptcy. See\n   <em>\n    Family Rehabilitation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203155911\">\n    2018 WL 3155911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *7 (\"Whereas, [the] [d]efendants will not suffer harm from granting the injunctive relief because they will have the opportunity to later recoup any overpayments if the ALJ reaches a decision in their favor\");\n   <em>\n    Adams Ems, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205264244\">\n    2018 WL 5264244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *11 (\"The government is not prejudiced by the delay\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the reasons provided above, the court finds that the potential injury to the plaintiffs if the injunction is denied outweighs the injury to the defendants if the injunction is granted. The third preliminary injunction factor therefore weighs in favor of granting injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    The Public Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Finally, Med-Cert must show that granting the preliminary injunction will not disserve the public interest. Med-Cert argues that the public interest would not be adversely affected by granting the preliminary injunction because the public, and specifically southeast Asian refugees, would benefit from continued access to Med-Cert's services. Plaintiff's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 6 \u00b6 14. The defendants allege that granting the injunction would disserve the public interest by overriding Congress' statutory scheme allowing recoupment to begin after the QIC has rendered a decision and by clashing with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia's mandamus order to eliminate the ALJ backlog by the end of fiscal year 2022. Response at 13 \u00b6 14. The defendants further allege that granting the injunction would not serve the public interest because there are hundreds of other active home health agencies that could serve the public in the absence of Med-Cert's services.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205264244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   After reviewing both parties' arguments, the court concludes that granting injunctive relief here would not disserve the public interest. First, while Congress allowed recoupment to begin before the ALJ renders a decision, \"Congress likely did not anticipate that decision being delayed much longer than the statutorily prescribed 90 days and certainly not a delay of [two] to [four] years.\"\n   <em>\n    Family Rehabilitation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203155911\">\n    2018 WL 3155911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5. Consequently, the court does not find that granting injunctive relief would disserve the public interest by conflicting with Congress' statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Second, nothing indicates that granting injunctive relief here would be at odds with the\n   <em>\n    American Hospital Association\n   </em>\n   court's mandamus order. There, the court declined to include as part of its mandamus order the requirements that: (1) the government reduce the interest charged on funds that it has yet to recoup from providers while appeals are pending; (2) providers be allowed to rebill their claims for six months following the issuance of the mandamus order; and (3) the government maintain its current programs to fight the backlog.\n   <em>\n    American Hospital Association,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205723141\">\n    2018 WL 5723141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4. The court refused to include these additional requirements because they would \"not necessarily improve delays\" and because they were not directly related to the claim giving rise to the mandamus order.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205723141\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nothing in the district court's opinion signaled that granting injunctive relief in a related case would cause further delays, and the defendants have not proven that such a result would occur. Accordingly, this court concludes that granting injunctive relief would not adversely affect the public interest by clashing with the mandamus order issued in\n   <em>\n    American Hospital Association.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Third, although there are other active home health agencies in the Dallas area, this court concludes that the public interest would be better served if injunctive relief is granted and Med-Cert stays in business. Unlike most home health agencies, Med-Cert provides unique services to an aging population from South East Asia who have special needs because of language and cultural differences in addition to exposure to Agent Orange. Exhibit K of Plaintiff's Additional Attachments at 3-4. The defendants have not shown that the other active home health agencies in the Dallas area provide similar services to Med-Cert or employ nurses who speak the same South East Asian languages and dialects as Med-Cert's patients and employees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the court concludes that the fourth preliminary injunction factor favors granting injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Med-Cert's motion for preliminary injunction is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .

No such deficiency by Med-Cert was reported to CMS for any of the three evaluation surveys completed of Med-Cert by its accrediting organization.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205723141\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    In its original complaint, Med-Cert asserted four claims: (1) a procedural due process claim; (2) an ultra vires claim; (3) a claim brought under Section 704 of the Administrative Procedure Act; and (4) a claim for mandamus relief.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Complaint at 22-26. Med-Cert did not discuss the likelihood of success it would have before this court on each claim in its Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, however.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Plaintiff's Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. Rather, Med-Cert mentioned only two of its claims-the procedural due process claim and the ultra vires claim.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205723141\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 6 \u00b6 16.

Accordingly, the court finds that Med-Cert did not carry its burden of persuasion with respect to its ultra vires claim, its Administrative Procedure Act claim, and its claim for mandamus relief. Therefore, the court will neither discuss Med-Cert's likelihood of success on these claims nor consider them to be a basis for Med-Cert's motion for injunctive relief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    This court recognizes that the court in\n    <em>\n     Sahara Health Care, Inc.\n    </em>\n    viewed the fact that the plaintiff was being deprived of payments properly billed as the plaintiff \"returning monies to which it was never entitled.\"\n    <em>\n     Sahara Health Care, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , 349 F.Supp.3d at 578. This court does not take the same view. Although the government may recoup overpayments from a health provider's Medicare payments,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.371\">\n     42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.371\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a), because Med-Cert's appeal of the overpayment determination is not final, this court cannot definitely state that withholding Med-Cert's payments for properly billed claims is the same as Med-Cert returning money to which it was \"never entitled.\" Med-Cert may prevail on its appeal, thereby entitling Med-Cert to the funds recouped with interest. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ddd(f)(2)(B).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The defendants argue that Med-Cert's claim that it will be forced to shut down if recoupment continues during the pendency of its appeal is unsupported by \"concrete information to substantiate this allegation.\" Response at 19. The court disagrees. As pointed out in Med-Cert's reply, Med-Cert's assertion that it will be forced to shut down is supported by the affidavit of Med-Cert's Chief Financial Officer, Mathew John. Reply at 9 \u00b6 15. The sworn statements of a Chief Financial Officer, \"[t]he executive in charge of making a company's accounting and fiscal decisions[,]\" Black's Law Dictionary 270 (9th ed. 2009), are not tantamount to unsupported statements. Moreover \"[t]he law is well-settled that because the procedures governing a preliminary injunction are generally less formal than those at trial, the court may rely upon otherwise inadmissible evidence when considering a preliminary injunction.\"\n    <em>\n     ADT, LLC v.
