Schlafly created numerous \"educational, advocacy, and policy groups,\" each of which she branded with an \"Eagle\"-themed name. (Am. Compl., ECF No. 20, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 31.) Among those entities are plaintiffs Eagle Trust Fund (\"ETF\") and Eagle Forum Education &amp; Legal Defense Fund (\"EFE-LDF\"), as well as non-party Eagle Forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 6, 31.) Each of Schlafly's \"Eagle\" organizations traditionally received its mail through one central post-office box in Alton, Illinois; significantly, much of this mail was addressed to some variation of \"Phyllis Schlafly, Eagle Forum,\" without regard to the particular \"Eagle\" entity the correspondence actually concerned. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Postal Service Initial Decision (\"Initial Dec.\"), Ex. A to Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 17-1, at 4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This centralized landing spot for the various entities' correspondence changed in 2016, when the organization known as Eagle Forum veered from the flock under new leadership (due to a legal dispute), and submitted a \"change of address\" form to the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Plaintiffs ETF and EFE-LDF have now combined with John Schlafly-Phyllis Schlafly's son, who serves as a trustee or officer of ETF and EFE-LDF-to file the instant lawsuit against USPS. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.) Plaintiffs claim that ETF's and EFE-LDF's mail matter is being improperly diverted to Eagle Forum's new address, and they request reversal of an administrative ruling upholding USPS's decision to honor Eagle Forum's change-of-address request. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before this Court at present is USPS's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' first amended complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss (\"Defs.' Mot.\"), ECF No. 21.) Because Plaintiffs' complaint does not identify a cause of action and otherwise fails to state a claim for the purpose of Rule 12(b)(6), as explained below, USPS's motion will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Plaintiffs' action will be\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   without prejudice. A separate Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Basic Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Phyllis Schlafly began leasing P.O. Box 618 in Alton, Illinois in 1967, the same year that she created Eagle Trust Fund. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Initial Dec. at 4.) Most, if not all, of her Eagle-themed organizations received mail at that P.O. Box for almost fifty years, and as mentioned above, said correspondence was typically addressed to some variation of \"Phyllis Schlafly, Eagle Forum[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This centralization of the different organizations' mail matter was not inherently problematic because \"[a]ll of Mrs. Schlafly's Eagle entities functioned in consonance\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 32), and Eagle Trust Fund provided \"back-office management, bookkeeping, and mail services for the other organizations\" (Initial Dec. at 5). Thus, Eagle Trust Fund employees sorted and distributed the mail that was delivered to P.O. Box 618 (and a related street address) for all of the \"Eagle\" entities, including Eagle Forum. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32, 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2016, members of the organization known as Eagle Forum clashed with Phyllis Schlafly, \"based in part on their holding political and social positions dissonant with Mrs. Schlafly and the other Eagle entities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) According to the amended complaint, six Eagle Forum directors \"secretly agreed among themselves to try to take control\" of Eagle Forum and \"to remove\n   Phyllis Schlafly and John Schlafly from their longstanding authority over [Eagle Forum's] accounts and assets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33, 34.) As a result, Mrs. Schlafly \"formally and expressly revok[ed] any and all existing licenses that [Eagle Forum] held to use her name, image, and likeness, as well as any intellectual property under her control.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.) Ultimately, an Illinois state court designated new, acting leadership for the Eagle Forum organization. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37; Initial Dec. at 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Soon thereafter, Eagle Forum's new leadership filed a change-of-address request form with USPS, thereby asking that any and all mail that was addressed to \"Eagle Forum\" at P.O. Box 618 and the related street address be forwarded to Eagle Forum's new place of business. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 38; Initial Dec. at 6.) As a trustee of ETF and an officer and director of EFE-LDF (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 4), John Schlafly opposed Eagle Forum's change-of-address request, leading to the administrative proceedings that underlie the instant mail dispute. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Initial Dec. at 6);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   39 C.F.R. Part 965 (governing \"Proceedings Relative to Mail Disputes\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On September 15, 2017, an Administrative Judge issued USPS's Initial Decision regarding the mail-matter conflict. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Initial Dec. at 3);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20965.11\">\n    39 C.F.R. \u00a7 965.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Administrative Judge addressed the question of \"how mail addressed to Eagle Forum at P.O. Box 618 and 322 State Street should be delivered\" (Initial Dec. at 6), and eventually concluded that \"Eagle Forum-and not Eagle Trust [Fund] or Eagle Forum Education and Legal Defense Fund-should control delivery of mail addressed to Eagle Forum\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In so finding, the Administrative Judge analyzed\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   two key concepts.... First, as it applies to all mail disputes, the sender's intent is paramount. Second, when a mail dispute concerns how mail to an organization should be delivered, the mail must be delivered under the order of the organization's president or equivalent official.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (internal citations omitted).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As to the question of the sender's intent, the Administrative Judge found that \"[t]he parties agree that [the disputed] mail addressed to Eagle Forum can actually be intended for any of Mrs. Schlafly's organizations, including Eagle Trust [Fund], Eagle Forum, and Eagle Forum Education and Legal Defense Fund[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Because of th[e] complex organizational web [of Eagle-themed organizations receiving mail at the same address], the sender's intent for items addressed to Eagle Forum is difficult, if not impossible, to determine.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.) Thus, the Administrative Judge concluded that it \"becomes necessary to look elsewhere for the evidence necessary to decide how the mail should be delivered.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Turning to the second component of his inquiry, the Administrative Judge found that \"there is no dispute that Eunie Smith is currently the acting president of Eagle Forum, entitling her to direct delivery of mail addressed to Eagle Forum.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although John Schlafly had argued that \"Eagle Forum really means Eagle Trust [Fund] or Eagle Forum Education and Legal Defense Fund[,]\" and that \"the term Eagle Forum encompasses the entire Schlafly network, all of which falls under Eagle Trust [Fund,]\" the Administrative Judge concluded that \"[t]hese arguments fail because the Domestic Mail Manual, which sets out the procedures for mail\n   delivery by the Postal Service, provides that an addressee controls the delivery of its mail, and that in the absence of a contrary order the mail is delivered as addressed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis omitted) (citation omitted).) \"To allow either [ETF or EFE-LDF] to control delivery of mail addressed to Eagle Forum would conflict with the plain meaning\" of USPS regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20211.2\">\n    39 C.F.R. \u00a7 211.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (establishing that \"[t]he regulations of the Postal Service consist of[,]\" among other things, \"[t]he Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual\"). The Administrative Judge therefore determined that \"all mail being held, or hereafter received, addressed to Eagle Forum at both P.O. Box 618, Alton, Illinois, and 322 State Street, Suite 301, Alton, Illinois, [should] be delivered as directed by Eunie Smith, the acting president of Eagle Forum.\" (Initial Dec. at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   John Schlafly appealed the Administrative Judge's decision,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20965.12\">\n    39 C.F.R. \u00a7 965.12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and a Judicial Officer (\"JO\") affirmed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Postal Service Decision (\"Dec. on Appeal\"), Ex. B. to Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 17-2, at 5 (concluding that, \"[a]s the only mail here in dispute is that directed to Eagle Forum (or Eagle Forum, Attention: Phyllis Schlafly), and Eagle Forum has moved, it remains entitled to redirect such mail to its present address\").) John Schlafly argued \"that the addressee in question-Eagle Forum-'may not file a change-of-address order' under [section 507.2.1.5 of the Domestic Mail Manual] because the disputed mail was 'originally addressed to the addressee\n   <em>\n    at\n   </em>\n   an organization, business, place of employment, or other affiliation' \" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 (emphasis added) )\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; however, the JO reasoned that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [b]y its own terms, the word 'addressee' in [section] 507.2.1.5 means 'an individual or a business entity,' not a combination of an individual or business entity to whom the mail piece is directed\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the address to which it is directed. Indeed, [section] 507.2.1.5 deals with a situation in which mail is sent to 'an organization, business, place of employment, or other affiliation' at which the individual or business entity to whom it is directed (the addressee) no longer conducts business or is employed. That is why the second sentence of [the provision] then allows the organization or business entity currently located at the physical address written on the piece of mail to 'change the address (but not the addressee's name)' on that mail to allow it to be redirected to the addressee (that is, to the individual or business entity whose name appears on that piece of mail but who no longer is located at that physical address).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The JO continued: \"[h]ere, the mail in dispute is being sent to Eagle Forum at a physical address (P.O. Box 618 and 322 State Street), not to Eagle Forum\n   <em>\n    at\n   </em>\n   Eagle Trust Fund or another of the many organizations and business entities also located at that physical address.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).) Thus, the JO determined that the Domestic Mail Manual provision that Schlafly sought to use to reverse the Administrative Judge's underlying decision \"does not apply and does not prohibit the change of address sought by\n   Eagle Forum.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20965.12\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20965.12\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (clarifying that \"[u]nless the face of a piece of disputed mail indicates that it is directed to Eagle Forum\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   to another business entity, for purposes of these mail delivery regulations, only one addressee is involved\" (emphasis in original) ).) In short, the JO determined that, \"if the words on a piece of mail identify only Eagle Forum, Eagle Forum is the addressee which is allowed to control delivery of that mail.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Consequently, the JO denied Schlafly's appeal, and the JO's \"final order [became] the final agency decision[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20965.12\">\n    39 C.F.R. \u00a7 965.12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Seeking to reverse the JO's decision upholding USPS's mail-routing determination, Plaintiffs filed a complaint with this Court on November 13, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs subsequently filed a four-count amended complaint, in which they claim (1) that USPS failed to use \"reasoned decisionmaking\" when resolving the underlying mail dispute (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 52-57, 58-60 (Counts I and II) ); (2) that USPS failed to follow its own regulations (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20965.12\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20965.12\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 61-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count III) ); and (3) that USPS violated Plaintiffs' constitutional right to due process (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20965.12\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20965.12\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 68-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count IV) ) by \"failing to provide for reconsideration, based on after-arising grounds or evidence\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69). The instant pending motion is USPS's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' amended complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   USPS's motion makes several arguments. First, USPS maintains that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. at 12-21);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). Next, USPS asserts that Plaintiffs' amended complaint fails to state a claim within the meaning of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), because it does not identify a source of law that authorizes this Court to grant the relief Plaintiffs request. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20965.12\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20965.12\">\n    at 22-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Finally, USPS contends that Plaintiffs' complaint lacks sufficient facts to support a plausible claim that the agency violated the Constitution's guarantee of due process, as Plaintiffs have neither \"identif[ied] a protected property or liberty interest under the Fifth Amendment[,]\" nor \"show[n] that [USPS's] procedures for resolving mail disputes violate[ ] the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process.\" (Defs.' Mot. at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs oppose USPS's dismissal motion on several fronts. They argue, first, that the APA authorizes review of USPS mail disputes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. in Supp. of Opp'n to Fed. Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss (\"Pls.' Opp'n\"), ECF No. 22-2, at 21 ;\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 17 (appearing to acknowledge that that \"Congress has exempted [USPS] from the [APA]\").) Plaintiffs further argue that the Court is authorized to engage in non-statutory (\"\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   \") review of USPS's actions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Opp'n at 22), and that the Due Process Clause requires the agency to provide aggrieved parties with the ability to seek reconsideration of USPS decisions based on after-arising grounds or evidence (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20965.12\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=39%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20965.12\">\n    at 37-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For the reasons explained below, this Court concludes that, while Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   jurisdictional argument is misguided, Plaintiffs' amended complaint does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted because it fails to identify a cause of action that would permit the Court to grant the requested relief. Furthermore, the complaint's allegations of fact, even if true, do not support a plausible claim that USPS violated Plaintiffs' procedural due process rights. Therefore, Defendants' motion must be granted, and Plaintiffs' claims must be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. at 1.) Notably, the crux of USPS's argument with respect to both contentions relies on the same purported defect in Plaintiffs' complaint: that Plaintiffs have failed to identify a source of law authorizing the Court to review the underlying USPS decision and grant Plaintiffs' requested relief. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. at 12 (\"[USPS's] decision is not reviewable under the APA or 'non-statutory' agency review.

Moreover, in similar cases, courts have easily found the due process requirements of the Constitution to be satisfied where various procedures short of reconsideration are afforded to the parties as part of an administrative review process.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Barkley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201378,4111015\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/25/\">\n    766 F.3d at 32-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding due process requirements met where officer \"terminated for reasons of medical fitness\" was first \"given the opportunity to supply\" evidence to \"neutral decisionmakers[,]\" even though no oral hearing was held);\n   <em>\n    Beverly Enters.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132653\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/130/1/#p18\">\n    130 F.Supp.2d at 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding due process requirements met in administrative proceedings where \"the plaintiff employed counsel, took depositions from and cross examined\" witnesses, and \"reviewed all documents considered by the agency in its decision and presented its own exhibits and witnesses to prove its case\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132653\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/130/1/#p18\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing case in which \"the court held that an administrative hearing meets the main requirements of due process where a party had the right to a neutral arbitrator, to be represented by counsel, to conduct cross-examination, present evidence and witnesses on its own behalf and rebut evidence submitted by the adverse party\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In short, Plaintiffs' claim that USPS violated their constitutional right to due process clearly cannot survive USPS's motion to dismiss when Plaintiffs offer no facts to suggest that the requested procedure was ever denied, and even so, merely claim, without more, that due process requires that USPS \"provide for reconsideration.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs have failed to identify a cause of action that would authorize this Court to grant the relief they seek as to three of the counts in their amended complaint, and have also failed to allege facts that support\n   a claim that Defendants violated their constitutional right to due process. Thus, Plaintiffs' amended complaint \"fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted[.]\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Accordingly, and as set forth in the accompanying Order, Defendant's motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and Plaintiffs' action is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Page-number citations to the documents that the parties have filed refer to the page numbers that the Court's electronic filing system automatically assigns.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The facts recited herein are drawn from the allegations in Plaintiffs' complaint, as well as from the written decisions in the underlying administrative proceedings, which the complaint incorporates by reference.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     R.J.

Brennan (collectively, \"Defendants\" or \"USPS\"), the original complaint also named Eagle Forum as a defendant. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. at 1.) Eagle Forum filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that venue was improper (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Mot. to Dismiss or Transfer Venue, ECF No. 10 ), and USPS filed a separate motion to dismiss (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 17 ). The Court issued an order dismissing Eagle Forum from the action and allowing Plaintiffs to amend their complaint. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Order, ECF No. 19, at 2-3.) It subsequently denied USPS's motion to dismiss as moot. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Min.
