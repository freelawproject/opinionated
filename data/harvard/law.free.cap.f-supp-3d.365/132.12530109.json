Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted (ECF No. 9 ). The School Department seeks dismissal of all three counts asserted against it in the complaint by Plaintiffs Michael and Erin McCann (\"the\n   McCanns\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on behalf of their minor son, J.M. Those counts include violations of Title IX,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2019) (Count I), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2019) (Count II), and the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution (Count III). Because I conclude that the complaint states a plausible claim for violations of Title IX and Section 504, I deny the School Department's motion in part, as to Counts I and II; however, I grant the School Department's motion as to Count III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The complaint alleges the following facts, which I treat as true for purposes of the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   J.M. has experienced difficulties with anxiety and attention for many years. In 2013, the same year J.M. started middle school, he was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder - Inattentive Type (ADHD) and anxiety, which the complaint alleges qualifies as a disability under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2019).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also in 2013, the School Department created a Section 504 Plan\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   for J.M., which provided accommodations for him including additional time for certain tasks and permission to take breaks when he was feeling anxious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Beginning in middle school, J.M. was subjected to bullying and harassment from fellow students because of his \"perceived nonconformance with conventional gender norms and stereotypes.\" ECF No. 1 \u00b6 9. During one incident, which took place during a school-sponsored overnight trip with J.M.'s 7th grade class, the boys with whom J.M. shared a bunk room \"defil[ed] J.M.'s pillow with their genitalia\" and threw water on him, and then said that J.M. had urinated himself.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    \u00b6 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The boys threatened to beat J.M. up if he reported them, but J.M. did tell a chaperone what had happened. The chaperone informed School Department officials about the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Later that same school year, J.M. and his parents complained to the School Department multiple times about other bullying, including an incident where one student videotaped J.M. being physically assaulted by another middle school boy. During a separate bullying incident, J.M.'s iPad was destroyed. J.M.'s parents ultimately withdrew J.M. from York Middle School at the end of his 7th grade year because they felt that the School Department had failed to adequately investigate or address the bullying issues. That summer, J.M. began seeing a mental health counselor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In August 2017, J.M. enrolled in 9th grade at York High School. Before the school year began, J.M.'s parents contacted the School Department to discuss changes to J.M.'s Section 504 Plan and to address J.M.'s anxiety and their concerns about his physical safety at school. The\n   School Department did not immediately respond. Meanwhile, beginning in August, J.M. was bullied and harassed by a group of 9th grade girls and a 9th grade boy, G.M. That same group of 9th grade girls then started exchanging social media messages with J.M. and some of his friends. One message referred to G.M. as a \"fag,\" and the girls then forwarded that message to G.M., who shared it with his mother. G.M.'s mother told the School Department that J.M. was bullying G.M. Shortly after that incident, G.M. told J.M. that he would have his older brother, D.M., beat up J.M. In September, G.M. and his friends' harassment of J.M. intensified. They taunted J.M. and called him names such as \"bitch\" and \"cunt.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    \u00b6 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After one bullying incident in late September, J.M. became so distraught that he left school and walked home, after which J.M.'s parents reported the bullying to the school's Section 504 Coordinator and the school resource officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 3, 2017, the School Department convened an emergency Section 504 meeting at the request of J.M.'s parents. Among those in attendance were J.M.'s parents, the Assistant Principal, who is also the school's Section 504 Coordinator, the school counselor, and several teachers. After the meeting, J.M.'s Section 504 Plan was modified to provide that the School Department would work with J.M. to identify a safe place and a trusted adult for him to go to when he felt anxiety. The new Section 504 Plan also stated that J.M. could \"access the school social worker and/or his school counselor as necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    \u00b6 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the days that followed the emergency Section 504 meeting, G.M. and the 9th grade girls continued to harass J.M. and call him a \"bitch\" and \"cunt.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 24-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . J.M. responded by giving G.M. and the girls the middle finger,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   after which G.M. again told J.M. that he was going to have his older brother, D.M., beat J.M. up. The McCanns told the School Department and the school resource officer about the new incidents of harassment, including which students were responsible and the fact that G.M. had been threatening assault. On October 19, J.M. told both the school's Section 504 Coordinator and the school resource officer about G.M.'s threats that D.M. would beat J.M. up, and the Section 504 Coordinator told J.M. that she would \"take care of it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    \u00b6 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the beginning of the school day on October 20, several students warned J.M. that they had heard that D.M. planned to attack J.M. later that day. J.M. went to the school counselor and told her that D.M. planned to assault him, but the counselor did not alert anyone or take any action to intervene or prevent the assault. After talking with the counselor, J.M. went to his second period class. D.M., who was not a student in the class, walked into the classroom, pointed at J.M., and said \"let's take a walk.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    \u00b6 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

D.M. then physically beat J.M., including pushing him into a glass door, throwing him against a locker and pounding his head against it multiple times, and punching him repeatedly. J.M. lost consciousness during the attack and was taken by ambulance to York Hospital Emergency Room, where he was diagnosed with a head injury, several contusions, and a dislocated jaw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   J.M. missed over three months of school as a result of his injuries. He was later found to have suffered a major concussion, was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, and suffered severe emotional distress. After the assault, the Section 504\n   Coordinator emailed Erin McCann to acknowledge that J.M. had asked her for help. The York High School Principal also sent an email to members of the community about the assault, in which he acknowledged that the School Department had known about the \"ongoing conflict\" between the students involved.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    \u00b6 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

That assault could also have been gender-based, given that it was related to the earlier name calling and other bullying. Viewing the complaint and the history of the alleged conduct holistically, it is plausible that even conduct that appears gender-neutral was motivated by J.M.'s perceived nonconformance with gender stereotypes, given the interwoven instances of gender-based bullying. The complaint, therefore, plausibly alleges that J.M. was subjected to bullying and harassment because the other students viewed him as different for failing to project the type of masculinity stereotypically associated with adolescent boys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The School Department argues that \"courts have held that 'gender-based' insults are not alone actionable under Title IX because they are not 'based on sex,' \" and cites as an example the First Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.

Those allegations include (1) that J.M. informed the School Department, through a chaperone, about the incident during the overnight trip in 2015; (2) that J.M.'s parents contacted the school's Section 504 Coordinator and the school resource officer in late September 2017 to report incidents of harassment, after other students had started calling J.M. \"bitch\" and \"cunt\"; (3) that after the emergency Section 504 meeting on October 3, 2017, J.M.'s parents again told the school resource officer that J.M. was being harassed, including the fact that threats of assault had been made; (4) that J.M. told the Section 504 Coordinator and the school resource officer about G.M.'s threats that D.M. would beat J.M. up; and (5) that, on the morning of the assault, J.M. reported to the school counselor that other students said the assault would happen that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A school official is an \"appropriate person\" to receive notice of harassment, for the purpose of determining liability under Title IX, when that person, \"at a minimum, has the authority to institute corrective measures\" and has \"customary disciplinary authority\" over the alleged harasser.\n   <em>\n    Santiago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3827639\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/61/#p74\">\n    655 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   74 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gebser v.

J.M.'s alleged harassers were his fellow students. It is plausible to infer, taking the complaint in the light most favorable to the McCanns, that each of the school officials notified of the harassment by J.M. and his parents-including the Section 504 Coordinator/Assistant Principal, school resource officer, and school counselor-have disciplinary authority over students enrolled at the school. Indeed, the school counselor was specifically designated as the support person for J.M. in the Section 504 Plan. ECF No. 1 \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The final issue is whether the School District \"fail[ed] adequately to respond\" to the reports of harassment.\n   <em>\n    Gebser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/#p290\">\n    524 U.S. at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182276\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/274/#p290\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As described above, the complaint alleges that J.M. and his parents made multiple reports of harassment to various school officials beginning in 2015, including the fact that J.M. was being threatened with assault in September and October 2017. As alleged in the complaint, the only action that the School Department took in response was to convene an emergency Section 504 meeting and modify J.M.'s Section 504 Plan to provide that the school would work with J.M. to identify a safe place and trusted adult to seek out when he felt anxious. The complaint further alleges that no action was taken in response to J.M.'s report on October 20 that he was going to be assaulted at school that day, even though he made the report to one of the adults who was identified as a resource for him in the Section 504 Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   It is plausible, based on these facts, that both the other students' continued harassment of J.M. and D.M.'s assault of J.M. were \"known or obvious consequence[s]\" of the School Department's inaction.\n   <em>\n    Porto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2913720\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/488/67/#p72\">\n    488 F.3d at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That J.M. and his parents made multiple reports on different occasions suggests that the bullying behavior was not likely to subside in the absence of intervention by school officials. Furthermore, because J.M. told the school counselor about the threat of assault\n   on the day the assault actually happened, the assault was a \"known consequence\" of the School Department's failure to act on J.M.'s and his parents' reports. Thus, the McCanns allege that the School Department did nothing to stop known incidents of harassment to J.M.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2913720\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/488/67/#p72\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2913720\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/488/67/#p72\">\n    at 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   I conclude that the complaint plausibly pleads both that the harassment J.M. endured was based on his perceived nonconformance with traditional gender stereotypes and that the School Department acted with deliberate indifference.

Rehabilitation Act Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The School Department seeks dismissal of the McCanns' claim under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act on two grounds. First, the School Department argues that the complaint alleges the denial of a free appropriate public education (\"FAPE\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that the McCanns failed to exhaust administrative remedies, as required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201415\">\n    20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) (West 2019), and the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Fry v.

Second, the School Department asserts that, even if the Court finds that administrative exhaustion was not required, the complaint fails to state a claim for relief under Section 504. I conclude that the complaint does not allege the denial of a FAPE under\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   and that the complaint states a plausible claim under Section 504.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    1. IDEA Exhaustion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court addressed the scope of \u00a7 1415(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ), the IDEA provision that \"requires that a plaintiff exhaust the IDEA's procedures before filing an action under the [Americans with Disabilities Act], the Rehabilitation Act, or similar laws when (but only when) her suit seek[s] relief that is also available under the IDEA.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p748\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held that IDEA exhaustion is only required where the \"substance, or gravamen, of the plaintiff's complaint\" seeks relief for the denial of a FAPE, and rejected a standard that simply asks \"whether [the] injuries were, broadly speaking, 'educational' in nature.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p748\">\n    at 752, 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Several facts may be relevant to the \"gravamen\" analysis, including whether the complaint alleges a deficiency in the student's Individualized Education Program (IEP) or accuses the school of \"refusing to provide the educational instruction and services\" that the student needs, and whether the plaintiff initially pursued IDEA administrative remedies before filing suit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p748\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p748\">\n    at 758\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The School Department argues that the McCanns were required to exhaust administrative procedures under the IDEA because the complaint alleges a \"failure to provide JM with an education that meets his needs,\" and, therefore, its gravamen is the denial of a FAPE. ECF No. 9 at 9. The McCanns respond that the complaint does not implicate the denial of a FAPE because the gravamen of the complaint is disability discrimination. The thrust of the Section 504 claim, they assert, is that the School Department \"discounted the seriousness\n   of the reports\" of bullying and harassment by J.M. and his parents because it \"regard[ed] them as manifestations of J.M.'s disability.\" ECF No. 14 at 11.

The school had a Section 504 Plan in place for J.M., which provided J.M. with accommodations based on his ADHD and anxiety,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 23, and the complaint does not allege that those accommodations were inadequate to meet J.M.'s educational needs. Rather, the complaint alleges that the School Department failed to respond to J.M.'s reports of harassment because of his disability. That omission, the McCanns argue, led to the continued harassment of J.M. by other students and, ultimately, him being assaulted while at school. ECF No. 14 at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Because the gravamen of the complaint is not the denial of a FAPE, the McCanns were not required to exhaust administrative\n   remedies under the IDEA and\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   before bringing suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The complaint also alleges that J.M. was an enrolled student, from which I infer that J.M. was \"qualified\" to receive the benefits of the educational programs at his respective schools. Therefore, I conclude that the complaint plausibly pleads the first three required elements under Section 504 and turn to the fourth element: whether the complaint plausibly pleads that J.M. was denied the benefits of the School Department's educational program solely by reason of his disability. The School Department argues that the complaint falls short in this regard.

The complaint alleges that the School Department \"knew that J.M.'s disability manifested in heightened fear and anxiety stemming from repeated acts of bullying and harassment\" and that J.M. and his parents reported harassment and threats of physical violence by other students. ECF No. 1 \u00b6 60. The McCanns argue that the School Department's failure to intervene was discrimination based on J.M.'s disability because J.M.'s heightened anxiety around bullying caused the School Department not to take his reports seriously.

The complaint plausibly alleges, therefore, that the School Department's failure to fully investigate and address J.M.'s reports was because of J.M.'s disability. \"The possibility of additional, or alternative, reasons for the ... decision does not detract from the plausibility of [the] allegation\" that J.M.'s disability was the \"sole reason\" for the School Department's response (or lack thereof).\n   <em>\n    Shaikh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=739%20F.%20App%27x%20215\">\n    739 F.

ECF No. 9 at 12-13. That argument, however, does not account for the fact that the alleged deprivation includes not only J.M.'s absence from school, but also the period when he was still attending school while allegedly enduring harassment by his peers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 \u00b6 61. It is plausible to infer from the complaint that the School Department's failure to intervene, which was allegedly because of J.M.'s disability, is an earlier link in the causal chain that led to the assault. Therefore, the fact that J.M.'s physical injuries were caused by another student does not mean that the alleged discrimination did not occur \"solely by reason of his disability.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The complaint thus states a plausible claim for relief under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
