LUDINGTON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On September 22, 2017, Plaintiff Rita R. Johnson filed suit in the Saginaw County\n   Circuit Court against Defendants City of Saginaw (the \"City\") and Water Department Worker No. 1. Johnson contended that Defendants \"arbitrarily and capriciously turned off the water supply\" to her business on May 7, 2011, \"without notice or authority.\" Compl. at 2, ECF No. 10, Ex. B. Defendants removed the case to this Court several days later. ECF No. 1. On September 29, 2017, Johnson filed a motion to remand the case, arguing that it was improperly removed. ECF No. 3. Several days later, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the suit. ECF No. 7. On December 20, 2017, the Court issued an opinion and order denying the motion to remand, denying the motion to dismiss, and resolving several other miscellaneous motions. ECF No. 23. On January 5, 2018, Johnson filed an amended complaint pursuant to a stipulation. ECF No. 28. The first amended complaint identified Jason Cabello as the water department worker identified anonymously in the original complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Afterwards, the case entered discovery. ECF No. 33. On May 7, 2018, Johnson filed a second amended complaint having obtained leave of the Court. ECF No. 39. The second amended complaint named John Stemple (the Chief Inspector for the City of Saginaw) as another Defendant. On July 19, 2018, Johnson filed a motion for leave to file a third amended complaint which the Court denied. ECF No. 53, 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On November 19, 2018, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. ECF No. 74. Two days later, Johnson filed a motion for partial summary judgment. ECF No. 75. For the following reasons, Defendants' motion will be denied and Johnson's motion will be granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Rita Johnson owns and operates Rita's Southern Soul Caf\u00e9 in Saginaw, Michigan. Am. Compl. at 2, ECF No. 39. She rents out the space on weekends for various events, such as parties, receptions, and baby showers. Johnson Dep. at 16, ECF No. 74-2. On May 5, 2017, Johnson rented the space to Andrick Pruitt for a birthday party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47-48. Pruitt had hired a security company to provide eighteen security guards for the party.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48; Hearing Transcript May 11, 2017 at 12, ECF No. 74-3. Some of the guards were wearing bulletproof vests and at least one carried an AK-47 style assault rifle. ECF. No. 74-3 at 16. At approximately 1:45a.m. the morning of May 6, 2017, approximately sixty shots were fired at the building as the party was still ongoing. ECF No. 74-2 at 47 ; ECF No. 74-3 at 14 ; ECF No. 75-12 at \u00b6 12. The Saginaw police chief, Robert Ruth, believed the incident was gang related. ECF No. 74-3 at 80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Saginaw police informed Defendant Stemple, Chief Inspector for the City of Saginaw, about the incident and Stemple determined that Johnson's water services should be suspended to prevent any further activities from occurring at the premises. Stemple Dep. at 9, 50, ECF No. 74-4. The evening of May 6, Stemple instructed Joe Gough, Water Department Foreman, to suspend Johnson's water services. Gough Dep. at 6, ECF No. 74-5. Gough contacted Defendant Cabello, a Saginaw Water Department utility worker, to perform the suspension.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. A work order was issued and Cabello shut off the water services to Johnson's business. Cabello Dep. at 12, 22, ECF No. 74-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The City provided Johnson no notice that it was suspending her water services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16; Gough Dep. at 9-10, ECF No. 75-10. On May 8 however, the City provided her notice that it had suspended her business license. Notice of Suspension, ECF No. 74-8. The notice provided\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT PURSUANT TO THE CITY OF SAGINAW (\"CITY\") CODE OF ORDINANCE,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ALL ACTIVITY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   RELATED TO THE USE AND/OR OPERATION OF THE PROPERTY LOCATED AT 110 N.

The notice further provided that pursuant to Ordinance O-1 Sec. 110.06(F), a hearing would be held on May 11, 2017 where Johnson could present a defense against the suspension.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The City held the hearing, granting Johnson the opportunity to be heard and to present witnesses and evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hearing Transcript, May 11, 2017, ECF No. 74-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Johnson's water services continued to be suspended following the business license suspension hearing. Johnson claims that she contacted the City requesting that her water services be reinstated, but that her water remained turned off. Johnson Aff. at \u00b6 33, ECF No. 75-12. The City represents that it has no record of Johnson making such a request. ECF No. 74-4 at 26. It was not until after Johnson filed this lawsuit that her water services were reinstated, nearly five months after the City initially suspended them. ECF No. 75-12 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In her second amended complaint, Johnson asserted two causes of action. Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 39. First, she alleged that Defendants' actions violated her substantive due process rights. She argued that Defendants \"arbitrarily and/or capriciously ended Plaintiff's delivery of water without any ability or opportunity to have any process or procedure to halt the proposed depravation and/or seek its restoration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. She further alleged that \"[e]nding water services when there is no on-going violations of City Ordinances or lack of payment makes the continued suspension of water services arbitrary and/or capricious, of such a character to shock the consciousness of this Court; and/or is an unreasonable restriction is [sic] without a valid rational basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In Count Two, Johnson alleged that her procedural due process rights were violated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. Specifically, Defendants did not provide her with notice before they ended her water services, and they did not provide a pre- (or post-) deprivation hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition to filing this complaint, Johnson filed a separate complaint alleging due process violations in relation to the City of Saginaw's suspension of her business license.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Dec. 20, 2017). Defendants in that case filed a motion to dismiss which the Court granted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206512450\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants now move for summary judgment and Johnson moves for partial summary judgment. A motion for summary judgment should be granted if the \"movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The moving party has the initial burden of identifying where to look in the record for evidence \"which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

First, the code that Defendants relied upon, Michigan Building Code \u00a7 112.3, did not apply in the situation. Section 112.3 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The building official shall have the authority to authorize disconnection of utility service to the building, structure or system regulated by the code and the referenced codes and standards set forth in Section 101.4 in case of emergency where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to life or property or when such utility connection has been made without the approval required by Section 112.1 or 112.2. The building official shall notify the serving utility, and whenever possible the owner or occupant of the building prior to taking such action. If not notified prior to disconnecting, the owner or occupant of the\n   building, structure or service system shall be notified in writing, as soon as practical thereafter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mich. Build. Code \u00a7 112.3. Defendants contend that the shooting outside Johnson's restaurant constituted an emergency pursuant to the statute and accordingly, they had the authority to suspend her water services without notice or a predeprivation hearing. ECF No. 74 at 7. Johnson argues that Section 112.3 cannot be used to justify Defendants' actions because Section 112.3 was intended only to address the construction of buildings. ECF No. 75 at 8, 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Michigan Building Code originates from Michigan Compiled Laws 125.1504 which \"prescribes the procedures for the administration and enforcement of the state construction code.\"\n   <em>\n    Forner v. Twp. of Spring Lake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203551357\">\n    2018 WL 3551357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *1 (Mich. Ct. App. 2018). It mandates the state of Michigan to promulgate a building code \"consisting of rules governing the construction, use, and occupation of buildings and structures ... and other requirements relating to the safety, including safety from fire, and sanitation facilities of the buildings and structures.\" M.C.L. 125.1504(1). The general purposes of the act is to regulate the construction and integrity of buildings. It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (3) The code shall be designed to effectuate the general purposes of this act and the following objectives and standards:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (a) To provide standards and requirements for construction and construction materials consistent with nationally recognized standards and requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (b) To formulate standards and requirements, to the extent practicable in terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the use intended the test of acceptability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (c) To permit to the fullest extent feasible the use of modern technical methods, devices, and improvements, including premanufactured units, consistent with reasonable requirements for the health, safety, and welfare of the occupants and users of buildings and structures.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (d) To eliminate restrictive, obsolete, conflicting, or unnecessary construction regulations that tend to increase construction costs unnecessarily or restrict the use of new materials, products, or methods of construction, or provide preferential treatment to types or classes of materials or products or methods of construction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (e) To ensure adequate maintenance of buildings and structures throughout this state and to adequately protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   M.C.L. 125.1504(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Nowhere does the act state or even suggest that a purpose of the building code is to protect individuals from criminal activity. It does state that the act is intended to \"protect the health, safety, and welfare of the people,\" but this is in relation to the \"maintenance of buildings and structures.\" It would be too far a stretch to conclude that the maintenance of the building extends to preventing criminal activity occurring outside the building. The code permits the suspension of utilities \"in case[s] of emergency where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to life or property.\" Mich. Build. Code \u00a7 112.3. However, this does not encompass any situation that could be considered an emergency within or near the building. Rather, the \"emergency\" must be in the context of the maintenance and use of the actual building. To interpret the code otherwise would be to reject its clear intended purpose as described in M.C.L. 125.1504.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants further argue that \"this Court has held that the\n   <em>\n    misapplication\n   </em>\n   of the Code is not a violation of due process.\" ECF No. 74 at 19 (emphasis present in original). While this assertion is true, it requires additional context. Plaintiff had filed a motion to amend her complaint a third time to add a claim that Defendants' actions pursuant to Michigan Building Code \u00a7 112.3 violated her due process rights. Mot. for Leave to File Third Am. Compl., ECF No. 52. The Court held that Section 112.3 was facially constitutional and that misapplication of a state law does not constitute a per se due process violation. ECF No. 70. However, this conclusion did not foreclose the possibility that Defendants still violated Johnson's due process rights while claiming to act pursuant to Section 112.3. The Court was explaining that the misapplication alone of a state law does not constitute a due process violation. Rather, the misapplication must have resulted in a due process violation. Here, the misapplication of Section 112.3 did result in a due process violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The second reason\n   <em>\n    City of Akron\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable is because the Sixth Circuit determined that the city's only option to address the emergency was to demolish the building.\n   <em>\n    City of Akron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515189\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/20/1396/#p1401\">\n    20 F.3d at 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The building was structurally unsound and permitting it to remain standing endangered public safety. In this case, Defendants have not demonstrated that suspending Johnson's water services was their only option to prevent another event from occurring at Johnson's premises. It is reasonable to assume that the City of Saginaw could have exercised other options to prevent another event from occurring at the property. In fact, the City exercised such an option when they suspended Johnson's business license. As the Court previously determined in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Morales\n   </em>\n   , the city had proper statutory authority to suspend her business license without a predeprivation hearing.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206512450\">\n    2017 WL 6512450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *13 (E.D. Mich. Dec. 20, 2017). Here, the City had no such statutory authority to suspend water services. Defendants argue that shutting off the water was necessary because suspension of the business license could not happen until the next day. However, there was nothing preventing the City from exercising other lawful options to address the emergency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The third reason\n   <em>\n    City of Akron\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the present case is that it requires adequate postdeprivation proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   When the situation necessitates \"quick action\" by the state or makes efforts to provide a meaningful predeprivation process impracticable, the persons acting under state authority may proceed without violating the property owner's rights so long as the state provides an adequate postdeprivation procedure.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    City of Akron\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515189\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/20/1396/#p1401\">\n    20 F.3d at 1401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Bd. of Educ. of Whitley Cty., Ky.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10548164\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/844/1268/#p1273\">\n    844 F.2d 1268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1273 (6th Cir. 1988). Johnson's means of livelihood is her restaurant which requires water to operate. She testified that without water, she could not clean or sanitize the building. Johnson Dep. at 53, ECF No. 74-2 (\"[Y]ou can't flush the toilets, you can't clean the kitchens; so for cleaning purpose, sanitation purpose.\"). Without water, Johnson was prevented from operating her business, thus depriving her of her primary source of income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Regarding the finality of the suspension, the Supreme Court has held \"[a]lthough utility service may be restored ultimately, the cessation of essential services for any appreciable time works a uniquely final deprivation.\"\n   <em>\n    Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division v.

The City suspended Johnson's water for five months, from May 2017 to October 2017. Defendants argue that it only lasted for five days because Johnson was granted a hearing on May 11. However, as explained below, the business license suspension hearing was not an adequate hearing on her water suspension. As such, her deprivation was permanent because it was not until October 3, at the request of her attorney, that water services were finally reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Johnson alleges that she asked the city to turn her water turned back on. Johnson Aff. at \u00b6 33, ECF No. 75-12. Defendants contend that they have no record of her making such a request. ECF No. 74-4 at 26. However, even if Johnson had made no such request, the City turned off the water in response to an alleged emergency. When the emergency was over, the City could have turned the water back on. Defendants argue that they do not turn water back on after emergencies until requested by the property owner to do so. Stemple Dep. at 30, ECF No. 74-4. However, the City unilaterally suspended Johnson's water services with no notice or predeprivation hearing. It had a responsibility to hold a postdeprivation hearing, which it did not do. As the instigator of the water suspension, the onus remained with the City to\n   determine whether it should reinstate Johnson's water services. This was not Johnson's responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The second factor to consider is the risk of an erroneous deprivation and the probable value added by additional safeguards or procedures (like a predeprivation hearing).\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p348\">\n    424 U.S. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p348\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). \"[T]he probability of error in utility cutoff decisions is not so insubstantial as to warrant dispensing with all process prior to termination.\"\n   <em>\n    Memphis Light\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490177\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/1/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 1566. In this case, the risk of erroneous deprivation is high because no one from the City water department assessed the situation prior to suspending water services. Stemple's decision to suspend Johnson's water services stemmed entirely from Chief Ruth's suspicions that the shooting was gang-related. Stemple Dep. at 9, 50, ECF No. 74-4. Water services were not suspended due to an emergency involving the actual water or its delivery to the building. Rather, they were suspended due to an outside occurrence. As established above, the City was acting without statutory authority when it suspended water services. As such, the \"risk of erroneous deprivation\" was high because no one from the City Water Department assessed or inspected the situation. It was based entirely on a report from law enforcement involving an act of violence that was potentially related to an event occurring at the property. It was not related to water services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The third factor to consider is the Government's interest in the deprivation.\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p348\">\n    424 U.S. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 335,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p348\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). The City of Saginaw has a strong interest both in preventing shootings at local establishments and in prosecuting the perpetrators of such shootings. And, given the serious threat posed by mass shootings, the City has a strong interest in taking steps to prevent further violence before it occurs. However, the Government's interest is only one of three factors in the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   balancing test. It may not swallow the other two factors whole. Though the prevention of crime is an important government interest, this does not give the government license to disregard individuals' Constitutional rights. Given the strong weight of the first two factors, the\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   balancing test does not excuse the City's obligation to provide notice and a hearing prior to suspending Johnson's water services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Johnson contends that the City of Saginaw never provided her a postdeprivation hearing after suspending her water services. ECF No. 39 at 6. Defendants disagree and argue that she received a postdeprivation hearing on May 11, 2011 when the City held a hearing about suspending her business license. ECF No. 74 at 12-13. The notice of the hearing given to Johnson provided\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT PURSUANT TO THE CITY OF SAGINAW (\"CITY\") CODE OF ORDINANCE,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ALL ACTIVITY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   RELATED TO THE USE AND/OR OPERATION OF THE PROPERTY LOCATED AT 110 N.

Def.'s M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Dismiss at 8, ECF No. 7. As the Court previously found, \u00a7 110.06(F) does not authorize termination of water services. ECF No. 23 at 19. The hearing was held expressly to provide Johnson an opportunity to challenge the license suspension, not suspension of her water services. Defendants argue that regardless, suspension of Johnson's water services was addressed at the hearing because the notice stated that \"all activity\" related to the property was suspended. However, the Court has previously determined that \"Johnson has related but distinct property interests in both her business license and the continuation of utilities service.\" ECF No. 23 at 18-19. The notice's phrase \"all activity\" does not subsume every activity at the property when the ordinance \u00a7 110.06(F) only authorized termination of Johnson's business license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendants identify one statement made by Johnson during the hearing which they argue proves that an adequate hearing was provided.

In all 109 pages of the hearing transcript, Johnson's statement is the only mention of the water suspension. At no time did the City address this issue.

A brief remark by Johnson that her water was shut off does not constitute a meaningful consideration of the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendants contend that their notice and hearing were not vague because the Court previously held in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

J. at 7, ECF No. 74. Suspending Johnson's water services was the most \"necessary and immediate action to ensure that no further violence stemming from\n   Plaintiff's business activity could occur.

As explained above, this code addresses the integrity and maintenance of buildings, not criminal acts occurring outside the building. Thus, Defendants were acting without statutory authority when they suspended water services. This is consistent with the Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v. Morales\n   </em>\n   in which the Court determined that the City of Saginaw had a rational basis for suspending Johnson's business license pursuant to the city ordinance \u00a7 110.06(F). Defendants have not identified a similar statute providing them this type of authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Furthermore, as stated in the Court's previous order, Defendants' purported reason for terminating water services is of questionable legitimacy. Defendants' desire to suspend business operations at Johnson's business because they feared future violent incidents and wanted to complete an investigation bears a rational relation to a legitimate government purpose. But that purpose was completely accomplished by terminating Johnson's business license. Defendants have not explained why public safety demanded both that Johnson's business license be suspended and her water services terminated during the length of the investigation. They contend that they had to suspend the water because they could not revoke her business license until the next day. However, they do not explain why Johnson's water services remained turned off even after the City suspended her business license. The utter redundancy of the decision to discontinue water services suggests that it was \" 'willful and unreasoning action, without consideration and in disregard of the facts or circumstances of the case.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1863025\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/961/1211/#p1216\">\n    961 F.2d at 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Greenhill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"435589\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/519/5/\">\n    519 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   10 n. 12 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Defendants further argue that suspending Johnson's water services was rational because it was consistent with the city's custom and past practices.

Though the Court uses the term \"arbitrary\" to describe the claim that the university had acted inconsistently with past practice, the Court was not creating a standard whereby arbitrariness is determined by a defendant acting consistently or inconsistently with its past behavior. To do so would overlook the fact that a custom and past practice may be irrational or unreasonable.
