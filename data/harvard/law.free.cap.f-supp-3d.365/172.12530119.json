(Docket No. 52). The plaintiff Rifat M. Cheema d/b/a/ Cheema's Supermarket (\"Cheema's\") has filed this action against the USDA in order to contest an agency ruling which found that Cheema's likely trafficked in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, and which disqualified Cheema's from participating in that program. Cheema's bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence at trial that the agency's ruling was incorrect. To survive summary judgment, Cheema's must present credible evidence at this stage of the case on which a jury could reasonably find for Cheema's at trial. For the reasons herein, the court rules that Cheema's fails to make that showing. This court, therefore, ALLOWS the USDA's Motion and grants summary judgment in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise indicated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     SNAP Benefits\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (\"SNAP\"), established through the Food Stamp Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202011\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , is intended \"to promote the general welfare, [and] to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's population by\n   raising the levels of nutrition among low-income households.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202011\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (DF \u00b6 1). SNAP is operated by the Food and Nutrition Service (\"FNS\" or the \"Agency\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2). Through SNAP, eligible participants are allotted funds to spend on certain food items. SNAP funds are used by beneficiaries through electronic benefit transfer or \"EBT\" cards, which are loaded monthly and operate in a similar fashion to debit cards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   EBT cards can be used at approved stores on approved items. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). For example, SNAP regulations provide that certified retail stores cannot accept EBT benefits for particular goods including alcohol, cigarettes, tobacco, lottery tickets, pet foods, soaps, paper products, household supplies, vitamins, medicines, and hot prepared foods. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15). FNS certifies stores to participate in the program and classifies each store based on its size and the types of goods sold. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202011\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202011\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 8-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A retail store that violates SNAP regulations may be subject to civil penalties or disqualification from the program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17). One such regulation is the prohibition on retail stores from exchanging EBT benefits for cash, which is considered trafficking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19). Regulators monitor EBT transactions in order to detect suspicious behavior. All EBT transactions are recorded in a database maintained by the USDA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21). The database records the date, time, and amount of each transaction, and the store and household identification numbers related to each. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23). The balance remaining in each beneficiary's account is also recorded after each transaction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24). The database has the capacity to produce certain reports of suspicious activity known as \"Anti-Fraud Locator using EBT Retailer Transactions,\" or \"ALERT\" reports. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25). FNS, and its Investigative Analysis Branch, is responsible for monitoring stores and investigating suspicious activity.

(DF \u00b6 39). Brothers Farhat, Nusrat, and Rifat Cheema own the store. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In March of 1997, Cheema's became authorized to accept SNAP benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42). Cheema's was approved to accept SNAP benefits as a retail store, but not as a wholesaler. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47). Cheema's originally was classified as a \"small grocery store\" for SNAP purposes and was later reclassified as a \"combination store/other\" in 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43). In 2015, based on the store's inventory and stock, Cheema's was reclassified as a \"medium grocery store.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53). The store is approximately 1300 square feet, has a single cash register, and has no scanning devices. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-45). Cheema's offers customers small handheld baskets as opposed to large shopping carts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50). At all times, one of the Cheema brothers\n   works the cash register and uses a calculator to tally purchases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Cheema's claims that since the store's inception, Cheema's has attracted loyal customers who travel long distances to shop at the store. (Owners' Aff. \u00b6 4). Cheema's asserts that the store specializes in unique Halal meats, much of which is sold at a significant markup. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 10). The store alleges that its customers often buy Halal meat for an entire month at once, quickly depleting an individual's SNAP benefits for that given month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14; Customers' Aff. \u00b6 6). While the store has no carts for customers, Cheema's avers that one of the owners carries meat orders to the checkout counter for customers and that most orders fit within typical shopping bags. (Owners' Aff. \u00b6 9). Cheema's alleges that \"[m]any of our customers place orders with us over the phone, and then come in at a later time to pick up their order. When the customers arrive, [Cheema's] already [has] the total price of their purchase calculated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12). Since the purchases are pre-tallied, Cheema's asserts that it is common for customers to \"make purchases beyond the meat. Oftentimes, these customers swipe their cards twice: once for the items ordered by phone, and a second time for the items picked up in-person.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Customers' Aff. \u00b6 3). In order to keep track of the large amount of phone orders placed by customers, Cheema's avers that the brothers use a notebook, replaced about every three months. (Pl. Mem. at 9-10 (referencing Cheema's most recent phone book, submitted as Ex. C and produced to the court at Docket No. 65) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     The Trafficking Investigation\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Before June of 2015, the USDA's ALERT system discovered suspect transactions from Cheema's. (DF \u00b6 51). Thereafter, FNS commenced an investigation into potential trafficking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52). FNS began by analyzing transaction data for Cheema's in the months of June, July, and August of 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On September 28, 2015, an FNS contractor visited Cheema's, where he observed Cheema's inventory and stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-53). After the store visit, Program Specialist Richard O'Toole provided his Section Chief, Gilda Torres, an analysis weighing Cheema's location, layout, storage capabilities, inventory, available equipment, the transactions tracked by the ALERT reports, and a comparison between Cheema's transactions and those of comparable stores. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54, 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following Specialist O'Toole's report, Section Chief Torres sent Farhat Cheema and Rifat Cheema a \"Charge Letter\" explaining the investigation and charging Cheema's with SNAP benefit trafficking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56, 57). The letter informed the brothers that the Agency was considering disqualifying Cheema's from SNAP as a result of the alleged conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Charge Letter detailed the suspicious transactions underlying the decision, and grouped suspicious activity into four categories. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58). The trafficking charge was based on: (1) multiple transactions made too rapidly to be credible; (2) multiple transactions made from individual accounts in short time frames; (3) transactions where all or most of an allotment of benefits were used in a short time frame; and (4) unusually large transactions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Charge Letter accused Cheema's of 830 individual violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70). The Charge Letter allowed for Cheema's to submit evidence combatting the allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71). Cheema's responded with two fax submissions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In responding to the allegations, Cheema's alleged that: (1) the store was exceptionally busy during the period they were under review because of the Muslim holy months of Ramzan and Haj; (2) Cheema's credit card sales were more than twice\n   that of EBT transactions; (3) many Somali customers order by phone and then pick up their orders in the store; (4) many customers who swipe their EBT cards realize they have a balance and make another transaction; (5) some of Cheema's customers travel long distances for Cheema's goods and buy groceries at once for the entire month; and (6) customers often shop in groups and swipe the same card for multiple purchases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74; A.R. 100-101). Cheema's also submitted credit card statements for the months of the investigation to support their claims. (DF \u00b6 75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After submitting their objections to the allegations and associated evidence, Mr. Rifat Cheema spoke with Specialist O'Toole who requested copies of meat invoices and records of telephone orders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-78). Cheema's provided the meat invoices and, after a subsequent request from Specialist O'Toole, also submitted non-meat invoices for review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79-81). It does not appear from the record that Cheema's ever submitted the requested phone evidence for review. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84). Cheema's now submits a more recent notebook of phone orders as an example of how Cheema's tracks phone orders and the type of volume the store experiences. (Docket No. 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Agency reviewed Cheema's submitted responses and evidence,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and ultimately concluded that the rendered explanations failed to explain the suspicious transactions. (DF \u00b6 83). Specifically, the Agency found that the evidence did not support the proffered statement that Cheema's received 15-20 phone orders each day, and did not refute the Agency's conclusions that the store's small checkout counter and lack of carts for customers did not support the contention that large purchases were frequently made, that the store's lack of scanners did not support the idea that multiple large purchases could be completed in quick succession, that the holy months did not explain the high sales in August of 2015, that the store's EBT transaction amounts during the holy months matched those of other months during the year, that Cheema's assertion that many customers traveled long distances to pick up groceries was not credible, that the physical storage space and observed inventory did not support the assertion that most of Cheema's sales were of fresh meat, and finally that Cheema's reported inventory did not account for Cheema's actual reported sales. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84-104). The Agency concluded that it was more likely than not that Cheema's had engaged in trafficking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On April 27, 2016, FNS sent Cheema's a letter including its decision and disqualifying Cheema's from SNAP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109). The plaintiff requested review of the decision by FNS' Administrative Review Branch (\"ARB\") on May 3, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113). ARO Ronald Gwinn was assigned to the case and asked the plaintiff for information in support of Cheema's position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115). He informed Cheema's that if such documentation was not provided within a three-week period, no review would occur. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Cheema's did not submit the requested information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116). ARO Gwinn reviewed the case nonetheless and determined that it was more likely true than not that Cheema's had engaged in trafficking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117). The final Agency decision affirmed the disqualification of Cheema's from SNAP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Cheema's filed their Second Amended Complaint in federal court on September\n   11, 2017. (Docket No. 23). Therein, Cheema's sought \"\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the USDA's Final Agency Determination and request[ed] that the Court reverse the determination barring [Cheema's] from the SNAP program as an authorized retailer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). The USDA filed the Motion for Summary Judgment on August 22, 2018. (Docket No. 52).

In support thereof, Cheema's first asserts that \"[l]arge, rapid transactions are [ ] explained by the fact that many EBT shoppers carpooled and/or shopped in large groups at Cheema's.\" (Pl. Mem. at 23). Cheema's also disputes the USDA's related conclusions drawn from the physical store, arguing that \"[t]he counter space and store size of Cheema's are perfectly sufficient to accommodate the business model of serving primarily fresh and frozen meat at Cheema's.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In making these arguments, Cheema's relies on its submitted Customers' Affidavit, through which affiants explain that \"[o]ftentimes, either I would carpool, or I would observe other individuals carpooling, in order to shop at Cheema's in large groups.\" (Customers' Aff. \u00b6 7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, it is not clear to the court exactly how shopping in large groups explains repetitive large transactions when a store clerk would be required to tally items between each purchase regardless of crowd size.

Cheema's has not come forward with specific and credible evidence to show the court that a genuine issue exists as to whether such shopping practices regularly occurred at Cheema's. Moreover, Cheema's has not demonstrated for the court exactly how such practices explain the 62 transactions submitted to the court by the government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Cheema's next attempts to rebut the Agency's data evidence by claiming that large amounts of orders are placed over the phone and are pre-tallied, allowing for large orders to be rung up quickly. As evidence, Cheema's does not submit records of phone orders from the review period, but instead submits a recent phone order book containing entries Cheema's claims are \"substantially similar to the phone order notebook from the months in question.\" (Pl. Mem. at 10 (referring to Ex. C (Docket No. 65) ) ). Those records, most of which are not legible, lack important indicators such as time, date, and payment method used for each of the orders. Moreover, even if the court were to accept the records as evidence of high phone order volume, Cheema's submits no evidence showing that these phone orders actually resulted in rapid transactions, or transactions involving hundreds of dollars, or otherwise explaining the government's data.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Cheema's also relies on its Owners' Affidavit for this phone order argument. Therein, the Cheema brothers aver that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   Many of our customers place orders with us over the phone, and then come in at a later time to pick up their order. When the customers arrive, we already have the total price of their purchase calculated. While coming into the store to pick up their order, customers often make purchases beyond the meat. Oftentimes, these customers swipe their cards twice: once for the items ordered by phone, and a second time for the items picked up in-person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Owners' Aff. \u00b6 12). This generalized claim is not enough to survive summary judgment and, as addressed above, Cheema's submits no further evidence linking the alleged large volumes of phone orders to quickly successive transactions at the store, and has not explained how placing orders ahead of time speeds up the checkout of the individual purchases to the extent indicated by defendant's data. In addition, Cheema's fails to demonstrate for the court how the submitted order book sufficiently explains this theory from their affidavit. The indication that orders are currently made over the phone, coupled with general assertions about customer behavior, does not sufficiently show that Cheema's can rebut the defendant's evidence of suspiciously rapid, large transactions in 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Cheema's makes the argument that the phone records were not available to the government during the initial investigation, contending that such a discrepancy between that record and the one before this court warrants a denial of summary judgment. (Pl. Mem. at 9 (\"While the logistics of SNAP transactions are certain to be a factor, it becomes far less of a deterrent to Cheema's model of operation if the phone orders placed ahead of time are taken into account, which ARO Gwinn did not.\") ). At oral argument, the plaintiff's counsel urged the court to deny the government's motion because the existence of phone orders as a part of the plaintiff's business model created a disputed material fact. This court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This court considers the evidence before it in light of the appropriate burden placed on the parties.

(DF \u00b6 63). Fifty-one of those transactions were part of sets of purchases that occurred within a timeframe of ten minutes or less. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64). Similar to their argument related to the first group of transactions, Cheema's contends that these transaction sets are explained by the fact that many customers order items over the phone and then make a separate purchase of goods that they find once they arrive at the store. (Customers' Aff. \u00b6 2 (\"When purchasing groceries at Cheema's Supermarket, it would not be uncommon for me to place orders ahead of time by phone to help expedite wait time and check out process.), \u00b6 3 (\"When purchasing groceries at Cheema's Super Market [sic] that I placed an order for ahead of time, it would not be uncommon for me to make two (2) or more transactions during one (1) visit.\") ). Cheema's also explains that some customers complete two transactions because they forget items the first time around. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 26 (\"rapid transactions in these instances are indicative of customers' shopping behavior, as opposed to fraud.\") (referencing charts at Ex. D showing that some of Cheema's customers exhibited similar behavior at other stores) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   USDA questions Cheema's rationales for these patterns because in eleven of the transactions, the latter purchase was for an amount equal to or greater than the first. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DF \u00b6 124). This court is equally unconvinced by Cheema's explanations, particularly in light of the size of the second transactions in many of the sets. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , A.R. 72 transaction nos. 138, 139);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Famous Int'l Mkt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203015249\">\n    2018 WL 3015249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (\"Even if we were to disregard the size of the second transaction in relation to the first, the high dollar amount of the second purchases alone cannot support an inference the customer purchased forgotten items.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Further, the Customers' Affidavit is generalized and does not suffice to explain the sheer number of repetitive transactions from single beneficiaries. Similarly,\n   Cheema's argument that such customer behavior \"is not commonplace to Cheema's alone\" is not persuasive. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 6). Thus, Cheema's has submitted charts showing EBT customers making multiple rapid transactions at other stores besides Cheema's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Exs. A, D). However, the fact that suspicious repeat transactions occurred at different stores during the same time period as FNS' investigation of Cheema's is not credible evidence that the transactions at Cheema's were the result of normal shopping behavior instead of trafficking, nor does it make the ones that occurred at Cheema's any less suspect. Furthermore, the court has no context for those other transactions, and Cheema's offers no evidence of the fact that the transactions at Cheema's or at the other stores were actually legitimate SNAP purchases despite their suspicious appearance. Cheema's assertion that the transactions at other stores were never investigated is neither corroborated nor determinative of the nature of the Cheema's transactions in question here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (\"The chart analysis clearly shows analogous purchase patterns by EBT customers with no ramifications, yet Cheema's received an onerous punishment for the same patterns of operation.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In sum, Cheema's generalized statements about typical customer behavior is insufficient to establish a genuine issue of material fact. The existence of a large number of multiple transactions made from the same EBT account in a short time frame is further evidence of trafficking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    (c)\n    <em>\n     Use of Most or All of a Household's Benefits in Short Time Frames\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The USDA's third category of violations consists of 110 occasions on which individual beneficiaries used most or all of their monthly allotment in an unusually short period of time. (DF \u00b6 65). Forty-five of these 110 transactions were for the precise amount of remaining benefits in a particular account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66). FNS points to a government study to show that, in contrast, an average beneficiary takes three weeks to spend 90% of their monthly SNAP benefit allotment. (DF \u00b6 93). Cheema's contests the use of the study, arguing that \"common sense dictates that many shoppers will deviate from the average in a ten-year-old report.\" (Pl. Mem. at 26). Cheema's further argues that it has \"illustrated an ad nauseam of uncommon purchasing patterns of its patrons involving large purchases of halal meat to last weeks or months, a scenario that is uncommon in most compared stores illustrated by the Defendant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, Cheema's invokes the Customers' Affidavit wherein it is averred that \"[w]hen using my household EBT card to make purchases at Cheema's Super Market [sic], it would not be uncommon for me to spend more than half, if not all, of my monthly EBT benefits in one transaction.\" (Customers' Aff. \u00b6 6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cheema's again fails to rebut the USDA's data with concrete evidence explaining these suspect transactions. Generalized statements claiming that entire SNAP allotments are spent on purchases of monthly supplies of meat is not sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact regarding these 110 alleged violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The instant situation is virtually identical to the facts in\n   <em>\n    Irobe\n   </em>\n   , where the First Circuit affirmed a grant of summary judgment for the government despite similar assertions by the affected store. As the Court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Indeed, the Store relies almost entirely on Irobe's deposition testimony, in which he offered generalized, non-specific observations about his customers' shopping habits. He testified, for example, that his customers sometimes would purchase expensive items (such as goat or camel meat) or buy rice in bulk. This testimony, the Store argues, creates a genuine dispute about whether the 205 EBT transactions exceeding $ 174 were for SNAP-eligible foodstuffs.... These arguments lack force in the face of the ample transactional data. It is common ground that the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position is not enough to ward off summary judgment. Where the plaintiff has the burden of proof, there must be evidence on which the factfinder could reasonably find for the plaintiff. There is no such evidence here - and generalized conclusions, such as Irobe has proffered, cannot fill the void.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Irobe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516951\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/371/#p376\">\n    890 F.3d at 380-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotations omitted). Similarly here, the generalized comments in Cheema's briefing and as produced by way of affidavit are not enough to show a credible rebuttal to the USDA's transaction data. The fact that the court in\n   <em>\n    Irobe\n   </em>\n   had only the owner's deposition whereas Cheema's has submitted affidavits from both the owners and customers does not change this analysis since these affidavits are similarly very generalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    (d)\n    <em>\n     Unusually Large Transactions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The USDA's final set of suspect transactions consists of 596 EBT transactions during the review period of over $ 47 each, which the USDA deems abnormally large. (DF \u00b6 67). Of these, 437 were for over $ 100. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68). FNS compared Cheema's transaction data with that of other similar stores. The government observed that \"a review of the average monthly transactions at Cheema's as compared to other stores that sell Halal meats reveals that, during June, July and August of 2015, Cheema's shoppers spent more than\n   <em>\n    double\n   </em>\n   per transaction than shoppers spent at any other store.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127 (emphasis in original) (showing that while Cheema's average transaction was $ 134.99, other stores which sold Halal meat averaged $ 50, $ 35.28, $ 54.31, $ 40.12 and $ 37.86) ). Moreover, when compared generally to other markets classified as medium grocery stores, Cheema's transaction data showed sales of over 300% the average purchase amount. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 126).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Cheema's responds to this data by arguing that it was compared to inappropriate stores. (Pl. Mem. at 26-27 (\"While the inventory may have indicated that status as a 'medium' grocery store was warranted, the amount of meat sold per week should have warranted classification as a specialty store, which would then compare Cheema's revenue to more reasonably comparable figures.\") ). However, Cheema's does not provide the court with data from such specialty stores showing that Cheema's numbers would be appropriate, even if classified into that category. Cheema's simply claims that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   [a] specialty store, as defined by FNS, is a food store 'specializing in the sale of meat products ... [which] [m]ay also carry non-food items or other food items, but such stock is incidental to the primary specialty food stock.' Such a description may better suit Cheema's, in light of the disputed fact that 70% of Cheema's sales are for halal meat products, and it negates the Defendant's comparison to area MGs of similar ethnic offerings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27). This bald assertion, without more, is insufficient to negate the government's comparison to other stores selling Halal meat and does not demonstrate that\n   Cheema's large transactions are typical of such a specialty store.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Famous Int'l Mkt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203015249\">\n    2018 WL 3015249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 (\"Even assuming the Market is well-stocked and offers international foods, the Market does not adduce specific evidence addressing why its EBT transaction data differs so greatly from the comparison stores when the comparison stores carry roughly the same inventory.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   At oral argument, Cheema's attorney argued that the comparisons between Cheema's and the other grocery stores was unfair because Cheema's was compared to stores like Stop &amp; Shop and BJ's which do not carry specialty Halal meat. The point misses the comparison at issue. The government did indeed reference purchases at Stop &amp; Shop and BJs in arguing that the purchases at Cheema's were suspiciously large. However, the government makes that comparison to show that \"individuals shopping at Cheema's shopped at other larger or comparable stores during the relevant time period, and spent far less money.\" (Def. Mem. (Docket No. 53) at 17). That inter-customer comparison is separate and apart from the USDA's argument that the individual transactions at Cheema's exceeded those at both other stores selling Halal meat and other stores within Cheema's classification category of medium grocery store. Cheema's has not submitted evidence to show that the government's comparison to average sales at those stores was inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Cheema's next attempts to explain the large transactions as a result of purchases surrounding certain holidays. (Pl. Mem. at 27 (\"many of the purchase dates for the large transactions correlate with delivery dates of hundreds to thousands of pounds of meat, and/or correlate with the religious and cultural holidays recognized by the vast majority of Cheema's customers. Not only did many of the customers spend comparable amounts at other Halal stores, but most made quite significant transactions at non-halal stores.\") ). First, if customers are indeed spending large amounts at other Halal stores and non-Halal stores during this time of the year, this fact contradicts Cheema's assertion that its customers buy monthly groceries in bulk at Cheema's. Second, FNS found during its investigation that \"[SNAP] redemptions during the review period (June, July and August of 2015) were not significantly different from those [at Cheema's] in non-holiday months outside the review period.\" (DF \u00b6 96). This contradicts Cheema's claim that the holidays created irregular transaction patterns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Cheema's next argues that \"[b]y looking at the receipts for when Cheema's purchased [its] meat, and then viewing customer purchases within the next one to two days, it becomes clear that these excessively large purchases originate around the time that Cheema's received fresh meat deliveries.\" (Pl. Mem. at 12). The Cheema brothers aver in the Owners' Affidavit that \"[d]eliveries of both fresh and frozen meat are made one to three times per week to [the] store.\" (Owners' Aff. \u00b6 7). Cheema's, however, submits no specific evidence to show that this is true. In fact, Cheema's contends, without evidentiary citation, that \"[w]hile there are 596 claims of 'excessively large purchases,' 494 of these occurred either on the date of the fresh meat delivery, or within the two days after, or within two days of the Fourth of July for any festivities occurring after sundown. This leaves merely 100 large purchases that do not correlate with delivery dates or the Fourth of July. Many of them correlate with religious holiday dates.\" (Pl. Mem. at 12-13). As stated above, Cheema's has not submitted sufficient evidence to give credence to the claim that the holidays were a driving force behind the large transactions in the review period. Thus, even accepting Cheema's claim regarding purchases near delivery dates to be true,\n   there remain approximately 100 uncontested alleged violations, more than enough to warrant the USDA's charge. In addition, this argument ignores the Agency's finding that the refrigeration space was insufficient to store thousands of dollars of fresh meat per day, as Cheema's contends. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DF \u00b6 85).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Cheema's further defends the high value transactions by claiming that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [o]n average, much of our inventory is sold at a significant markup due to the nature/designation of the specialty foods that we provide to our customers. Upon information and belief, Middle Eastern foods/brands often cost substantially more to ship to supermarkets than more commonplace food items. On average during the months in question, our store sold chicken at a 69% markup, beef at an 81.5% markup, lamb at a 26.5% [markup], and goat at a 20% markup.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   (Owners' Aff. \u00b6 10). FNS had initially assumed a 40% markup on goods in estimating that, based on Cheema's submitted invoices, the store had an inventory during the review period of $ 274,307.46 worth of product. (DF \u00b6 102). The actual amount of sales were $ 113,148.62 in SNAP benefits and $ 310,007.10 in credit card sales, for a total amount of $ 423,155.72, exclusive of cash sales. (DF \u00b6 103). In making the claim that the 40% markup estimate was too low, Cheema's fails to show that the higher markup sufficiently explains the serious discrepancy in projected and actual sales, or how it accounts for specific instances of unusually high purchases. Thus, the claim from Cheema's owners that Cheema's meat is more expensive than the government assumes is not enough to create a genuine issue on summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Famous Int'l Mkt.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203015249\">\n    2018 WL 3015249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 (\"The Market's vague and generalized argument 'some combination' of its food offering, inventory, and pricing justifies the 400 large transactions at issue is insufficient to refute the EBT data and create a genuine issue of material fact.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Cheema's also contests the above government calculations by asserting that the government's tabulation of available inventory was lacking because it excluded invoices Cheema's could have provided absent bad record keeping efforts. Cheema's has proffered the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   The Agency's consideration that Cheema's failure to demonstrate inventory for nearly $ 150,000 in sales over a three month period as indicative of trafficking is conjecture. The Agency's argument assumes that failing to include a large number of invoices equates to trafficking. On the contrary, had Cheema's kept better records of their invoices, the records would have shown inventory for the $ 150,000 in sales that the Agency has flagged as potential trafficking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (Pl. Mem. at 7 (internal citations omitted) ). This argument does purport to address the fact that sales generally exceeded the government's estimation of inventory. The numbers presented by Cheema's show Cheema's credit card sales alone ($ 310,007.10) surpass the government's expected sale potential based on store inventory ($ 274,307.46). However, Cheema's has neither produced invoices explaining the government's miscalculations nor submitted evidence of inventories for other time periods similar to the one under investigation for the court to consider by comparison. Cheema's assertion that bad record keeping explains the apparent lack of inventory for the amount of sales and high value transactions Cheema's experienced ignores the burden placed on Cheema's at this stage in this proceeding. In light of the set of high volume transactions produced by the government, it is Cheema's burden to rebut the suspicion that arises therefrom with sufficient evidence. Had\n   Cheema's submitted invoices to this court showing its ability to sell at such a volume, that evidence may have been enough to survive summary judgment on this set of transactions. However, the assertion that Cheema's failed to maintain those records, without more, is insufficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Irobe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516951\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/890/371/#p376\">\n    890 F.3d at 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A store is in the best position to show what actually happens on its premises.
