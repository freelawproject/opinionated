The \"local controversy exception\" does not apply because\n    <em>\n     Ictech-Bendeck\n    </em>\n    was an earlier class action filed asserting similar allegations against almost all of the same defendants on behalf of a nearly-identical class.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under the \"local controversy exception,\" a district must decline jurisdiction if the following conditions are met:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (i) [the] class action [is one] in which--\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (I) greater than two-thirds of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate are citizens of the State in which the action was originally filed;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (II) at least 1 defendant is a defendant--\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (aa) from whom significant relief is sought by members of the plaintiff class;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (bb) whose alleged conduct forms a significant basis for the claims asserted by the proposed plaintiff class; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (cc) who is a citizen of the State in which the action was originally filed; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (III) principal injuries resulting from the alleged conduct or any related conduct of each defendant were incurred in the State in which the action was originally filed; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (ii) during the 3-year period preceding the filing of that class action, no other class action has been filed asserting the same or similar factual allegations against any of the defendants on behalf of the same or other persons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"[T]he exception is intended to be narrow, 'with all doubts resolved in favor of exercising jurisdiction over the case.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court considers the final prong of the local controversy exception under which a court must exercise jurisdiction if, during the three-year period preceding the filing of suit, another class action has been filed \"asserting the same or similar factual allegations against any of the defendants on behalf of the same or other persons.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Senate Report accompanying CAFA explains this exception as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The fourth and final criterion is that no other class action involving similar allegations has been filed against any of the defendants over the last three years on behalf of the same or other persons. In other words, if a controversy results in the filing of multiple class actions, it is a strong signal that those cases may not be of the variety that this exception is intended to address. As such, it is a test for assessing whether a controversy is localized. The Committee wishes to stress that another purpose of this criterion is to ensure that overlapping or competing class actions or class actions making similar factual allegations against the same defendant that would\n   benefit from coordination are not excluded from federal court by the Local Controversy Exception and thus placed beyond the coordinating authority of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. The Committee also wishes to stress that the inquiry under this criterion should not be whether identical (or nearly identical) class actions have been filed. The inquiry is whether similar factual allegations have been made against the defendant in multiple class actions, regardless of whether the same causes of actions were asserted or whether the purported plaintiff classes were the same (or even overlapped in significant respects).\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Ictech-Bendeck\n   </em>\n   action was filed on July 25, 2018, five days before Plaintiff filed this case on July 30, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Like the instant case,\n   <em>\n    Ictech-Bendeck\n   </em>\n   is a class action alleging damages from noxious odors and gases emanating from the Landfill. Jefferson Parish, Aptim Corp., and two of the three Waste Connections Defendants named in the instant case also are defendants in\n   <em>\n    Ictech-Bendeck\n   </em>\n   . The proposed plaintiff class in\n   <em>\n    Ictech-Bendeck\n   </em>\n   is nearly identical, including all Jefferson Parish domiciliaries \"who sustained legally cognizable damages in the form of nuisance, interference with the enjoyment of their properties and/or diminution in value of their properties\" because of the emissions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants, the proposed classes, and the allegations in the cases are nearly identical in the two cases. The local controversy exception does not apply to the instant case because another class action asserting similar allegations was filed against the same defendants on behalf of a largely identical class. Furthermore, the fact that this Court has not remanded\n   <em>\n    Ictech-Bendeck\n   </em>\n   to state court has no bearing on whether the final prong of the local controversy exception applies to the instant case. The statute does not require that the earlier action be heard in federal or state court. CAFA's policy considerations, including the instruction that exceptions to CAFA jurisdiction are to be narrowly construed, also weigh in favor of exercising jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff argues that, for purposes of the local controversy exception, this case and\n   <em>\n    Ictech-Bendeck\n   </em>\n   are \"the same lawsuit\" because, while the instant case was pending in state court, she \"began to take steps toward consolidating\" it with\n   <em>\n    Ictech-Bendeck\n   </em>\n   and that, had this case not been removed to this Court, \"the two proposed class actions would be one.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, consolidation did not occur. Second, \"[u]nder Louisiana law, '[c]onsolidation of actions is a procedural convenience designed to avoid multiplicity of actions and does not cause a case to lose its status as a procedural entity.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even had this case been consolidated with\n   <em>\n    Ictech-Bendeck\n   </em>\n   , it would still be another class action asserting similar allegations against common defendants, for purposes of the local controversy exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In further support of her argument that the Court should consider the instant case as part of the same case as\n   <em>\n    Ictech-Bendeck\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    Vodenichar v. Halcon Energy Properties, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , a Third Circuit decision interpreting the final prong of the local controversy exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Vodenichar\n   </em>\n   is inapposite. In that case, the plaintiffs first filed an action invoking the court's\n   diversity jurisdiction under \u00a7 1332(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs dismissed the first action voluntarily and refiled the action in federal court, joining two local defendants that would destroy complete diversity, but invoking the court's jurisdiction under CAFA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Third Circuit held the second action was part of the same case as the first action because it was a \"continuation of the first filed action\" and \"[t]he same representative plaintiffs filed two complaints on behalf of an identically-defined putative class arising from the same factual allegations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   The instant case and\n   <em>\n    Ictech-Bendeck\n   </em>\n   involve different representative plaintiffs, and the classes and named defendants are not identical. The instant case is not a continuation of\n   <em>\n    Ictech-Bendeck\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court's ruling is consistent with the legislative history of CAFA. Congress stated that one purpose of the requirement that no similar class action have been filed in the three years preceding an action \"is to ensure that overlapping or competing class actions or class actions making similar factual allegations against the same defendant that would benefit from coordination are not excluded from federal court by the Local Controversy Exception.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court has jurisdiction over\n   <em>\n    Ictech-Bendeck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   and exercising jurisdiction over the instant case will permit both actions to benefit from coordination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because\n   <em>\n    Ictech-Bendeck\n   </em>\n   was filed before the instant case, the local controversy exception does not apply. The Court need not analyze the other prongs of the exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
