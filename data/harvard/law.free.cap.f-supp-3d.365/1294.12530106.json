With respect to those sales for which Plaintiff procured domestic inland freight from unaffiliated freight providers, Commerce determined that there was \"no information to establish the percentage of freight charges that were provided by unaffiliated [versus] affiliated suppliers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.

Commerce has not articulated any justification for this application of AFA and the court cannot provide a justification for the agency. Consequently, the court will remand this limited aspect of Commerce's application of AFA to the agency for reconsideration or further explanation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Hyundai Steel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526065\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/319/1327/#p1357\">\n    319 F.Supp.3d at 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court ordered Commerce to \"reconsider or\n   further explain its application of AFA for domestic inland freight expenses on transactions that incurred no foreign inland freight and on transactions for which domestic inland freight was provided by an unaffiliated freight provider.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526065\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/319/1327/#p1357\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526065\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/319/1327/#p1357\">\n    at 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On remand, Commerce found its use of AFA in connection with transactions that incurred no foreign inland freight to be inappropriate and explained that, with regard to the use of unaffiliated freight providers, Hyundai Steel had not documented which sales, or what percentage of sales, used an unaffiliated freight provider. Remand Redetermination at 6-8. Thus, in compliance with the remand order, Commerce reconsidered and further explained its use of AFA concerning domestic inland freight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Substantial evidence supports Commerce's finding that the record did not establish for which sales, or what percentage of freight services, Hyundai Steel used unaffiliated freight providers. In its Section C questionnaire response, Plaintiff reported that during the period of investigation (\"POI\"), it \"transported merchandise by truck using an affiliated general logistics company, [Plaintiff's affiliate],\" and that it \"calculated the freight expenses amounts based on the contract prices [Plaintiff's affiliate] charged during the POI.\" Sec. C Resp. at C-27. Plaintiff did not indicate that its affiliate provided freight services only for the Suncheon plant, nor did Plaintiff reference any unaffiliated freight providers in this narrative response. This statement led Commerce to find that Plaintiff's affiliated freight provider was involved in U.S. sales for merchandise shipped from both the Suncheon and Dangjin plants to the port of exportation. Remand Redetermination at 7 &amp; nn.36-37 (citing Sec. C Resp. at C-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Commerce recognized that Hyundai Steel may have used unaffiliated freight providers, but it could not ascertain the percentage of freight charges incurred from unaffiliated providers at either plant in order to limit the AFA adjustment accordingly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526065\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/319/1327/#p1357\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7 &amp; nn.33-34 (citing Sec.

Plaintiff references a finding in the verification report wherein Commerce noted that \"[Hyundai Steel] stated the only non-[Plaintiff's affiliate] freight provision involved the freight from the Dangjin plant to the Dangjin port.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526065\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/319/1327/#p1357\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 12 (citing Hyundai Steel Sales Verification Report (May 26, 2016) (\"Sales Verification Report\") at 39, CR 598, PR 347, CRJA Tab 13, PRJA Tab 13). This statement, however, concerned a single sample sale. Sales Verification Report at 39. As Plaintiff acknowledges, Commerce did not verify that Plaintiff used unaffiliated freight providers for all shipments from the Dangjin plant to the port.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n Cmts. at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Similarly, Plaintiff points to sample freight documentation that it provided to Commerce in Exhibit S-26 of its supplemental section B and C questionnaire response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9, 10. That exhibit was submitted in response to Commerce's request for documentation regarding Plaintiff's freight transactions\n   <em>\n    with Plaintiff's affiliated freight provider\n   </em>\n   for shipments of subject merchandise from each plant to each port of exportation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl.

S-26. In any case, the record evidence indicating that Hyundai Steel's affiliated freight provider was involved in some shipments from both plants, combined with a lack of documentation of what percentage of shipments utilized unaffiliated freight providers, is sufficient to support Commerce's determination that it could not adjust its use of AFA to account for the use of unaffiliated freight providers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

With respect to the U.S. market, Plaintiff made sales through three channels of distribution: EP sales through unaffiliated Korean distributors (Channel 1); CEP sales through its affiliates-Hyundai Steel America, Hyundai Corporation, and HCUSA-to unaffiliated processors (Channel 2); and CEP sales through its affiliate Hyundai Steel America to unaffiliated and affiliated processors (Channel 3).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff performed selling functions in all four categories at the same relative level of intensity for its U.S. sales through Channels 1 and 3.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.401\">\n    at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Commerce explained that although it had concluded in the\n   <em>\n    Final Determination\n   </em>\n   that, for Channel 2 sales, Plaintiff did not provide selling functions in the fourth category-warranty and technical support-on remand, it found that Plaintiff \"did, in fact, report that it provided technical assistance for its Channel 2 U.S. sales, as well as its Channel 1 and Channel 3 U.S. sales.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.
