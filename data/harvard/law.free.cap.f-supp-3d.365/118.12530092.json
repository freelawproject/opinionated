INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This action seeks to compel a federal agency, Defendant U.S. Chemical and\n   Safety Hazard Investigation Board (\"CSB\" or \"the Board\"), to promulgate regulations requiring persons to report accidental chemical releases to the CSB. The CSB does not deny that its enabling statute requires the agency to so act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207412\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (r)(6)(C)(iii). Instead, it advances two contentions to fend off Plaintiffs' suit. First, the CSB vigorously asserts that Plaintiffs lack standing to sue. Second, the CSB half-heartedly maintains that the agency's inaction has not been \"unreasonably delayed,\" even though nearly 30 years have passed since Congress enacted the CSB's enabling statute. The court finds neither argument has merit. Accordingly, the court grants judgment in favor of Plaintiffs. As relief, the court directs the CSB to promulgate reporting regulations within 12 months of the date of the court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Accidental Release Reporting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Congress established the CSB by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207412\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (r)(6). Congress modeled the CSB on the \"structure, activities and authorities of the National Transportation Safety Board.\" S. REP. NO. 101-228 at 228 (1989). The agency's mission is to investigate certain types of accidental chemical releases and to propose safety measures \"to reduce the likelihood or the consequences of accidental releases.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207412\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (r)(6)(i), (ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   To facilitate that mission, Congress directed the CSB to promulgate certain reporting requirements concerning accidental chemical releases. The agency's enabling statute provides: The Board \"shall\" \"establish by regulation requirements binding on persons for reporting accidental releases into the ambient air subject to the Board's investigatory jurisdiction.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207412\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (r)(6)(C)(iii). The Board does not dispute that the quoted provision imposes an affirmative obligation to adopt reporting regulations. Yet, since beginning its operations in 1998, the CSB has not done as Congress directed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ten years ago, the agency did take a step towards developing regulations, but ultimately that effort came up empty.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chemical Release Reporting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Fed.%20Reg.%2030%2C259\">\n    74 Fed.

As support, they point to section 7412(r)(6)(Q) of the CSB's enabling act, which provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   any records, reports or information obtained by the Board shall be available to ... the public, except that upon a showing satisfactory to the Board by any person that records, reports, or information, or particular part thereof (other than release or emissions data) to which the Board has access, if made public, is likely to cause substantial harm to the person's competitive position ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207412\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (r)(6)(Q). There can be little doubt that, on its face, the statute presumptively would make public any \"records, reports or information obtained by the Board\" as a result of a mandatory reporting requirement of accidental chemical releases. Plaintiffs' assertion of informational standing-they are injured because they cannot access information that the statute mandates the agency collect and then make available-therefore would appear to be straightforward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   But not so, says the CSB. It takes a narrow view of the Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit decisions in which informational standing has been recognized. According to the CSB, \"[t]he common thread in these cases is that Congress imposed an obligation on the agency to take\n   <em>\n    affirmative actions\n   </em>\n   to disclose the documents at issue to the public and prescribed certain steps that must be taken.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply, ECF No. 28 [hereinafter Def.'s Reply] at 5 (emphasis in original).

Unlike\n   <em>\n    PETA\n   </em>\n   , this case does not involve a question of voluntarily production. Rather, under Plaintiffs' reading of the law, the CSB would be required to make public information collected through a mandatory accidental-release reporting requirement. If the denial of voluntarily produced information can result in a sufficiently concrete injury in fact, then surely Plaintiffs' claimed denial of information that, by statute, the CSB must produce qualifies as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Board's attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    PETA\n   </em>\n   falls flat. It argues that \"the parties in\n   <em>\n    PETA\n   </em>\n   do not appear to have contested whether the AWA and its implementing regulations gave PETA a legal right to disclosure of inspection Reports.\" Def.'s Reply at 7. Whether the parties contested that issue or not misses the point. The court in\n   <em>\n    PETA\n   </em>\n   considered and recognized that there was no legal right to disclosure, but nevertheless held that PETA had standing to sue to compel the agency to promulgate regulations that in turn would cause the agency to voluntarily produce information.

Although members of LBB lack some of the governing authority found in some other membership organizations, that fact is not fatal. At least a subset of members-Board Members and the Executive Director-do exercise the governance function of the organization. Additionally, members fund the organization through voluntary contributions. And there can be little doubt that LBB's fortunes are tied to those of its constituency. These qualities are sufficient to qualify LBB for associational standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The question remains whether the members of LBB \"would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right.\" Plaintiffs argue that LBB's Executive Director, Anne Rolfes, who is a member, at least has standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

The APA provides that courts \"shall compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1). Plaintiffs assert that the CSB's failure to promulgate accidental release-reporting regulations constitutes both \"unlawfully withheld\" and \"unreasonably delayed\" agency action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 33, 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   To compel agency action that is \"unlawfully withheld,\" a plaintiff must demonstrate \"that an agency failed to take a\n   <em>\n    discrete\n   </em>\n   agency action that it is\n   <em>\n    required to take.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/#p64\">\n    542 U.S. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 64,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/#p64\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/#p64\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). The Supreme Court has recognized that \"a specific statutory command requiring an agency to promulgate regulations by a certain date\" qualifies as a \"discrete agency action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/#p64\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/#p64\">\n    at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5858295\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/55/#p64\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, although the CSB's enabling act does not require the agency to establish reporting regulations by a date certain, there can be no doubt that the congressional directive to adopt such regulations is a discrete act that the CSB is required to take. In the past, the CSB readily conceded that \"a reporting regulation is clearly required by the statute.\" Chemical Release Reporting at 30,260. It does not contend otherwise now. Accordingly, the court finds in favor of Plaintiffs on their APA claim based on the CSB's unlawful withholding of agency action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The court also finds that the Board's inaction with regard to reporting regulations has been \"unreasonably delayed.\" The D.C. Circuit has identified multiple factors relevant to deciding whether an agency's delay is unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Telecomms. Research &amp; Action Ctr. v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3805818,6561307,628886\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/750/70/\">\n    750 F.2d 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 79 (D.C. Cir. 1984). But in this case the court need not dwell on those factors, because the D.C. Circuit has\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   held that a delay of the magnitude present here-more than 20 years-can be reasonable. To the contrary, the D.C. Circuit has found far less time to constitute an unreasonable delay. For example, in\n   <em>\n    In re American Rivers &amp; Idaho Rivers United\n   </em>\n   , the court stated that \"a reasonable time for agency action is typically counted in weeks or months, not years,\" and found that a six-year delay in responding to a rulemaking petition was unreasonable.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3429033,9232451\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/413/\">\n    372 F.3d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 419 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Midwest Gas Users Ass'n v. F.E.R.C.\n   </em>\n   , the court noted \"generally that a reasonable time for an agency decision could encompass months, occasionally a year or two, but not several years or a decade,' \" and held that four years was unreasonable delay.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332790,10544862\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/833/341/\">\n    833 F.2d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 359 (D.C.

Cir. 1980) ). And, in\n   <em>\n    Nader v. F.C.C.\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit declared that \"nine years should be enough time for any agency to decide almost any issue.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695109,1116685\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/520/182/\">\n    520 F.2d 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 206 (D.C. Cir. 1975). Under this precedent, twenty years of inaction is not merely unreasonable; it is an\n   egregious abdication of a statutory obligation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pub. Citizen Health Research Grp. v. Auchter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641401,1847901\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/1150/\">\n    702 F.2d 1150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1157 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (stating that delays \"are less tolerable when human lives are at stake\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The CSB's only justification for its inaction is that it is \"a small agency with very limited resources\" that has \"prioritized its investigatory activities over [ ] rulemaking.\" Def.'s Mem at 21. But, if that is the case, the solution to its resource constraints is not to ignore a congressional directive. It is to return to Congress and ask for relief from the statutory requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Having found the CSB in violation of the APA, the question remains as to the appropriate remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cobell v. Norton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11140530,3677773\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/240/1081/\">\n    240 F.3d 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1108 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (stating that \"the district court has substantial ability to order that relief which is necessary to cure [an agency's] legal transgressions\"). The CSB asks the court to allow it 24 months to sign a final rule. Def.'s Mem at 22. That request is supported with a declaration from the CSB's Executive Director of Investigations and Recommendations, Stephen Klejst.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot., Decl. of Stephen J. Klejst, ECF No. 21-3. Klejst states that \"[i]nternal estimates of time required to complete a chemical release reporting rule include approximately twelve months to issue and receive comments on a notice of proposed rule, and approximately twelve additional months from the date of closure of comments received on the notice of proposed rule to complete a final rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\u00b6\n   </em>\n   31. Klejst, however, offers no support for these assertions. They are simply conclusory. The CSB already has had 20 years to promulgate regulations. The court will not grant it two full years to do what it should have done long ago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The court will order the CSB to promulgate final accidental chemical release reporting regulations within twelve months from this date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
