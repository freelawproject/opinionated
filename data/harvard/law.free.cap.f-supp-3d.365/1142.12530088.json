For the reasons below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   both motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This is a breach of contract case brought by Plaintiff Cypress Insurance Company (\"Cypress\") as a subrogee to Microsoft Corporation (\"Microsoft\"). Dkt. # 34. During the relevant time period, from July 1, 2013 to July 1, 2014, Cypress insured Microsoft under Policy No. 1005 (the \"Microsoft Policy\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2; Dkt. # 162 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant SK Hynix America, Inc. (\"Hynix\") is an electronic memory chip supplier. Dkt. # 34 at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 11. On August 19, 2004, Hynix entered into a supplier contract with Microsoft.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. The contract, titled \"Microsoft Component Purchase Agreement\" (the \"CPA\"), has been modified by subsequent amendments, including by Amendment No. 9, dated April 1, 2013 (the \"Ninth Amendment\"). Dkt. # 154 at 4; Dkt. # 162 at 9. The Ninth Amendment concerns, in part, Microsoft's purchase of 2133 Mhz 4Gb DDR3 Dynamic Random Access Memory chips (the \"DRAM chips\") for use in its Xbox One gaming console. Dkt. # 154 at 3; Dkt. # 162 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 4, 2013, a fire occurred at a manufacturing plant in Wuxi, China, where Hynix makes a portion of the DRAM chips. Dkt. # 154 at 3; Dkt. # 162 at 12-13. After the fire, Hynix allegedly failed to comply with the terms of the CPA in providing the DRAM chips to Microsoft. Dkt. # 154 at 3. Microsoft tendered a claim to Cypress for damages resulting from the Wuxi fire under the Microsoft Policy's contingent time element provision. Dkt. # 154 at 10; Dkt. # 162 at 12. After deciding that Microsoft's claim was covered, Cypress paid Microsoft for losses up to the policy limit of $ 150 million. Dkt. # 154 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Cypress filed its original Complaint against Hynix on March 23, 2017. Dkt. # 1. On March 5, 2018, the Court gave Cypress leave to file an Amended Complaint pursuant to a stipulated motion submitted by the parties. Dkt. # 33. Cypress filed the Amended Complaint on March 6, 2018. Dkt. # 34. Sometime in March 2018, Microsoft assigned all of its rights, claims, interests, causes of action, and damages against Hynix in this matter to Cypress. Dkt. # 39-1. On September 18, 2018, Cypress filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment and on November 13, 2018, Hynix filed a Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, which were refiled per the Court's instruction on January 25, 2018.

With respect to conventional subrogation, the Microsoft Policy specifically delineates a section for subrogation; the same section also permits Microsoft to assign Cypress rights of recovery against others to the extent of a payment made under the policy: \"The Insured is required to cooperate in any subrogation proceedings. The Company may require from the Insured an assignment or other transfer of all rights of recovery against any party for loss to the extent of the Company's payment.\" Dkt. # 160-32 at 58.

Additionally, the Court's order stated that Cypress could not amend its Complaint to seek recovery as an\n   <em>\n    assignee\n   </em>\n   of Microsoft-not that Cypress could not recover as a conventional subrogee under the Microsoft Policy.

Accordingly, based on the evidence before the Court, Hynix is not entitled judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Hynix also fails to meet its burden regarding Cypress's ability to pursue its claims as an equitable subrogee. Washington's doctrine of equitable subrogation enables an insurer that has paid its insured's loss to recoup that payment from the party responsible for the loss.\n   <em>\n    Trinity Universal Ins.

Hynix claims Cypress cannot proceed as an equitable subrogee because Microsoft was not insured against the risk of Hynix breaching its contractual duties. Furthermore, Hynix believes an equitable subrogation claim is untenable because it was not responsible for the \"physical loss or damage\" to property for which Cypress paid Microsoft. Dkt. # 162 at 10-12 (\"As a threshold matter, Hynix cannot be primarily liable for the debt that was paid here because that debt was an insurance payment based on a specifically insured risk: the risk of physical loss or damage to the property of the direct supplier such as Hynix.... Since the insurance payment was indisputably based on a policy provision covering against 'physical loss or damage' to property, Cypress was required to prove that Hynix, a third party to the Microsoft insurance policy, was responsible for that physical loss or damage.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court is not able to conclude, as Hynix does, that Cypress' breach of contract claim is not covered loss under the Microsoft Policy's contingent time element provision. The provision states that Cypress will insure Microsoft for \"the Actual Loss Sustained and EXTRA EXPENSE incurred ... directly resulting from physical loss or damage of the type insured to property of the type insured at Contingent Time Element Locations ....\" Dkt. # 160-32 at 43. Covered locations include the property of \"a direct customer, supplier, contract manufacturer or contract\n   service provider to the insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44. Because the scope of coverage is not easily ascertained from the language of the policy, the Court looks to extrinsic evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Denny's Restaurants, Inc. v. Security Union Title Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787220\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/71/194/\">\n    71 Wash.App. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=859%20P.2d%20619\">\n    859 P.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 628 (1993) (permitting use of extrinsic evidence where insurance policy was ambiguous with respect to the extent of coverage for off-record title defects). Hynix offers little evidence to support its interpretation that the time element provision did not cover potential breaches of contract, such as evidence indicating the policy only covered physical loss or damage to property. Dkt. # 162 at 10-12. Instead, Hynix relies on the deposition testimony of Cypress' insurance expert who states, at best, the Microsoft Policy was not liability coverage \"for the fault of Hynix.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10; Dkt. # 165-23 at 5-6. Additionally, contrary evidence prevents the Court from granting Hynix summary judgment on whether equitable subrogation applies. Specifically, Cypress puts forth evidence showing the insurance adjusters determined the loss was covered under the Microsoft Policy and paid out based on that determination. Dkt. # 48-1 at 23-24, 30-31. Cypress also provides testimony from Hynix representatives who say Hynix would have been able to provide more DRAM chips to Microsoft but for the fire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 155-1 at 88, 107-108. Given the liberal construction of equitable subrogation generally, and in viewing the evidence in Cypress's favor, the Court will not grant summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bank of America, N.A. v.

First, Cypress argues that Hynix breached Paragraph 1.1 by failing to provide Microsoft with at least 60 million DRAM chips. Second, Cypress claims Hynix breached by failing to meet Microsoft's total demand for DRAM chips in 2013, which approached 100 million. Dkt. # 154 at 6. In support, Cypress offers admissions from Hynix stating that it failed to provide Microsoft with at least 60 million DRAM chips and did not meet Microsoft's total demand for the DRAM chips in 2013. Dkt. # 155-1 at 68-70. In addition, Cypress offers deposition testimony of Hynix representatives which purportedly confirm that Hynix never rejected any purchase orders from Microsoft, even\n   after the fire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61, 87, 98-99. Hynix responds with evidence that it provided Microsoft approximately 51 million DRAM chips, or 99 percent of the DRAM chips it had available, and concludes it did not breach the CPA given the Ninth Amendment's \"commercially reasonable efforts\" language. Dkt. # 160-23. Additionally, Hynix offers communications with Microsoft where it purportedly told Microsoft that it could not meet the forecast for Q3'13 and would be short of the total capacity target. Dkt. # 160-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As to Cypress' first contention, the Court finds the relevant provisions of the CPA and Ninth Amendment to be unambiguous.\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.

Paragraph 1.1 requires Hynix sell the DRAM chips pursuant to the terms and conditions of the CPA and also requires Hynix not restrict the supply of DRAM chips. As memorialized in the Ninth Amendment, Hynix agreed to use \"commercially reasonable efforts\" in meeting the capacity targets for the DRAM chips-60 million for Q2'13 through Q4'13. Dkt. # 155-1 at 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Therefore, the Court finds Cypress' preferred interpretation, where Hynix breaches the CPA just by supplying less than 60 million DRAM chips, would render the Ninth Amendment's \"commercial reasonable efforts\" language superfluous.\n   <em>\n    Craig Wireless Systems Ltd. v.

Accordingly, to prevail on summary judgment based on Hynix's failure to provide 60 million chips, Cypress must show Hynix failed to use commercially reasonable efforts in doing so. Whether a party has used commercially reasonable efforts is typically a question of fact.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Mount Vernon Dodge, Inc. v.

Here, Cypress points to evidence that Hynix could have set up a special task force to oversee the Microsoft project or allocated additional DRAM chips to Microsoft after the fire instead of supplying other customers. Dkt. # 155-1 at 77-78; Dkt. # 171-1 at 90. Hynix responds by pointing to evidence that it allocated 99 percent of the DRAM chips it had available to Microsoft.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. # 160-23 at 4. The disputed evidence on the issue of commercially reasonable efforts prevents summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Regarding Cypress' second contention that Hynix breached Paragraph 1.1 by failing to provide Microsoft's total demand for DRAM chips, the Court also finds summary judgment inappropriate. In analyzing the applicable terms, the Court again looks to the Ninth Amendment. The Ninth Amendment amends Paragraph 4.1 of the CPA, which governs purchase orders placed by Microsoft. It states: \"About once each month, Microsoft will provide Supplier with an updated six-(6) month rolling forecast of anticipated product requirements (the \"Forecast\"). Microsoft may increase quantities included in its Purchase Orders as indicated in the Purchase Order Flexibility below only upon receipt of Supplier's prior written consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld.... Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, including without limitation capacity restraints under Section 4.2, Supplier may not reject any Purchase Order that complies with this Agreement.\" Dkt. # 155-1 at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Cypress argues this provision permitted Microsoft to forecast and submit purchase\n   orders for any amount and that Cypress could only reject in instances such as capacity constraints. Dkt. # 168 at 17-18. Hynix objects to this interpretation and offers its communications with Microsoft as evidence; the emails show Hynix bargained for written approval for \"upside requests.\" Dkt. # 160-22. Based on this evidence, Hynix seeks declaratory relief that its only obligation was to use \"commercially reasonable efforts\" to supply 60 million DRAM chips under normal circumstances. Dkt. # 156 at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"A provision is not ambiguous merely because the parties suggest opposing meanings.\"\n   <em>\n    Paradise Orchards Gen. P'ship v.

Here, Cypress' interpretation of Paragraph 4.1 would again render the \"commercially reasonable efforts\" language superfluous. Cypress also fails to provide the Court with sufficient evidence to resolve the tension between these two provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brotherson v. Prof'l Basketball Club, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4200495\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/604/1276/#p1286\">\n    604 F.Supp.2d 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1286 (W.D. Wash. 2009) (where interpretation \"depend[s] on the use of extrinsic evidence,\" or the extrinsic evidence admits more than one \"reasonable inference,\" the court cannot interpret the contract as a purely legal matter). The same is true for Hynix. Paragraph 4.1 can reasonably be read as permitting Microsoft to forecast and order more than 60 million chips and could thus require Hynix to assume additional obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 155-1 at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Therefore, Cypress is not entitled to summary judgment on this issue.

Dkt. # 154 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court finds summary judgment inappropriate here given the ambiguity of the preceding Paragraph 4.1, as just discussed, as well as the factual dispute over the forecasts offered by Microsoft and purchase orders accepted by Hynix.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 155 at 61, 98; Dkt. # 160-7 at 12; Dkt. # 160-11; Dkt. # 160-26.

Dkt. # 156 at 24. The Court disagrees with Hynix.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    On the issue of waiver, the CPA states that no waiver will be effective unless in writing and signed by the waiving party. Dkt. # 155-1 at 29; Dkt. # 160-4 at 7. Hynix presents no evidence of a signed waiver to the Court, nor does it affirmatively show that any buffer inventory was affirmatively established.

In fact, Paragraph 7 required Hynix to establish buffer inventory prior to the first anticipated delivery.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 26. Hynix presents no material evidence in support of its interpretation that a \"capacity constraint\" relieved Hynix of establishing the buffer inventory in the first instance.

However, as Cypress evidences, the existence of a provision calling for a \"Disaster Recovery Plan\" for use in the event of\n    <em>\n     force majeure\n    </em>\n    and the fact that Hynix allocated additional DRAM chips to other customers precludes finding as a matter of law that Hynix's non-performance is entirely excusable based on commercial impracticability.

In all capital letters, the clause reads: \"To the maximum extent permitted by law, neither party will ever be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, special or exemplary damages that arise out of or relate to this Agreement.\" Dkt. # 155-1 at 35. Hynix seeks partial summary judgment on the applicability of the limitation of liability provision and argues it limits Microsoft, and thus Cypress, to direct damages only. Dkt. # 162 at 23-25.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Under Washington law, parties may limit their liability for breach of contract and the interpretation of such clauses is a matter of law.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Am.

RCWA \u00a7 62A.2-713. The Washington Revised Code includes in its definition of \"incidental damages\" any commercially reasonable charges, expenses or commissions in connection with effecting cover. RCWA \u00a7 62A.2-715 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    67A Am. Jur. 2d Sales \u00a7 1160. As for consequential damages, the statute defines it to include \"any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the seller at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise.\" RCWA \u00a7 62A.2-715. Here, the limitation of liability provision is unambiguous and disclaims liability for any incidental, consequential, punitive, special or exemplary damages that arise out of or relate to this Agreement.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=998%20P.2d%20305\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Because Cypress' claims for breach of contract plainly arise out of or relate to the CPA, it is subject to limitation of liability provision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Cypress makes two arguments in response-that it is still entitled to freight charges and miscellaneous costs as \"direct damages\" and that the Court should find limitation of liability clause unconscionable. Cypress suggests freight charges and miscellaneous costs are \"direct damages\" because they \"flow naturally from the breach of a contract.\" Dkt. # 168 at 22 (citing\n    <em>\n     Valve Corp. v. Sierra Ent. Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5534712\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/431/1091/\">\n     431 F.Supp.2d 1091\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (W.D. Wash. 2004) ). However, the Court finds Cypress' cited case for this proposition distinguishable.\n    <em>\n     Valve Corp.\n    </em>\n    involved breach of a licensing agreement, not breach of a contract for the sale of goods.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5534712\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/431/1091/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5534712\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/431/1091/\">\n     at 1101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Cypress also fails to provide evidence that the parties intended\n    \"direct damages\" to include freight charges and miscellaneous costs as opposed to the measure of damages under Section 62A.2-713.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Cypress' argument on unconscionability is similarly unpersuasive. In a purely commercial transaction, as is the case here, the fact that an unfortunate result occurs after the contracting process does not render an otherwise standard limitation of remedies clause substantively unconscionable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     M.A. Mortenson Co., Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=998%20P.2d%20305\">\n     998 P.2d at 315\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The limitation of liability clause was set forth in capital letters in the Ninth Amendment and negotiated between the parties. Dkt. # 155-1 at 35; Dkt. # 160-22. Microsoft is not an inexperienced seller and had entered into purchase agreements for almost ten years prior to the dispute. Cypress stands in the shoes of the Microsoft here and is subject to the limitation of liability clause. Hynix is entitled to summary judgment on this issue. Accordingly, Cypress may not recover any indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, special or exemplary damages.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <strong>\n     V.
