Holdcraft seeks the following relief: (1) a declaratory judgment that the ZBA decision is invalid (Count One); (2) injunctive and equitable relief, due to the harm that would result from having to remove the shed, which has been on his property since 2003 (Count Two); and (3) damages for deprivation of his property rights, due process and right to quiet enjoyment in retaliation for having exercised his federal and state right to free speech (Count Three). This Memorandum of Decision and Order addresses Defendant's Motion To Dismiss (Docket No. 7). For the reasons set forth below, that motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Facts\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On or about July 17, 2003, the ZBA granted a special permit to Holdcraft to build a shed on his property located on South Maple Street in Brookfield, Massachusetts (\"Property\"). The special permit was filed with the Town Clerk on August 18, 2003. This special permit was \"issued for a period of two years, subject to renewal for a year period upon the applicant's compliance with all the conditions in this permit on the operation of this business during the permit period.\" On June 2, 2005, the ZBA voted unanimously in favor of Holdcraft's request for an extension of the original permit. The permit granting the extension stated that: \"[t]he members of the Zoning Board of Appeal voted at their meeting ... for an extension for John Holdcraft to build a shed as agreed almost 2 years ago. The shed will be 27 feet x. 8 feet with a 36-inch-wide door. The, original agreement was 17 Jul 03. This extension is good until 31 Dec 05.\" The permit was filed with the Town Clerk on June 9, 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, Holdcraft built his shed and used it to store goods, material and products. Holdcraft was able to use the shed and the property surrounding it in quiet enjoyment until March 21, 2017 (approximately twelve years after the extension was granted) when Clarence Snyder (\"Snyder\"), a member of the Town's Board of Selectman, filed a \"Request for Zoning Enforcement\" (\"Request\") with the Brookfield Zoning Enforcement Officer (\"ZE Officer\"). Snyder asked that the ZE Officer \"order the removal, forthwith, of the business signage from the [Property].\" Snyder has no legal relation to the Property, that is, he is not an owner or abutter and does not live near the Property. Significantly, Holdcraft has maintained a sign on the Property questioning Snyder's abilities and capabilities to serve as a Selectman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response to Snyder's Request, the ZE Officer wrote back to Snyder on April 3, 2017, stating that he had inspected the Property and had imposed three specific requirements on Holdcraft regarding landscaping, signage and leaving materials outside the shed. However, the ZE Officer did\n   not order Holdcraft to remove the shed. Snyder filed an appeal of the ZE Officer's decision to the ZBA stating that the ZE Officer had failed to address the primary issue of whether the special permit had expired on December 31, 2005. He further stated: \"Please be advised that I am aggrieved by the decision and I request a public hearing on this appeal. Following the hearing, I request that the Zoning Board of Appeals grant my appeal and determine that the special permit has lapsed and the enforcement action should be taken by the ZEO to require removal of the business, shed and signage on the property.\" Snyder did not explain how he was aggrieved by the ZE Officer's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The ZBA scheduled a hearing on Snyder's complaint. In contravention of Massachusetts law, neither Holdcraft, the abutters or any other parties with an interest in the Property were notified of the hearing. The hearing was scheduled for July 19, 2017 but was continued multiple times and was ultimately held on August 16, 2017. Notice of the first two continuances (to August 1 and then to August 2, 2017) was not provided to Holdcraft, the abutters, or any other persons with a legal interest in the Property. Although Holdcraft was served with two weeks' prior notice of the final continuance to August 16, 2017, notice was not given to the abutters or any other persons with a legal interest in the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to the August 16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing date, Holdcraft's counsel sent a letter to the ZBA's counsel and Snyder's counsel pointing out perceived flaws with respect to the upcoming meeting. The letter to the ZBA's counsel noted that a ruling upholding Snyder's complaint would require Holdcraft to take down a building that has been up since 2005 and end his quiet enjoyment of the Property that has existed since the permit was granted. At the hearing, Holdcraft's counsel argued that Snyder had no standing to appeal the ZE Officer's letter ruling because he was not an abutter, had no legal interest in the Property, and was otherwise not an \"aggrieved\" party. The ZBA ruled 4 to 1 in favor of upholding Snyder's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The ZBA's decision upholding Snyder's complaint was filed with the town clerk on August 30, 2017 (the \"ZBA's Decision\"). On September 19, 2017, Holdcraft filed a complaint in state court. He attempted to have notice and a copy of the complaint brought to the clerk's office that same day. According to Holdcraft's attorney, when he reached the Town office building sometime between 3:45 and 4:00 p.m., the building itself was open, but the Town Clerk's office was closed. Holdcraft emailed the complaint to the Town's counsel that afternoon and announced that he had filed a complaint at a Board of Selectmen meeting that evening. Holdcraft states that the Town Clerk \"may\" have been at the meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Discussion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants allege that Holdcraft failed to serve a copy of his complaint on the Town Clerk within twenty days of the filing of the ZBA's Decision, as required by Mass.Gen.L. ch. 40A \u00a7 17 (\"Chapter 40A\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   They argue that the complaint must be dismissed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) because the untimeliness\n   of the appeal divests the Court of subject matter jurisdiction over his claims. They further argue that the complaint should be dismissed pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Whether Plaintiff's Complaint must be Dismissed for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants assert that Holdcraft's complaint must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) because he failed to timely appeal the ZBA's decision in accordance with Massachusetts law. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), a claim must be dismissed when the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. A motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction \"is flexible, and it can serve as a procedural vehicle for raising a variety of challenges to the court's power to hear the case.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

He then asserts that even if he failed to timely file his complaint with the Town Clerk, actual notice of the filing was accomplished: (i) when he emailed a copy of the complaint to Town counsel that day, and/or (ii) because the Town Clerk \"may\" have been present at the Board of Selectman's meeting that night when he \"announced\" that he had filed a complaint. The Plaintiff has not cited, and this Court has not found, any Massachusetts federal or state court case addressing the issue of whether an exception should be made to the notice requirement where a town clerk's office has unexpectedly closed early on the day that a zoning board appeal must be filed and I need not do so in this case. Holdcraft's counsel has filed an affidavit stating that he arrived at the Town building between 3:45 and 4:00 p.m. on\n   <em>\n    Monday\n   </em>\n   September 19, 2017 and found the Town building open, but the Town Clerk's office closed.

The relevant inquiry is whether the town clerk received actual (not speculative) notice that a complaint had been filed within the twenty-day statutory period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bingham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1011106\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/52/566/\">\n    52 Mass.

The Massachusetts statutory scheme set forth in Chapter 40A provides an adequate post-deprivation remedy for Holdcraft to challenge the ZBA's decision. Moreover, he cannot assert that he has been deprived of his due process rights simply as the result of his own failure to comply with Chapter 40A's notice requirement. Because the post-deprivation procedures in place provide a meaningful and adequate remedy, Holdcraft has failed to state a plausible claim for violation of his procedural due process rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff has also asserts that Defendants violated his constitutional rights by retaliating against him for exercising his First Amendment right of freedom of expression. In support of this claim, Holdcraft relies on the following facts stated in the complaint: (1) Holdcraft had a sign on the Property which he used to criticize Snyder's abilities as a Board of Selectmen member, (2) Snyder does not own property near or live near Holdcraft's property, and (3) Snyder was persistent in seeking enforcement of the zoning bylaws. To state a claim for violation of his First Amendment rights, a plaintiff must show: (1) that he engaged in constitutionally protected conduct, (2) he was subjected to an adverse action by the defendant, and (3) the protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse action.\n   <em>\n    D.B. v.

More specifically, in the complaint and at the hearing, Holdcraft proffered evidence that could support an allegation that Snyder, a Board of Selectmen member, may have initiated a complaint with the ZE Officer in retaliation for Holdcraft displaying a sign on his property critical of Snyder's job performance. However, he has failed to assert any factual allegations that the Defendants in this case, the Town and the ZBA, were motivated by Holdcraft's criticisms of Snyder in reaching a decision that was adverse to him. Instead, Holdcraft makes only the conclusory allegation that \"the ZBA members were obviously happy to do their Selectman's bidding.\" This blithe, unsupported assertion is insufficient to establish the necessary link between his criticism of Snyder and the ZBA's motivation in reaching its decision. Given that the Plaintiff has not provided any factual support for the conclusion that the Town and/or the ZBA took action against him due to his protected speech activities, he has failed to state a plausible claim for violation of his First Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the motion to dismiss is granted.
