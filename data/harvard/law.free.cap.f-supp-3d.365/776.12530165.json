As mayor, Ms. Jordan was empowered to vote as part of the Richardson City Council for proposals on zoning changes, among other matters.

Section 1343 criminalizes \"schemes to defraud,\" which \u00a7 1346 defines to include schemes to deprive the public of honest services. To save \u00a7 1346 from being impermissibly vague, in\n   <em>\n    Skilling v. United States\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court interpreted \"honest services\" narrowly \"to encompass only bribery and kickback schemes.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/358/\">\n    561 U.S. 358\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 412,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283,3815903\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/2896/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/358/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). The Supreme Court found this interpretation definite and consistent with congressional intent because \u00a7 1346 was \"draw[n] from federal statutes proscribing-and defining-similar crimes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/358/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/358/\">\n    at 412-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644193,12455283,3815903\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/130/2896/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fifth Circuit has since held that prosecutions for honest services wire fraud under \u00a7\u00a7 1343, 1346 may be based on violations of an underlying federal or state bribery or kickback statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But the Fifth Circuit has rejected this precise argument, reasoning that, to establish an honest services violation under \u00a7\u00a7 1343, 1346, the Government must prove that the defendant engaged in conduct amounting to the violation of\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   legal duty to not offer or accept bribes-not a particular statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Rather, this court held that, properly interpreted, 'honest services' are services owed to an employer under state law and thus, that the government must prove that the defendant deprived the employer of such services.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.
