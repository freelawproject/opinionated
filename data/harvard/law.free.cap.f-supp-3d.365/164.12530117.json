Marvic (\"Defendant\") subsequently moved to dismiss Counts I and V for failure to state a claim. (Docket No. 23).

In March 2018, Plaintiff registered the brochure with the Federal Copyright Office.

In addition, Defendant did not compensate Plaintiff for the continued use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 26, 2019, this Court stayed this litigation in light of a case pending before the Supreme Court that had the potential to be dispositive of Plaintiff's copyright claims.
