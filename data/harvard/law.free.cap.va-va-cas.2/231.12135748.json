The jury found the prisoner guilty of unlawful shooting, \u201cwith intention to maim, disfigure and disable, but not with intention to kill,\u201d and referred it to the Court to decide whether he could be punished under the Indictment. That Court decided, 1. That the Indictment was good; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>although the Statute is in the disjunctive, yet that according to the most approved authorities and precedents, the Indictment ought to lay the intention in the conjunctive.

The record of the Examining Court, which he exhibited in support of his motion, charged him with the fact of shooting <em>A. Tensor, </em>with intention to maim, disfigure, or kill, but did not call it an unlawful, or malicious shooting. The depositions spread on the record, shew it to have been an unlawful, if not a malicious shooting. The Superior Court refused to arrest the judgment, on the ground, principally, that he had been examined for the fact of which he was indicted.</p><p id=\"b260-4\">The prisoner now moved the General Court for a Writ of Error, alledging the latter ground only, as cause for reversal. The Court, however, examined the whole record, and decided:</p><p id=\"b260-7\"><em>2. </em>That the finding by the jury of a substantive offence, was sufficient, without proving all of the intentions laid.</p><p id=\"ALq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>NOTE.</em>\u2014The Court did not in this Case give its reasons in support of the two first propositions: it may not, then, be amiss to copy the opinion given on the subject by the Circuit Court, when the judgment was pronounced on the verdict. \"As to the first question, I think there is no doubt that the Indictment is good, on principle and on authority. It is true that Indictments on Penal Statutes must strictly pursue the Statute, and that the fullest description of the offence, even if in terms of a legal definition, is not sufficient, without keeping close to the expressions. This position is well illustrated by the case of a man being indicted for robbery \"in a certain King\u2019s <em>footway </em>leading from London to Islington; the prisoner was admitted to his Clergy, because the Statute describes the place as \"in or near the King\u2019s <em>highway.\u201d </em>In this Case, if the Indictment, instead of using the words \"maim, disfigure,\u201d &amp;c were to use other words conveying the same meaning, the Indictment would not be sufficient. But, in this Indictment, those words are used, and it does keep close to the words of the Statute. But it is supposed to depart from it in using the conjunctive, instead of the disjunctive, and that such variance is fatal. To shoot with intent only to disfigure, is certainly punishable under this Statute ; so with intent to <em>maim, </em>with intent to <em>disable, </em>and with intent to <em>kill; </em>and if an unlawful shooting, with either of these intents, is prohibited by the Statute, it necessarily follows, that an unlawful shooting, with <em>all </em>of these intents, is likewise prohibited. The Indictment, then, which charges all these intents, must be sufficient under the Statute, and it cannot be demurred to on that account. The authorities in support of this position are numerous. The Attorney General pointed out numerous precedents where the Statutes use the disjunctive expression, and the Indictments founded on them, the conjunctive. Cases under the Black Act, the Act against assaults, with intent to cut, spoil <em>or </em>deface clothes, and the Acts against forgery, are numerous, in which this variance occurs, and never adjudged to be fatal, but on the contrary, always supported. But the precedents under the Coventry Act, are the most important for the present purpose, because that Act is the foundation on which our own Statute against mayhems was erected. That Act uses the disjunctive expression, \"with intent, in so doing, to maim, <em>or </em>disfigure ;\" and yet the Indictments framed on that Statute have generally (perhaps universally) charged the act to be done <em>\"</em>with intent to maim <em>and </em>disfigure;\u201d and I do not perceive that any objection has ever been urged against this method since the date of its passage.\u201d The reason why this mode of indicting has been pursued, seems obvious: it is a rule of great antiquity, that the Indictment must not state the offence disjunctively, because thereby it is left uncertain what is really intended to be relied on as the accusation. The prisoner would not know how to defend himself, if not being certain what offence he is specifically charged with. Thus, to say that a prisoner forged, or caused to be forged, an instrument, is bad, because he cannot know whether he is charged with forging it himself, or causing another <em>to </em>forge it. But, to say that he forged, <em>and </em>caused it to be forged, is good, for the prisoner is informed that he is charged with both offences, and he is warned to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>prepare himself against both. In opposition, however, to these numerous precedents, a modern one (3 <em>Chitty's Crim. Law. </em>788,) is relied on. That indictment is founded on the Statute 43 <em>George </em>3, against stabbing, cutting, &amp;c. with intent to rob, <em>or </em>murder, &amp;c. or with intent to maim, disfigure, <em>or </em>disable &amp;c. That precedent prescribes a separate Count for each separate intent, and undoubtedly is a good and sustainable Indictment. It only shews, that if the Attorney General had in this case chosen to have four separate Counts for malicious shooting, and as many for unlawful shooting, such Indictment would have been good under this law: that may be the best method of counting, but it is certainly the most tedious, and does not prove that the old method of charging all the intents conjunctively in one Count, is bad.</p><p id=\"b261-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>3. Without deciding whether the record of the Examining Court proved that he had been examined for the offence of which he was indicted; yet, they decided that the objection came too late; that it could not be moved in arrest of judgment, as was previously decided in a case from Campbell Circuit Court in June, <em>1819.</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark></p><p id=\"b261-3\">The motion for a Writ of Error was, thereupon, overruled.</p><p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>The second question is settled by authorities. It is understhod to be the rule that it is enough to prove so much of the Indictment, as shews that the prisoner has committed a <em>substantive </em>crime, therein charged against him. (1 <em>Chitty, 558 </em>637-8.) In this case, the prisoner is convicted of a substantive crime; the jury have found that he is guilty of unlawful shooting, with intent to maim, disfigure and disable, and though they have negatived that part of the Indictment which charges the intent to kill; yet, as by Law, the unlawful shooting, with either intent is punishable, proof of either is sufficient, and the objection to the verdict, founded on that proof, cannot be sustained.</p><p id=\"b260-9\"><em> </em>1 <em>Chitty\u2019s Cr.
