J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aoh\">Oscar L. Edwards (Oscar) appeals a postjudgment order denying his motion to terminate child support or to reduce it to zero based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>a change of circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In response to Oscar\u2019s motion, the trial court reduced child support for his adult son, Oscar Jr., from $700 per month to $432 per month, pursuant to the statewide uniform guideline for determining child support. (Earn. Code, \u00a7 4055.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The essential issue presented is the applicability of the statutory support guideline to a competent adult child who has moved away to college.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We conclude that in these circumstances, where neither parent retains \u201cprimary physical responsibility\u201d (\u00a7 4055, subd. (b)(1)(D)) for the adult child for any percentage of time, the guideline formula, by its terms, is inapplicable. Stated another way, application of the guideline formula \u201cwould be unjust or inappropriate\u201d under the particular circumstances of this case. (\u00a7 4057, subd. (b)(5).) Therefore, the order is reversed with directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Oscar and his former spouse, Sharon R. Edwards (Sharon) were married in 1982, had a son in 1984, and were separated in 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">1. <em>The provisions for extended child support and educational support.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">In 1990, Oscar and Sharon entered into a marital settlement agreement (MSA). The MSA included a provision for extended child support beyond the age of majority, stating: \u201cSubject to the power of the court to modify the same, [Oscar] shall pay to [Sharon], as and for child support, the sum of $200 per month, payable on the 10th day of each month, said payments began on . . . March 15, 1990, and shall continue for the Minor Child until further order of this court or until he marries, dies, becomes self-supporting, emancipated,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] <em>reaches the age of 25, </em>or completes 4 years of post-secondary education, <em>whichever occurs first.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">In addition to the provision for extended child support, the MSA contained a provision for Oscar Jr.\u2019s educational support. In that regard, the MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>provided: <em>\u201c[i\\n addition, during the term of the support obligation for Minor Child, the parties shall equally share in the entire cost of books, tuition, incidental fees, living expenses for the Minor Child if he attends an accredited college, university, or private school. </em>Such obligation shall end for the Minor Child either upon completion of four years of post-secondary schooling <em>or at age 25, whichever comes first.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">2. <em>The stipulated judgment and subsequent proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">On August 7, 1990, in accordance with the terms of the MSA, the trial court entered a stipulated judgment of dissolution. At that time, the judgment required Oscar to pay Sharon $200 per month in child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">In 1991, at Sharon\u2019s request, the county became involved in enforcing Oscar\u2019s child support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">In 1998, Oscar, Sharon and the district attorney entered into a stipulated order setting child support at $400 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">In 1999, following a contested hearing, the trial court issued an order increasing Oscar\u2019s child support obligation to $700 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">3. <em>Oscar\u2019s motions to terminate and to modify child support.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">On June 12, 2003, Oscar filed another motion to terminate child support on the ground support terminated <em>by operation of law </em>when the minor child turned 18 and graduated from high school.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">On November 14, 2003, the trial court denied the motion to terminate child support. The trial court ruled there had been no change in the terms of the support order to terminate support prior to age 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">On December 30, 2003, Oscar filed another motion to modify the existing child support order of $700 per month based on a <em>change of circumstances. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Oscar requested either a termination of child support or an order reducing it to zero until such time as circumstances warranted otherwise. Oscar indicated his annual income had declined since 1999 from $87,552 to $38,304, he has two minor children with his current spouse, Oscar Jr. was no longer in the custody of either parent and was attending a state university in Northern California on a full financial aid package.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">On January 13, 2004, Oscar filed notice of appeal from the trial court\u2019s November 14, 2003 order denying his motion to terminate support.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The trial court continued the hearing on Oscar\u2019s motion to modify child support pending the determination of the appeal from the denial of Oscar\u2019s motion to terminate support.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">On November 22, 2005, this court affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision denying Oscar\u2019s motion to terminate child support, ruling that \u201cOscar, having stipulated in the first instance to pay child support to age 25, is estopped to challenge the validity of the 1990 judgment in that regard.\u201d We concluded Oscar\u2019s \u201cremedy is to seek a modification of support based on an alleged change of circumstances, a remedy which he apparently is pursuing.\u201d <em>(Edwards, supra, </em>B172917, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">On March 16, 2006, the trial court held the long-delayed hearing on Oscar\u2019s motion to modify child support. The trial court applied the statutory guideline formula for calculating child support (\u00a7 4055) and determined that child support would be modified from $700 to $432 per month, commencing January 1, 2004. With respect to the issue of time-sharing responsibility, the trial court assigned zero percent to Oscar and 100 percent to Sharon, even though neither parent had custody of Oscar Jr., an adult who had moved away to college.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">On May 11, 2006, Oscar filed notice of appeal from the order modifying child support to $432 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">On June 15, 2006, the trial court issued its intended statement of decision. On June 26, 2006, Oscar objected to the statement of decision as untimely. On July 14, 2006, having reviewed Oscar\u2019s objections, the trial court filed its statement of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">Oscar contends: the trial court abused its discretion in failing to vary from the presumptively correct formula support amount in light of substantial evidence of rebuttal factors that the formula would be unjust or inappropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>in this case; even assuming the guideline applies, the trial court erred in applying the time-sharing component and in using outdated financial information; the trial court abused its discretion in improperly imputing 100 percent of the time Oscar Jr. was in college to Sharon; the trial court failed to consider whether the child support payable to Sharon should be terminated because Oscar Jr. had become self-supporting; and the order must be reversed because the trial court failed to render a timely statement of decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">1. <em>Standard of appellate review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\u201c \u2018 \u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s determination to grant or deny a modification of a support order will ordinarily be upheld on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is demonstrated.\u201d [Citation.] Reversal will be ordered only if prejudicial error is found after examining the record of the proceedings below. [Citation.] However, questions relating to the interpretation of statutes are matters of law for the reviewing court. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Marriage of Drake </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1139, 1150-1151 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 466] <em>(Drake).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">To the extent Oscar challenges the trial court\u2019s factual findings, our review follows established principles concerning the existence of substantial evidence in support of the findings. On review for substantial evidence, we examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party and give that party the benefit of every reasonable inference. <em>(Drake, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 1151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">2. <em>Trial court erred in determining child support pursuant to the guideline formula because neither parent retains physical responsibility for Oscar Jr., rendering the guideline inapplicable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">a. <em>Statutory scheme.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">Section 4055, subdivision (a), provides: \u201c(a) The statewide uniform guideline for determining child support orders is as follows: CS = K (HN - (H%) (TN)).\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Section 4057 provides: \u201c(a) <em>The amount of child support established by the formula provided in subdivision (a) of Section 4055 is presumed to be the correct amount of child support to be ordered. </em>['][] (b) <em>The presumption of subdivision (a) is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted by admissible evidence showing that application of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate in the particular case, </em>consistent with the principles set forth in Section 4053, <em>because one or more of the following factors is found to be applicable by a preponderance of the evidence, </em>and the court states in writing or on the record the information required in subdivision (a) of Section 4056: F0 (1) The parties have stipulated to a different amount of child support under subdivision (a) of Section 4065. [f] (2) . . . [f] (3) The parent being ordered to pay child support has an extraordinarily high income and the amount determined under the formula would exceed the needs of the children, [f] (4) A party is not contributing to the needs of the children at a level commensurate with that party\u2019s custodial time. [&lt;j[] (5) <em>Application of the formula would be unjust or inappropriate due to special circumstances in the particular case. These special circumstances include, but are not limited to, </em>the following: [][] (A) Cases in which the parents have different time-sharing arrangements for different children. [][] (B) Cases in which both parents have substantially equal time-sharing of the children and one parent has a much lower or higher percentage of income used for housing than the other parent. [][] (C) Cases in which the children have special medical or other needs that could require child support that would be greater than the formula amount.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">b. <em>Trial court\u2019s ruling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In this regard, the trial court ruled: \u201cAlthough the code section is not exhaustive, there does not appear to be any reason to find \u2018special circumstances\u2019 in this matter. The motion was filed at a time when both parents\u2019 income and tax status was known. Oscar Jr. lived with Sharon for the year until he went off to college. The MSA and judgment set out that child support would continue for him until age 25 so long as none of the circumstances eliminating the support obligation occurred. Absent some special language in the MSA and judgment for the post high school graduation period, \u00a7 4057 (a) applies, [f] This case does not appear to fall into any of the enumerated sections and the court does not find any \u2018special circumstances\u2019 to deviate from the guideline support formula. The time share of the parties in the year prior to filing is dealt with in the calculation of timeshare, H% and is not a \u2018special circumstance\u2019 under Subdivision (b)(5) of \u00a7 [4057].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>c. <em>The guideline formula, by its terms, is inapplicable because neither parent retains any physical responsibility for Oscar Jr., an adult who has moved away to college.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">One of the essential factors in calculating child support pursuant to the guideline is the \u201capproximate percentage of time that the high earner has or will have primary physical responsibility for the children compared to the other parent.\u201d (\u00a7 4055, subd. (b)(1)(D).)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Here, neither parent retains \u201cprimary physical responsibility\u201d for Oscar Jr. for any period of time. He turned 18 in November 2002. As an adult, Oscar Jr. is not in the custody of either parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Moreover, in August 2003, Oscar Jr. relocated to San Francisco to attend college. Since then, he has resided in San Francisco, initially in a dorm and later in an apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">In an income and expense declaration dated December 15, 2005, Sharon acknowledged: \u201cSon attends San Francisco State University. Last year [2004] he came home for Christmas and a week for spring break with friends. During the summer he stayed to take classes to complete education in 4 years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Nonetheless, Sharon contends she has \u201cphysical responsibility\u201d for Oscar Jr. because when school is not in session Oscar Jr. returns to her home, his \u201cstuff\u2019 is there, he receives mail there, and it is Oscar Jr.\u2019s address of residence with the college. These circumstances, reflecting an ongoing familial bond, do not support the contention Sharon continues to have \u201cprimary physical responsibility\u201d for Oscar Jr. within the meaning of the statute. (\u00a7 4055, subd. (b)(1)(D).)</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\"><em>Drake, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th 1139, on which Sharon relies for her theory that she retains physical responsibility for Oscar Jr., is completely inapposite. In a case of first impression, <em>Drake </em>addressed the applicability of the child support guideline formula to adult children. <em>(Drake, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 1155.) However, <em>Drake </em>involved the support of a mentally incapacitated adult child whose mother took \u201cfull responsibility for [his] physical situation and care.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1148, 1154, 1160.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">In arguing against the applicability of the guideline, the father in <em>Drake </em>contended \u201cthe guideline formula is inapplicable to disabled adult children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>because it incorporates \u2018time-sharing\u2019 as a factor, although many disabled adult children, including David, are not in the custody of either parent.\u201d <em>(Drake, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 1160.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\"><em>Drake </em>rejected that argument, explaining it did not \u201cfind any fatal inflexibility in the guideline formula concerning adjustments appropriate for cases involving children not under the supervision of either parent. [Citation.] [(J[] Moreover, in the circumstances of this case, the trial court did not err in according Miriam [the mother] and her successors in interest credit for full physical responsibility for David under the guideline formula. \u2018The time-sharing adjustment is based on the parents\u2019 respective periods of primary physical \u201cresponsibility\u201d for the children rather than physical \u201ccustody.\u201d Use of this terminology is purposeful: i.e., to clarify that [section] 4050 et seq. is not intended to alter current child custody law in any manner.\u2019 (Hogoboom &amp; King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law, <em>supra, </em>][ 6:168, p. 6-52.) <em>The record here discloses substantial evidence that Miriam and her successors in interest have had full responsibility for David\u2019s physical situation and care, </em>that [father] has no physical responsibility for David, and that [father] visited David only three times between May 1988 and June 1995.\u201d <em>{Drake, supra, </em>53 Cal.App.4th at p. 1160, final italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In the instant case, there is nothing in the record to show that Oscar Jr. is anything but a competent adult. The fact Sharon receives mail for Oscar Jr. at her address, that he keeps some of his \u201cstuff\u201d at her home, and that he visits her from time to time, do not support the trial court\u2019s finding that Sharon has \u201cprimary physical responsibility\u201d (\u00a7 4055, subd. (b)(1)(D)) for Oscar Jr. for any percentage of time. In this fact situation, neither parent retains \u201cprimary physical responsibility\u201d of their adult son for any period of time. Accordingly, the guideline formula, by its terms, is inapplicable. Stated another way, application of the guideline formula \u201cwould be unjust or inappropriate\u201d due to the particular circumstances of this case. (\u00a7 4057, subd. (b)(5).)</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">[[ ]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The March 16, 2006 order modifying monthly child support from $700 to $432, effective January 1, 2004, is reversed.
