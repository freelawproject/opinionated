We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">1. <em>Zanone Joins the Whittier Police Department</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Zanone joined the Whittier Police Department in January 1997 after 10 years working for the Gardena Police Department as both a patrol officer and a detective. Approximately six months after she began Zanone was transferred to patrol duty in the City of Santa Fe Springs, which was policed by Whittier pursuant to a contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Zanone had grown up in Santa Fe Springs and was living there at the time of the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">In her first annual performance evaluation for the year 1997 Zanone received an overall rating of \u201ccompetent plus.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In her annual performance evaluation for 1998, completed by her supervisor during that time, Sergeant Rod Bryant, Zanone received an overall rating of outstanding. For the year 1999 she also received an overall outstanding rating from Sergeant Bryant, who was her supervisor for the first 10 months of 1999, and Sergeant Gary Hancock, who was her supervisor for the last two months. In addition to these outstanding evaluations, Zanone was presented with the officer of the year award by a local post of the Veterans of Foreign Wars for her services as a patrol officer in Santa Fe Springs for 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">2. <em>Zanone Becomes a Detective in Santa Fe Springs</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">In late 1998 Zanone unsuccessfully applied to become a detective in Santa Fe Springs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> She reapplied in 1999 and was transferred in January 2000 to the detective bureau, which was staffed with a sergeant and four detectives, one of whom was designated the \u201clead detective\u201d with supervisory powers. By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Department order the position was a five-year \u201cspecial assignment\u201d; however, pursuant to a memorandum of understanding between the police officers\u2019 union and Whittier, detectives could be transferred from the detective bureau without cause on the anniversary date of the special assignment. Zanone was the first female detective ever assigned to the Santa Fe Springs detective bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">For approximately the first 10 months Zanone was in the detective bureau, Jeff Piper was the lead detective. During this period Zanone did not receive any complaints or reprimands relating to her performance. In mid-October 2000, after Michael Redmon replaced Piper as lead detective and Kent Miller became Zanone\u2019s partner, the situation changed. On November 30, 2000 Zanone attended a meeting with Redmon and Sergeant Hancock, who had taken command of the detective bureau, at which Zanone was informed about several deficiencies in her performance and was advised she needed to improve communication with her partner and other coworkers and to be a better team player by, among other things, participating in the execution of search warrants and more effectively handling her caseload. According to Zanone, at the close of the meeting Hancock told her, \u201cGina, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen if this doesn\u2019t improve. I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to go from here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">3. <em>Zanone\u2019s December 2000 Discrimination Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Zanone believed she had been unjustifiably criticized at the November 30, 2000 meeting in light of her outstanding performance reviews as a patrol officer, including positive comments on the thoroughness of her investigations, the lack of any indication during her first 10 months with the detective bureau her performance was in any way deficient and what she had perceived as a positive working relationship with Piper and her previous partner. Based upon Hancock\u2019s ominous warning, Zanone also believed her job was in jeopardy. Consequently, on December 5, 2000, the same date Zanone received a memorandum documenting the November 30, 2000 meeting, Zanone informed Whittier\u2019s human resources department she thought she was being treated differently because she was a woman.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Zanone subsequently explained she had seen this kind of treatment occur during her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>time at the Gardena Police Department and wanted to stop to it before it worsened. Zanone was also concerned there were no female supervisors at the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Whittier hired a labor attorney, Linda Jenson, who had represented Whittier on a number of matters over the previous 10 years, to conduct an investigation of Zanone\u2019s complaint. After interviewing, among others, Zanone, Redmon, Piper and Hancock, Jenson concluded there was a legitimate, work-related and nondiscriminatory reason for the November 30, 2000 meeting and Zanone had not been subjected to sex discrimination or harassment. However, Jenson did not interview officers identified by Zanone, including her former partner and several female officers, who may have supported Zanone\u2019s belief the deficiencies for which she had been admonished were pretextual. Zanone was informed of the results of the investigation in a memorandum dated December 21, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">4. <em>Zanone\u2019s Experience in the Detective Bureau After Investigation of Her Discrimination Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">On February 1, 2001 Zanone received her first annual performance evaluation as a detective for the year 2000. In contrast to her outstanding ratings as a patrol officer, Zanone received an overall rating of competent. The evaluation included criticisms in a number of areas that had not previously been identified as problems by anyone in the detective bureau: She was too \u201cfixated\u201d on certain reports; she typed her reports instead of dictating them; she would go out into the field without her gun, which was a major safety violation;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and other detectives were disappointed with Zanone. The evaluation also included narrative descriptions of her performance completed by both Piper, for the first 10 months of the year, and Redmon, for the remainder of the year. Notwithstanding the almost identical descriptions of Zanone\u2019s work, although Piper had rated Zanone very good in several categories, Redmon reduced the rating in those categories to competent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition to Sergeant Hancock, both Redmon and Piper, considered Zanone\u2019s peers even though they were lead detectives, signed the evaluation. Prior to that, Zanone had never received an evaluation that had been signed by anybody who was not in the Department\u2019s management (sergeant or higher).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>As 2001 progressed, Zanone continued to experience difficulties in the detective bureau. In March 2001 Zanone was practicing with a newly issued gun, which she had recently qualified to shoot, at the firing range with range master Sergeant Steve Dean. According to Zanone, the gun would not decock because the decocking mechanism was difficult to operate, a problem known to the Department. Zanone, however, was informed in a memorandum without explanation to resume use of her old gun until she was retrained. A different memorandum was placed in Zanone\u2019s personnel file, of which she was unaware at the time, stating she was unable to identify major operational components of her weapon and did not know how to decock it.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">On July 18, 2001 Sergeant Hancock and Detective Redmon met with Zanone to discuss a number of items, including a directive to Zanone she should dictate her reports notwithstanding her assertion she found it easier to see patterns in the data by typing them. (Zanone was working on forgery and fraud cases that involved multiple check numbers, dates and amounts.) The supervisors also noted she had missed a detective meeting, which she stated she had not realized was taking place, and discussed the incident with her new gun. The meeting was memorialized in a memorandum to Zanone from Hancock, which she was asked to sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">On August 28, 2001 Zanone had another meeting with Hancock and Redmon to discuss additional concerns about her performance. At the meeting Zanone was criticized because a case file she had arranged to have delivered to the district attorney\u2019s office was missing the record of the individual\u2019s arrests and convictions, as well as a supplemental report that had not yet been typed,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and because she had requested that the Department receptionists better screen calls to ensure that matters properly routed to dispatch were not directed to her. This meeting was also memorialized in a memorandum Zanone was asked to sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">On December 18, 2001 Zanone met with Redmon and Sergeant Dean, who had become the sergeant in charge of the detective bureau in October 2001, to discuss new issues that had arisen: Zanone had sent duplicative requests for fingerprint analysis in the same case; she had erroneously transferred a case from Santa Fe Springs to Whittier when the bulk of the thefts had occurred in Orange County; she could not answer an informal question from her partner, Tim Roberts, regarding whether the amount constituting grand theft was $300 or $400; she was not responding quickly enough to \u201ccall-ins\u201d; and she had too many cases rejected by the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>attorney\u2019s office. Although Zanone signed the postmeeting summary memorandum as requested, she attached a written statement disputing that the memorandum accurately reflected the discussion at the meeting or that it was an accurate portrayal of her job performance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">5. <em>Zanone\u2019s Transfer from the Detective Bureau and Her Experience While in Patrol; the Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">On January 15, 2002 Zanone was informed she was being transferred back to patrol pursuant to the agreement permitting nonrenewal of an employee\u2019s special assignment without cause on the anniversary date. A few weeks after her transfer, Zanone found a \u201cjoke\u201d memorandum had been posted above Redmon\u2019s desk at the detective bureau; Zanone believed the memorandum was mocking her. In April 2002 Zanone received her annual evaluation for 2001, which contained an overall rating of \u201cimprovement needed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">After her transfer to patrol Zanone, who was now working the night shift, began receiving \u201chang-up\u201d telephone calls during the day while she was trying to sleep. She filed a police report with the City of Long Beach, where she had moved; and one of the calls was traced to the home of a Whittier sergeant who had no reason to call her. In April 2002, near in time to Zanone\u2019s receipt of her 2001 performance review, Zanone received literature on how to plan your funeral from a mortuary located on the same street as the detective bureau. Contemporaneously, Zanone began to experience problems with dispatch, which would send other officers to respond to calls in her beat area, a practice that was extremely embarrassing to her. Zanone also had difficulties with the sergeant in charge of the jail facility. As a result, Sergeant Bryant, who was again Zanone\u2019s supervisor, told her not to make any arrests until after 2:00 a.m. when that sergeant would be off duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Zanone began to suffer from stress, anxiety and depression. She sought treatment from a psychologist in January 2003. After diagnosing Zanone with depression, anxiety and panic disorder, the psychologist determined she was no longer capable of performing her job, and Zanone ceased working in February 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Zanone filed a complaint with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and received a right-to-sue notice. On October 29, 2003 she filed a complaint in superior court for sex discrimination, harassment and retaliation in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act, Government Code section 12900 et seq. (FEHA).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">6. <em>The Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Trial lasted 13 days with testimony from 39 witnesses, including expert witness testimony on, among other things, whether Zanone\u2019s treatment was the result of sex discrimination and retaliation or a response to legitimate workplace concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">a. <em>Chief Singer\u2019s memorandum stating there was a perception in the Department women lacked career-enhancing futures</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Zanone introduced evidence no female sworn officer had ever been promoted to management and there was a perceived lack of opportunity for women at the Department.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In addition to Zanone\u2019s own testimony, Trini Nelson, who joined the Department in 1996, testified she believed she was unable to be promoted to sergeant because she was a woman; she also expressed the view the Whittier Police Department was one of the only law enforcement agencies that did not have a woman in management. Lisa Peasley, who had joined the Department in 1995 and was promoted to field training officer and then lead patrol officer, testified she left the Department in part because of her concerns about the promotion opportunities for women, a concern she had expressed to the then chief of police at the time of her departure. Additionally, after Chief David Singer, who had become chief in 2001, testified on cross-examination he did not recall ever being advised there was a perception in the Department of a lack of advantageous or career-enhancing futures for women, Zanone\u2019s counsel established Singer had made that statement in an October 25, 2002 memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">b. <em>Sergeant Bryant\u2019s statement Zanone was transferred from the detective bureau because she was a woman</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">To support her claim she had been unfairly criticized and transferred from the detective bureau because she was a woman, Zanone called as a witness Cary Cavalieri, a special agent for the California Department of Justice, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>testified about a background investigation he had performed in connection with Zanone\u2019s application to become a special agent for the Department of Justice in September or October 2002. Cavalieri was concerned about Zanone\u2019s transfer from the detective bureau prior to expiration of her five-year term. In an effort to determine the reason for her transfer, he interviewed Sergeant Dean and Sergeant Bryant. Over Whittier\u2019s hearsay objection, Cavalieri testified, \u201cWhen I asked [Sergeant Bryant] about the circumstances surrounding [Zanone] leaving the detective bureau, he expressed\u2014he told me that it wasn\u2019t because of a problem with [Zanone], that the problem was within\u2014he had worked in the detective bureau, and I believe the one in Santa Fe Springs, and he felt that the reason she had problems within the bureau had to do with her being a woman.\u201d Sergeant Bryant had died before trial started and was not available to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">c. <em>Whittier\u2019s attempt to introduce documents pertaining to the departure of two female officers from the Department and call one of those officers as a rebuttal witness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Whittier\u2019s primary defense to Zanone\u2019s claims of discrimination, harassment and retaliation was that serious performance issues led to her transfer from the detective bureau. Whittier asserted Zanone\u2019s performance as a patrol officer, which it conceded had been outstanding, was not relevant to her performance as a detective because different skills were required for the different positions. Whittier also contended, although the Department actively recruited women, almost no qualified female officers attempted to become a sergeant. Finally, Whittier argued other women in the Department had not experienced discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Jenson testified that, in connection with her investigation of Zanone\u2019s discrimination complaint, she had looked into Zanone\u2019s contention other women had left the Department in part because of concerns about promotability. Specifically, Jenson had reviewed documents pertaining to the departure of officers Anne Marie Lunsman and Rebecca Biamesen. As a result of her review of those materials, Jenson did not find it necessary to interview either Lunsman or Biamesen or any other women who had left the Department. Whittier sought to introduce those documents\u2014exit questionnaires prepared by Lunsman and Biamesen and a summary of their exit interviews prepared by the Whittier personnel who conducted the interviews. The trial court denied Whittier\u2019s request, apparently persuaded by Zanone\u2019s argument the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>documents were hearsay and did not satisfy the requirement for admission as business records notwithstanding the testimony of Whittier\u2019s human resource director, Fred Wiener, as to how the exit summaries had been prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Before it had finished its defense case-in-chief, Whittier orally moved to call Lunsman as a rebuttal witness. Lunsman had not been included on its pretrial witness list, but was included on a second amended witness list filed the day jury selection commenced. Whittier contended Lunsman would testify she left Whittier solely for financial reasons and had not been treated in a discriminatory manner to rebut Zanone\u2019s and others\u2019 testimony there was Department-wide discrimination that motivated women to leave. The court ruled, if Zanone put on rebuttal witnesses and that subject was raised, Whittier could call Lunsman. Zanone did not call any rebuttal witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">7. <em>The Jury\u2019s Deliberations and Verdict</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">After four days of deliberation the jury appeared deadlocked. After seven more days of deliberation the jury reached a verdict in favor of Zanone on her claims for discrimination and retaliation by a vote of nine to three. However, the jury failed to reach a verdict on her harassment claim. Using a special verdict form prepared by Zanone, the jury awarded $1,249,165 in damages: $530,012 in economic and $372,503 in noneconomic damages on Zanone\u2019s claim for discrimination, and $59,150 in economic and $287,500 in noneconomic damages on her claim for retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">8. <em>The Court\u2019s Denial of the City\u2019s Motions for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict and for New Trial; the Award of Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">On February 2, 2006 the court denied Whittier\u2019s motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for new trial. On April 11, 2006 the trial court awarded $45,954.56 in costs and $454,803 in attorney fees to Zanone.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">Whittier contends the trial court erred in permitting Zanone to quote from Chief Singer\u2019s memorandum, which was located in an officer\u2019s personnel file, but had not been disclosed to Zanone pursuant to the procedures specified in Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1046; admitting the hearsay statement by Sergeant Bryant that Zanone had been transferred from the detective bureau because she was a woman; failing to admit the documents pertaining to exit interviews with former officers Lunsman and Biamesen; refusing to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Whittier to call Lunsman as a rebuttal witness; rejecting Whittier\u2019s special instruction defining an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d; and using a confusing and misleading special verdict form. Whittier further contends a juror engaged in prejudicial misconduct by researching provisions in the Penal Code during deliberations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">DISCUSSION<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">1. <em>Zanone\u2019s Failure to File a </em>Pitchess <em>Motion Seeking Disclosure of Chief Singer\u2019s Memorandum Does Not Preclude Her Use of the Memorandum to Impeach the Chief\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The disclosure of peace officer personnel records is governed by rules different from those for discovery of other information because, although \u201cevidence contained in a law enforcement officer\u2019s personnel file may be relevant in a lawsuit, [that] officer \u2018has a strong privacy interest in his or her personnel records and . . . such records should not be disclosed unnecessarily.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Haggerty v. Superior Court </em>(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 1079, 1085 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 467]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Mooc </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 1216, 1227 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 482, 36 P.3d 21].) To balance these competing interests, following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pitchess v. Superior Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 531 [113 Cal.Rptr. 897, 522 P.2d 305],<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Legislature enacted a statutory scheme mandating certain procedures for discovery of peace officer personnel records. (See <em>City of Santa Cruz </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at pp. 93-94 [\u201c[i]n enacting [the statutory scheme] the Legislature clearly intended to place specific limitations and procedural safeguards on the disclosure of peace officer personnel files which had not previously been found in judicial decisions\u201d].) Penal Code section 832.7, subdivision (a), provides \u201cPeace officer or custodial officer personnel records and records maintained by any state or local agency pursuant to [Penal Code] Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>832.5 [governing citizen complaints against personnel in departments or agencies that employ peace officers], or information obtained from these records, are confidential and shall not be disclosed in any criminal or civil proceeding except by discovery pursuant to Sections 1043 and 1046 of the Evidence Code.\u201d Evidence Code sections 1043 and 1046, in turn, set forth detailed procedures for discovery and disclosure, including the requirement that, \u201c[t]o initiate discovery, the [party seeking discovery or disclosure] must file a motion supported by affidavits showing \u2018good cause for the discovery,\u2019 first by demonstrating the materiality of the information to the pending litigation, and second by \u2018stating upon reasonable belief\u2019 that the police agency has the records or information at issue. ([Evid. Code,] \u00a7 1043, subd. (b)(3).) This two-part showing of good cause is a \u2018relatively low threshold for discovery.\u2019 [Citation.] [fj If the trial court finds good cause for the discovery, it reviews the pertinent documents in chambers and discloses only that information falling within the statutorily defined standards of relevance.\u201d <em>(Warrick v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 1011, 1019 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 2, 112 P.3d 2].)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Whittier contends the trial court erred by allowing Zanone to impeach Chief Singer with material from a memorandum he had written that was located in another officer\u2019s personnel file even though Zanone had not obtained the memorandum by filing a <em>Pitchess </em>motion. The memorandum at issue reported the details and conclusions of an unrelated investigation into claims of racial discrimination made by Officer James Rollins and contained Singer\u2019s statement, \u201cThere is a perception of a lack of an advantageous or career-enhanced future for minority or female officers within the WPD.\u201d Because this memorandum does not fall within the statutory definition of \u201cpersonnel records,\u201d even if it could be found in Officer Rollins\u2019s personnel file, the trial court did not err in allowing its use to impeach Singer.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Penal Code section 832.8 defines peace officer personnel records as \u201cany file maintained under that individual\u2019s name by Ms or her employing agency and containing records relating to any of\u2019 a list of enumerated categories of information, including personal data, medical Mstory and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>employee discipline. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 832.8, subds. (a), (b), (d).)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Last year, in <em>Commission on Peace Officer Standards &amp; Training v.

Therefore, we conclude that peace officer personnel records include only the types of information enumerated in [Penal Code] section 832.8.\u201d <em>(POST, </em>at p. 293.) Accordingly, the issue is whether the Singer memorandum concerning the Rollins racial discrimination complaint falls within one of the specific categories of information listed in Penal Code section 832.8\u2019s definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Whittier contends Chief Singer\u2019s October 25, 2002 memorandum falls within the ambit of Penal Code section 832.8, subdivision (e), which lists \u201c[c]omplaints, or investigations of complaints, concerning an event or transaction in which [the peace officer] participated, or which he or she perceived, and pertaining to the manner in which he or she performed his or her duties.\u201d Whittier argues the investigation of Rollins\u2019s complaint of racial discrimination, the subject of the memorandum, was based on events Rollins had perceived\u2014that is, his own discriminatory treatment by other members of the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Whittier\u2019s proposed construction of Penal Code section 832.8, subdivision (e), ignores critical, limiting statutory language.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> While it is correct a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>personnel record includes information relating to the investigation of a complaint, not just the complaint itself, and may concern events or transactions the officer perceived, as well as those in which he or she actually participated, only those complaints or investigations of complaints that also \u201cpertainQ to the manner in which [the officer] performed his or her duties\u201d are included within subdivision (e)\u2019s definition of personnel records. That is, to be a personnel record the complaint or investigation of a complaint must both concern an event that involved the officer as a participant or witness <em>and </em>pertain to the officer\u2019s performance of his or her duties. (See <em>Melamed v.

Yet it is those officers who have been the subject of complaints about their alleged misconduct whose privacy rights are most threatened by overly broad disclosure of personnel records and who, therefore, need the greater protection afforded by the statutory scheme.

(See Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200.) Although we agree with Whittier\u2019s assertion Bryant\u2019s statement did not fall within any exception to the hearsay rule and, therefore, was not properly admitted, in light of the other evidence of discrimination and retaliation before the jury, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">a., b.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">3. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion in Excluding the Exit Questionnaires and Exit Interview Summaries</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Whittier contends the trial court erred in refusing to admit the exit questionnaires prepared by departing officers Lunsman and Biamesen, as well as summaries of the exit interviews prepared by the Whittier personnel who conducted them. The trial court\u2019s ruling was well within its discretion,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> notwithstanding its comment at the hearing on Whittier\u2019s motion for new trial that it would \u201cprobably change [its] ruling\u201d because \u201c[i]t does appear that they may have been business records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">a. <em>Governing law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">Evidence Code section 1271 provides, \u201cEvidence of a writing made as a record of an act, condition, or event is not made inadmissible by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>hearsay rule when offered to prove the act, condition, or event if: [f] (a) The writing was made in the regular course of a business; [K] (b) The writing was made at or near the time of the act, condition, or event; [f] (c) The custodian or other qualified witness testifies to its identity and the mode of its preparation; and [f] (d) The sources of information and method and time of preparation were such as to indicate its trustworthiness.\u201d As the Law Revision Commission comment to Evidence Code section 1271 explains, \u201c \u2018The chief foundation of the special reliability of business records is the requirement that they must be based upon the first-hand observation of someone whose job it is to know the facts recorded. . . . But if the evidence in the particular case discloses that the record was not based upon the report of an informant having the business duty to observe and report, then the record is not admissible under this exception, to show the truth of the matter reported to the recorder.\u2019 [Citations.] [f] Applying this standard, the cases have rejected a variety of business records on the ground that they were not based on the personal knowledge of the recorder or of someone with a business duty to report to the recorder. Police accident and arrest reports are usually held inadmissible because they are based on the narrations of persons who have no business duty to report to the police. [Citations.] They are admissible, however, to prove the fact of the arrest.\u201d (Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29B pt. 4 West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code (1995 ed.) foil. \u00a7 1271, pp. 315-316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">b. <em>The exit questionnaires are not business records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The record on appeal does not demonstrate the exit questionnaires met the criteria for business records. Although it may have been Whittier\u2019s practice to require departing employees to complete the exit questionnaire and to keep those questionnaires with the exit interview summaries prepared by Whittier personnel, to qualify as a business record the document\u2019s <em>author </em>must have created the document in the ordinary course of his or her business. <em>(Daniels v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 532, 537-538 [189 Cal.Rptr. 512, 658 P.2d 1313] [accident report submitted to Department of Motor Vehicles by vehicle owner pursuant to Vehicle Code was not business record; \u201c[a]lthough it may be the regular course of business for the D.M.V. to receive the report, it undoubtedly is not in the regular course of business for the citizen author to make . . . such a report. And, it is this aspect of the report that bears on the trustworthiness factor contemplated by this exception to the hearsay rule\u201d].) Clearly, the departing officers were neither employees acting on behalf of the Department nor acting in the ordinary course of their own business when they completed their exit questionnaires, an infrequent event. Moreover, because the two officers in this case were leaving to join other police departments, their exit questionnaires were not inherently trustworthy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The officers could have easily believed any complaints they may have made about sex discrimination\u2014or anything less than a glowing endorsement of the Department and its personnel\u2014would be communicated to their new employers and cause them to suffer adverse treatment as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">c. <em>The summaries are not business records</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The exit interview summaries prepared by Whittier employees, although prepared in the ordinary course of business, also do not qualify as business records under Evidence Code section 1271 because the employees who prepared them did not have firsthand knowledge of the events recorded and the officers, who did have firsthand knowledge, were not under a business duty to accurately report the facts pertaining to their departure. (See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Centennial Bowl, Inc. </em>(1966) 65 Cal.2d 114, 126 [52 Cal.Rptr. 561, 416 P.2d 793] [\u201cbusiness records are not admissible under this exception when they are \u2018not based upon the report of an informant having the business duty to observe and report\u2019 \u201d]; Cal. Law Revision Com. com., 29B pt. 4 West\u2019s Ann. Evid. Code, <em>supra, </em>at p. 315.) Moreover, the summaries, even if they had been established as business records, themselves contained hearsay statements regarding the employees reasons for leaving for which no exception had been established. <em>(Alvarez v. Jacmar Pacific Pizza Corp. </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 1190, 1205 [122 Cal.Rptr.2d 890] [\u201c[w]hen multiple hearsay is offered, an exception for <em>each </em>level of hearsay must be found in order for the evidence to be admissible\u201d]; <em>People v.

Code, \u00a7 1201 [\u201cstatement within the scope of an exception to the hearsay rule is not inadmissible on the ground that the evidence of such statement is hearsay evidence if such hearsay evidence consists of one or more statements each of which meets the requirements of an exception to the hearsay rule\u201d].) Inasmuch as the exit questionnaires prepared by the departing employees lacked trustworthiness, the summaries, which repeated much of the same information, were equally lacking in trustworthiness. A summary of an inadmissible hearsay statement cannot be made admissible merely because it is repeated in a valid business record.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">4.-7.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The judgment is affirmed.

Applying the last antecedent rule, if the statutory requirement that the complaint or investigation of the complaint pertain to the manner in which the officer performed his or her duties were to be limited at all, it would apply only to events perceived by the officer, not those in which the officer actually participated. (See <em>White v.
