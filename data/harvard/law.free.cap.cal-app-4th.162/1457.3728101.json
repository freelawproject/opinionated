Code, \u00a7\u00a7 269, 261, subd. (a)(2)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and two counts of lewd or lascivious acts on a child (\u00a7 288, subd. (a)). The sex crimes involved defendant\u2019s granddaughter, Anna Doe (Anna). The court denied defendant\u2019s two separate motions for new trial and sentenced defendant to a term of 30 years to life, consecutive to eight years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">Defendant contends that his first new trial motion should have been granted because the prosecution\u2019s nondisclosure of a videotape of a medical examination of Anna\u2014an examination commonly (and hereafter) referred to as a SART (sexual assault response team) exam\u2014constituted prejudicial <em>Brady </em>error <em>(Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963) 373 U.S. 83 [10 L.Ed.2d 215, 83 S.Ct. 1194]). (Hereafter, this videotape is sometimes referred to as the SART video.) He contends further that, irrespective of whether the nondisclosure constituted <em>Brady </em>error, the SART video constituted newly discovered evidence that warranted the granting of defendant\u2019s first new trial motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-7\">Defendant also argues that Anna\u2019s posttrial execution of a declaration recanting her claims that her grandfather sexually assaulted her constituted newly discovered evidence that required the granting of his second new trial motion. A further claim of error concerns the court\u2019s preclusion of defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Anna as to whether her therapist had coached her testimony. Defendant also urges that the trial court erred by permitting the testimony of a prosecution investigator concerning child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome (hereafter CSAAS). Lastly, defendant contends that there was an insufficient basis for giving an instruction concerning CSAAS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">We conclude that nondisclosure of the SART video by the prosecution constituted prejudicial <em>Brady </em>error. We therefore reverse the judgment and remand the matter for a new trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1464\">*1464</page-number>FACTUAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-5\">I., II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-6\">III. <em>Medical </em>Testimony<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-7\">A. <em>Testimony of Mary Ritter (Prosecution)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1362-8\">Mary Ritter is a physician assistant, clinic coordinator, and the primary examiner at the Center for Child Protection (Center) in the department of pediatrics at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center (Valley Medical). As of the time of trial, she had been employed at Valley Medical for over 18 years and had been the primary examiner for nearly that entire time. In that capacity, Ritter saw the majority of children brought to the Center at Valley Medical in the daytime by the police or child protective services for sexual abuse examinations, known as SART exams. She received her training in performing these examinations from Dr. David Kerns, medical director of the Center. As of the time of trial, Ritter had performed roughly 4,000 SART exams. The trial court qualified her as an expert in the field of child sexual assault and the examination of children alleged to have been sexual assault victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-9\">A SART exam occurs as a result of an initial contact to the Center at Valley Medical by the police or social services. Ritter routinely takes a history from the investigative officer. After performing a physical examination of the child head to toe, Ritter, in the case of a girl, would perform a genital examination, using a special instrument called a colposcope. The colposcope has a camera attached to it that permits the examiner to take magnified photographs. The child is examined while she is lying on her back with her feet in stirrups (supine position). After this portion of the genital examination is completed, \u201ca real[ly] important part of the examination\u201d involves turning the child over so that she is positioned on her hands and knees with her knees brought up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1465\">*1465</page-number>her chest (knee-chest position). Because (1) \u201c[t]he most common place for a penetrating injury is the bottom portion of the . . . hymen,\u201d and (2) \u201cgravity\u201d often makes it more difficult to get a clear view of the hymen when the child is in the supine position, it is often easier for the examiner to observe evidence of injury when the child is in the knee-chest position. If the SART exam occurs within 72 hours of the alleged assault and there is any chance of getting forensic evidence for the crime lab, Ritter would swab the alleged victim for DNA. Even if the alleged assault were not recent, the SART examiner might obtain cultures to test for sexually transmitted diseases. After the completion of the examination, Ritter would get the photographs from the SART exam developed, obtain any laboratory studies, prepare a report, and send the report to the investigator on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">Ritter explained that for prepubescent girls, the results of SART exams fall within a spectrum. At one end, there would be no objective evidence of injury. At the other end of the spectrum, there would be evidence of \u201cabsolute tears of the vaginal opening, the hymenal opening. And then ... in the middle of that spectrum, . . . there would be bruises and abrasions.\u201d Ritter testified that it would often be the case that a child victim of sexual assault would present with normal findings after a SART exam.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This would be explained by the fact that, in her experience, between 85 to 90 percent of alleged child victims do not report assaults immediately and are examined at least three days and as long as years after the alleged assault. Thus, injuries resulting from sexual penetration, such as bruising and tearing, may have had enough time to heal because of the victim\u2019s delayed reporting of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-6\">On July 28, 2005, Ritter performed a SART exam of Anna. She was accompanied by a counselor from the children\u2019s shelter. Anna chose to have the counselor wait in the reception area rather than to have her present during the SART exam. Ritter interviewed Anna to obtain a history that would be relevant for the medical examination. She told Anna that she was examining her because she had heard that Anna\u2019s grandfather had sexually assaulted her. Ritter asked whether Anna, around the time of the sexual assault, had experienced pain when she urinated. Anna responded in the negative \u201cand then she proceeded to say that never really did happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-7\">Ritter conducted a SART exam of Anna. She examined Anna in the supine position; Ritter did not note an injury but felt that there was too much tissue for her to get a complete view of the hymenal opening. After this portion of the examination, she had Anna position herself in the knee-chest position. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1466\">*1466</page-number>From this position, Ritter determined that there was evidence of an old injury. \u201c[Ijnstead of having [a] nice smooth broad hymen, . . . [Ritter] saw ... a V-shape configuration that went up at 1:00 o\u2019clock almost... to the fossa.\u201d It \u201c[was] not a recent tear.\u201d She opined that this V-shaped configuration was evidence that \u201cthe hymen tissue that was here has been tom and when hymen tears it doesn\u2019t heal by knitting together like cutting a skin .... It doesn\u2019t come over and smooth over like nothing happened. When hymen tissue tears[,] it\u2019s essentially going to stay, that\u2019s going to stay there.\u201d \u201c[Tjhere was nearly no hymen at all at the point of the V.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-5\">During the examination, Ritter observed a small red area at the edge of the hymen. She did not believe that it represented an injury, but swabbed it to determine if it was an infection, possibly herpes. Ritter also took a culture of Anna\u2019s vaginal area to mle out the existence of any sexually transmitted diseases. The test results were negative for any infection or sexually transmitted diseases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-6\">Ritter concluded that there was physical evidence \u201cconsistent with a penetrating event occurring.\u201d Both Ritter and her superior, Dr. Kems, signed off on a written report containing Ritter\u2019s findings as described in her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-7\">On cross-examination, Ritter confirmed that it was her opinion that the V-shaped configuration represented a hymenal tear that was evidence of penetrating trauma. She testified that \u201cit certainly is a deep tear. It\u2019s not the deepest kind of tear that we have seen.\u201d There would be severe pain associated with the type of tearing Ritter concluded had occurred in this instance. In response to questioning as to whether the condition she had observed could have been consistent with a normal variation as opposed to evidence of a penetrating event, Ritter testified that she had never seen any studies or instances in which such a V-shaped configuration was within limits of a normal condition.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> She also testified on cross-examination that she would not necessarily expect that there would have been heavy observable bleeding at the time of the penetrating event that resulted in the tearing of the hymen as she concluded had occurred with Anna. There might have been observable bleeding, or, alternatively, the blood might have \u201cessentially [been] absorbed back into the tissue and sitting in the vaginal canal.\u201d Ritter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1467\">*1467</page-number>testified that she had \u201cseen lots of [hymenal] tears that bled and the child didn\u2019t seem to be aware that [she was] bleeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-5\">B. <em>Dr. Theodore Hariton (Defense)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1365-6\">Defendant called an expert, Dr. Theodore Hariton, a retired medical doctor specializing in obstetrics and gynecology who had practiced for 40 years. He reviewed the Valley Medical records, including photographs, concerning the July 2005 SART exam of Anna. Dr. Hariton did not examine or interview Anna and did not speak with Ritter. Although he had sat through a course concerning SART exams, he had never performed or observed one. He testified that he had performed between 150,000 to 250,000 gynecological examinations; of those examinations, approximately 15,000 to 25,000 involved patients under 16 years old and about 250 to 300 were of prepubescent girls. However, Dr. Hariton had never examined a prepubescent girl who had asserted that she had been a sexual assault victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-7\">From his review of the records and photos, Dr. Hariton arrived at the conclusion that \u201cwith reasonable medical certainty this [penetrating trauma] did not happen.\u201d After referring to unidentified photographic exhibits he stated that they depicted a condition \u201cconsistent with a partial tear and . . . also consistent with a normal variant of what hymens look like.\u201d He pointed in particular to one defense exhibit (exhibit I) as depicting what \u201ccan well be a normal hymen.\u201d He also testified that two photos from the SART exam that he looked at (exhibits H &amp; J) appeared to reflect the examiner\u2019s, as part of standard procedure, stretching out the hymen in order to get a better view.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-8\">Dr. Hariton also based his disagreement with Ritter\u2019s opinion that there was physical evidence of penetrating trauma on the absence in the record of a report of pain and bleeding. He testified that there would be severe pain and bleeding associated with an adult male\u2019s putting his penis in the vagina of a five-year-old girl. Dr. Hariton testified that it would not have been possible for the blood associated with such trauma to have been simply reabsorbed inside the vagina. He also opined that he would expect that such a trauma would have resulted in the transection of the girl\u2019s hymen. From a review of the Valley Medical records and photographs from Anna\u2019s SART exam, Dr. Hariton concluded that Anna\u2019s hymen was not completely transected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1365-9\">On cross-examination, Dr. Hariton stated that it was possible that the photos of Anna\u2019s SART exam did depict a hymenal tear and that such a tear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1468\">*1468</page-number>may have been caused by a sexual act. He added, however that he didn\u2019t think that that was the case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-5\">C. <em>Dr. David Kerns (Prosecution Rebuttal)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1366-6\">As of the time of trial, Dr. David Kerns\u2014a pediatrician, medical director of the Center at Valley Medical, and a clinical professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine\u2014had approximately 30 years of experience in the subspecialty of the medical aspects of child abuse. Over the years, he had performed personally or \u201c100 percent reviewfed]\u201d nearly 6,000 SART exams at Valley Medical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-7\">Dr. Kerns did not personally perform the SART exam of Anna, but he did review the photos and the report of that examination performed by Ritter. In his opinion, Ritter did not do anything that resulted in the hymen falsely appearing on the photos to have had a V-shaped configuration. His medical opinion\u2014which confirmed the opinion in the report\u2014was \u201cthat there was definite physical evidence of penetrating trauma to [Anna\u2019s] hymen.\u201d Dr. Kerns described Anna\u2019s condition as being a complete transection of the hymen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-8\">Dr. Kerns singled out one particular photograph of Anna in \u201cthe knee-chest position\u201d (exhibit 4) as being the \u201ccritical\u201d photograph supporting his conclusion. (He explained that the knee-chest position \u201cgives the best exposure of . . . the hymenal anatomy.\u201d) Dr. Kerns noted that, in that photo, there was a V-shaped area of the hymen that evidenced the absence of hymenal tissue that was in such a \u201cposition and [to such a] degree of severity [as to not represent a] congenital variation[].\u201d In Dr. Kerns\u2019s opinion, the finding of the existence of physical evidence of penetrating trauma in this instance was \u201cnot a close call.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-9\">According to Dr. Kerns, the most frequent type of hymenal tearing as a result of a penetrating trauma is posterior tearing of the type found in the case of Anna. On cross-examination, he agreed that, if an adult penis were forced into a nine-year-old girl\u2019s hymenal ring, it would be more likely than not that tearing, severe pain, and bleeding would result. Dr. Kerns testified \u201cthat the acute injury that led to these changes [in Anna\u2019s hymen] would have . . . likely [resulted in] bleeding.\u201d But \u201cthe absence of bleeding in a history is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1469\">*1469</page-number>little bit. . . problematic\u201d because in some instances, the child who suffered a hymenal tear that resulted in bleeding would not be aware of the bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-5\">Also on cross-examination, Dr. Kerns testified that he was familiar with a California form (No. 925; exhibit L), labeled \u201cForensic Medical Report: Non-acute . . . Child/Adolescent Sexual Abuse Examination.\u201d He did not specifically recall whether the form was used for Anna\u2019s SART exam.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It probably was not used, however, because Valley Medical\u2019s general policy was not to use such forms in nonacute cases; the information sought in the form was redundant to that provided in Valley Medical\u2019s SART exam reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-6\">Dr. Kerns also testified that one of the photo exhibits (exhibit I) that Dr. Hariton relied on to conclude that Anna did not have a damaged hymen was a bad photo. He did not believe that the hymen was even depicted in the photo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-7\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1367-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-9\">I. <em>Issues on </em>Appeal*</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-10\">II. <em>The Videotape of the SART Exam\u2014Claimed </em>Brady <em>Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"AmST\">A. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1367-11\">On June 23, 2006, defendant filed a (first) motion for new trial. This motion was founded upon defendant\u2019s, after the trial, learning of the existence, and obtaining a copy, of a videotape of Anna\u2019s SART exam. Defendant argued that the new trial motion should be granted because the videotape constituted \u201cnew evidence . . . discovered material to the defendant, and which he could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered and produced at the trial\u201d under section 1181, subdivision 8. He also contended that he was denied due process because the nondisclosure of the SART video constituted a <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1470\">*1470</page-number>In an accompanying declaration, defense counsel stated that after the trial\u2014in a conversation that apparently took place on March 28, 2006<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>\u2014he had spoken with Ritter, who advised him that she was in possession of a videotape of the SART exam. He noted that prior to trial, on behalf of defendant, he had made a discovery request to the prosecution, inter alia, for all photographs and other documentation concerning Anna\u2019s SART exam; and had filed a motion to release documents previously produced by Valley Medical in response to a subpoena duces tecum issued by his office for all medical records concerning Anna.</p>\n<p id=\"b1368-5\">The motion was also accompanied by the declaration of the defense trial expert, Dr. Hariton. After summarizing in his declaration the substance of his testimony at trial as well as the testimony of the prosecution\u2019s experts, Dr. Hariton stated that (1) there had been \u201cone photo . . . not centered and slightly out of focus that supported [his] opinion regarding [the absence of] penetrating trauma\u201d; (2) \u201cDr. Kerns testified that this single photo [Dr. Hariton] used to support [his] opinion had no forensic value because it was out of focus and the flash did not work properly in that photo\u201d; (3) Dr. Kerns\u2019s \u201ctestimony was highly important and crucial to the case because said single photo contradicted Dr. Kems[\u2019s] and Mary Ritter\u2019s testimony that the alleged victim sustained a transection of her hymen\u201d; (4) he had viewed the SART video following the trial; (5) after isolating the portion of the video that corresponded with the photo on which he relied in his trial testimony, he concluded \u201c[t]hat Dr. Kerns was incorrect when he testified that the picture [Dr. Hariton] referred to . . . did not depict the [hymenal] opening of the alleged victim\u201d; (6) the \u201cvideo clearly shows a circular [hymenal] opening that is clear, in focus, and similar to the photo [he] referred to in support of [his] opinion\u201d; (7) he had obtained several additional photos from the video that also \u201cclearly show an intact hymen with no evidence of a prior transection or trauma\u201d; (8) although no photos had been available showing an examination of Anna in the supine position, the \u201cvideo of the [hymenal] area in the supine position again shows an intact hymen with no evidence of a prior transection\u201d; and (9) the \u201cvideo is extremely important and necessary in this case,\u201d it fully supported his opinions given at trial, and contradicted the opinions of Dr. Kerns and Ritter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1471\">*1471</page-number>The prosecution opposed the new trial motion, arguing that there was no <em>Brady </em>error because (1) the video evidence was cumulative; (2) the SART video did not support Dr. Hariton\u2019s previous testimony; (3) it could not be concluded that, had the video been shown to the jury, a not guilty verdict would have been probable; (4) Valley Medical was not part of the \u201cprosecution team\u201d in that the videotaping was not performed for an investigative purpose; and (5) the SART video was not exculpatory evidence. The opposition was not accompanied by any declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-5\">The trial court, in a lengthy written order, denied the motion for new trial on July 26, 2006. There was no hearing on the first motion for new trial that preceded the order.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The court concluded that there was no <em>Brady </em>error because \u201c[mjedical or psychiatric evidence in the possession of a county hospital or clinic are not in the possession of the \u2018prosecution team\u2019 for purposes of the <em>Brady </em>rule.\u201d To the extent defendant\u2019s new trial motion was based upon newly discovered evidence, the court found Dr. Hariton\u2019s testimony to have not been credible; attached little weight to his declaration as a result; and, after its own review of the SART video, concluded that \u201c[t]he existence of an intact hymen as described in the Defendant\u2019s moving papers and in the defense expert\u2019s declaration is not found in the videotape.\u201d The court therefore concluded that \u201c[t]here is nothing exculpatory in the videotape. In fact, the videotape refutes the defendant\u2019s trial position that the SART nurse manipulated the vagina into a position that created the look of a hymenal tear that did not exist.\u201d The court thus concluded that the videotape, if it had been produced before trial, \u201cwould not have made a difference to the outcome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1369-6\">B. Brady <em>Error Generally</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1369-7\">In <em>Brady, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d <em>(Brady, supra, </em>373 U.S. at p. 87.) Thus, under <em>Brady </em>and its progeny, the state is required to disclose to the defense any material, favorable evidence. <em>(Ibid; </em>see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley </em>(1985) 473 U.S. 667, 674-678 [87 L.Ed.2d 481, 105 S.Ct. 3375] <em>(Bagley).) </em>Favorable evidence includes both evidence that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1472\">*1472</page-number>exculpatory to the defendant as well as evidence that is damaging to the prosecution, such as evidence that impeaches a government witness. <em>(Bagley, supra, </em>at p. 676; see also <em>In re Sassounian </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 535, 544 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 446, 887 P.2d 527].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-5\">Further, irrespective of whether the defendant made a request for discovery from the prosecution, \u201cfavorable evidence is material, and constitutional error results from its suppression by the government, \u2018if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kyles v. Whitley </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 419, 433-434 [131 L.Ed.2d 490, 115 S.Ct. 1555] <em>(Kyles), </em>quoting <em>Bagley, supra, </em>473 U.S. at p. 682.) But the presence or absence of a specific request at trial is relevant to whether evidence is material under this test. \u201c \u2018[A]n incomplete response to a specific request not only deprives the defense of certain evidence, but also has the effect of representing to the defense that the evidence does not exist. In reliance on this misleading representation, the defense might abandon lines of independent investigation, defenses, or trial strategies that it otherwise would have pursued. [Citation.] HD We agree that the prosecutor\u2019s failure to respond fully to a <em>Brady </em>request may impair the adversary process in this manner. And the more specifically the defense requests certain evidence, thus putting the prosecutor on notice of its value, the more reasonable it is for the defense to assume from the nondisclosure that the evidence does not exist, and to make pretrial and trial decisions on the basis of this assumption.\u2019 [Citation.] Accordingly, in determining whether evidence was material, \u2018the reviewing court may consider directly any adverse effect that the prosecutor\u2019s failure to respond might have had on the preparation or presentation of the defendant\u2019s case.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Steele </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 682, 700-701 [10 Cal.Rptr.3d 536, 85 P.3d 444], quoting <em>Bagley, supra, </em>at pp. 682-683.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1370-6\">The Supreme Court in <em>Kyles </em>has identified four aspects to the materiality (i.e., prejudice) component of a <em>Brady </em>violation. <em>(Kyles, supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 434-437; see also <em>In re Brown </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 873, 886-887 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 698, 952 P.2d 715] <em>(Brown).) </em>First, \u201c[although the constitutional duty is triggered by the potential impact of favorable but undisclosed evidence, a showing of materiality does not require demonstration by a preponderance that disclosure of the suppressed evidence would have resulted ultimately in the defendant\u2019s acquittal (whether based on the presence of reasonable doubt or acceptance of an explanation for the crime that does not inculpate the defendant).

Although neither party specifically addresses this element, we do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-9\">Dr. Hariton in his declaration in support of the first new trial motion specifically stated that the portion of the SART video that corresponded with the photo (exhibit I) he relied on in his trial testimony contradicted Dr. Kerns\u2019s testimony that that photo did not depict Anna\u2019s hymen at all. The defense expert declared further that several photos he obtained from the SART video\u2014including ones taken while Anna was in the supine position\u2014 offered additional evidence to support his trial testimony that Anna had \u201can intact hymen with no evidence of a prior transection or trauma.\u201d Dr. Hariton concluded that the SART video constituted \u201cextremely important and necessary [evidence] in this case\u201d that fully supported his opinions given at trial, and contradicted the opinions of Dr. Kerns and Ritter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1372-10\">The People\u2019s opposition contained no evidence to refute the statements in Dr. Hariton\u2019s declaration. Rather, the People in their points and authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1475\">*1475</page-number>simply argued that Dr. Hariton\u2019s trial testimony and his subsequent declaration were entitled to no credence whatsoever. They made the unsupported assertion that \u201c[a] viewing of the SART exam video does not support the previous testimony of Dr. Hariton.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-5\">Dr. Hariton\u2019s declaration established that the SART video was favorable both because it offered potential evidence impeaching a prosecution expert\u2019s testimony, and it was supportive of the opinions of defendant\u2019s expert. We have little difficulty concluding from the record presented here that the SART video constituted \u201cfavorable\u201d evidence under <em>Brady. </em>(See <em>Salazar, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 1048 [evidence allegedly withheld was favorable to the defendant, and real issue was whether its omission was prejudicial to establish <em>Brady </em>violation].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-6\">2. <em>Whether SART video was suppressed</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1373-7\">The prosecution need not affirmatively suppress evidence favorable to the defense in order for there to be \u201csuppression\u201d under <em>Brady.

As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[T]he individual prosecutor has a duty to learn of any favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government\u2019s behalf in the case, including the police. But whether the prosecutor succeeds or fails in meeting this obligation (whether, that is, a failure to disclose is in good faith or bad faith, [citation]), the prosecution\u2019s responsibility for failing to disclose known, favorable evidence rising to a material level of importance is inescapable.\u201d <em>(Kyles, supra, </em>514 U.S. at pp. 437-438; see also <em>Strickler, supra, </em>527 U.S. at p. 281.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1373-8\">\u201c[A]ny favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government\u2019s behalf is imputed to the prosecution. \u2018The individual prosecutor is presumed to have knowledge of all information gathered in connection with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1476\">*1476</page-number>government\u2019s investigation.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Brown, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 879; see also <em>Youngblood v.

Conversely, \u201cthe prosecution cannot reasonably be held responsible for evidence in the possession of <em>all </em>governmental agencies, including those not involved in the investigation or prosecution of the case.\u201d <em>(In re Steele, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at p. 697.) The \u201cprosecution team\u201d for purposes of <em>Brady </em>thus includes both investigative and prosecutorial agencies and personnel. (Ibid.; see <em>People v.

We therefore consider the circumstances presented here to ascertain whether the knowledge of the SART video gained by the personnel conducting Anna\u2019s SART exam at the Center at Valley Medical (Ritter and Dr. Kerns) will be imputed to the prosecution. As stated by the Fourth District Court of Appeal, \u201c[t]he important determinant is whether the person or agency has been \u2018acting on the government\u2019s behalf\u2019 <em>([Kyles], supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 437 . . .) or \u2018assisting the government\u2019s case.\u2019 <em>([Brown], supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 881.)\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court (Barrett), supra, </em>80 Cal.App.4th at p. 1315.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-6\">Dr. Kerns is the director of the Center, which he founded in 1985. The Center is \u201crecognized as the place for evaluation in Santa Clara County in virtually 100 percent of the cases that come to [it].\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Ritter is the daytime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1477\">*1477</page-number>person in the Center \u201cwho sees the majority of the children when the police ... or Child Protective Services bring children to the hospital for child sexual abuse examinations.\u201d The police or social services initiate a SART examination to be performed by Ritter; an \u201cofficer or a social worker calls the Center and says they have a child to bring.\u201d In advance of the examination, Ritter obtains a history from the investigating officer who had previously interviewed the child. \u201cAll of [Ritter\u2019s] patients are essentially there because there is a concern of nonconsensual intercourse . . . . \u201d Ritter\u2019s practice after completing the SART exam, and after obtaining photographs and any laboratory results from the exam, is to write a report and send that report to the investigating officer in the case. In this instance, Anna was brought to the Center by someone from the children\u2019s shelter for a SART exam. Prior to that visit, Ritter had spoken to a police officer concerning the reason Anna was being referred to the Center for a SART exam (i.e., the nature of Anna\u2019s allegations against her grandfather).</p>\n<p id=\"b1375-5\">There is a statutory scheme addressing the function of SART exams in connection with the criminal investigative process. By legislative enactment, one hospital training center in the state was established for the purpose of, inter alia, \u201ctraining] medical personnel on how to perform <em>medical evidentiary examinations </em>for victims of child abuse or neglect, sexual assault, . . . [and] shall provide training for investigative and court personnel involved in dependency and criminal proceedings, on how to interpret the findings of medical evidentiary examinations.\u201d (\u00a7 13823.93, subd. (b), italics added.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Section 13823.93 was enacted in 1995 because of the Legislature\u2019s recognition that adequate training of medical professionals was essential both to provide for the medical needs of victims of domestic violence, child abuse, elder abuse, and sexual assault \u201cand to provide comprehensive, competent <em>evidentiary examinations for use by law enforcement agencies.'\u201d </em>(Stats. 1995, ch. 860, \u00a7 1, p. 6541, italics added.)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1478\">*1478</page-number>Under section 13823.9, subdivision (a), any public or private acute care hospital conducting an examination of a sexual assault victim (including a child molestation victim) \u201cshall comply with the standards specified in Section 13823.11 and the protocol and guidelines adopted pursuant to Section 13823.5.\u201d The \u201cminimum standards\u201d under section 13823.11 for such examinations and for \u201cthe collection and preservation of evidence\u201d include that \u201c[l]aw enforcement authorities shall be notified\u201d (\u00a7 13823.11, subd.

They asserted that, while the written report containing the findings of the SART exam \u201cis provided to the investigating police agency,\u201d Dr. Kerns and his staff \u201cdo not perform their examinations with the intention of aiding law enforcement.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1479\">*1479</page-number>The factual assertions in the opposition were unsupported by either citation to the record or by an accompanying declaration of any kind. In response to defendant\u2019s initial opening brief, the Attorney General again argues that Valley Medical is not part of the \u201cprosecution team\u201d for purposes of establishing a potential <em>Brady </em>violation. He argues that Ritter, in performing Anna\u2019s SART exam, \u201cwas not working on the government\u2019s behalf or assisting its case.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1377-5\">We reject any suggestion that the SART exam here was not investigative. It was clearly spearheaded by the police, who advised Ritter of a report of alleged sexual abuse in which Anna was the victim. A major purpose of the examination was to determine whether the allegation could be corroborated with physical findings. Ritter collected and preserved physical evidence, consistent with statutory protocol. (See \u00a7\u00a7 13823.11, 13823.7, subds. (e), (f).) And according to her practice\u2014after completion of the SART examination and after she and Dr. Kerns reach concurrence as to their findings as contained in the written report\u2014Ritter provided a copy of the forensic report to the police. (See \u00a7\u00a7 13823.11, subds. (a), (h)(4), 13823.7, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1377-6\">We believe that the circumstances presented in this case are aligned with those in <em>Brown, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 873, where the court held that the crime laboratory responsible for assisting the district attorney\u2019s office in the prosecution of its cases \u201cwas part of the investigative \u2018team.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 880.) There, as here, the defense received some but not all of the potentially relevant data from an agency assisting the prosecution, i.e., a crime laboratory. In <em>Brown, </em>the petitioner sought habeas corpus relief under <em>Brady </em>based upon the nondisclosure of a portion of the toxicology results of tests on his blood\u2014a radioactive immunoassay (RIA) that was positive for phencyclidine (PCP)\u2014where other results presented at trial (gas chromatography mass spectrometry [GC/MS]) were negative for PCP. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 877.) Although the crime laboratory sent the prosecution and the defense a copy of the \u201c \u2018result sheet\u2019 \u201d containing the GC/MS results, \u201cfor reasons of laboratory protocol,\u201d a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1480\">*1480</page-number>copy of a \u201c \u2018worksheet\u2019 \u201d containing the RIA results was not routinely sent by the lab. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Supreme Court held that the lab was part of the \u201cprosecution team\u201d for <em>Brady </em>purposes, concluding that \u201c[t]he prosecutor thus had the obligation to determine if the lab\u2019s files contained any exculpatory evidence, such as the worksheet, and disclose it to petitioner. Whether or not he actually did examine the files, the lab personnel\u2019s knowledge is imputed.\u201d <em>(Brown, supra, </em>at p. 880.) It reasoned, \u201cAny other rule would leave the defendant\u2019s due process rights to the fortuity of a subordinate agency\u2019s procedural protocol, which the Supreme Court has squarely rejected.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 880-881, citing <em>Kyles, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 438.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-5\">The court below cited <em>People </em>v. <em>Webb </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 494, 517-518 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 779, 862 P.2d 779] <em>(Webb) </em>in support of its conclusion that the SART video was not suppressed because \u201c[m]edical or psychiatric evidence in the possession of a county hospital or clinic [is] not in the possession of the \u2018prosecution team\u2019 for purposes of the <em>Brady </em>rule.\u201d But the circumstances in <em>Webb </em>were very different from those we confront here. In <em>Webb, </em>the issue was not a claimed <em>Brady </em>violation. Rather, the defendant claimed that the trial court had erred in refusing to release subpoenaed psychiatric records pertaining to the treatment of his girlfriend, Sharon, and that this error had prevented him from effectively cross-examining her at trial. <em>(Webb, supra, </em>at p. 517.) After the <em>Webb </em>court acknowledged that under <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie </em>(1987) 480 U.S. 39, 56-58 [94 L.Ed.2d 40, 107 S.Ct. 989], \u201cthe due process clause requires the \u2018government\u2019 to give the accused all \u2018material\u2019 exculpatory evidence \u2018in its possession,\u2019 even where the evidence is otherwise subject to a state privacy privilege, at least where no clear state policy of \u2018absolute\u2019 confidentiality exists,\u201d it questioned as a threshold matter \u201cwhether records stemming from Sharon\u2019s voluntary treatment by private and county therapists can be deemed \u2018in the possession\u2019 of the \u2018government\u2019 in the manner assumed by <em>Ritchie. </em>The records were not generated or obtained by the People in the course of a criminal investigation, and the People have had no greater access to them than [the] defendant. Given the strong policy of protecting a patient\u2019s treatment history, it seems likely that [the] defendant has no constitutional right to examine the records even if they are \u2018material\u2019 to the case.\u201d <em>(Webb, supra, </em>at p. 518.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1378-6\">In contrast to <em>Webb, </em>here the SART exam performed by Ritter did not constitute \u201cprivate treatment\u201d of Anna; the examination was initiated through a referral by the police in their investigation of a report of criminal conduct. And the prosecution had greater access to the records generated from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1481\">*1481</page-number>exam than defendant since Ritter, in compliance with the law (see \u00a7\u00a7 13823.11, subds. (a), (h)(4), 13823.7, subd. (a)), forwarded the report to law enforcement.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Webb </em>therefore does not support the conclusion that either Ritter or the Center, in conducting the SART exam here, was not part of the \u201cprosecution team\u201d for purposes of establishing a <em>Brady </em>violation. (See <em>State v. Farris </em>(W.Va. 2007) 656 S.E.2d 121 [knowledge of Kentucky forensic psychologist retained by West Virginia police to interview the defendant\u2019s cousin and possible victim of sexual abuse imputed to prosecution under <em>Brady].)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\">We thus conclude that, when it performed Anna\u2019s SART exam, including the collection of data necessary for the report, the Center at Valley Medical was, in fact, \u201c \u2018acting on the government\u2019s behalf\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018assisting the government\u2019s case.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Barrett), supra, </em>80 Cal.App.4th at p. 1315, citations omitted.) In this instance, the personnel in the Center at Valley Medical responsible for conducting SART exams\u2014 namely, Ritter and Dr. Kerns\u2014were part of the \u201cprosecution team\u201d for <em>Brady </em>purposes. (Cf. <em>Medina v.

Their knowledge of the existence of the SART video was thus imputed to the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">3. <em>Whether SART video was material (prejudice)</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-7\">4. <em>Conclusion re </em>Brady <em>violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1379-8\">We have carefully reviewed and considered the entire record in this case, including all of the trial testimony, exhibits, arguments of counsel, defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1482\">*1482</page-number>ant\u2019s two new trial motions, the People\u2019s oppositions thereto, the SART video and additional photographs submitted by the defense in connection with the first new trial motion and reviewed in camera by the trial court, and the court\u2019s lengthy order on the first new trial motion. We cannot uphold the trial court\u2019s conclusion that there was no <em>Brady </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-5\">The SART video was favorable to the defense. And it constituted suppressed evidence under <em>Brady, </em>because the Center at Valley Medical was part of the \u201cprosecution team.\u201d The determination of whether defendant established the third element, namely, the materiality of the SART video under <em>Brady, </em>boils down to an overall assessment of whether, giving full consideration of the evidence presented at trial, the suppression of the SART video \u201c \u2018undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kyles, supra, </em>514 U.S. at p. 434, quoting <em>Bagley, supra, </em>473 U.S. at p. 678.) This, we believe, is <em>something more </em>than a conclusion that the outcome <em>may have been different </em>had the SART video been available, but <em>something less </em>than defendant\u2019s being required to \u201cdemonstrate that after discounting the inculpatory evidence in light of the [SART video], there would not have been enough left to convict.\u201d <em>(Kyles, supra, </em>at pp. 434-435.) Here, evaluating the potential impact of the omitted SART video in light of the entire record, our confidence in the outcome of the trial has been undermined by the suppression of this evidence by the prosecution. This determination is largely based upon the relative weakness <em>(sans </em>medical evidence) of the prosecution\u2019s case, coupled with the unfairness to defendant in his being required to respond to medical testimony with limited and inferior photos when far superior and numerous photographic evidence in the form of the SART video should have been made available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-6\">We are mindful that the purpose of the <em>Brady </em>rule is \u201cto ensure that a miscarriage of justice does not occur.\u201d <em>(Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at p. 675, fn. omitted.) Based upon our conclusion that defendant established the requisite three elements, we find that the trial court erred by denying defendant\u2019s first motion for new trial made on the basis of violation of the <em>Brady </em>rule.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1483\">*1483</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-5\">The judgment is reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-6\">Mihara, Acting P.

Instead, the Attorney General states in a footnote that Ritter\u2019s duties at Valley Medical included matters other than SART exams, i.e., performing physical examinations of girls detained in juvenile hall. This fact does nothing to negate the essentially investigative function that Ritter and others at the Center played in performing SART exams on children referred by the police or social services based upon reports of child sexual abuse. Furthermore, defendant, in his supplemental opening brief, included some six pages of further argument on the suppression issue. While we do not assume that the issue is conceded, it is perhaps of some significance that the Attorney General, neither in the supplemental respondent\u2019s brief nor in oral argument, even addresses the legal question of whether the Center was part of the \u201cprosecution team.\u201d Rather, the Attorney General argues only that defendant failed to establish the materiality element of a <em>Brady </em>violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b1379-9\"> In opposition to defendant\u2019s first new trial motion, the People argued that the videotaping of SART exams was not done by the Center at Valley Medical for any investigative purpose but was simply for the training of potential SART examiners. The People offered no evidentiary support for these claims. And it is readily apparent that the photos taken from the SART video here <em>were </em>used by Ritter and Dr. Kerns for the investigative purpose of arriving at their findings concerning Anna\u2019s SART exam. Thus, since the photos were used for an investigative purpose, it would make no sense to conclude (particularly where there is no evidence to support the conclusion) that the source material for the photos was not used for an investigative purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1379-10\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1457.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b1380-7\"> Because of this conclusion, we need not address defendant\u2019s remaining contentions of error.
