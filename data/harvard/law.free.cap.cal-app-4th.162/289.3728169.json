The trial court concluded that it does. Upon de novo review of the issue, we conclude otherwise\u2014that however worthy the policy goals of encouraging the construction of low-cost housing and ensuring compliance with the prevailing wage requirements, the statutory language in its present form cannot be construed to command that result. Tax credits are, at best, intangible inducements offered by government, but they are not actual or de facto expenditures by government. As such, they do not qualify as either the \u201cpayment of . . . the equivalent of money by the state\u201d (subd. (b)(1)), or as a \u201c[transfer by the state ... of an asset of value for less than fair market price\u201d (subd. (b)(3)), the portions of the definition of \u201cpaid for in whole or in part out of public funds\u201d considered here. We thus reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">California\u2019s Prevailing Wage Law</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">California\u2019s prevailing wage law (\u00a7\u00a7 1720-1861) traces back to 1931, the same year Congress enacted the federal counterpart, commonly known as the Davis-Bacon Act. (Stats. 1931, ch. 397, p. 910; 46 Stat. 1494, as amended, codified at 40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3141-3148.) Prevailing wage laws were enacted in response to the economic conditions of the Depression, when the oversupply of labor was exploited by unscrupulous contractors to win government contracts when private construction virtually stopped. (See <em>Universities Research Assn. </em>v. <em>Coutu </em>(1981) 450 U.S. 754, 774 [67 L.Ed.2d 662, 101 S.Ct. 1451].)</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">The Legislature has declared that it is the policy of California \u201cto vigorously enforce minimum labor standards in order to ensure employees are not required or permitted to work under substandard unlawful conditions or for employers that have not secured the payment of compensation, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>protect employers who comply with the law from those who attempt to gain competitive advantage at the expense of their workers by failing to comply with minimum labor standards.\u201d (\u00a7 90.5, subd. (a).) \u201cThis general objective subsumes within it a number of specific goals: to protect employees from substandard wages that might be paid if contractors could recruit labor from distant cheap-labor areas; to permit union contractors to compete with nonunion contractors; to benefit the public through the superior efficiency of well-paid employees; and to compensate nonpublic employees with higher wages for the absence of job security and employment benefits enjoyed by public employees.\u201d <em>(Lusardi Construction Co. v. Aubry </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 976, 987 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 837, 824 P.2d 643].)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The prevailing wage law is fairly straightforward in operation. Its general thrust is that \u201cExcept for public works projects of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or less, not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for work of a similar character in the locality in which the public work is performed, and not less than the general prevailing rate of per diem wages for holiday and overtime work . . . shall be paid to all workers employed on public works.\u201d (\u00a7 1771.) The minimum threshold is increased to $25,000 for \u201cconstruction work,\u201d and $15,000 for \u201calteration, demolition, repair, or maintenance work.\u201d (\u00a7 1771.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\u201cPublic works\u201d is given a broad definition, to include \u201cConstruction, alteration, demolition, installation, or repair work done under contract and paid for in whole or in part out of public funds, . . . [and] includes work performed during the design and preconstruction phases of construction . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1720, subd. (a)(1).) The project may involve property that will remain in private hands but will be leased to the state or a political subdivision. (\u00a7 1720.2.) However, the prevailing wage requirement does not apply to work carried out by a public agency with its own employees. (\u00a7 1771.)</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The Director of the Department of Industrial Relations (Director) is given the responsibility for determining the general prevailing wage according to statutory criteria. (\u00a7 1770.) The Director fixes the prevailing wage rates for every category of worker needed for a public works project, which are then used by public entities soliciting bids for the project. (\u00a7\u00a7 1773, 1773.2.) The Director also has the authority to give opinions as to whether \u201ca specific project or type of work\u201d requires compliance with the prevailing wage law. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 16001(a)(1); see <em>Lusardi Construction Co. v. Aubry, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th 976, 988-989.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>A contractor or subcontractor who pays less than the established prevailing rate may be assessed civil penalties (\u00a7\u00a7 1741, 1775, 1777.7), may be suspended from bidding or working on public works projects for up to three years (\u00a7\u00a7 1777.1, 1777.7), and is also subject to criminal prosecution for failing to maintain payroll records demonstrating compliance (\u00a7\u00a7 1776, 1777).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Before the particulars that led to this appeal can be fully understood, a knowledge of the prevailing wage law must be augmented with a description of the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The Federal and California LIHTC Programs</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">According to the State Board of Equalization, \u201cThe federal low-income housing tax credit program, instituted by the 1986 Tax Reform Act and subsequently codified as section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. \u00a7 42]\u201d allows \u201celigible taxpayers [to] take a credit against federal income taxes due for qualified expenditures involving qualified low-income housing projects. To be eligible for the tax credit, the taxpayer must hold an ownership interest in a low-income housing project for which tax credits have been awarded. In exchange for the tax credits, the project owners agree to operate the project in accordance with the restrictions contained in Section 42 and IRS regulations. Furthermore, as a condition of receiving tax credits, the project owners are required to enter into a recorded regulatory agreement restricting the use of the property to its terms. [ft] . . . [ft] Each year, the federal government allocates a fixed amount of low-income housing tax credits to each state .... [ft] Under . . . section 42, each state must annually adopt a qualified allocation plan describing how its annual share of federal tax credits will be allocated among eligible, competing projects. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\u201cThe California agency responsible for tax credit allocation, and for developing the state\u2019s annual qualified allocation plan, is the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee (CTCAC), a unit of the State Treasurer\u2019s Office. CTCAC reviews applications from project developers and allocates the state\u2019s federal tax credits on a competitive basis, using the prescribed criteria in . . . section 42 and the additional [tax] criteria contained in CTCAC\u2019s own regulations. [See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 50199.8, 50199.10; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 4, \u00a7\u00a7 10315, 10325, 10326.] CTCAC currently receives applications for about four times the annual amount of federal tax credits available.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>\u201c. . . The California Legislature has also authorized a state low-income housing tax credit program to augment the federal program that is also administered by CTCAC.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (State Bd. of Equalization, Guidelines for the Assessment of Properties Financed Using Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (July 2005) pp. 1-2, ftis. omitted (SBE Guidelines); see Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 50199.4-50199.22; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 4, \u00a7 10300 et seq.) After the credits have been allocated, they are still subject to \u201creservations,\u201d conditioning their use upon \u201ctimely project completion\u201d and its subsequent operation. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 4, \u00a7 10328, subd. (a).) The project when completed must serve low-income tenants \u201cfor a period equal to the greater of 55 years or the life of the property.\u201d (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12206, subd. (c)(3)(C), 17058, subd. (c)(4)(C), 23610.5, subd. (c)(4)(C); see Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 50199.14, subd. (f).) There is a rigorous \u201congoing compliance monitoring\u201d program administered by the IRS and CTCAC. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 4, \u00a7 10337.) \u201cIf a project is found to be in material noncompliance, CTCAC notifies the IRS, which by law may take action to disallow previously-claimed tax credits.\u201d (SBE Guidelines, <em>supra, </em>at p. 3; see Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 50199.22, subd. (b); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 4, \u00a7 10337.)</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">According to the State Board of Equalization, the existence of tax credits is the principal instrument for achieving the goal of increasing the supply of low-income housing: \u201cThe tax credits allocated to a project form the basis for the project\u2019s equity financing .... Typically, a public or private real estate syndication is the mechanism for converting tax credits allocated to a project into cash proceeds . . . used to develop the project. [j[] A limited partnership is formed, with the developer of the project as general partner. Equity in the tax credit project is sold to investors in the form of limited partnership interests. The buyers of the tax credits become limited partners and equity holders in the . . . project, which entitles them to claim the future tax credits.\u201d (SBE Guidelines, <em>supra, </em>at p. 4.) \u201c[Although it is commonly stated that the developer of a tax credit project raises equity funds by \u2018selling the tax credits,\u2019 this is not exactly what happens. What in fact are sold are limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>partnership-equity interests in the project that include rights to certain tax credits, not the tax credits per se.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>p. 4, fn. 11.)</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The Project and Start of this Dispute</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The project at issue is the proposed rehabilitation of the 117 units in the Woodhaven Manor Apartments located in Rancho Cucamonga, San Bernardino County. The rehabilitation is to be done by a limited partnership known as HB Housing Partners (HB Housing). The managing partner of HB Housing is the nonprofit Southern California Housing Development Corporation (Housing Development). Late in 2005, HB Housing executed an agreement with the Rancho Cucamonga Redevelopment Agency, under the terms of which HB Housing would purchase the complex, rehabilitate it, and for a period of 55 years rent all of the apartments to persons earning no more than 60 percent of the area median income. The cost of the project was estimated at $18.6 million, most of which would be obtained by loans from the California Housing Finance Agency and the Rancho Cucamonga Redevelopment Agency. Slightly more than $600,000 would represent state LIHTC\u2019s allocated over a four-year period following completion of the rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">In August 2005, Housing Development asked the Director for a \u201ccoverage determination\u201d that the project was not required to comply with the prevailing wage law because it \u201cdoes not constitute public works paid for in whole or in part out of public funds.\u201d (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 16001 [any \u201cinterested person\u201d may file a \u201crequest to determine coverage under the prevailing wage laws\u201d].) Noting that the Director had already determined that federal LIHTC\u2019s did not involve an expenditure of public funds, Housing Development requested that the same reasoning be applied to state LIHTC\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">On November 16, 2005, the Director issued his coverage determination, reaching the result desired by Housing Development. The Director reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-10\">\u201cThe federal tax credits do not entail payment out of public funds for the reasons set forth in PW 2004-016, <em>Rancho Santa Fe Senior Affordable Housing Project </em>(February 25, 2005). Although state tax credits were not at issue in that case, much of the analysis of federal tax credits is equally applicable to them. However, each of the definitions of \u2018payment out of public funds\u2019 set forth in section 1720(b) requires a payment or other action \u2018by the state or political subdivision.\u2019 Thus it is necessary to examine whether state tax credits fall within any of these definitions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u201cSection 1720(b)(1) provides that \u2018payment of money or the equivalent of money by the state or political subdivision\u2019 constitutes payment out of public funds. A tax credit \u2018involves no expenditure of public moneys received or held . . . but merely reduces the taxpayer\u2019s liability for total tax due.\u2019 <em>Center for Public Interest Law v. Fair Political Practices [Com.] </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 1476 [259 Cal.Rptr. 21], Accordingly, the allocation of state tax credits is not a payment of money or the equivalent of money within the meaning of section 1720(b)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">\u201cSection 1720(b)(3) defines payment out of public funds to include the \u2018[transfer by the state or political subdivision of an asset of value for less than fair market price.\u2019 LIHTCs \u2018do not constitute a right to a payment of money, have no independent value, and are not freely transferable upon receipt.\u2019 <em>Rainbow Apartments v. [PTAB </em>(2001) 326 Ill.App.3d 1105, 1108] [260 Hl.Dec. 875, 762 N.E.2d 534, 537] .... Thus a fair market price cannot be assigned to state tax credits, and they are not payment out of public funds within the meaning of section 1720(b)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">\u201cSection 1720(b)(4) defines as payment out of public funds to include: [f] \u2018Fees, costs, rents, insurance or bond premiums, loans, interest rates, or other obligations that would normally be required in the execution of the contract, that are paid, reduced, charged at less than fair market value, waived, or forgiven by the state or political subdivision.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">\u201cWhile the tax credits may reduce Developer\u2019s state income tax obligations, these are not \u2018obligations that would normally be required in the execution of the contract.\u2019 The execution of the contract entails expenditures by, not income to, Developer. The tax credits therefore would reduce tax obligations, if any, on income derived from activities other than construction of the housing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">\u201cSection 1720(b)(6) defines payment out of public funds to include \u2018[credits that are applied by the state or political subdivision against repayment obligations to the state or political subdivision.\u2019 An income tax is not an obligation to repay money obtained from a governmental entity. Moreover, the state tax credits at issue here are not against any \u2018repayment obligation\u2019 pertaining to this Project, but rather will reduce the tax liability that investors incur on income unrelated to the Project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">\u201cThus the state tax credits do not constitute payment out of public funds within the meaning of section 1720(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">\u201cFor the foregoing reasons, the Project is not a public work subject to prevailing wage requirements.\u201d <em>(Woodhaven Manor Apartments, </em>Pub. Works case No. 2005-034, Nov. 16, 2005.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Proceedings in the Trial Court</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Because the Director designated his decision as precedential, thus allowing it to be relied upon in subsequent determinations (see Gov. Code, \u00a7 11425.60), this coverage determination reverberated beyond the specific controversy. The State Building and Construction Trades Council of California (Trades Council), which had initially opposed Housing Development\u2019s requested interpretation of the applicability of the prevailing wage law, sought to have the Director\u2019s decision reversed by administrative appeal. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 16002.5 [\u201cinterested part[y]\u201d may appeal coverage determination].) When that failed, Trades Council commenced this action in February 2006 against the Director and the Department of Industrial Relations (Department); Housing Development was named as \u201cInterested Party.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Trades Council sought a writ of traditional mandate (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085) on the ground that the Director \u201chas abused his discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law, in that he misinterpreted and misapplied the law in reaching his opinion that the Project is not a public work subject to California\u2019s prevailing wage act.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Trades Council prayed that the Director be commanded to set aside his \u201cerroneous decision\u201d and to issue \u201ca new decision that correctly applies the law.\u201d Trades Council also asked for declaratory relief \u201cconsistent with the . . . contentions as set forth above\u201d if the trial court \u201cconcludes that review of the . . . Director\u2019s decision is not available under C.C.P. \u00a7 1085.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The trial court heard extensive argument on Trades Council\u2019s motion for issuance of the writ. In its written order, the court concluded that LIHTC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>qualified as both \u201cpayment of money or the equivalent of money by the state . . . directly to or on behalf of the public works contractor, subcontractor, or developer\u201d (\u00a7 1720, subd. (b)(1)), and the \u201c[transfer by the state . . . of an asset of value for less than fair market price\u201d (subd. (b)(3)), which are two of the definitions of \u201cpaid for in whole or in part out of public funds\u201d set out in section 1720.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Noting that the plain language of section 1720 \u201cdoes not expressly list tax credits\u201d in those definitions, the trial court concluded the economic reality of LIHTC\u2019s showed that they are \u201can asset of value.\u201d As the court explained; \u201cTo hold that LIHTCs are not an \u2018asset of value\u2019 would be inconsistent with the reality of their function in the funding of the project. Even if the tax credits cannot be used immediately, and even if they come with various limitations and conditions, they are obviously an asset of value in some sense. It does not matter that the tax credits have no value except to the owners of limited partnership interests in this particular project. The legislature clearly intended to finance the development of low income housing by issuing these tax credits, and succeeded in doing so, in so far as the tax credits were clearly treated as a source of construction funding by the developer to whom they were issued. The State created the credits and allocated them specifically to [Housing Development\u2019s] project to accomplish exactly this result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The court concluded its thoughtful and tightly reasoned order by ruling that Trades Council was entitled to the writ; \u201cConsideration of the statute as a whole, therefore, leads to the conclusion that LIHTCs come within the scope of either section 1720(b)(1) or, more likely, section 1720(b)(3). [The Director\u2019s] prevailing wage determination ... is therefore in error. The Woodhaven project involves construction done under contract and funded in part by state-issued LIHTCs allocated after December 31, 2003. The use of the state LIHTCs to subsidize the construction means the construction is \u2018paid for ... in part out of public funds\u2019 within the meaning of section 1720(b) and, therefore, that the workers performing that construction are entitled to be paid prevailing wages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">Separate notices of appeal were filed by Housing Development and by the Director and the Department.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We ordered the appeals consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">There is but a single issue before us, namely, whether the LIHTC\u2019s involved in the financing make the project a \u201cpublic work\u201d requiring workers to be paid the prevailing wage. In deciding this issue, we have had the benefit of highly competent briefs filed by the parties. In addition, Trades Council is also supported with an amicus curiae brief from the State Treasurer, while the California Redevelopment Association and the California Building Industry Association have submitted amicus curiae briefs behind the Director and the Department. But before we address the merits, we must settle the issue of our standard of review\u2014specifically, how much, if any, deference must we pay to the Director\u2019s coverage determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The broad question of the deference due to administrative decisions has perplexed some of our best judicial minds. (See maj. opn. of Brown, J., and conc. opn. of Mosk, J., in <em>Yamaha Corp. of America </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 1 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 960 P.2d 1031] [citing, e.g., <em>Wilkinson v.

Fortunately, we are not required to make an original contribution to this topic.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">The parties and one amicus curiae devote a considerable amount of space in their briefs to the issue of whether the Director\u2019s coverage determination was the equivalent of an established administrative interpretation of a statute by the official responsible for administering that statute, and thus a quasi-legislative rule entitled to our deference. (See generally <em>Yamaha Corp. of America v. State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1, 6-11 <em>(Yamaha).) </em>There are three compelling reasons why there is not much, if any, deference due.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">First, following completion of briefing for this appeal, the Director discontinued the practice of designating coverage determinations as precedential; he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>also stripped prior determinations of precedential value, and announced that past and future coverage determinations would be \u201cadvisory . . . only.\u201d The obvious conclusion is that the Director and the Department have jettisoned a general interpretation of whether LIHTC\u2019s meet the statutory definition of a public work \u201cpaid for in whole or in part out of public funds,\u201d and adopted a case-by-case approach using good-for-one-time-only decisions on specific projects. In other words, coverage determinations are no longer, if they ever were, treated as quasi-legislative by the Department itself. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 16303 [declaring that the Director\u2019s authority \u201cto establish the prevailing wage for any craft, classification, or type of worker is quasi-legislative,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny hearing under this process is quasi-legislative . . . .\u201d]; <em>Tidewater Marine Western, Inc. v. Bradshaw </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 557, <em>574\u20145775 </em>[59 Cal.Rptr.2d 186, 927 R2d 296] [\u201cA written statement of policy that an agency intends to apply generally . . . and that predicts how the agency will decide future cases is essentially legislative in nature . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Second, and just as significant, judicial deference to an administrative interpretation of a statute is extended if the interpretation is long-standing, consistent, and if the interpretation was contemporaneous. <em>(People v. Cole </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 964, 987 [44 Cal.Rptr.3d 261, 135 P.3d 669]; <em>Sara M. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 998, 1012 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 89, 116 P.3d 550]; <em>Yamaha, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1, 7, 13.) Such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The Director\u2019s coverage determination is less than two years old, so it hardly qualifies as long-standing. Moreover, that determination reversed the Department\u2019s position taken in 2003, that LIHTC\u2019s <em>did </em>make a project a public work \u201cpaid for in whole or in part out of public funds\u201d within the meaning of section 1720. <em>(1010 Pacific Apartments, </em>Pub. Works case No. 2002-070, June 30, 2003.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Director\u2019s current reading of section 1720 thus hardly qualifies as consistent. \u201c[W]hen an agency\u2019s construction 1 \u201cflatly contradicts\u201d \u2019 its original interpretation, it is not entitled to \u2018significant deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Murphy v. Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc. </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 1094, 1105, fn. 7 [56 Cal.Rptr.3d 880, 155 P.3d 284], quoting <em>Henning </em>v. <em>Industrial Welfare Com. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1262, 1278 [252 Cal.Rptr. 278, 762 P.2d 442].) Put more bluntly, \u201c \u2018[a] vacillating position ... is entitled to no deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Yamaha, supra, </em>at p. 13.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Third, and most importantly, the nature of the issue before us involves the quintessential judicial function. Because the issue here is a pure one of statutory interpretation, this is not a situation where the administrative agency \u201c \u2018has a comparative interpretative advantage over the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Yamaha, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1, 12, quoting Cal. Law Revision Com., Tent. Recommendation, Judicial Review of Agency Action, <em>supra, </em>at p. 11; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Cole, supra, </em>38 Cal.4th 964, 987; <em>Bonnell v. Medical Board </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1255, 1264-1265 [8 Cal.Rptr.3d 532, 82 R3d 740].) Statutory language is not something \u201cwhere the materials are technical and engage an agency\u2019s expertise.\u201d (Asimow, <em>The Scope of Judicial Review of Decisions of California Administrative Agencies, supra, </em>42 UCLA L.Rev. 1157, 1204.) To the contrary, it is the judiciary which has the ultimate authority for determining the meaning of a statute. <em>(Yamaha, supra, </em>at pp. 11-12; <em>Culligan Water Conditioning </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>17 Cal.3d 86, 93 [\u201c \u2018the ultimate resolution of . . . legal questions rests with the courts\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Morris v. Williams </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 733, 748 [63 Cal.Rptr. 689, 433 P.2d 697] [\u201c \u2018Whatever the force of administrative construction . . . final responsibility for the interpretation of the law rests with the courts.\u2019 \u201d]; see Cal. Const., art. m, \u00a7 3.5 [only appellate courts, not administrative agencies, can declare laws invalid].)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Nevertheless, the opinion of an administrative agency as to a statute\u2019s meaning may be helpful even if it is \u201cnot binding or necessarily even authoritative.\u201d <em>(Yamaha, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th 1, 8; accord, <em>Sara M. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th 998, 1011.) \u201cCourts must, in short, independently judge the text of the statute, taking into account and respecting an agency\u2019s interpretation of its meaning, of course, whether embodied in a formal rule of less formal representation. Where the meaning and legal effect of a statute is the issue, an agency\u2019s interpretation is one among several tools available to the court. Depending on the context, it may be helpful, enlightening, even convincing. It may sometimes be of little worth.\u201d <em>(Yamaha, supra, </em>at pp. 7-8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">In short, while we consider the Director\u2019s current interpretation of section 1720, we do not extend that interpretation any particular deference. Because there is no factual dispute, only the question of how that statute is to be construed and applied, we exercise our independent judgment. <em>(Murphy </em>v. <em>Kenneth Cole Productions, Inc., supra, </em>40 Cal.4th 1094, 1105, fn. 7; <em>City of Long Beach v. Department of Industrial Relations </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 942, 949, 951 [22 Cal.Rptr.3d 518, 102 P.3d 904] <em>(City of Long </em>Beach) [discussed in fn. 11, post]; <em>People ex rel. Lockyer v.

Before addressing the merits of the pure legal issue before us, we first examine the history of section 1720 in this court, and the legislative aftermath.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The precise issue here may be novel, but its general context has previously been before this court, in <em>McIntosh v. Aubry </em>(1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 1576 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 680] <em>(McIntosh), </em>where we considered the Director\u2019s conclusion that a project was not a \u201cpublic work\u201d and thus did not require payment of prevailing wages. The project there was to be a privately run residential shelter for emotionally disturbed or abused minors. The facility was to be constructed on acreage leased by the county that it would sublease, rent free, to the developer for 20 years. The trial court denied mandamus to overturn the Director\u2019s decision. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1580.) We affirmed, on the basis of section 1720 as it then read,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> reasoning that the county\u2019s forbearance of rent did not qualify as a \u201cpayment\u201d of \u201cpublic funds\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">\u201c \u2018To determine the intent of legislation, we first consult the words themselves, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] The full [statutory] phrase here is \u2018paid for in whole or in part out of public funds\u2019 (\u00a7 1720, subd. (a)). Does it encompass the forbearance of rent? The verb \u2018pay,\u2019 standing alone, can in its usual and ordinary sense include the transfer of things other than money. It means \u2018to satisfy (someone) for services rendered or property delivered\u2019 or to \u2018discharge an obligation\u2019; \u2018Pay is a general term, usu[ally] lacking particular connotation but sometimes bluntly stressing the purchase of services . . . .\u2019 (Webster\u2019s Third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>New Internat. Dict. (1965) p. 1659.) Even \u2018[i]n a more restricted legal sense[,] payment is the performance of a duty promise, or obligation ... by the delivery of money or other value\u2019\u2014\u2018the delivery of money or its equivalent. . . .\u2019 (Black\u2019s Law Diet. (6th ed. 1990) p. 1129.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">\u201cHowever, the \u2018payment\u2019 here must be \u2018out of public funds\u2019 (\u00a7 1720, subd. (a)). The word \u2018funds\u2019 is not specially defined in the statute but \u2018has a well-established meaning in common parlance .... The dictionary defines it as \u201cavailable pecuniary resources ordinarily including cash and negotiable paper\u201d [citation], and in a legal context the courts have also taken it to include property of value which may be converted into cash [citations].\u2019 [Citation.] The county\u2019s right to charge rent is not an available pecuniary resource like cash or some readily cash-convertible asset. To take rent <em>collected </em>from one source and use it to pay obligations would plainly be a payment of public funds, but the County here will not collect the rent. Nor, according to our record, will it lose appreciable rents it otherwise might have charged for the acreage in its unimproved state. Also, it may be more accurate to view uncharged rent over 20 years as an ongoing subsidy of contracted-for <em>services </em>rather than the initial <em>construction. </em>The contract originally envisioned only a year of construction, during which time, of course, the commercial value of the land would be at its lowest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">\u201cThe forbearance of rent here, while valuable as a negotiating tool in securing the total project, does not fit comfortably into the idea of \u2018construction\u2019 \u2018paid for . . . out of public funds.\u2019 Plaintiffs attribute the ill fit to changing times: words which were easy to apply when counties contracted for projects directly have become awkward in a post-Proposition 13 age when cash-poor counties turn increasingly to alliances with private industry. In plaintiffs\u2019 view, we must expand the meaning of anachronistic language to fit the realities of the present, or risk frustrating legislative intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">\u201cWe view the situation differently. Courts will liberally construe prevailing wage statutes [citations], but they cannot interfere where the Legislature has demonstrated the ability to make its intent clear and chosen not to act [citations]. We do not share plaintiffs\u2019 view that the Legislature has overlooked changes in county needs or practices in this area. It has in fact been active. It . . . has regularly amended the prevailing wage law to keep pace with evolving realities. Section 1720.2 was such a reaction, as was the 1989 addition of section 1720.4 and subdivision (f) of section 1720 . . . .[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] Those balanced solutions show current awareness by the Legislature. We adhere to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>the plain meaning of section 1720, subdivision (a), and decline to read it more expansively.\u201d <em>(McIntosh, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 1576, 1588-1589.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Although it was not an express term of the contract between the county and the developer, it appears that during the construction process in <em>McIntosh </em>the county incurred inspection costs that would ordinarily have been charged to the developer, but in fact were absorbed by the county. We held that these expenses likewise did not qualify as the payment of public funds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">\u201cThe <em>nature </em>of the costs is important, and is undisputed. The County waived costs it normally charges for routine inspections and allocated them between departments for internal accounting purposes. . . . [f] We hold that the cost waivers were not public funds paid for construction (\u00a7 1720, subd. (a)). Like the forbearance of rent, these \u2018costs\u2019 involve no payment of funds out of county coffers. Legislators could easily express an intent to bring waived costs (or rent) within the concept of payment with \u2018public funds\u2019 but have not done so. A holding that waived inspection costs are partial payments from public funds could make public works of any project where a county has used cost waivers as incentives to development, even though the project may serve purely private needs. The statute gives no warning that this result was intended.\u201d <em>(McIntosh, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 1576, 1589-1590.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\"><em>McIntosh </em>generated repeated attempts in the Legislature to modify or overturn it. These efforts culminated in the passage of Senate Bill No. 975 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) in 2001. (Stats. 2001, ch. 938, \u00a7 2.) The bill was sponsored by the Trades Council. (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 975 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) as amended Aug. 30, 2001, p. 1.) It began modestly as an amendment of Government Code section 63036, a provision of the statutory scheme for the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank (Gov. Code, \u00a7 63000 et seq.), to simply provide that \u201call public works\u201d financed by the bank, \u201cincluding those projects financed through the use of industrial development bonds . . . shall comply\u201d with the prevailing wage law. (Sen. Bill No. 975 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 1.) It cleared the Senate Government Operations Committee on April 24, 2001, and was passed by the full Senate two days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>It was the Assembly which began amending section 1720 as it then read. (See fn. 9, <em>ante.) </em>The first amendment would have added a subdivision (g), to the effect that \u201c \u2018paid for in whole or in part out of public funds\u2019 includes, but is not limited to, the payment of money or the equivalent of money by a public agency directly to or on behalf of the public works contractor or developer, performance of work in execution of the project, transfer of an asset of value for less than fair market price, or payment or waiver of fees, costs, rents, or other obligations that would normally be required in the execution of the contract.\u201d (Assem. Amend, to Sen. Bill No. 975 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) June 25, 2001, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The bill was again amended to move this language to subdivision (b) so that it would provide: \u201cFor purposes of this section, \u2018paid for in whole or in part out of public funds\u2019 . . . means the payment of money or the equivalent of money by a state or local public agency directly to or on behalf of the public works contractor, subcontractor, or developer, performance of construction work by the state or local public agency in execution of the project, transfer of an asset of value for less than fair market price . . . ; fees, costs, rents, insurance or bond premiums, loans, interest rates, or other obligations that would normally be required in the execution of the contract, which are paid, reduced, charged at less than fair market value, waived, or forgiven . . . ; or credits applied against repayment obligations.\u201d (Assem. Amend, to Sen. Bill No. 975 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) July 10, 2001, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Two days later, the Assembly amended the bill for a third time, this time adding as subdivision (e) the language now found in section 1720, subdivision (c)(4). (Assem. Amend, to Sen. Bill No. 975 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) July 12, 2001.) The bill was amended for the fourth time by the Assembly on July 18, 2001, to specify that \u201c \u2018paid for in whole or in part out of public funds\u2019 shall not include tax credits provided pursuant to Section 17053.49 or 23649 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.\u201d (Assem. Amend, to Sen. Bill No. 975 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) July 18, 2001, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Senate Bill No. 975 (2001-2002 Reg. Sess.) was amended for the fifth, and final time by the Assembly on August 30, 2001. This was the version passed by the Legislature and signed by Governor Davis on October 14, 2001. Although minor changes were enacted the following year (Stats. 2002, ch. 1048, \u00a7 1), the final version of Senate Bill No. 975 is essentially the version of section 1720 with which we are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">As statutes go, section 1720 is hardly a triumph of the drafter\u2019s art.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>The problem starts with subdivision (a), which defines \u201cpublic works\u201d as various categories of work \u201cdone under contract\u201d and \u201cpaid for in whole or in part out of public funds,\u201d and subdivision (b), which enumerates what is meant by the latter clause. Of the two, subdivision (b) is obviously more important for present purposes. As definitional provisions of a statute in a statutory scheme that has traditionally received a liberal construction (as we noted in <em>McIntosh), </em>one would expect these provisions to be prefaced with the familiar wording that the definition \u201cincludes\u201d or, more broadly still, \u201cincludes but is not limited to,\u201d particularly as this was a bill intended to broaden the scope of section 1720. In fact, the first Assembly amendment used the broader language, but it was subsequently deleted. Instead, in both subdivisions (a) and (b) the Legislature employed the word \u201cmeans,\u201d a term accepted as one of limitation, not enlargement. (See 2A Singer &amp; Singer, Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction (7th ed. 2007) \u00a7 47:7, p. 305; <em>Brown v. Scott Paper </em>(2001) 143 Wn.2d 349 [20 P.3d 921, 926].) And conspicuous by their absence from subdivision (b) are the words \u201ctax credits,\u201d an omission only made more glaring by subdivision (b)(6), which includes this within the definition of \u201cpaid for in whole or in part out of public funds\u201d: \u201cCredits that are applied by the state or political subdivision against repayment obligations to the state or political subdivision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">However, the Legislature was not content to halt with subdivision (b). It went on in subdivision (c) to specify a number of situations that might be included\u2014or excluded\u2014as \u201cpaid for in whole or in part out of public funds.\u201d The most pertinent of these exclusions is subdivision (c)(5), which unambiguously states that \u201c \u2018Paid for in whole or in part out of public funds\u2019 <em>does not include tax credits </em>provided pursuant to Section 17053.49 or 23649 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">But there is more. Subdivision (d) identifies three types of projects that \u201cshall not, <em>solely by reason of this section, </em>be subject to the requirements\u201d of the prevailing wage law. (Italics added.) All of the three situations are expressly pegged to projects already commenced \u201con or before December 31, 2003,\u201d one of which is precisely the type of that at issue here: \u201cLow income housing projects that are allocated federal or state low-income housing tax credits pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code [or] Chapter 3.6 of Division 31 (commencing with Section 50199.4) of the Health and Safety Code____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>It is more than a little confusing to attempt to discern a consistent logic to subdivisions (b), (c), and (d). Subdivision (b) specifies that its enumerated categories are what \u201c \u2018paid for in whole or in part out of public funds\u2019 means.\u201d Subdivision (c) is a true hodgepodge: it designates two categorical exclusions from the prevailing wage law (subd. (c)(4), (5)), but the remaining four categories of project may or may not be exempt depending on the circumstances. Subdivision (d) then sets out three types of projects that \u201cshall not, <em>solely by reason of this section, </em>be subject to the requirements\u201d of the prevailing wage law. (Italics added.) A carefiil reader is naturally inclined to wonder if subdivision (d) is simply an extension of subdivision (c) and whether both serve the same functions, namely, adding and subtracting from the public funds definition of subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">This is the raw material with which we must grapple to resolve these appeals. That resolution turns on the construction we give to section 1720. That construction is not to be reached by examining bits and pieces of the statute, but after a consideration of all parts of section 1720 in order that we may effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>(Coalition of Concerned Communities, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 733, 737 [21 Cal.Rptr.3d 676, 101 P.3d 563]; <em>County of Riverside v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 278, 292 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 713, 66 P.3d 718]; <em>Alford v. Superior Court </em>(2003) 29 Cal.4th 1033, 1040 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 63 P.3d 228].) In the rare case, widening the analytical aperture brings additional difficulties: \u201cStatutory language which seems clear when considered in isolation may in fact be ambiguous or uncertain when considered in context.\u201d <em>(Quarterman v. Kefauver </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1371 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 741].)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Such is the case here. We cannot look at subdivision (b) by itself, because subdivisions (c) and (d) address the same subject, namely, what is encompassed by subdivision (b)\u2019s definition of what constitutes a public work \u201cpaid for in whole or in part out of public funds.\u201d In addition, just what is meant by \u201ccredits\u201d cannot yield a single answer because the Legislature did not use the word in the same and consistent sense. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Nguyen </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 197, 205 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 198, 980 P.2d 905]; <em>Hoag </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1880) 55 Cal. 564, 565.) With these provisos, we come at last to the issue of whether LIHTC\u2019s are within the section 1720 definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Both the Director and Housing Development argue for reversal on the basis of the reasoning in the Director\u2019s coverage decision, and the spirit of our decision in <em>McIntosh. </em>Stripped to its essentials, their argument is that giving a tax credit does not amount to paying out public funds. A tax credit has no intrinsic value to the state. It is not sold by the state. It cannot be stolen from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the state. And in allocating a tax credit, the state parts with nothing of any realizable monetary worth. It thus is not \u201c[t]he payment of money or the equivalent of money by the state\u201d (subd. (b)(1)), nor is it a \u201c[transfer by the state ... of an asset of value for less than fair market price\u201d (subd. (b)(3)). After careful consideration of the issue, we agree with the Director and Housing Development.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">There is nothing in the language of subdivision (b) that furnishes a basis for concluding that the Legislature intended to overthrow the <em>McIntosh </em>ordinary meaning approach to determining what qualifies as \u201cpaid for in whole or in part out of public funds.\u201d Indeed, precisely the opposite appears true, that the trigger for application of the prevailing wage law carried over from the McIntoshsra version of section 1720 (quoted at fn. 9, <em>ante) </em>is still the payment of public funds. The various provisions of section 1720, subdivision (b), demonstrates that the Legislature was guided by the <em>McIntosh </em>language that \u201cpayment\u201d meant \u201c \u2018the delivery of money or its equivalent.\u2019 \u201d <em>(McIntosh, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 1576, 1588.)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The statutory emphasis is very much upon the tangibility and form of the payment. The Legislature virtually adopted our <em>McIntosh </em>formulation in subdivision (b)(1), which defines \u201c \u2018paid for in whole or in part out of public funds\u2019 \u201d as first and foremost the \u201cpayment of money or [its] equivalent.\u201d \u201cTransfer ... of an asset of value for less than fair market price,\u201d and \u201cFees, costs, rent, insurance or bond premiums, loans, interest rates, or other obligations that would normally be required in the execution of the contract, that are paid, reduced, charged at less than fair market value\u201d (subd. (b)(3), (4)) are obviously in the same vein. So is \u201cMoney loaned\u201d when repayment is not guaranteed. (Subd. (b)(5).) It is not hard to understand that extending \u201cCredits that are applied . . . against repayment obligations\u201d (subd. (b)(6)) is simply money that would otherwise be paid. And there is certainly a cash value if the state actually undertakes \u201cPerformance of construction work ... in execution of the project.\u201d (Subd. (b)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Moreover, subdivision (b)(1) and (3) speak to the state or political subdivision parting with a thing possessing current value. Within the definition of \u201cpaid for in whole or in part out of public funds\u201d is \u201cThe payment of money or the equivalent of money by the state or political subdivision\u201d specified by subdivision (b)(1). Subdivision (b)(3) includes in the same definition the \u201cTransfer by the state or political subdivision of an asset of value for less than fair market price.\u201d It is significant that both of these provisions are couched in the present tense. By contrast, when the Legislature meant to refer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>to an exchange occurring in the future, it used language to reflect that expectation, as in subdivision (b)(5), which places within the definition \u201cMoney loaned by the state or political subdivision <em>that is to be repaid on a contingent basis.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Even more significant is subdivision (b)(6), which speaks to \u201cCredits that are applied by the state or political subdivision against repayment obligations to the state or political subdivision.\u201d \u201cRepayment\u201d in this context can hardly refer to a private contract where no moneys are advanced by the state that can be owing\u2014and thus there is nothing to be \u201crepaid.\u201d If the Legislature had intended that LIHTC\u2019s be included with subdivision (b), one would naturally expect to see something like the language of subdivision (d)(3) in subdivision (b). That absence cannot be without meaning.  \u201c \u2018It is a well recognized principle of statutory construction that when the Legislature has carefully employed a term in one place and has excluded it in another, it should not be implied where excluded.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Brown v. Kelly Broadcasting Co. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 725 [257 Cal.Rptr. 708, 771 P.2d 406] <em>(Brown); </em>accord, <em>Smith v. Rae-Venter Law Group </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 345, 364 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 516, 58 P.3d 367] [\u201cwhen different terms are used in parts of the <em>same </em>statutory scheme . . . they are presumed to have different meanings\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">There is, moreover, an impressive body of authority, much of which was cited by the Director in his coverage decision, that excludes tax credits from the category of goods and services that amount to public assets or are treated as the equivalent of money. For example, within the context of California\u2019s personal income tax system, a credit is treated as something that \u201cinvolves no expenditure of public moneys received or held . . . but merely reduces the taxpayer\u2019s liability\u201d at a future point in time. <em>(Center for Public Interest Law </em>v. <em>Fair Political Practices Com., supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d 1476, 1486.) Federal tax law is to the same effect: it likewise does not recognize receipt of a tax credit as a taxable event, on the theory that the taxpayer \u201chas received no money or other \u2018income\u2019 within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d <em>(Randall v. Loftsgaarden </em>(1986) 478 U.S. 647, 657 [92 L.Ed.2d 525, 106 S.Ct. 3143] (Randall).)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The credits \u201chave no value in themselves,\u201d only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>contingent benefit \u201cto reduce the taxes otherwise payable.\u201d <em>(Randall, </em>at p. 657; see also <em>id., </em>at pp. 657-659 [credits have \u201ceconomic value\u201d only indirectly to extent they reduce tax liability].)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Both California and the federal courts have declined to treat tax credits as sufficiently substantial to offset civil damage awards. <em>(DePalma v. Westland Software House </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 1534, 1539-1543 [276 Cal.Rptr. 214]; <em>Randall, supra, </em>478 U.S. 647, 662-667.) For purposes of California\u2019s criminal law, a tax credit is not a \u201cpublic money\u201d that can be misappropriated. <em>(Center for Public Interest Law </em>v. <em>Fair Political Practices Com., supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d 1476, 1486; see Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 424-426.) Federal law follows a similar approach: \u201cUnissued tax credits have zero intrinsic value\u201d and thus \u201care not property\u201d when they in the possession of the allocating state agency. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Griffin </em>(5th Cir. 2003) 324 F.3d 330, 354 <em>(Griffin).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">It is true that certain references to an LIHTC being \u201csold\u201d can be found in reported decisions. (E.g., <em>Griffin, supra, </em>324 F.3d 330, 355; <em>Marysville Properties, L.P. </em>v. <em>Nelson </em>(Mo.Ct.App. 2002) 83 S.W.3d 608, 611.) But this is misleading unless substantially qualified. A person or entity cannot be allocated a LIHTC and immediately sell it on any street comer. The housing project must be completed and made operational before the credit begins to appear on a tax return. Thereafter, the project may be sold, but the LIHTC is transferred with the property; the LIHTC cannot be sold separately. As the State Board of Equalization puts it: \u201cUnder IRC section 42, low income housing tax credits may only be claimed by owners of qualifying low-income housing; that is, the tax credits cannot be claimed unless the taxpayer also holds a concomitant equity interest in a low-income housing project.\u201d (SBE Guidelines, <em>supra, </em>p. 4, fn. 11; see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 42(d)(7), (f)(1), (4), (5).)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">Even the most prominent of the authorities using the word \u201csale\u201d agrees with this limitation: \u201cOnce tax credits have been allocated, they cannot be transferred from the property to which they were allocated. . . . Once the tax credits have been issued <em>on a property, </em>the owner can sell limited partnership interests <em>in the property </em>so that investors can take advantage of the tax credits allocated <em>to that </em>project.\u201d <em>(Griffin, supra, </em>324 F.3d 330, 354\u2014355, italics <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>added.) Moreover, the State Board is equally explicit that \u201cpreviously-claimed tax credits\u201d may be \u201cdisallowed\u201d if the project falls out of compliance with the terms of the developer\u2019s regulatory agreement with the state. (SBE Guidelines, <em>supra, </em>at p. 3; see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 4, \u00a7 10328, subd. (a).) This is hardly the unqualified finality one would ordinarily associate with a \u201csale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Courts across the country have, in the main, adopted this view of the LIHTC\u2019s existence and alienability. (E.g., <em>Brandon Bay v. Payette County </em>(2006) 142 Idaho 681 [132 P.3d 438, 441] [\u201cThe tax credits ... do not exist separate from an ownership right in the low-income housing.\u201d]; <em>Pine Pointe v. Lowndes County, etc. </em>(2002) 254 Ga.App. 197 [561 S.E.2d 860, 863] [\u201cif a property eligible for Section 42 tax credits is sold, then the subsequent owner ... is entitled to the future tax credits associated with the property\u201d]; <em>Rainbow Apartments v. PTAB, supra, </em>762 N.E.2d 534, 537 [\u201cThe benefit of a tax credit ... is entirely incidental . . .\u201d to ownership.].) More than 20 years ago the United States Supreme Court characterized as \u201cobvious\u201d the logic underlying the connection between ownership and the right to claim a tax credit. <em>(Randall, supra, </em>478 U.S. 647, 666.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Following that approach, Illinois courts have held that \u201cTax credits, as <em>Randall </em>instructs us, have no independent value in and of themselves; instead, they are an incidental benefit that investors receive when they purchase . . . their interest in a limited partnership. The investors cannot transfer or sell the tax credits separate from the [partnership interest] itself. The limited partnership did not \u2018sell\u2019 the tax credits to the investors; the tax credits remain exactly where they resided before ... in the limited partnership.\u201d <em>(Chicago </em>v. <em>Michigan Beach Housing Coop. </em>(1993) 242 Ill.App.3d 636 [182 Ill.Dec. 343, 609 N.E.2d 877, 886]; accord, <em>Rainbow Apartments v. PTAB, supra, </em>762 N.E.2d 534, 537.) We agree entirely. The arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Trades Council argues that state LIHTC\u2019s are \u201cthe equivalent of money\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (b)(1) because \u201cthey have an immediate and ascertainable cash value on a well-established syndication market\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>shown by the fact the state is aware that \u201cLIHTCs will immediately be converted to cash to pay for construction of the project.\u201d This may be so, but it is irrelevant. The fact that LIHTC\u2019s may indeed be marketable <em>by others, after </em>they have been allocated by the state, does not establish that they have a realizable monetary worth <em>to the state before </em>they are allocated. (See <em>Griffin, supra, </em>324 F.3d 330, 355 [\u201cthe only property interest the State has in the tax credits is purely abstract or theoretical, even after [the project] is completed\u201d].) Moreover, as previously established, it is actually interests in the property that are sold; the tax credits are merely an incidental feature of purchasing ownership. <em>(Chicago </em>v. <em>Michigan Beach Housing Coop., supra, </em>609 N.E.2d 877, 886; <em>Rainbow Apartments v. PTAB, supra, </em>762 N.E.2d 534, 537.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In arguing that LIHTC\u2019s amount to \u201can asset of value\u201d for purposes of subdivision(b)(3), Trades Council notes that \u201cCalifornia tax law was very recently amended to <em>exclude </em>the value of LIHTC\u2019s from the assessed value of real property. (Stats. 2004, ch. 786). If tax credits had no value as a matter of law, this recent tax statute would have been unnecessary.\u201d Not at all. The question had divided the courts of the nation (see <em>Huron Ridge </em>v. <em>Ypsilanti Twp </em>(2007) 275 Mich.App. 23 [737 N.W.2d 187] and decisions cited), so it would be eminently logical for the Legislature to provide a clear answer and resolve any uncertainty. Further, and as just noted, the fact that LIHTC\u2019s may acquire value in the hands of a subsequent holder does not establish that they had value before they were allocated by the state. In sum, we do not conclude that LIHTC\u2019s have \u201cno value as a matter of law\u201d for all time\u2014only that their allocation by the state is not a transfer \u201cof an asset of value for less than fair market value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Trades Council reasons that \u201cLIHTCs entitle the holder to a dollar-for-dollar offset of unrelated tax liabilities. To persons or [entities] with tax liabilities, who would otherwise be required to pay that money to the State, the tax credit is an \u2018asset of value\u2019 for which they are willing to pay.\u201d True enough, but the operative point is that the purchase price is not paid to the state. The value for which would-be buyers pay accrues when the LIHTC\u2019s come within the disposition of the developer for the project, not the state. It is from the developer, not the state, that \u201cpersons or entities with tax liabilities\u201d purchase an ownership interest in the underlying project. The buyer realizes the value of the tax credit only when\u2014and if\u2014the project is completed in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>timely fashion, becomes operational, and remains so for a number of years.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (See Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 50199.14, subd. (f); Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12206, subd. (c)(3)(C), 17058, subd. (c)(4)(C), 23610.5, subd. (c)(4)(C); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 4, \u00a7 10328, subd. (a); <em>Griffin, supra, </em>324 F.3d 330, 355.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Trades Council argues that \u201cThe LIHTCs were allocated to the Developer for no consideration,\u201d and were \u201cthus transferred for less than their fair market price.\u201d We are not persuaded. While we do not disagree with the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>court\u2019s conclusion that LIHTC\u2019s \u201care obviously an asset of value in some sense,\u201d the issue here is whether LIHTC\u2019s qualify as an asset of value to the state when they were allocated by CTCAC, acting for the state. We hold they do not. The value of the LIHTC\u2019s is at that point merely latent. Their potential for economic worth is not realized until after the project has been completed and they can be used to neutralize certain tax liabilities. Thus, the factual nexus between the allocation of the LIHTC\u2019s and the anticipated construction or alteration is at that moment in time only contingent, indirect, and incidental. <em>(Randall, supra, </em>478 U.S. 647, 656-659; <em>Chicago v. Michigan Beach Housing Coop., supra, </em>609 N.E.2d 877, 886.)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The situation is more akin to the loss of rent faced by the county in <em>McIntosh. </em>Concerning this forbearance of rent, we noted that \u201cThe county\u2019s right to charge rent is not an available pecuniary resource like cash or some readily cash-convertible asset.\u201d <em>(McIntosh, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 1576, 1588.) All we have to do is substitute \u201ccollect taxes\u201d for \u201ccharge rent\u201d and the reasoning is just as valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Trades Council and the State Treasurer as amicus curiae labor mightily, and creatively, to convince us that an LIHTC qualifies as \u201cthe equivalent of money\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (b)(1) or as \u201can asset of value\u201d within the meaning of subdivision (b)(3). And they are persuasive that tax credits are an important mechanism for achieving objectives the Legislature deems in the public interest. But their undoubted importance and utility is not at issue here. Tax credits operate to reduce <em>future </em>tax liability, and cannot be used until the low-income project is built and operating. (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 42(f)(1); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 4, \u00a7 10328, subd. (a).) Further, any worth the credits may have is obviously predicated on the taxpayer having tax liabilities to offset. In other words, the worth of LIHTC\u2019s is, at the time they are allocated by the CTCAC, speculative and contingent upon future conditions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>The United States Supreme Court has held that the mere receipt of a tax credit confers no economic benefit because the credits \u201chave no value in themselves.\u201d <em>(Randall, supra, </em>478 U.S. 647, 656-657.) We simply hold the converse\u2014that in this context LIHTC\u2019s when allocated to a proposed project likewise entail no actual diminution of the state\u2019s economic resources. It bears emphasis that the operative event here is the allocation of LIHTC\u2019s to a project not yet completed. There is nothing in our record that shows allocation is anything more than a promise or an administrative assignment, the mere movement of figures from one column to another. Nothing tangible, such as certificates evidencing ownership of a property interest in the project, is transferred or delivered to the developer. Any movement of LIHTC\u2019s is purely abstract, a matter at best of bureaucratic bookkeeping. LIHTC\u2019s are not property. Allocated LIHTC\u2019s represent only the possibility of future benefit that may be realized after construction or rehabilitation of the proposed project. (See <em>Randall, supra, </em>478 U.S. 647, 656-657; <em>Griffin, supra, </em>324 F.3d 330, 355.) We therefore hold that they do not amount to either the \u201cpayment of money or the equivalent of money\u201d within the scope of subdivision (b)(1)) or the transfer of \u201can asset of value for less than fair market value\u201d within the scope of subdivision (b)(3).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">In the course of their diligent examination of section 1720, the parties and amici curiae comment upon a number of flaws, inconsistencies, and peculiarities in the statute. So have we.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>As previously noted, the first proposed amendment to section 1720 used the broadly inclusive approach of \u201cincludes but is not limited to\u201d when framing the definition of \u201cpaid for in whole or in part out of public funds,\u201d but the final version employed the far more restrictive \u201cmeans.\u201d This precludes us from reading subdivision (b) as reaching subjects not specified within it, or otherwise brought within subdivision (b) by provisions of section 1720. This conclusion follows from a principle of statutory construction best enunciated by Division One of this District: \u201cThe rejection by the Legislature of a specific provision contained in an act as originally introduced is most persuasive to the conclusion that the act should not be construed to include the omitted provision.\u201d <em>(Rich </em>v. <em>State Board of Optometry </em>(1965) 235 Cal.App.2d 591, 607 [45 Cal.Rptr. 512]; <em>see Arden Carmichael, Inc. </em>v. <em>County of Sacramento </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 507, 516 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 248] [\u201c \u2018every word excluded from a statute must be presumed to have been excluded for a purpose\u2019 \u201d].) The Director asks us to reach the same result through application of the \u201c \u2018 \u201cfamiliar rule of construction . . . that where a statute enumerates things upon which it is to operate it is to be construed as excluding from its effect all those not expressly mentioned.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Capistrano Union High School Dist. v. Capistrano Beach Acreage Co. </em>(1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 612, 617 [10 Cal.Rptr. 750].)\u201d We understand the logic of this argument, but we need not formally invoke it here because there are other prudential considerations that persuade us the language of section 1720 in its current form cannot be construed to reach LIHTC\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Housing Development points out a number of specific statutes apart from section 1720 where the Legislature has expressly directed designated public works to comply with the prevailing wage law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The implication is that by not ordering compliance with the prevailing wage law in the statutes establishing the LIHTC program, the Legislature has decided not to require that compliance. We do not think it unduly significant that the LIHTC program does not have a similar stand-alone directive in its enabling statutes, because such an approach would strip section 1720 of much of any independent utility, and threaten it with desuetude, if not extinction. On the other hand, the tenor of the argument is correct in drawing our attention to the undoubted ability of the Legislature to resolve any statutory doubt or ambiguity when it is so minded. And, we note, it is significant that section 1720 has no such expression, an omission even more striking because of the express reference to the LIHTC program in subdivision (d)(3). We are not authorized to rewrite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>section 1720 to conform to an assumed intent the Legislature did not express. <em>(Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lucky Stores, Inc. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 573 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 731, 950 P.2d 1086]; <em>In re Hoddinott </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 992, 1002 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 706, 911 P.2d 1381].)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Trades Council also insists that the Legislature significantly revised section 1720 in 2001 \u201cin large part to overturn the <em>McIntosh </em>court\u2019s narrow construction of the word \u2018pay.\u2019... [f] .. . ['ll] Under the current version of \u00a7 1720 (b), the word \u2018pay\u2019 has a broad meaning that reflects economic reality, not the narrow meaning used in McIntosh.\u201d This is true, but only up to a point. The Legislature clearly intended to broaden the scope of section 1720 from the way it read at the time <em>McIntosh </em>was decided (see fn. 9, <em>ante), </em>but the revision was not as significant as Trades Council imagines.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Trades Council points to subdivision (c)(5), where the Legislature categorically excluded one type of tax credit as demonstrating that there is no comparable exclusion for LIHTC\u2019s. And, so it argues, \u201cIf tax credits were not subsumed within the basic ... \u00a7 1720 (b) definition, this exemption would have been wholly unnecessary. Hence, the adoption of this tax credit exemption at the same time that the coverage definition was expanded shows the Legislature intended the coverage definition to encompass [LIHTC\u2019s].\u201d This may be valid as a point of abstract logic, but it collides with other parts of section 1720.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">For one thing, if subdivision (c)(5) was meant to fulfill the function Trades Council assigns it, what is the intent behind subdivision (d)(3), which might be read as putting LIHTC\u2019s partly outside subdivision (b)? (We say \u201cpartly\u201d because of the dateline established in subdivision (d)(3), a matter to which we will return.) If, as Trades Council argues, the effect of subdivision (c)(5) brings LIHTC\u2019s within the ambit of subdivision (b), and if the Legislature truly meant to include LIHTC\u2019s within the definition of \u201cpaid for in whole or in part out of public funds,\u201d why did it simply not say in a manner that would remove any doubt, by using the precise language it did in subdivision (d)(3)?</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">But, as already noted in part III, both subdivision (b)(1) and (3) speak to the state or political subdivision parting with a thing possessing current value. Subdivision (b)(1), \u201cThe payment of money or the equivalent of money by the state or political subdivision,\u201d and subdivision (b)(3), \u201cTransfer by the state or political subdivision of an asset of value for less than fair market price,\u201d are couched in the present tense, and therefore would not ordinarily be thought to govern a future exchange or transfer. By contrast, such an intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>can be seen in subdivision (b)(5), where the Legislature placed within the definition \u201cMoney loaned by the state or political subdivision <em>that is to be repaid on a contingent basis.\" </em>(Italics added.) As also noted, subdivision (b)(6) speaks to \u201cCredits that are applied by the state or political subdivision against repayment obligations to the state or political subdivision.\u201d And \u201crepayment\u201d in this context can hardly refer to a private contract where no moneys are advanced by the state, and thus nothing to be \u201crepaid.\u201d If the Legislature had intended that LIHTC\u2019s be included with subdivision (b), one would naturally expect to see something like the language of subdivision (d)(3) in subdivision (b) . That absence cannot be without meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">It may be true, as the Treasurer points out, that by granting LIHTC\u2019s the state accepts it will \u201cforego\u201d tax revenues which would otherwise be owed to the state. If the logic of this point is conceded, one would expect to see the point addressed in subdivision (b)(4)\u2014which was obviously intended to abrogate part of our decision in McIntosh\u2014and which brings within the definition of \u201cpaid for in whole or in part out of public funds\u201d the following items of compensation that may be foregone: \u201cFees, costs, rents, insurance or bond premiums, loans, interest rates, or other obligations that would normally be required in the execution of the contract, that are paid, reduced, charged at less than market value, waived, or forgiven by the state or political subdivision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">It could be argued, as is done here, that the prevailing wage law is in fact a disincentive to expanding the supply of low-income housing, and that, aware of this, the Legislature intended subdivisions (c)(4), (6), and (d) to remove that disincentive. Logically, however, one might expect the exemption to be categorical. Subdivision (c)(1) has that degree of certainty, and subdivision (c) (6) only slightly less. Based on this, the Director argues that it would have been anomalous for the Legislature to have granted immunity for some types of low-income housing projects, but not for ones using LIHTC\u2019s. While it is not beyond the realm of possibility, or power, that the Legislature could adopt differing approaches to a matter as large and important as low-income housing, we would not adopt that conclusion without trepidation. If there is a logical line of division, we cannot discern it. The matter is further complicated by the peculiar nature of subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Mention has already been made of the unusual language in subdivision (d). It directs that \u201cresidential rental projects,\u201d \u201c[sjingle-family residential projects,\u201d and \u201c[l]ow-income housing projects\u201d financed with bonds, mortgage certificates, or LIHTC\u2019s in accordance with specified federal and state statutes \u201con or before December 31, 2003,\u201d \u201cshall not, solely by reason of [section 1720], be subject to\u201d the prevailing wage law. (\u00a7 1720, subd. (d).) This, Trades Council argues, shows a legislative compromise not to apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>prevailing wage law to projects that had already started or were imminently to be started so as not to jeopardize projects already financed on the assumption that prevailing wages would not have to be paid. While this is, as the trial court noted, a plausible explanation,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> there are difficulties with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">For one thing, if projects commenced before December 31, 2003, are to be treated as exempt from the prevailing wage law \u201csolely\u201d because LIHTC\u2019s have been allocated, it might logically follow that a different rule was intended for projects commenced after that date? More specifically, does it mean that projects begun after January 1, 2004, do not enjoy a like exemption? Such a clear chronological delineation naturally suggests a distinction of some sort, and what is a more logical distinction than a not covered/covered dichotomy?</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">This is how Trades Council views the matter, noting that \u201cit would be strange for the Legislature to focus on exempting LIHTC-funded projects for a limited time if LIHTCs themselves did not trigger prevailing wage coverage.\u201d The Director responds that \u201cThe effect of the expiration of the sunset date is not that LIHTCs became payment out of public funds, but rather that after that date, each source of funding for a project has to be examined against the definition in section 1720 (b). In other words, a project allocated LIHTCs after December 31, 2003, may be subject to prevailing wage requirements if it receives other forms of financial assistance that are enumerated by section 1720 (b).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Neither of these arguments is completely satisfying. The problem with the Director\u2019s position is that it simply begs the question of whether, after January 1, 2004, LIHTC\u2019s are covered by the definitional provisions of subdivision (b), which is where we came in. It begs the additional question of why, if this was its intent, the Legislature did not simply use language comparable to the permanent exclusion it established for a different tax credit program in subdivision (c)(5)? Here again, the difficulty with acceding to the arguments of Housing Development and the Director is that the very precision used for subdivision (c)(5) cautions against implying that level of precision with respect to LIHTC\u2019s. (See <em>Brown, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d 711, 725.) As one Court of Appeal noted in a different statutory context, \u201cThe Legislature knows how to speak the language and they used it.\u201d <em>(People v. Palomar </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 131, 134 [214 Cal.Rptr. 785].) But not in subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>The difficulty with the way in which Trades Council reads subdivision (d)(3) is simply one of proportionality. To accept it, we must accept that the fact that the Legislature in effect made subdivision (d)(3) an oblique way of introducing LIHTC\u2019s allocated after January 1, 2004, into the general definition of \u201cpaid for in whole or in part out of public funds.\u201d We would need much stronger proof that the Legislature played such a sleight-of-hand game.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Courts do not lightly conclude that substantial statutory changes are intended or accomplished by legislative misdirection. At the federal level, the United States Supreme Court has observed that \u201c \u2018Congress . . . does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions\u2014it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u2019 <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>American Trucking Assns. </em>531 U. S. 457, 468 [149 L.Ed.2d 1, 121 S.Ct. 903] (2001); see <em>FDA </em>v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. </em>529 U. S. 120, 160 [146 L.Ed.2d 121, 120 S.Ct. 1291] (2000) (\u2018[W]e are confident that Congress could not have intended to delegate a decision of such economic and political significance ... in so cryptic a fashion\u2019).\u201d <em>(Gonzales </em>v. <em>Oregon </em>(2006) 546 U.S. 243, 267 [163 L.Ed.2d 748, 126 S.Ct. 904].) California courts have adopted a similar skepticism. <em>(Garcia </em>v. <em>McCutchen </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 469, 482 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 319, 940 P.2d 906]; <em>In re Christian S. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 768, 782 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 33, 872 P.2d 574]; <em>Ailanto Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Half Moon Bay </em>(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 572, 589 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 340]; <em>Pleasant Hill Bayshore Disposal, Inc. </em>v. <em>Chip-It Recycling, Inc. </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 678, 690, fn. 7 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 708].) Thus, we cannot view subdivision (d)(3) as a shoehorn for inserting LIHTC\u2019s into subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The preceding discussion has shown that existing law prior to the 2001 amendments to section 1720 did not treat tax credits as tangible property akin to expenditure of public funds. That consensus has only increased since then. We do not believe that the Legislature\u2019s insertion of the generic term \u201ccredits\u201d into subdivision (b) meant to diverge from this widespread agreement.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This conclusion is only fortified by consulting subdivision (c), where the Legislature made explicit reference to a specific type of tax credit, and subdivision (d)(3), where it made a highly opaque reference to the LIHTC program. We cannot treat all of these differing references as synonyms. <em>(People v. Nguyen, supra, </em>21 Cal.4th 197, 205; <em>Brown, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d 711, 725.) If there are blanks or gaps in section 1720, it is not for us to fill them. <em>(Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th 553, 573, <em>In re Hoddinott, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th 992, 1002.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>CONCLUSION AND DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">California courts accept that tax credits are, for all practical intents, \u201ca matter of legislative grace,\u201d which the Legislature \u201cmay grant or deny ... in any manner it sees fit, . . . and the scope, application, and terms of eligibility are entirely for the Legislature to establish.\u201d <em>(General Motors Corp. v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 773, 790 [47 Cal.Rptr.3d 233, 139 P.3d 1183].) The Legislature has decided to join with the federal government to enlarge the stock of low-income housing by using LIHTC\u2019s as an inducement for private parties to help achieve what is deemed to be in the public good. But did the Legislature when it amended section 1720 intend that LIHTC\u2019s were to be used as one of the instruments for expanding the ambit of the prevailing wage law?</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">There are weighty arguments and worthy goals arrayed on each side. Trades Council and the State Treasurer, citing the rule of liberal construction traditionally afforded the prevailing wage law <em>(City of Long Beach, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th 942, 949-950; <em>McIntosh, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 1576, 1589), see the issue as the threatened frustration of the clear statutory mandate to apply the prevailing wage law to a category of residential construction that would not exist but for the gift of LIHTC\u2019s. The Director, Housing Development, the Building Industry Association, and the Redevelopment Association are eloquent in describing what they perceive will be the adverse impact of extending the prevailing wage law to future projects, thereby reducing the willingness of developers to expand the stock of low-income housing. These are issues of high public policy. To choose between them, or to strike a balance between them, is the essential function of the Legislature, not a court. \u201cOur role is confined to ascertaining what the Legislature has actually done, not assaying whether sound policy might support a different rule.\u201d <em>(General Motors Corp. v. Franchise Tax Bd., supra, </em>39 Cal.4th 773, 790.)</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The rule of liberal construction is subject to an important proviso: \u201c \u2018Courts will liberally construe prevailing wage statutes [citations], but they cannot interfere where the Legislature has demonstrated the ability to make its intent clear and chosen not to act [citation].\u2019 \u201d <em>(City of Long Beach, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th 942, 950, quoting <em>McIntosh, supra, </em>14 Cal.App.4th 1576, 1589; accord, <em>Peralta Community College Dist. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1990) 52 Cal.3d 40, 50 [276 Cal.Rptr. 114, 801 P.2d 357].) Ultimately, this is how we deal with section 1720.  Subdivision (c)(5) demonstrates that the Legislature knew how to craft a categorical exemption for a project connected to a statutory tax credit. Subdivision (d)(3) demonstrates that the Legislature knew about, and knew how to address, the LIHTC programs at issue here. The fact that it did not do so tips the scales.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The purported appeals from the writ of mandate are dismissed.

Low Income Housing Tax Credits. In addition, States may qualify for a pro rata share of credits available annually in a national pool comprised of states\u2019 unused credits. Also, any credits returned to a state from a credit recipient may be allocated to new projects. From the total amount available to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>California, the Committee allocates credit amounts based upon assessments of eligible project costs, as defined by IRC Section 42. The housing sponsor uses or sells ten times the allocation amount, since investors can take the annual credit each year for a ten-year period.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\"> The 2007 CTCAC publication also states that the California program was begun in 1987. State LIHTC\u2019s are \u201conly available to a project which has previously received, or is concurrently receiving, an allocation of federal credits. Thus the state program does not stand alone, but instead, supplements the federal tax credit program.\u201d According to CTCAC, the \u201cannual state credit ceiling for 2007 is approximately $80 million and would be increased by any unused or returned credits from previous years. Investors claim the state credit over a four-year period, rather than the ten-year federal allocation period.

But the legal form of the transaction does not reflect this treatment. Petitioners purchased securities, thereby acquiring freely alienable rights to any income that accrued to them by virtue of their ownership. <em>They did not, however, also acquire a separate, freely transferable bundle of tax losses that would have value apart from [their] status as partners. </em>For obvious reasons, tax . . . credits are not, in the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, freely transferable from one person to another if wholly severed from the property or activity to which they relate . . . .\u201d (Randall, <em>supra, </em>478 U.S. 647, 665-666, italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\"> Trades Council requests that we take judicial notice of various documents concerning the details of the HB Housing project and the LIHTC program.

Moreover, even after the reservation of tax credits, the amount of such reservation may be adjusted if, upon the initial and subsequent feasibility determinations, [CJTCAC determines that the Project received more credits than are necessary for financial feasibility of the Project. In addition, [CjTCAC may rescind a reservation of credits in the event that the maximum amount of credits available is insufficient for financial feasibility of the Project.\u201d The signature of its chief financial officer reflected HB Housing\u2019s acceptance of these terms and conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">In fairness to the trial court, we feel compelled to note that the material produced before it was far less developed than is the record on appeal we have examined.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\"> Quoting <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 36, 40 [286 Cal.Rptr. 453], the SEE Guidelines state that a tax credit provides \u201ca dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax liability.\u201d (SEE Guidelines, <em>supra, </em>at p. 1, fn. 2.) There is reason to doubt the absolute accuracy of this zero-sum assessment. First, as already noted, the tax credit has utility as on offset only if the taxpayer has other liabilities to offset. Second, the LIHTC applies to most, but not all, tax liabilities; according to the State Treasurer: \u201cThe credits may be used to reduce the tax liability arising out of personal income taxes, bank or corporate taxes or insurance taxes . . . .\u201d Finally, the idea of LIHTC\u2019s as seed money for desired economic development would clearly seem to indicate that the credits would have a ripple effect, that is, they would generate many kinds of taxable transactions or events that would inure to the state\u2019s financial benefit. The United States Supreme Court recently declined to see the fiscal impact of tax credits as entirely negative: \u201c[I]t is unclear that tax breaks of the sort at issue here do in fact deplete the treasury: The very point of the tax benefits is to spur economic activity, which in turn <em>increases </em>government revenues.\u201d <em>(DaimlerChrysler Corp. </em>v. <em>Cuno </em>(2006) 547 U.S. 332, 344 [164 L.Ed.2d 589, 126 S.Ct. 1854].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b340-8\"> We do not find it obligatory to decide whether this type of transaction also involves \u201c[cjonstruction ... or repair work\u201d that is \u201cdone under contract,\u201d the two other predicates specified in subdivision (a). In the trial court proceedings, Trades Council took it as a given that the proposed Woodhaven project \u201cunquestionably involves \u2018construction\u2019 that is \u2018done under contract.\u2019 \u201d Housing Development was equally emphatic the other way: \u201cThe State . . . does not enter into or \u2018award\u2019 a contract allowing tax credits. Nor ... did the State put out to bid construction of the Woodhaven low-income housing project or enter into a contract for the construction of that project.\u201d The Director did not address either issue in his opposing papers. And in its order granting Trades Council\u2019s petition for the writ, the trial court did not consider whether allocation of LIHTC\u2019s by CTCAC amounted to a contract for construction or repair work, and neither issue was addressed by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Although Housing Development does mention both issues in its opening brief, we see no need to pick up that invitation. Although it would appear that both issues could be considered here because they are purely legal and do not involve contested issues of fact, whether we elect to address them is a matter entrusted to our discretion. <em>(Sea &amp; Sage Audubon Society, Inc. v.

We decline to reach these issues because they have not been fully developed in the trial court papers or in the appellate briefs. Most significantly, they are not necessary for a decision here: if resolved favorably to the Director and Housing Development, they would simply be additional reasons for reversal; on the other hand, if resolved against the Director and Housing Development, reversal would still be required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b341-6\"> Housing Development cites Fish and Game Code section 1350; Government Code sections 5956.8, 63036; Health and Safety Code sections 50675.4, 50898.2, 125290.65; Penal Code section 7010; Public Contract Code section 20672; Public Utilities Code section 3354; and Streets and Highways Code section 27189.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b344-9\"> It is possible to view subdivision (d)(3) as in the nature of a \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d or as establishing a grace period of deferred operation.
