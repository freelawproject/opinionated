The transcript shows that defendant was addressed through an interpreter. His assent to or knowledge of the admission is not shown by the record. By our statutes defendant\u2019s attorney could not plead <em>guilty </em>for him; <em>ergo, </em>how could the attorney admit a fact establishing defendant\u2019s guilt? (Wood\u2019s Digest, 293, sec. 301; 4 Cal. 238.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b532-9\">Our Federal Constitution says that a party charged with crime shall be confronted on the trial with the witnesses against him. (U. S. Const., Art. VI\u2014amendments; Green-leaf on Evidence, Vol. 3, sec. 39.) The only exception to this rule is in cases of <em>dying declarations. (People </em>v. <em>Glenn, </em>6 Cal.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b532-10\"><em>J. G.

They were solemn admissions in open Court; made on the trial, and taken as part of the proofs of the case. The defendant may waive a constitutional privilege, except only in capital cases perhaps. (1 Whar. Crim. Law, sec. 591, <em>e.) </em>But these cases go upon the theory of benefit to the prisoner\u2014that when asked he may fear injury to his cause unless he consent to a waiver, and he will not be permitted to consent his life away. Here, the defendant actually forced the State to accept his admissions. Besides, these cases only go to the waiver of a constitutional privilege, and not to the admission of facts, which the State otherwise would be bound to prove. The defendant or <em>Ms counsel </em>may admit such a fact in open Court at the trial. (3 Greenlf. on Evidence, sec. 39; <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Thornhill, </em>8 Car. &amp; Payne, 575; <em>People </em>v. Hobson, 17 Cal. 425-431; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bruzzo, </em>24 Cal. 41.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b533-4\">By the Court, Sawyer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">There was no error in overruling the demurrer to the indictment. The property is alleged to have been brought into Tuolumne County, and the offense was indictable in that county. (Wood\u2019s Digest, 277, secs. 87-92.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The offense is charged in the language of the Act defining it, (Wood\u2019s Digest, 339, sec. 70,) and the circumstances under which it was committed are fully set out. This has repeatedly been held to be sufficient under our statute, without using the word \u201c feloniously.\u201d (6 Cal. 487 ; 7 Cal. 403 ; 10 Cal. 309 ; 14 Cal. 30 ; 19 Cal. 601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">On the 20th of January the District Attorney filed an affidavit, stating that a witness for the prosecution, who had been subpcenaed, was absent, and the facts which he expected to prove by him, and asked a postponement of the trial. The prisoner\u2019s counsel opposed the postponement, and offered to admit the facts expected to be proved by the absent witness, and thereupon made, and permitted to be entered upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>records of the Court, an admission \u201c that the property mentioned in the indictment was intrusted to the defendant by Edward C. Bell, to take to the ranch in Merced County. * * And that the value thereof is as set forth in the indictment.\u201d Upon the entry of this admission upon the records, the Court denied the motion to postpone the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">On the 21st the case was called for trial. Again the defendant\u2019s attorney, in the presence of the defendant in open Court, \u25a0 admitted the same facts, and consented that the admission be again entered on the records of the Court, which was accordingly done. '</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">After examining several witnesses on the part of the prosecution whose testimony tended to prove the same and other facts, the District Attorney, without objection by the defendant, read to the jury from the records of the Court the admissions thus made and entered, and rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">After the District Attorney had made his opening argument to the jury, and during the argument of defendant\u2019s counsel, the counsel for defendant, for the first time, asked the Court to strike from the testimony the admissions read in evidence as before stated, on the ground that the testimony was illegal and incompetent. The Court refused to strike out, but no exception was taken to the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The defendant\u2019s counsel, at the close of the argument, asked the Court, substantially, to charge the jury to disregard the said admissions read in evidence, which the Court refused to do, but no exception was taken to the refusal. The admission of this evidence, and the several subsequent rulings in regard to it, are assigned as error. The admission was a solemn admission of record of a fact at the commencement of the trial, and for the purposes of the trial, by the prisoner\u2019s counsel in open \u00bb Court, in his presence, and we must presume with his consent. And the admission was on the trial read from the record, in pursuance of the purpose for which the admission and record were made, without any objection on the part of the prisoner. An admission of a fact made at the trial in open Court by the prisoner or his counsel may be properly considered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>jury, (3 Greenl. Ev., Sec. 39; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>17 Cal. 425\u2014 431,) and such we consider this to be. No exception was taken to the subsequent rulings in regard to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">We cannot presume that the charge was oral. The presumption is that the action of the Court was in pursuance of the law, and that the charge was in writing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ching Let, </em>17 Cal. 322.) If the Court gave the charge orally, the \u25a0 fact should appear in the record. The strong implication from the record is that the charge of the Court was in writing. For it appears that the Court at first gave a written charge, asked by the District Attorney, with an oral explanation, to which defendant excepted because the explanation was not in writing, whereupon the Court withdrew the instruction and oral explanation, reduced the same to writing, and read them to the jury as written, directing the jury to disregard them as first given. It does not appear that any oral charge was given other than as just stated. If there had been, the Court, after what occurred, would undoubtedly have corrected the error. We think it was competent for the Court to correct the error at the time, in the manner shown by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">No other point requires notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
