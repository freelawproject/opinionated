Upon a jury verdict the trial court rendered a judgment for petitioner, which was reversed by the Court of Civil Appeals and the cause remanded. 245 S. W. 2d 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">The only question both in the Court of Civil Appeals and here is whether the trial court properly refused to admit in evidence a compromise settlement agreement signed by both parties before this suit was filed but never approved by the Industrial Accident Board. The body of this agreement was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-10\">\u201cOn the 3rd day of November, 1949, Joe Brannam sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>injury while employed by J. F. Pritchard &amp; Company, which employer was insured under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of Texas by TEXAS EMPLOYERS\u2019 INSURANCE ASSOCIATION.

Stack\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-16\">INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENT BOARD RECEIVED: FEB. 7, 1950 STATE OF TEXAS\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-17\">When this instrument was offered petitioner objected to its admission \u201cbecause it is certainly hearsay. An offer for an oral compromise is never admissible.\u201d He further urged that it \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>inadmissible for the reason that it could never be binding upon the plaintiff until approved by the Industrial Accident Board as provided by Statute and that such instrument was an offer of compromise which was not carried out by the parties thereto and which was ineffectual to bind the plaintiff in any manner.\u201d Respondent stated that it was offered as an \u201cadmission against interest and not for the purpose of being binding, and for impeachment purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Respondent admits the general rule that offers of compromise are not admissible in evidence, but contend that the principle does not apply to a completed agreement for a compromise although the agreement is later repudiated by one of the parties ; that while petitioner\u2019s repudiation of the compromise agreement plus the consequent refusal by the Industrial Accident Board to approve it did prevent the instrument from becoming a contract, nevertheless those facts did not destroy its effect as an admission against interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">1 In support of this contention respondent cites the text from 31 C.J.S., Evidence, sec. 284, which declares: \u201cAs a general rule, a written statement is none the less competent as an admission because it is contained in a document ineffective for the purpose for which it was made.\u201d However, the subject matter there under consideration is not offers of compromise, that being dealt with in 31 C. J. S. Evidence, secs. 285 et seq. We believe the true rule is stated in sec. 290 (31 C.J.C., Evidence) as follows: \u201cIt is usually considered that the rule excluding evidence of offers of compromise does not apply to a completed agreement for a compromise, and that such agreement, <em>unless for some reason void, </em>is ordinarily admissible.\u201d (Italics ours.) Paraphrased, that language means that the rule excluding offers of compromise applies as well to completed compromise agreements when the latter are void.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">2 Under the decisions of this court, compromise agreements settling compensation claims are void and wholly ineffective unless and until approved by the Industrial Accident Board; and claimant has the right at any time before the Board\u2019s approval to withdraw from the agreement for any reason satisfactory to himself. Petroleum Casualty Co. v. Lewis (Civ. App.) 63 S. W. 2d 1066, error refused, cited with approval in Commercial Casualty Ins. Co. v. Hilton, 126 Texas, 497, 87 S. W. 2d 1081 and 89 S. W. 2d 1116. This is because Art. 8307, sec. 12, Vernon\u2019s Anno. Civ. Stat., provides, \u201cWhere the liability of the association or the extent of the injury of the employee is uncertain, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>indefinite or incapable of being satisfactorily established the Board may approve any compromise, adjustment, settlement or commutation thereof made between \u2022 the panties.\u201d Texas Emp. Ins. Association v. Miller, 137 Texas, 449, 154 S. W. 2d 450. Therefore, the agreement in question.- here falls, within the rule-above stated that void compromise agreements are; not;admissible. \u25a0 ;</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00ab* &gt; - Besides 31 C.J.S., Evidence, sec. 284, supra, respondent cites in support of its contention Reese v. McVittie, 119 Colo 29, 200 Pac. 2d 390; Lane v. Miller Lbr. Co. et al, 101 Okla. 14, 222 Pad, 968,; and Dugger v. Kelly 168 Ia. 129, 150 N.W., 27. But the agreements there offered did not require approval by any governmental iagency to - make them' effective nor wa\"s there: any claim that they were in any manner invalid, hence those cases have no bearing on' the issue \u00e1t bar. '</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Other cases cited by respondent hold that statements made by the claimant and filed with the Industrial- Accident Board in support of his claim are admissible. Obviously, they likewise have no relation to our question.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">3 \u201e But respondent insists that it was admissible even though not a valid, contract \u201cas a written statement evidencing petitioner\u2019s attitude in respect to the nature and extent of his injuries at the time the statement.was made.\u201d And in this connection it asserts that he had made no avowal of injuries to his back nor of any total and permanent disability until he testified on the trial of this case. Be that as it may, the entire context of the instrument refutes any intent on the part of .petitioner to state the nature and extent of his \u201e injuries or the amount of his damages \u201cfor any other purpose than compromise.\u201d Sullivan v. Missouri, K. <em>&amp; </em>T. Ry. Co. of Texas, 110 Texas, 360, 220 S. W. 769. For the converse of the situation in the Sullivan case, see Sanford v. John Finnigan Co. (Civ, App.) 169 S, W. 624, error, refused, wherein it is said, \u201cThere is nothing rin the letter: (objected to as an offer of compromise) that- indicates that .the statements therein would not have been made except to bring about a compromise.\u201d In Bedner v. Federal Underewriters Exchange (Civ. App.), 133 S. W. 2d,214, er. dism., cor. judgt., it was held that checks-given the claimant for weekly compensa-, tion at $17,13 per week, as advance payments \u2018\u2018upon a compro-\u00bb mise settlement of the claim in suit which-for some reason failed of .consummation',\u2019\u2019 did not: constitute an- admission by claimant of what'the deceased\u2019s average weekly wage was and was inad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>missible because it involved an unsuccessful effort at compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\">We conclude that the trial court correctly excluded the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Therefore, the judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals is reversed and that of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Opinion delivered April 9, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Rehearing overruled May 7, 1952.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
