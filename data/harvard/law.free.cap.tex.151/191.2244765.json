Houston Transit Co. v. Felder, 146 Texas 428,208 S.W. 2d 880; Missouri Pac. Ry.Co.v. Porter, 73 Texas 304, 11 S.W. 324; Texas &amp; Pac. Ry. Co. v.

B. Houghland. Both respondent and Houghland were employees of petitioner, respondent being a brakeman and baggageman and Houghland being a special agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-16\">The principal question in the case is whether Houghland, in striking respondent, was acting within the scope of his employment. The jury in answer to special issues found that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Houghland accosted respondent he did so in pursuance of one or more of his duties as agent of petitioner, the railway company; that he struck respondent without cause or provocation; that respondent did not provoke or invite the blows, and that at the time of the altercation Houghland was not off duty. Judgment was rendered in respondent\u2019s favor against petitioner for $7400.00. Petitioner filed a motion for an instructed verdict, and after verdict a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto. The Court of Civil Appeals, after reviewing the evidence fully, reached the conclusion that a jury issue was raised and affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. 241 S. W. 2d 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">1 The first point of error in the application for the writ is that the Court of Civil Appeals erred in holding that there is evidence raising an issue whether C. B. Houghland was acting in the furtherance of his duties for petitioner at the time he struck respondent. In considering and deciding the question presented by the point, we follow the familiar rule, referred to in the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals, that credit is to be given to all evidence favorable to respondent, every legitimate conclusion favorable to him indulged, and all adverse evidence disregarded. Wininger v. Fort Worth &amp; D. C. Ry. Co., 105 Texas 56, 58, 143 S. W. 1150</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Both respondent and Houghland testified at length about their acts and conversations prior to the time of the last encounter and about what was said and done in that encounter. There are no important conflicts except in their testimony as to what was said just before Houghland struck respondent. Houghland ceased to be an employee of petitioner more than two years before this case was tried. He was called as a witness by respondent, who insists that he was an adverse witness, and that the jury could disregard any part of his testimony even though uncontradicted. The Court of Civil Appeals sustained that contention, saying that it seemed clear that Houghland was a hostile and adverse witness, apparently basing its conclusion on the fact that Houghland was charged with making and did make an assault on respondent. In view of the disposition that in our opinion can correctly be made of the case without reference to Houghland\u2019s testimony, it is unnecessary either to approve or disapprove the ruling of the Court of Civil Appeals that Houghland was an adverse witness. It may not be inappropriate to say here, without discussing Houghland\u2019s testimony in detail, that if believed it would show that at the time he accosted respondent and struck him he was not on duty for petitioner, being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>then \u201coff\u201d for two days; that he had prior to that time closed the investigation Of the loss of the jewelry out of which the ill feeling between him and respondent arose; that he accosted respondent only to discuss a personal grievance which he understood respondent had against him; and that he struck respondent in resentment of a grievous personal insult spoken by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\">Respondent Hagenloh resided in El Paso. He worked as a brakeman on petitioner\u2019s freight trains between El Paso and Toyah, and at times he worked as a baggage man on petitioner\u2019s passenger trains between El Paso and Big Spring. Houghland resided in Toyah and worked for petitioner as a special agent, his territory extending from El Paso to Big Spring and south out of Pecos to Balmorhea, and from Monahans north to Loving-ton, New Mexico. Respondent\u2019s briefs indicate that he relies upon Houghland\u2019s testimony as to the nature and extent of his duties and authority, and Houghland\u2019s testimony seems to be the only direct evidence of the same. He testified that it was his duty to protect all property, to investigate trespasses, personal injuries at railroad crossings, claims for damages to stock, and other claims for damages, and that when claims were made for missing baggage or other property it was his duty to take care of the claims and to undertake to find the missing property, and that in the performance of those duties he \u201cwas given pretty much of a free hand within reason\u201d, but had to go by the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">The following statement of what occurred between respondent and Houghland is taken from respondent\u2019s testimony. Respondent first became acquainted with Houghland about Christmas of 1946, when Houghland entered the baggage car and without introducing himself looked at the baggage here and there and looked through the \u201cpigeon holes\u201d against the wall where company mail, little packages and registered mail were carried. In January, 1947, Houghland continued the inspections and also went through respondent\u2019s brief case which contained company material such as forms, envelopes, clips and pencils. The inspections continued until the middle of June, 1947. At some time during that period, the date not definitely shown, Houghland went through respondent\u2019s little suitcase or overnight bag in which he kept extra clothes. Houghland told him at that time that, something had been missing when respondent\u2019s car came into El Paso, and asked him whether he knew anything about the missing articles. Respondent answered that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>In March, 1947, the owner of three pieces of baggage, picked up by respondent at Pecos and checked for California, changed her mind and requested that the baggage be taken off at El Paso. Respondent placed the baggage at the door' with other El Paso baggage and left the car for his home, being relieved of his duty as soon as the train stopped \"at El Paso. About a week later at Toyah Houghland told respondent that some jewelry was missing from that baggage. He did not accuse respondent of taking the jewelry, but asked him whether he knew anything about it, since he was the only one who had handled the baggage. Respondent told Houghland that he knew nothing about it, and he testified that he did not take anything that belonged to the woman or to the railway company. After that incident Houghland contined to enter respondent\u2019s car and inspect his baggage as well as the company\u2019s baggage. Respondent complained to Mr. Bishop, superintendent of special agents, telling him about Houghland\u2019s investigations and statements as to the missing jewelry.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Two or three weeks after the incident of the missing jewelry Houghland and two other men, who represented themselves as F.B.I. agents, called at respondent\u2019s home in the early evening. Houghland said that they came in connection with \u201cthat baggage deal\u201d, and that they would-like to go through respondent\u2019s house. Although they had no search warrant, respondent invited them to come into the house. They did not enter the house, but asked him for his baggage reports of about the time when the property was missing. He gave them the reports except one sheet, which he had mailed to his \u201cboss\u201dor the \u201ctimekeeper\u2019-\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">There were other searches by Houghland and sometime in June respondent made a report to Mr. French, assistant superintendent of .the railway company, telling him of the searches and of the visit made by Houghland and the F.B.I. agents to his home, and requesting French to have an investigation made by the railway company and the employees\u2019 brotherhood. French promised to \u201ccheck into it\u201d and let him know. Respondent did not hear from French.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Later Houghland entered respondent\u2019s baggage car when the train stopped at Monahans and again went through the company\u2019s mail in the \u201cpigeon holes\u201d and respondent\u2019s\" brief case\". Houghland then started to look into respondent\u2019s \u201clittle personal suitcase\u201d and had laid his hands on it, when respondent turned and grabbed it and told Houghland that he was getting tired of his looking through his personal baggage and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>could not look through it. Thereupon Houghland stepped to the car door and asked Mr. Bishop, his immediate superior who was standing outside of the door, to come into the car and told him that he was trying to go through respondent\u2019s suitcase and respondent would not let him inspect it. Bishop thereupon told Houghland \u201cif you have anything against Hagenloh, find out about it and settle with him after he gets off of the train, after you are through working.\u201d Houghland pointed his finger at respondent and said: \u201cI am going to find out; that is exactly what I am going to do.\u201d When respondent\u2019s train arrived at Big Sprping he \u201cwas pretty much excited\u201d and reported the Monahans incident to Mr. Brannon, division superintendent, and begged him to have an investigation made. He got no report from Brannon. Respondent testified that he was tired of being aggravated, that he resented the fact that Houghland went through his personal belongings, and that he became angry when Houghland at Monahans looked into the \u201cpigeon holes,\u201d went through the brief case, and finally went into his own suitcase.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\">Several days after the Monahans incident, from two to five days according to respondent\u2019s testimony, respondent completed a \u201crun\u201d as brakeman on a freight train from El Paso to Toyah, arriving at Toyah at 8:30 P.M. He left his brief case and lantern in the yard office and went across the street to a cafe. After eating he left the cafe and started to go back across the street and across the tracks to the depot for his bag, intending then to go to his rooming house. When he was walking up the street or road after leaving the cafe and had reached a point about forty feet north of the railroad tracks, he heard someone call him. He stopped, and Houghland came to him and said: \u201cI want to talk to you about the baggage incident.\u201d Respondent said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that this is the place to talk about it. I would like to have an investigation, which I have asked for, and probably will get.\u201d Then in the words of respondent\u2019s testimony the following: \u201cHe said T don\u2019t need an investigation. I have made up my mind to find out right now, right here, right now.\u2019 He said \u2018you are a thief and you belong in the penitentiary.\u2019 And I said \u2014 I don\u2019t remember just the exact words, I said \u2018well, how come?\u2019 And he said \u2018Judge Schmidt told me.\u2019 And I said \u2018that is a lie.\u2019 With that, as I was talking to him, had started around and trying to walk in the same direction I had originally started, turned away from him and when I said \u2018that is a lie,\u2019 he hauled out and hit me with his right hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">The blow was struck on the back of respondent\u2019s head, on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>part of his ear. It staggered him but did not knock him down. He ran toward the depot pursued by Houghland, who struck him again and knocked him down as he entered the door of the depot.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">J. R. Cobb, an employee of petitioner, was called as a witness by respondent. He testified that while engaged in making up a train as a brakeman he saw the two men running and followed them to the door of the depot, where he heard Houghland \u201ccussing\u201d respondent and saying to him \u201cI\u2019ll teach you to call me a liar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">2 After careful examination of the record and the applicable authorities, and bearing in mind the rule stated at the beginning of this opinion for testing the evidence in the consideration of a motion for peremptory instruction, we are of the opinion that it is not reasonably to be inferred from Houghland\u2019s words and conduct on the night of the assault as described in respondent\u2019s testimony or from that testimony and any other evidence in the record, that Houghland in accosting respondent and assaulting him was acting within the scope of his employment or in pursuance of his duties or in the furtherance of petitioner\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">3 The case is one of assault by an employee, and the ultimate question is whether the employer should be held responsible for the consequences of the assault. It is not ordinarily within the scope of a servant\u2019s authority to commit an assault on a third person. 57 C.J.S., p. 341, Sec. 575. And the cases in which liability has been imposed upon the master for assault by his servant are comparatively few. Usually assault is the expression of personal animosity and is not for the purpose of carrying out the master\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The nature of the employment may be such as necessarily to involve at times the use of force, as where the employee\u2019s duty is to guard the employer\u2019s property and to protect it from trespassers, so that the act of using force may be in furtherance of the employer\u2019s business, making him liable even when greater force is used than is necessary. International &amp; G.N.Ry.Co. v. Anderson, 82 Texas 516, 17 S. W. 1039, cited in the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals, sets out the rules applicable when that is the nature of the employment. A brakeman on the railway company\u2019s freight train, in ejecting a trespasser from the train struck him and caused him to fall under the wheels. The court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>stating the law of.the case, said that the master may be liable for the act of the servant even, though the master has expressly forbidden the particular act, and added: \u201cBut the act must be done within the scope of the general authority of the servant in furtherance of the master\u2019s business, and for the accomplishment of the object for which the servant is employed.\u201d It was held that the trial court\u2019s charge was erroneous because its effect was to place the burden upon the railway company to prove that the brakeman who ejected the trespasser was not acting within the scope of his employment, whereas the burden Was on the plaintiff to prove the facts which would entitle him to recover, including proof that the servant who did the wrong was acting within the scope of his employment. The plain implication of the opinion is that the railway company would have been liable had such proof been made by the plaintiff, that is, if the plaintiff had proved that the brakeman had authority to eject trespassers.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\">In this case the evidence is that Houghland was a special agent of petitioner, whose duties were to protect petitioner\u2019s property, investigate trespassers, claims and damages, and for missing baggage or other property and undertake to find missing property. In his acts in relation to respondent Houghland was not engaged in protecting the railway company\u2019s property from trespass or otherwise. He was investigating for the purpose of finding property missing from baggage. His duties in that respect were hot of \u25a0 such nature as to involve the use of force, and there is no evidence in the record tending to prove that he was authorized to use force in the performance of those duties. And so it Seems that in this respect respondent failed to prove a fact essential to recovery by him against petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">However, when we look to all of the evidence bearing upon Houghland\u2019s conduct in relation to respondent, what was done and what was said, we believe that the only reasonable conclusi\u00f3n is that in accosting and striking respondent Houghland was not acting in furtherance of petitioner\u2019s business, but was carrying on an enmity that had developed between him and respondent to gratify personal animosity, and that his acts were not for his employer, but were personal to him. ' '</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Over a long period Houghland had been making from time to time inspections of respondent\u2019s baggage ear, searching for lost baggage or valuables from baggage. The inspections were so thorough and frequent as to annoy respondent and cause him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>to make several complaints to respersentatives of petitioner and ask for an investigation. It very clearly appears from Houghland\u2019s acts and words as described in respondent\u2019s testimony that after the incident of the missing jewelry Houghland believed that respondent was responsible for the loss of the jewelry. He did not accuse him of having stolen it, but asked him what he knew about it, and told him he was the only one who had handled the baggage. He continued to search respondent\u2019s baggage car, and even opened and looked into his personal baggage and visited respondent\u2019s home with F.B.I. agents and asked permission to search the house. On the occasion of the incident at Monahans from two to five days before the assault both Houghland and respondent became angry. Houghland laid his hands on respondent\u2019s personal suitcase and respondent grabbed the suitcase. Respondent\u2019s testimony shows that a personal encounter probably would have occurred then but for the presence of Bishop, who was Houghland\u2019s superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Respondent and Houghland met again two to five days later at Toyah, where the assault was made. Respondent had completed his \u201crun\u201d from El Paso. His day\u2019s work was done, and at about 9 o\u2019clock P.M. he was on his way from a restaurant, where he had eaten dinner, to the depot to pick up his brief case and then go to his rooming house. The evidence, except Houghland\u2019s testimony, does not show what Houghland was doing immediately before the encounter. The time was after normal working hours. When Houghland accosted and struck respondent they were not on petitioner\u2019s property, but in the street or road. It may seem from Houghland\u2019s first words that he was pursuing the investigation of the missing jewelry. He said that he wanted to talk about the baggage incident, and that he had made up his mind to find out then and there, but those words were immediately followed by \u201cYou are a thief and belong in the penitentiary,\u201d showing that his intention was to abuse and revile respondent rather than to obtain information from him. The encounter was, or immediately became, personal, and the words were insulting and spoken in anger. The words and the assault that followed were the expression of contempt and animosity, and they were not in pursuance of the employer\u2019s business. It is true that the assault may be traced back to Houghland\u2019s performance of his duty to investigate the loss of the jewelry, but that investigation was the remote cause of the personal encounter, and the encounter and assault were not so closely related to the investigation in time or in place as to be a part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The material facts in this case are in substance very nearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the same as those of several decisions of the Courts of Civil Appeals in which judgments of the trial courts against employers on account of assa.ult by employees were reversed and remanded, or judgments for employers affirmed, because the evidence conclusively showed that the employee in making the assault was actuated by personal animosity and that there was no close relationship between the assault and the performance of the duties of the employment. See: Home Telephone &amp; Electric Co. v. Branton, 7 S. W. 2d 627; National Life &amp; Accident Co. v. Ringo, 137 S. W. 2d 828, application for writ of error refused; AB.C. Stores v. Brown, 105 S. W 2d 725; Greathouse v Texas Public Utilities Corp., 217 S. W. 2d 190; Hidalgo v. Gulf, C. &amp; S.F. Ry. Co, 60 Texas Civ App. 433, 128 S. W. 683, application for writ of error refused; Lytle v. Crescent News &amp; Hotel Co, 27 Texas Civ. App. 530, 66 S. W. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\">Houston Transit Co. v. Felder, 146 Texas 428, 208 S. W. 2d 880, is cited by the Court of Civil Appeals and relied upon by respondent for affirmance of the judgment in his favor. An automobile driven by Felder ran into the rear of a transit company\u2019s bus. Goodson, the operator of the bus, left it, went to Felder\u2019s automobile and struck Felder in the face with a money-changing Box. Goodson testified that he left his bus and went to get Felder\u2019s name and automobile license number as it was his duty to do, that Felder refused to give his name, started reviling him, and laid his hand on him, and that he then struck Felder. Felder testified that Goodson came around to the rear of the bus, looked at the bumpers, shouted something that he did not understand, and hit him before he had said a word. The jury found that Goodson was acting within the scope of his employment when he committed the assault, but the trial court rendered judgment for the transit company notwithstanding the verdict. The Court of Civil Appeals reversed and rendered judgment for Felder on the verdict, and the Supreme Court affirmed that judgment. The Supreme Court\u2019s judgment and opinion are based upon the evidence that Goodson, in keeping with his duties, went immediately after the collision to Felder\u2019s automobile to get information, and that while he was thus about his master\u2019s business and before he had finished the mission, he committed the assault. The opinion is expressed that the assault was so closely connected with the performance of Goodson\u2019s duties as to prevent the conclusion as a matter of law that when he struck Felder he had ceased to act for the company and had begun to act for himself. And on that basis the Court distinguished the case from the Branton case and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Ringo case cited above. In the instant case the assault, as has been shown, was not thus closely connected with the service that Houghland had been performing for petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">4 The rule of Galveston H. &amp; S.A.Ry.Co. v. Currie, 100 Texas 136, 96 S.W. 1073, 10 LRA (NS) 367, also requires the reversal of the judgments of the trial court and the Court of Civil Appeals. The rule is that \u201cwhen the servant turns aside, for however short a time, from the prosecution of the master\u2019s work to engage in an affair wholly his own, he ceases to act for the master and the responsibility for that which he does in pursuing his own business or pleasure is upon him alone.\u201d 100 Texas 136, 142, 96 S.W. 1073, 1074. If it be assumed (which in our opinion is not a reasonable assumption) that when Houghland first accosted respondent he was continuing his search for the missing jewelry and was pursuing petitioner\u2019s business, his act in striking respondent after respondent said \u201cThat is a lie\u201d was a clear departure for the time from the service of petitioner to engage in an act of violence in his own behalf and in resentment of a personal insult. It is not reasonably to be inferred that the blow was struck as a part of the search for the missing jewelry. Houghland had told respondent that he was a thief and should be in the penitentiary, and added that Judge Schmidt told him. Respondent said \u201cThat is a lie,\u201d and Houghland immediately struck respondent, pursued him, and struck him again. If it be assumed that at the beginning of the encounter Houghland was in the course of the master\u2019s service, he stepped aside from that service in anger and in resentment, not in play as in the Currie case. By the same principle, however, his act when he stepped aside and struck respondent was his act and not that of his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">That Houghland struck respondent because respondent called him a liar was evidence also by the testimony of J.R. Cobb, a witness called by respondent. He was near by at the time of the assault, saw the two men running toward the depot, followed them to the door of the depot and heard Houghland say to respondent \u201cI\u2019ll teach you to call me a liar.\u201d Cobb was an employee of petitioner, but he was called by respondent as a witness, and his testimony was not contradicted. Respondent did not take the position that Cobb should be considered an adverse witness under Rule 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The case has been fully developed. Our opinion is that the judgments of the District Court and the Court of Civil Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>should be reversed and that judgment should be rendered here that respondent take nothing by his suit. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\">Opinion delivered March 5, 1952.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b218-5\">Mb, Justice Smith,</author>\n<p id=\"APK\">joined by Justices Sharp and Calvert, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">I most respectfully :dissent from the opinion expressed by the majority in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Obviously, the vital and ultimate answer that determines the merits of this case is whether or not Houghland was acting within the scope of his authority on the occasion when Hagenloh was injured. The majority opinion, while purporting to have followed the rule set out in Wininger v. Fort Worth &amp; D. C. Ry. Co., 105 Texas 56, 143 S.W. 1150, states: \u201cwe are of the opinion that it is not reasonably to be inferred that Houghland\u2019s words and conduct on the night of the assault as described in respondent\u2019s testimony or from that testimony and any other evidence in the record, that Houghland in accosting respondent and assaulting him was acting within the scope of his employment or in pursuance of his duties or in the furtherance of petitioner\u2019s business.\u201d With this conclusion we cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">There can be but little disagreement between us over the rules by which we are to test whether the action of Houghland was within the scope of his employment. However, we disagree with the statement in the majority opinion that the rule quoted by the majority from International &amp; G. N. R. Co. v. Anderson, 82 Texas 516, 17 S.W. 1039, applied only when the employee is possessed of the authority to use some degree of force. To the contrary, we think the quoted language announces the essential tests for determining the scope of general authority of any employee. His act, to be within the scope of his general authority, must be done (1) in furtherance of the master\u2019s business, and (2) for the accomplishment of an object for which the Servant is employed. In Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Guffey, 129 Texas 293, 102 S.W. 2d 408, these two elements were described as follows: \u201cThe final and conclusive test in all cases without any distinction as to negligent torts and willful torts is whether or not the act or omission of the agent constituting the tort, although itself not authorized, and even if in violation of instructions, was an act done or omitted in pursuance of the principal\u2019s business, and within that particular part of such business, - if less than all, committed to the agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Our difference with the majority opinion concerns a limitation on the above rule which we do not believe is a proper limitation. We understand the majority opinion to say, in effect, that an employer can never be liable for an assault and battery committed by his employee unless the employee acts pursuant to an authority, general or limited, which permits the use of physical force to some degree. Consequently, Houghland could not, in the majority\u2019s view, have been acting within his general investigative authority because the majority found \u201cno evidence\u201d . that he was authorized to use physical force against persons in. obtaining information for the company. Before disposing the law point, we will state that in our view there is a serious question presented by the record as to whether this, em-through its agents, Bishop, Brannon and French, could have been found by, the jury to have known of and acquiesced in Houghland\u2019s threatened use of force to get information so that Houghland would be held to have had apparent authority to so act. See Restatement, Agency, Sec. 26, Comment d., p. 75. The record indicates that Hagenloh had complained to each of them of Houghland\u2019s methods. The record shows that -after the incident at Monahans, Bishop, in the presence of Hagenloh, said to Houghland, \u201cIf you have anything against Hagenloh, find out about it and settle with him after he gets off of the train, after you are through working.\u201d Following this, Houghland pointed his finger at Hagenloh and said, \u201cI am going to find out; that is exactly what I am going to do.\u201d Admittedly this evidence will bear many different interpretations, but, in our view, it may well be sufficient, under Rule 279, to have supported a finding thereon by the jury that there was, on the employer\u2019s part, at least an acquiescense in a course of conduct by Houghland calculated to force information from Hagenloh,, if it could not be interpreted as an, express authorization to so act.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">But we do not think it necessary to the employer\u2019s liability here that it should be found that Houghland had authority to use physical .force to get information. As we read the cases, such a finding is not a prerequisite to a conclusion that an assault and battery were within the scope of employment of the assaulting employee. All that is required is (1) that the act was in furtherance of the master\u2019s business, and (2) that the act was done for the accomplishment of an object for which the particular s\u00e9ry\u00e1nt. was employed.\u2019 The Anderson case, supra, illustrates the separate functions of both parts of the rule. It would be in furtherance of the master\u2019s business for a brakeman, or any other specialized employee, to eject trespassers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Yet ejection of trespassers does not accomplish the object for which a brakeman is employed. Therefore, the plaintiff in that case had not met his burden of showing that the brakeman was within his general scope of authority and it was error for the trial court to imply authority on the brakeman\u2019s part and to shift the burden of proving otherwise to the employer. The most impressive negation of the idea that there must be some authority to use force before an assault and battery can be within the scope of authority is Houston Transit Co. v. Felder, 146 Texas 428, 208 S.W. 2d 880. There is no indication whatever in that case that the bus driver was authorized to use any amount of force in obtaining information about the collision. Nevertheless this court affirmed the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals which had reversed a judgment non obstante for defendant and had rendered judgment for plaintiff on the jury verdict. The rule of law applicable is stated in Corpus Juris as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-3\">\u201cIf the act complained of was within the scope of the servant\u2019s authority, the master will be liable, although it constituted an abuse or excess of the authority conferred. The master who puts the servant in a place of trust or responsibility, or commits to him the management of his business or the care of his property, is justly held responsible when the servant, through lack of judgment or discretion, or from infirmity of temper, or under the influence of passion aroused by the circumstances and the occasion, goes beyond the strict line of his duty or authority and inflicts an unjustifiable injury on a third person.\u201d 39 C. J. p. 1285, Sec. 1476.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">As said by Justice Alexander in Central Motor Co. v. Gallo, Tex. Civ. App., 94 S.W. 2d 821, 822:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">\u201cThe real test of the master\u2019s liability is, not whether the servant\u2019s employment contemplated the use of force or whether the act complained of was done in accordance with the master\u2019s instructions, but whether the act complained of arose directly out of and was done in the prosecution of the business that the servant was employed to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">See also Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Guffey, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The second reason given by the majority for its conclusion that no evidence supported the jury finding that Houghland was within the scope of his authority is the conclusion reached by the majority that the evidence shows as a matter of law that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Houghland struck Hagenloh out of personal animosity. We are in complete accord with the idea that a servant who commits an assault and battery solely in response to insulting words, or other purely personal reasons, does not act within the scope of his authority. Such action would not pass either of the two tests for scope of authority which we have spoken of. Our difference with the majority springs from our conviction that they have refused to discard \u201call adverse evidence,\u201d have refused to give credit \u201cto all evidence favorable to plaintiff,\u201d and have refused to indulge \u201cevery legitimate conclusion favorable to the plaintiff which might have been drawn from the facts proved.\u201d Wininger v. Fort Worth &amp; D. C. Ry. Co., supra. There is ample evidence in this record that the scope of Houghland\u2019s authority permitted him a wide choice of methods in collecting information. We think, within the limits of the review of the evidence to which we are here committed, that \u201ca jury might have found\u201d and reasonably could have found, in answering the issue that Houghland acted to recover lost jewelry in furtherance of his master\u2019s business, that his act was done for the accomplishment of an object for which Houghland was employed; namely, to get information. The witness, Houghland, testified that it was his duty to investigate claims for missing baggage and other property, and respondent, Hagenloh, also testified, without objection, that such was one of the duties of Mr. Houghland.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Shortly after Christmas, 1946, the claim was filed for the missing \u201cPecos jewelry.\u201d Mr. Houghland began his investigation and continued working on the case until July 27, 1947. Mr. Houghland worked under contract with the Railroad as a special officer on a monthly salary basis. The missing jewelry was alleged to have been taken from some baggage being transported in a baggage car under the exclusive control of Mr. Hagenloh. The petitioner lays great stress on a claim that Mr. Houghland did not, at any time during the investigation, accuse Hagenloh of stealing the jewelry, and the majority opinion emphasizes this. We think the testimony would lead a jury to believe that Mr. Houghland did accuse Mr. Hagenloh of stealing the jewelry and that he continued to think so right up to the moment he accosted respondent and made the attack on the night of July 27, 1947. Hagenloh testified on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">Q. \u201cDid Mr. Houghland ever accuse you of stealing anything?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-11\">A. \u201cHe had said there were some things missing out of the baggage car and that I had handled and I was the only man who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>did handle that very specifier piece of, baggage from Pecos to El Paso, from which the jewelry was missing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-3\">Hagenloh further testified that Houghland tpld him, that it was missing and lie was the only man that had handled it, and he wanted to know what became of it, He also testified .that when Mr. Houghland came to his house with- .two F.B.-1. officers, some three weeks later, Mr. Houghland was still searching for the.missing jewelry, and again repeated that it was missing from his baggage car, and that \u201cI xyas the only one that did. handle it.\u201d Mr Hagenloh. at , all times denied any knowledge of the. missing jewelry, .and went to three officials, Bishop, Bran-non and French, \u00a1 and demanded an invpstigatipn of the-case. He gxplained the nature of the case and the activities of Mr. Houghland. Under the contract between the Railroad and the Railroad Brotherhood of which Hagenloh was a member, he, Hagenloh, had the right, under such circumstances, to demand an investigation, - either by making such demand through the Brotherhood, or in person. He chose, the. l\u00e1tter .course. All of these officials in authority knew the facts, yet failed to grant his request. They knew Mr. Houghland was investigating the theft of the jewelry and that was the only business Mr. Houghland had with Hagenloh. Mr. Houghland claims that .he merely, wanted to straighten Mr. Hagenloh out as to his (Houghland\u2019s) duties. He says that when he went into .the baggage car several days before July 27,. 1947, he had np purpose other than to see if Mr. Bishop had any mail in the car, but while in there Mr. Hagen-Ioh says that Houghland began his usual routine of. searching the car, which he had a right to do; that when Mr. Houghland started to search his personal bag on that date, he had gotten tired of such conduct,, and refused to allow the search; that he had made repeated efforts to have a complete investigation, as provided for in his contract with the Railroad, and although the\" officials would make promises to do so, they failed. The petitioner, knowing that Mr. Bishop, an official with authority, was present When this incident occurred failed, to call Mr. Bishop as a witness. It seems to me that, if Mr. Bishop had sent Mr. Hpughland info the car solely- for. the purpose of getting mail, he cpujd have said. so'. .Hagenloh testified that Mr. Houghland told him, on one occasion prior to July 27, 1947, that he' (Houghland) was <em>continuing, </em>to <em>search his belongings because- he had not - cleared, up the Pecos jewelry deal and it was his job to do it. </em>When Mr. Hagenloh refused Mr. Hpughland permission to search his \u201cperspnal f jbelongingsU on- the - date Mr. Bishop was present,. Bishop was called into the car and told by Mr. Houghland what had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>happened. Mr. Bishop knew that Mr. Houghland was then searching for the missing jewelry, and knowing that he had not granted Hagenloh\u2019s request for a thorough investigation, as provided under the contract heretofore mentioned, continued to approve Mr. Houghland\u2019s method of procedure, and while standing in the car said to Mr. Houghland <em>\u201cif you have anything against Hagenloh, find out about it and settle with him after he gets off of the train, after you me through working.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Houghland then pointed his finger at Hagenloh and said \u201cI am going to find out; that is exactly what I am going to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">Now what was Mr. Bishop referring to when he made this statement? Was he talking about his personal mail, or was he directing Mr. Houghland to continue his investigation of the missing jewelry and settle with Mr. Hagenloh? The jury reached the conclusion, supported by a preponderance of evidence, that at the time Houghland accosted Hagenloh on July 27, 1947, he did so in pursuance of one or more of his duties as agent of the defendant. The jury further found that at the time Houghland struck plaintiff, he, (Houghland) was on duty for the company. In other words, the jury believed that Houghland was still searching for the missing jewelry when he accosted Hagenloh and said: \u201cI want to talk to you about the baggage incident.\u201d The jury believed Hagenloh\u2019s statement as to the conversation which immediately followed the above statement: \u201cI don\u2019t think that this is the place to talk about it. I would like to have an investigation, which I have asked for, and probably will get.\u201d To which Houghland replied: \u201cI don\u2019t need an investigation. I have made up my mind to find out right now, right here, right now. You are a thief and you belong in the penitentiary.\u201d Hagenloh said, \u201cWell, how come.\u201d And Houghland said that Judge Schmidt told him, and Hagenloh said, \u201cThat is a lie.\u201d From this and other evidence a jury could believe that Houghland was still seeking the missing jewelry, that he sought information for his master, and that he planned to get it by terrorizing Hageloh, and that he struck respondent pursuant to such plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">It is true that prior to the first blow Hagenloh stated \u201cThat is a lie.\u201d This statement may have precipitated the blow. But then again it may not have. Since we are convinced that there is some evidence, which, when interpreted favorably to respondent, supports the finding that Houghland acted within his scope of authority, the assignment of error asserting that there was no evidence is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>This view of the evidence distinguishes Galveston, H. &amp; S. A. Ry. Co. v. Currie, 100 Texas 136, 96 S.W. 1073, 10 L. R. A. N. S. 367. We cannot say that Houghland had \u201cturned aside\u201d from his employment if there is evidence to support the finding by the jury that he acted in furtherance of his master\u2019s business and to accomplish an objective of his particular employment. In the Currie case the act of the employee was intended as a personal joke and there was no evidence which gave the slightest inference that it was undertaken in furtherance of the railroad\u2019s business or to accomplish an objective of the engine dispatchers\u2019 employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-3\">The majority opinion on page nine cites a number of opinions of the Courts of Civil Appeals, stating that the evidence in each \u201cconclusively showed that the employee in making the assault was actuated by personal animosity and that there was no close relation between the assault and the performance of the duties of the employment.\u201d From our review of these cases we are unwilling to agree with the first clause in the majority\u2019s statement. But if the majority\u2019s second clause \u2014 that in those cases \u201cthe evidence conclusively showed * * * that there was no close relation between the assault and the performance of the duties of the employment\u201d \u2014 means that, under the acknowledged tests of scope of authority, those employees were conclusively shown to be outside, then we agree with it. In none of those cases is it shown that there was any theory made out in the evidence by which the jury could have found that the assaulting employees (a telephone exchange manager, an insurance premium collector, a grocery cashier, an ice deliveryman, a watchman who was off duty, and a lunch counter employee) acted in furtherance of his master\u2019s business and at the same time acted to accomplish an objective of his particular job. In contrast to the cases cited by the majority, there are Texas cases in which the employee (who in each case shot his adversary) was found to have been within his scope of authority because the evidence supported a theory by which the employee\u2019s act was construed to satisfy both requirements of the scope of authority rule. Chicago, R. I. &amp; G. Ry. Co. et al. v. Carter, et al., 261 SW 135, Tex Com App., 1935; Gulf, C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Cobb, Tex. Civ. App., 1931, 45 S.W. 2d 323, error dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">There are two other points which should be considered. The first is petitioner\u2019s Point IV to the effect that the jury\u2019s finding of scope of authority is invalid because the issue submitted inquired about scope of authority at the wrong time; i.e., at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>the time of \u201caccosting\u201d instead of the time of striking. I think this matter was waived by the defendant because his objection to Issue No. 1 did not complain of this deficiency (did not point out specifically that this was a bad issue for this reason), but rather complained simply that there was no evidence to support a finding that plaintiff was in his scope of authority \u201cat said time.\u201d Rule 272 and Rule 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\"The other point that should be discussed, in view of our conclusion that this case should be affirmed, is the holding of the Court of Civil Appeals that C. B. Houghland was an adverse witness to respondent under Rule 182. Also petitioner has presented a related point to the effect that the Court of Civil Appeals erred in overruling petitioner\u2019s assignment of error that the trial court erred in refusing to rule upon the question whether C. B. Houghland was an adverse witness or,not under Rule 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">On the question as to whether the trial court ruled on the objection that C. B. Houghland was not an adverse witness, we think the trial court did rule on the objection and to the effect that Houghland was not an adverse witness. Plaintiff called Houghland as an adverse witness under Rule 182. Defendant objected on the ground that Houghland had left the employ of defendant some two years previous to the date of trial. The court at that time did not rule on the objection. The examination of the witness by plaintiff proceeded, after the court stated \u201cWe will see what the objection is. Go ahead.\u201d When the defendant began its cross-examination, the plaintiff objected to leading and suggestive questions, stating, in effect, that under Rule 182, the defendant must examine the witness as though he was the defendant\u2019s witness on direct examination. Thereupon, the defendant\u2019s counsel stated: \u201cIf the Court has any doubt about it, I have the only authority in the State here which is contrary to counsel\u2019s statement as to what the law is. He then furnished the Court with the case of Dollahite-Levy Company v. Phillips, et al., 99 S.W. 2d 688, writ dismissed. The Court, after reading the case, overruled plaintiff\u2019s objection, and from then on defendant propounded leading questions to the witness and cross-examined the witness in every detail. The witness, Houghland, admitted that, under this cross-examination, it had been so long since the conversation on the night of July 27, 1947, that he could not remember just what was said word for word. When he was asked about the \u201cbaggage incident,\u201d he answered that he was talking about his right to enter the car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>to get Mr. Bishop\u2019s mail, and that he wanted to explain to Mr. Hagenloh that he had the authority to do this; arid that he wanted to straighten Mr. Hagenloh out on this. The defendant did not move the Court to strike any of the testimony giveri by Mr. Houghland under examination by plaintiff. In view of the circumstances, and the further fact, as stated in the majority opinion, \u201cthat there was no important conflict, except in their testimony as to what was said just before Houghland struck respondent,\u201d I cannot see that defendant suffered any injury because of the delayed ruling mad\u00e9 by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\">The holding of the Court of Civil Appeals that Houghland was an adverse witness, even though erroneous, does not require a reversal of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">The judgment of the Court of Civil Appeals should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Opinion delivered March 5, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Rehearing overruled April 9, 1952.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
