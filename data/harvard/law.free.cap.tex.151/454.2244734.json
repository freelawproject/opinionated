Wear\u2019s claim was based upon three contracts. The case was submitted to the jury upon special issues, and many of the issues were answered favorably to the Insurance Company. Notwithstanding such favorable answers, the trial court disregarded same and entered judgment for Wear for the sum of $68,630.79 and the further sum of $5,000 as attorney\u2019s fees. The Court of Civil Appeals held that Wear\u2019s right to recover \u201coverride\u201d commissions on certain insurance was terminated on the date when the contract on which the \u201coverride-\u201d commissions were based was terminated. The Court of Civil Appeals, by a divided court, reformed the judgment of the trial court in the. following respects:</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">\u201cAppellant tendered the sum of $942 to a]u#?liee as being due him under his override contract, and the judgment will be amended so as to eliminate the recovery of $68,630.79, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>place thereof provide for a recovery of $980.40, together with interest at the rate of <em>6% </em>per annum from January 1, 1948, until paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\">\u201cParagraph (6) of the judgment will be amended so as to hereafter read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">\u201c(6) That, in addition, defendant Government Personnel Mutual Life Insurance Company, either now owes or else will owe plaintiff, Gordon Wear, two and one-half (2%%) percent commission on renewal premiums paid or that may later be paid, on each and every twenty-year endowment and twenty-payment life insurance policy, application for which was originally procured by C. H. Earl prior to January 1, 1948, that has been or is later renewed within ten years of its original issuance, if, as and when the premiums have been paid thereon to defendant since December 31, 1949, or are hereafter paid thereon to defendant in the future.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Mr. Justice Pope in his opinion states his views as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">\u201cI would reform the judgment and award Wear a judgment for $4,703.28, together with attorney\u2019s fees and interest, and award him commissions on those renewals allowed by the majority but would allow them up to June 28, 1948, instead of January 1, 1948.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The judgment of the trial court by a majority of the Court of Civil Appeals was reformed as to the amount of recovery for commissions, as stated above, but the judgment of the trial court was affirmed as to attorney\u2019s fees. 247 S. W. 2d 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">This suit involves the construction of three contracts. Gordon Wear, formerly an agent for the Insurance Company, sued the Insurance Company on November 18, 1951, upon a written contract of July 1, 1946, styled \u201cSupplemental Agreement,\u201d and referred to by the court below as \u201cContract No. 2.\u201d This agreement provided that Wear was to receive \u201coverride\u201d commissions on life insurance policies solicited by Earl under his respective agent\u2019s contract of July 1, 1946, with the Insurance Company, referred to by the court below as \u201cContract No. 3.\u201d The \u201cSupplemental Agreement\u201d contained no provision for cancellation, but was appended to the agent\u2019s contract of Wear executed on the same day, and which provided for its termination on thirty days\u2019 written not^e by either party. This is referred to by the court below as \u201cContract No. 1.\u201d Alleging that he was also entitled to receive an \u201coverride\u201d on insurance sold by Earl\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>subagents, and that thirty days\u2019 written notice was required for termination of the \u201cSupplemental Agreement\u201d as well as for his agent\u2019s contract, Wear sued to recover \u201coverride\u201d commissions on insurance sold by Earl and his subagents from January 1, 1948, when the Insurance Company ceased paying such commissions, to June 28, 1948, being thirty days after Wear had received written notice of termination of his agent\u2019s contract. Wear prevailed in the trial court on these two theories. However, the Court of Civil Appeals unanimously held that he was not entitled to an \u201coverride\u201d upon insurance sold by Earl\u2019s sub-agents, and, by a divided court, held that the \u201cSupplemental Agreement\u201d was effectively terminated as of January 1, 1948, by oral notice given Wear in October, 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\">The following Special Issues were submitted to the jury, and they were answered as set out below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">\u201cQuestion No. 1: Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that when Peter J. Hennessey in October or November, 1947, orally notified plaintiff, Wear, that the contract of July 1, 1946, between plaintiff and defendant, insofar as it related to overriding commissions, would be cancelled by the defendant effective on January 1, 1948, that plaintiff, Wear, waived the thirty days\u2019 written notice of cancellation as provided for in said contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">\u201cWe, the jury, answer: \u2018Yes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">\u201cQuestion No. 2: Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that in the month of October, 1947, plaintiff and defendant, by mutual agreement between them, cancelled, effective January 1, 1948, the Supplemental Contract dated July 1, 1946?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">\u201cWe, the jury, answer: \u2018No.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">\u201cQuestion No. 8: Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that on the occasion when such oral notice of cancellation was given, plaintiff, Wear, knew that defendant intended to increase the commissions of C. H. Earl and other agents effective January 1, 1948, in reliance, if he did rely, upon the cancellation, if any, of the contract of July 1, 1946, between plaintiff and defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">\u201cWe, the jury, answer: \u2018Yes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">\u201cQuestion No. 4: Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that defendant thereafter did increase the commissions of C. H. Earl and other agents, effective January 1, 1948, in the belief that the contract of July 1, 1946, between plaintiff and defendant had been cancelled?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-11\">\u201cWe, the jury, answer: \u2018Yes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-12\">\u201cQuestion No. 5: Do you find from a preponderance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>evidence that but for the belief, if any, by defendant that the Supplemental Agreement in question had been properly can-celled by oral notice, said defendant would not have increased the commissions to said Earl and other Agents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-3\">\u201cWe, the jury, answer: \u2018Yes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">\u201cQuestion No. 6: Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that defendant acted in good faith toward plaintiff, Wear, in the cancellation effective December 31, 1947, of C. H. Earl\u2019s contract of July 1, 1946, if there was such cancellation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">\u201cWe, the jury, answer: \u2018Yes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">\u201cQuestion No. 7: Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that the plaintiff, Wear, had knowledge that defendant did not intend to pay him after December 31, 1947, override commissions under the Supplemental Contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">\u201cWe, the jury, answer: \u2018Yes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">\u201cQuestion No. 8: When do you find from a preponderance of the evidence the plaintiff, Wear, had knowledge that the defendant Company did not intend to pay him after December 31, 1947, override commissions under the supplemental contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">\u201cWe, the jury, answer: \u2018Oct., 1947.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">\u201cQuestion No. 9: What amount of money do you find from a preponderance of the evidence would, if paid now in cash, fairly and reasonably compensate the attorneys of Gordon Wear for legal services rendered plaintiff in connection with the matters in controversy in this suit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-11\">\u201cWe, the jury, answer: \u2018$5,000.00.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-12\">Two controlling questions are presented here: (1) Was the contract under which Wear claims his \u201coverride\u201d commissions terminated on December 31, 1947; and (2), does Article 2226, as amended, Vernon\u2019s Annotated Civil Statutes, operate retrospectively so as to authorize the recovery by Wear of $5,000 attorney\u2019s fees?</p>\n<p id=\"b474-13\">1 The majority opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals held that the evidence raised an issue of fact as to whether the Insurance Company intended to cancel the contract on December 31, 1947, and we think the findings of the jury upon this issue and the holding of the Court of Civil Appeals are sustained by the evidence ; and no sound reason is presented here why such findings should be disturbed by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-14\">2 This brings us to a consideration of the recovery by Wear of $5,000 as attorney\u2019s fees. Petitioner Insurance Company contends that the allowance of the attorney\u2019s fees was error, on the grounds that: (1) the Court of Civil Appeals retroactively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>applied Article 2226 as amended; and (2), Wear\u2019s claim was not based on \u201cpersonal services rendered\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Since the matter will be disposed of on the first ground, there is no need to consider the second. In upholding the allowance of attorney\u2019s fees, Chief Justice Murray reasoned that Article 2226, as amended, \u201cdoes not require that the claim must have accrued subsequent to the effective date of the amendment,\u201d and that the claim on which Wear relies was brought within the provisions of the amended statute since it was presented and refused on November 15, 1949, after the effective date of the amendment. That court held that the criterion for the application of the amendment was the date on which the claim was presented and refused, rather than the date on which the cause of action arose, which in this case was well before June 29, 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-3\">The pertinent parts of Article 2226, as amended, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">\u201cAny person having a valid claim against a person or corporation for personal services rendered, labor done, material furnished, overcharges on freight or express, lost or damaged freight or express or stock killed or injured, may present the same to such person or corporation or to any duly authorized agent thereof; and if at the expiration of thirty (30) days thereafter, the claim has not been paid or satisfied, and he should finally obtain judgment for any amount thereof as presented for payment to such person or corporation, he may also recover, in addition to his claim and costs, a reasonable amount as attorney\u2019s fees, if represented by an attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-5\">\u201cSec. 2. The fact that it is practically impossible to obtain legal services for the purpose of collecting claims described in this Act under the present law creates an emergency and an imperative public necessity that the Constitutional Rule requiring bills to be read on three several days in each House be and the same is hereby suspended, and that this Act shall take effect and be in force from and after its passage, and it is so enacted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The foregoing Act became effective June 29, 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The original Article, which was amended in 1949, (Ch. 494) and is now known as Article 2226, described the method of enforcing a claim, and further provided: \u201cand if he shall finally establish his claim, and obtain judgment for the full amount thereof, as presented for payment to such person or corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>in such court, he shall be entitled to recover the amount of such claim and all costs of suit, and, in addition thereto, a reasonable amount as attorney\u2019s fees; provided he has an attorney employe's in the case, not to exceed twenty dollars, to be determined by the court or jury trying the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\">Prior to the amendment of Article 2226, in order to authorize the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees it was required that the full amount of the claim be recovered. The amendment substituted \u201cany amount\u201d for \u201cfull amount,\u201d and the provision limiting the amount of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cnot to exceed twenty dollars\u201d was repealed. The amended Act now provides that, \u201cin addition to his claim and costs, a reasonable amount as attorney\u2019s fees, if represented by an attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The jury found that the contracts under which Wear asserts his claim against the Insurance Company terminated on December 31, 1947. At that time Article 2226, under which he asserts his right of recovery for attorney\u2019s fees, had not been amended, and therefore his right to recover attorney\u2019s fees is governed by the unamended Article, which limited a recovery of attorney\u2019s fees to \u201ctwenty dollars.\u201d To sustain a recovery of the $5,000 attorney\u2019s fees, as asserted in this case, the law would have to be construed to operate retrospectively. To give it that construction would violate Section 16 of Article I of the Constitution, and give to the law an intent not expressed therein. If the Legislature had intended for this Article to operate retrospectively, that intention could have been expressed in plain and specific language. This the Legislature did not do. It is the duty of courts to construe a law as written, and, if possible, ascertain its intention from the language used therein, and not look for extraneous reasons to be used as a basis for reading into a law an intention not expressed nor intended to be expressed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The construction of Article 2226 was involved in the case of U. S. Life Insurance Co. v. Hamilton, Tex. Civ. App., 238 S. W. 2d 289, Refused NRE, and in the opinion, written by Mr. Justice Hale, in discussing Article 2226, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">\u201cSince this article is penal in nature, like other similar statotory provisions authorizing the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees in derogation of the common law, it should be strictly construed and applied. Washington Fid. Nat. Ins. Co. v. Williams, Tex. Com. App., 49 S. W 2d 1093, pt. 3, and authorities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Section 16 of Article I of the Constitution of Texas provides: \u201cNo * * * retroactive law, or any law impairing the obligation of contracts, shall be made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\">As early as 1878 this Court, in the case of The Piedmont and Arlington Life Insurance Co. v. Tresy Ray et al., 50 Texas 511, expressed the rule prevailing in this State as to whether laws will be construed to act retrospectively or prospectively, in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">\u201cThe judgment in appellee\u2019s favor for the sum of $319.58 as reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, is unwarranted and cannot be sustained. The loss on account of which this suit was brought, had occurred long before the enactment of the law allowing a recovery of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees in suits against life insurance companies incorporated out of this State. It is a well-settled rule that statutes are always held to operate prospectively, unless a contrary construction is evidently required by their plain and unequivocal language.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The courts of this State in many cases have construed the foregoing provision of the Constitution, and in 39 Tex. Jur., p. 54, \u00a7 27, the rule prevailing in this State is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">\u201cBut apart from any constitutional impediment, retrospective laws are commonly regarded with disfavor. A statute will not be applied or construed retrospectively or given retrospective operation, so as to affect existing rights or create new obligations and impose new duties as to past transactions, unless it clearly appears, from its terms or at least by fair implication, that the Legislature so intended. On the contrary, a statute is generally held to operate prospectively unless a contrary construction is required by the terms or the nature and object of the law.\u201d See also Tex. Jur., Ten Year Supp., 1937-1947, p. 796, \u00a7 27.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">There is no language used in this Article indicating that it was the intention of the Legislature that such Article should operate restrospectively. If an Act is intended to operate retrospectively ,that intention must be clearly and unmistakably shown in the language of the Act, and it will not ordinarily be inferred. Had the Legislature intended that the amended Act should-apply to claims presented and refused after the effective date of the amendment, regardless of when the cause of action arose, it could have plainly said so. If there is any doubt about the intention to have an Act operate retrospectively, the intention will be resolved against the retrospective operation of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Act. This rule is recognized and enforced generally. See Miller &amp; Miller Motor Freight Lines v. Gilliland, Tex. Civ. App., 232 S. W. 2d 886, writ dismissed; Zweig v. Bethlehem Supply Co., 186 Fed. 2d 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\">In 50 Amer. Jur., p. 494, \u00a7 478, the rule is stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">\u201cThe question whether a statute operates retrospectively, or prospectively only, is one of legislative intent. In determining such intent, the courts have evolved a strict rule of construction against the retrospective operation, and indulge in the presumption that the legislature intended statutes, or amendments thereof, enacted by it to operate prospectively only, and not retroactively.\u201d See also 59 C. J., Statutes, page 1181, section 719.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The trial court erred in rendering judgment for Wear for the sum of $68,630.79 and the further sum of $5,000 attorney\u2019s fees. The judgment for $68,630.79 was correctly reformed by a majority of the Court of Civil Appeals, and judgment for Wear upon that item was entered as above indicated; but the Court of Civil Appeals erred in affirming the judgment of the trial court regarding the $5,000 attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The judgment of the majority of the Court of Civil Appeals reforming the judgment of the trial court and entering judgment in favor of Wear for the commissions as above indicated is affirmed ; but the judgments of the trial court and the Court of Civil Appeals, allowing a recovery of $5,000 attorney\u2019s fees, are reversed, and judgment is here rendered that respondent take nothing as to that item.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Opinion delivered October 1, 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Rehearing Overruled October 29, 1952.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
