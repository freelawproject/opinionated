We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Defendant challenges the sufficiency of an affidavit which Oregon State Police detective Reeg used to obtain a warrant to search his home. The affidavit is based primarily on information obtained from a named informant, Keitz, and contains two defects which are serious, but not fatal: it uses the results of a search previously declared illegal, and it contains information that is simply false.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under <em>State v. Harp, </em>299 Or 1, 9, 697 P2d 548 (1985), we excise the inaccurate portion of an affidavit. <em>See also State v. Haines, </em>62 Or App 163, 168, 659 P2d 972 (1983). We must also consider the affidavit without the benefit of information obtained in the prior illegal search. <em>State v. Payne, </em>72 Or App 631, 640, 696 P2d 1147 (1985); <em>see also </em>ORS 133.683; <em>State v. Cartwright, </em>246 Or 120, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>125, 418 P2d 822, <em>cert den </em>386 US 937 (1967). Without the part that is false and the part derived from the illegal search, the affidavit contains the following substantive information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\">\u201cThat on April 13, 1984, affiant personally spoke with Mark Douglab Keitz. That Mark Douglas Keitz told affiant he had been involved in the use and sale of marijuana and methamphetamine, a controlled substance, for at least the past 5 years. That after speaking with Mark Douglas Keitz, and considering my background and training, affiant is satisfied that Mark Douglas Keitz knows and can identify marijuana and methamphetamine in its different forms, use, and manufacturing stages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201cThat Mark Douglas Keitz proceeded with Detective Ray Looney of the Josephine County Sheriffs Department and affiant to five (5) separate locations in Josephine County. That Mark Douglas Keitz stated controlled substances were being sold at these locations. That Mark Douglas Keitz identified six (6) individuals who also sell controlled substances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">\u201cThat both Detective Ray Looney and affiant independently confirmed said locations and individuals as being involved in the possession and sales of controlled substances, from investigations and arrests. That I believe Detective Ray Looney to be a truthful and reliable person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">\u201cThat affiant was told by Mark Douglas Keitz that he had the opportunity to be at the residence located at 2858 Sykes Creek Road, Jackson County, within the past two (2) weeks. That Mark Douglas Keitz said the residence was occupied by \u2018Dennis,\u2019 who was also known to him as the \u2018Bud Wizard.\u2019 That on April 13,1984, Mark Douglas Keitz, I, and Detective R. C. Kennedy of the Jackson County Sheriffs Office drove to the property described above. Detective Kennedy verified that this is the residence of Dennis Wayne Christiansen. That Mark Douglas Keitz told affiant that the \u2018Bud Wizard\u2019 gained this nickname from his expertise in the development and growth of a very powerful strain of marijuana called \u2018Endicutt Rooticus.\u2019 That said strain of marijuana was purple in color and reaches a maximum height of 4 to 5 feet and produced about 11/2 pounds of bud per marijuana plant. That Mark Douglas Keitz told affiant that \u2018Dennis\u2019 furnished starter marijuana plants to other individuals and receives a share of the profit when the marijuana plants mature and are harvested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">\u201cThat Mark Douglas Keitz told affiant that while he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>at said residence, an individual named \u2018Ron\u2019 purchased 11/2 pounds of marijuana from \u2018Dennis\u2019 and that \u2018Ron\u2019 used to live at said residence with \u2018Dennis.\u2019 That Mark Douglas Keitz also purchased 1/4 pound of marijuana from \u2018Dennis\u2019 and observed approximately 100 growing marijuana plants, to heights of approximately 10 inches, on shelves in a room of said residence. That I believe Mark Douglas Keitz to be a truthful and reliable person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Defendant identifies several defects in the affidavit other than those noted above and in note 1. All ar\u00e9 based on the assumption that Oregon\u2019s version of the <em>Aguilar/Spinelli </em>rule applies. <em>See Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 US 108, 84 S Ct 1509, 12 L Ed 2d 723 (1964); <em>Spinelli v. United States, </em>393 US 410, 89 S Ct 584, 21 L Ed 2d 637 (1969); <em>State v. Russell, </em>293 Or 469, 473, 650 P2d 79 (1982); <em>State v. Souders, </em>74 Or App 123, 700 P2d 1050, <em>rev den </em>300 Or 112 (1985); ORS 133.545(4) <em>(formerly </em>ORS 133.545(3)). The state argues that the rule does not apply, because ORS 133.545(4) applies only to <em>unnamed </em>informants.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">\u201c* * * If an affidavit is based in whole or in part on hearsay, the affiant shall set forth facts bearing on any <em>unnamed </em>informant\u2019s reliability and shall disclose, as far as possible, the means by which the information was obtained.\u201d ORS 133.545(4). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The state also argues that, because the <em>Aguilar/Spinelli </em>analysis does not apply when the affidavit relies on a named informant, in those cases we should employ the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d analysis that has replaced <em>Aguilar/Spinelli </em>at the federal level. <em>See Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 US 213, 103 S Ct 2317, 76 L Ed 2d 527 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">We need not consider whether some less restrictive rule based on <em>Gates </em>should be applied, because the affidavit in this case meets the <em>Aguilar/Spinelli </em>requirements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As stated in <em>State v. Montigue, </em>288 Or 359, 362, 605 P2d 656 (1980), those requirements are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\u201c1. The affidavit must set forth informant\u2019s \u2018basis of knowledge.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">2. The affidavit must set forth facts showing the informant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>\u2018veracity,\u2019 either by showing:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">\u2018a. The informant is credible, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aun\">\u2018b. That his information is reliable.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Our review is limited to a determination of \u201cwhether a neutral and detached magistrate could conclude, based on the facts and circumstances shown by the affidavit, that there was probable cause to believe that the search would discover things specified in the affidavit in the places requested to be searched.\u201d <em>State v. Villagran, </em>294 Or 404, 408, 657 P2d 1223 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Defendant does not deny that the affidavit adequately sets forth the informant\u2019s basis of knowledge. He argues, instead, that it does not contain information showing the informant\u2019s credibility or reliability. With respect to credibility, defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\u201cSo far as can be determined from the affidavit, the affiant had never spoken with the informant other than on the one occasion, nor did he have any information that any other police agency or personnel had successfully dealt with that person on any other occasion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Defendant assumes that an informant\u2019s credibility can be established only through previous contacts between the informant and police. He is incorrect. <em>See State v. Hermach, </em>53 Or App 412, 420, 632 P2d 466, <em>rev den </em>291 Or 893 (1981). At least four factors contribute to Keitz\u2019s credibility. First, he is a named informant. Although he does not fit into one of the categories of \u201ccitizen informers\u201d discussed in <em>State v. Villagran, supra, </em>294 Or at 409, a magistrate could reasonably infer that a person who allows himself to be identified as the source of a serious accusation is more likely to be telling the truth than an informant who insists on anonymity. <em>See State v. Carlile, </em>290 Or 161, 165, 619 P2d 1280 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">Second, Keitz demonstrated that he knew the location of defendant\u2019s house and that he could identify marijuana. Similar showings were held to contribute to the credibility of the informant in <em>State v. Hermach, supra. </em>Third, he made declarations that were against his penal interest. Defendant argues that Keitz made the declarations only to obtain his release from jail. Even if that was his only motive, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>magistrate reasonably could have found that it did not destroy his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Nothing on the face of the affidavit compelled the magistrate to discredit the informant in defendant\u2019s favor. Reeg testified that Keitz supplied the information because he was tired of his involvement in the drug world. Reeg denied that he had promised him anything to prompt his decision to inform. Even if defendant is correct as to Keitz\u2019s motive, a magistrate might reasonably infer that he would have fabricated a less incriminating story if it was only to obtain his release and that it was unlikely that, in the hope of securing his release, he would dig himself a deeper hole by telling lies to the police. Finally, Keitz identified other drug sellers and other locations where drugs were sold, and the officers confirmed all of his other reports. Taken together, these factors would allow a neutral and detached magistrate to conclude that Keitz was credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">\u201c[T]here is not a shred of police corroboration concerning the accuracy of the information given by the informant, e.g. they do not establish he had ever been to the defendant\u2019s premises, he did not produce any substance that he claimed came from the defendant\u2019s premises, nor is it in any way established that anything he says concerning the present activity at the defendant\u2019s residence is accurate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Defendant ignores the corroborating information that led to the earlier illegal search of defendant\u2019s home. <em>See </em>note 1, <em>supra. </em>Although the <em>fruits </em>of that earlier search could not be considered, <em>the information that led to the search </em>is not tainted and could be used to corroborate Keitz\u2019s story. The fundamental issue to be addressed in considering questions of taint is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">\u201cwhether, granting the establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 US 471, 488, 83 S Ct 407, 9 L Ed 2d 441 (1963).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Keitz\u2019s information satisfies both the reliability and credibility tests of the veracity prong of the <em>Aguilar/Spinelli </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-6\"> This part of the affidavit relies on the results of the search that was previously declared illegal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201cThat Detective R. C. Kennedy told affiant that in September of 1979, Sheriffs deputies had served a search warrant for cultivating marijuana, a controlled substance, and seized several marijuana plants. That said search warrant was served to Dennis Wayne Christiansen at 2858 Sykes Creek Road, Jackson County. A photograph of said marijuana plants seized is attached to this Affidavit and is incorporated herein by reference. That in the early part of 1981, a confidential reliable informant of the Jackson County Sheriffs Department told Deputy Dewey Patten that Dennis Wayne Christiansen was cultivating marijuana in a greenhouse on said property. That said confidential, reliable informant told Deputy Dewey Patten that a growing partner of Dennis Wayne Christiansen was a James Stafford during the summer of 1982. That Dennis Christiansen had supplied James Stafford with a quantity of marijuana plants to grow. That said informant wishes to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal. That subsequent investigation by the Jackson County Sheriffs Department led to the issuance of a search warrant and seizure of numerous growing marijuana plants. That said investigation further determined the reliability of information from the confidential informant about Dennis Wayne Christiansen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The state admits that the following information is false:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">\u201cThat Detective R. C. Kennedy told affiant that the Oregon State Police Department has executed a search warrant in the past at said residence occupied by Dennis Wayne Christiansen and seized growing marijuana plants. That I believe Detective R. C. Kennedy to be a truthful and reliable person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">Reeg maintained at the suppression hearing that Kennedy had actually made that statement, but he admitted that subsequent checking on his part had revealed that the Oregon State Police (as opposed to the Jackson County sheriffs department) had not previously conducted a search at defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b628-10\"> We note that the Oregon Supreme Court has applied the <em>Aguilar/Spinelli </em>test in cases involving named informants. <em>State v. Villagran, </em>294 Or 404, 657 P2d 1223 (1983); <em>see also State v. Carlile, </em>290 Or 161, 619 P2d 1280 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
