Judge Raum of the Tax Court held in a reasoned opinion, 19 T.C. 1013, that it was; and the petition for review has been brought by the executor of the beneficiary who had been allowed to intervene in the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-24\">In 1915 the decedent, Arthur Curtiss James, and his wife, Harriet Parsons James, created a trust for the benefit of petitioner\u2019s testate, Maud P. Larson, sister to Mrs. James. The trust was subject to revocation by joint act of the settlors while both lived, and thereafter by the individual act of the survivor. Mrs. James died on May 15, Mr. James on June 4, 1941. Thus at the time of his death the trust was subject to decedent\u2019s uncontrolled power of revocation. The Commissioner determined that the value of the trust must be included in decedent\u2019s gross estate under I.R.C. \u00a7 811(d) (2), 26 U.S.C.;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Tax Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>has sustained this determination. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The trust instrument gave decedent a power to revoke the trust subject to his wife\u2019s concurrence during her lifetime. Upon her death the power became absolute. Assuming that his wife had an adverse interest during her life and that Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., 278 U.S. 339, 49 S.Ct. 123, 73 L.Ed. 410, then applied to indicate that had he then died the property would not have been taxable to his estate, nevertheless the original check upon his discretion did not endure. So by the time of his death the situation was no different from that in C. I. R. v. Hofheimer\u2019s Estate, 2 Cir., 149 F.2d 733, where we held the trust principal taxable. Petitioner urges that under Treas.Reg. 105, \u00a7 81.20(b) (1), tax-ability must depend on reservation of an absolute power at the time of the original transfer. But in our view the cited language requires no more than that the power stem from the creating instrument. To the argument that taxation here would be unconstitutional for retroactivity it is sufficient answer that decedent had time in which to renounce his power and complete his original gift. In short we are clear that regardless of prior conditions the existence of an untrammeled power of revocation at the time of decedent\u2019s death brings the trust within the ambit of I.R.C. \u00a7 811(d) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Alternatively, petitioner asserts that part of the trust principal was contributed by decedent\u2019s wife and therefore cannot be included in his estate. But the evidence supporting the Tax Court\u2019s contrary finding is more than ample. Mrs. James was merely a nominal settlor who contributed no part of the trust assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">Since the decision below is in all respects correct, it is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-16\">. \u201c\u00a7 811.
