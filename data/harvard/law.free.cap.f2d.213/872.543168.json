Appellant is imprisoned under the sentence of a state court, imposed upon him when he pleaded guilty to the crime of murder, in a proceeding in which he was represented by counsel of his own choice. The petition was properly dismissed on the ground that appellant had not exhausted state remedies. Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 70 S.Ct. 587, 94 L.Ed. 761. If the appeal were properly before us, therefore, the order dismissing the petition would be affirmed. The appeal must be dismissed, however, because appellant has failed to obtain the certificate of probable cause required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. The judge below properly refused to grant such a certificate and no judge of this court is of opinion that same should be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-26\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
