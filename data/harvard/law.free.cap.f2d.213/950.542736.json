Nehi appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-9\">Its first proposition is that Mission\u2019s trade-mark \u201cRoyal Punch\u201d is confusingly similar to its trade-mark \u201cRoyal Crown\u201d when both are applied to soft drinks. It reasons that the test for confusion is applied to ordinary purchasers; that the ordinary purchasers of soft drinks are careless and casual purchasers ; therefore the confusion test in this instance should be applied to careless and casual purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-10\">We find nothing in the record to support the contention that the ordinary soft drink buyer is a careless and casual buyer but, even so, we note that Chief Judge Leahy in his opinion made specific allowance \u201cfor the facts and circumstances attendant upon the ordinary retail purchase of soft drinks, viz., small price, types of purchasers, and places of sale.\u201d 117 F.Supp. 116, 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-11\">\u25a0 One of the cases relied upon by the trial court in ascertaining whether the confusion existed was his own opinion in Telechron, Inc., v. Telicon Corp., D. C., 97 F.Supp. 131, which we affirmed in 3 Cir., 1952, 198 F.2d 903. The latter decision with others of the type is here relied upon by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-12\">On the issue of confusion it is evident from the trial judge\u2019s opinion that he had very much in mind just what and who were involved. Using the same sound standard as he had in the Tele-chron matter, namely, whether an average buyer is unable to distinguish defendant\u2019s name or mark from his recollection of plaintiff\u2019s mark, the court concluded that, as he stated in his opinion, \u201cI think there is a sufficient dissimilarity in appearance of the two marks, their pronunciation or sound, and their suggestiveness so that the ordinary purchaser would not confuse them.\u201d Our own examination of the record convinces us that the trial court\u2019s determination of that issue of fact is not only supported by the evidence but is clearly the right decision. Cf. Q-Tips, Inc., v. Johnson &amp; Johnson, 3 Cir., 1953, 206 F.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-14\">We agree with the district court that there is no necessity at this time of examining into the question of laches on the part of the appellant as determined by the Commissioner of Patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-15\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
