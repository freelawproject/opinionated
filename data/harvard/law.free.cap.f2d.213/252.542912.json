So insisting, it urges upon us that \"the sole question involved in this appeal is whether or not the United States Court had jurisdiction to remit a forfeiture of an automobile for violation of the internal revenue laws relating to narcotics.\"</p>\n<p id=\"AcX5\">Helton, having no interest in the further proceedings, has made no appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\">The bank, denying that the purport and effect of the judgment was to forfeit the car and remit the forfeiture in -favor of the lien of the bank, and that the question presented on this appeal is the question of the power of the district judge so to do, insists that the judgment was a denial of the forfeiture and that two questions are presented for decision: the first, does the United States have the right to forfeit property of innocent per~ sons without just compensation therefor, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution; the second, whether the proof was insufficient to show a violation of the law and justify forfeiture of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"AKb\">In its argument on the first point, appellee cites no cases in support of its position and concedes that the only authorities it can find are to the contrary. We will, therefore, without gathering or citing some of the many authorities which conclusively show the law to be the contrary of the bank's contention, simply say of it that the contention is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"AjF\">Upon its second point, that the judgment was not, as contended by appellant, a judgment forfeiting and remitting but one denying altogether the forfeiture sought, and that there was no evidence that the defendant Helton was concealing or possessing or selling any narcotics, the bank points to the testimony of Hel-ton that lie did not know anything about the marihuana in his car, and that he never made any sales out of the car. So pointing, it urges upon us that any unlawful use by anyone else of the car could not cause a forfeiture and, therefore, there is absolutely no proof of any kind whatsoever to sustain the allegations of the libel.</p>\n<p id=\"A8vN\">The bank also insists that the motion to suppress was good and it must be presumed in favor of the judgment that it was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">We cannot agree with these views. We think it was made abundantly clear by the district judge's grounds for judgment that he did not sustain the motion to suppress and that he did not find or intend to find that the government had not made out its case for forfeiture. The whole tenor, indeed the precise language, of the court's findings expressly rebut such a conclusion. Stating, \"I do not think, * * * would justify a forfeiture of this bank's security by reason of the mere finding in the car of that which was illegal to be there. If Billy Joe were seeking the car, that would be a different matter, but the interpleader here is the bank that loaned on the car. And the car will be liberated upon payment of any storage charges to and for the benefit of, the Greenville Avenue State Bank\", the findings concluded with, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>\u201cLet me have an order to that effect, Gentlemen\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"AGtF\">Since it is established law appellees\u2019 only remedy is to petition the Secretary of the Treasury,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the judgment is Reversed and the cause is Remanded with directions to enter judgment against the bank for $1500, the reasonable market value of the car when the bank took possession of it.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-33\">. The Court: \u201cI don\u2019t think the bank here had any legal, compelling reason why it should have asked the Chief of Police of Dallas, or the United States Marshal of Dallas about Billy Joe. He had dealt with them before and was a prompt payer of his bills, and, I do not think that it was brought within the rule which would justify a forfeiture of this bank\u2019s security by reason of the mere finding in the car of that which was illegal to be there.</p>\n<p id=\"ap-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>\"If Billy Joe were seeking the car, that would be a different matter, but the in-terpleader here is the bank that loaned on the car.</p>\n<p id=\"Apt\">\"And, the car will be liberated upon payment of any storage charges to, and for the benefit of, the Greenville Avenue State Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"A7bp\">\"Let me havr an order</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ayh-dedup-0\">.
