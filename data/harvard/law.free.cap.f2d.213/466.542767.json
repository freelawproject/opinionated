The evidence amply supports the verdict. The pre-trial stipulation and the testimony of defendant\u2019s president fully answer defendant\u2019s argument that defendant did not authorize the army officers to act as defendant\u2019s agents in shipping the goods to defendant at its New York address. Moreover, the letter from defendant\u2019s lawyer to plaintiff shows that defendant did not refuse to pay the demanded charges on the ground that the shipments were not authorized by defendant but solely because of the asserted error in the classification. As defendant made no effort to prove the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>tents of the sales contract, it is in no position to assert that the contract obligated the army to pay the freight charges; nor did defendant\u2019s president, in his testimony, so much as whisper that the contract so provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
