The trial court found the issues favorable to plaintiff, entered judgment accordingly, and awarded to plaintiff $1,500 as punitive damages, plus $1,500 attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-26\">Plaintiff charged defendant with infringement of its trade-mark \u201cTub-Kove,\u201d registered on the Supplemental Register in the U. S. Patent Office, bearing Registration No. 529,264, dated August 15, 1950. The complaint also charged infringement of a trade-mark registered by plaintiff, being a design consisting of a circular solid colored background with a contrasting angular figure thereon, registered on the Principal Register in the U. S. Patent Office, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>bearing Registration No. 553,206, dated January 8, 1952. Each registration showed that the trade-mark was used for flexible sealing strips.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">As early as 1948 plaintiff engaged in the manufacture and sale of flexible sealing strips made of white, rubber-like material and adapted to be cemented at the juncture of intersecting surfaces, particularly where wall and bathtub surfaces join. The strips are used to seal the crack or space between such surfaces. The strips are sold to the public as part of a kit made up of a 15 ft. length of sealing strip, a bottle of cement, a bottle of solvent, and a brush applicator. The strips are in a flat, ribbonlike form, put up in an elongated roll. The strips have a characteristic feature, in that when applied at a right angle to wall and tub, a triangular shaped recess opens on the side adjacent to the porcelain of the tub and the wall. The cement, by working into and adhering to the recesses of the strip, as well as to the bathtub and wall surfaces, causes the strip to remain firmly in place in spite of the presence of moisture, steam and soap.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Plaintiff adopted and used a distinctive package for the marketing of its sealing strip. On the front and on each side of its package, \u201cTub-Kove\u201d appeared in large white letters. On the front of the package and immediately under \u201cTub-Kove,\u201d appeared \u201cSealing Strip\u201d in white letters, while on the sides, the words \u201cSealing Strip\u201d appeared in black letters immediately following \u201cTub-Kove.\u201d Underneath part of the word \u201cTub-Kove\u201d as it appears on the front of the package, and immediately adjacent thereto, appeared the design, consisting of a black circular background, with a white angular figure thereon, which figure was a representation of a cross-section view of plaintiff\u2019s sealing strip as applied. On the face of the package an outline of two bathtubs also appeared, and the places where the sealing strips should be applied were indicated by heavy white lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Prior to the commencement of this suit plaintiff had spent in excess of $42,000 in advertising its product, and in addition had received considerable free advertising in trade magazines and papers. Plaintiff\u2019s product was well received by the public. Plaintiff sold more than 372.000 of its packaged kits, including 75.000 which were sold to the retail trade by Sears-Roebuck &amp; Company under its own trade-mark, \u201cHarmony House.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">In 1952 defendant started marketing a sealing strip of a material and color similar to that used in plaintiff\u2019s strip. It adopted a package of the same shape and dimensions as that used by plaintiff. The words \u201cTub Cove\u201d in large black letters appeared on the front and both sides of defendant\u2019s package. The words \u201cSeal Strip\u201d in smaller black letters appeared either immediately thereunder or following the words \u201cTub Cove.\u201d Defendant also used on the front of its package a circular design with a solid dark blue background, on which appeared an angular figure which represented a cross-section of a sealing strip as applied, with the recess resembling very closely that in plaintiff\u2019s strip but not being a truthful representation of a cross-section of the strip as manufactured and sold by defendant. On the front of the package an outline of two bathtubs also appeared, and the places where the sealing strips should be applied were indicated by heavy black lines. Defendant\u2019s package also enclosed a bottle of cement, a bottle of solvent and a brush applicator, in addition to a 15 ft. strip of its sealing strip, in an elongated roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">The colors of plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s packages were not similar. Approximately one-third of the top of plaintiff\u2019s package was reddish orange in color, the other portion being black and white in about equal amounts. Over one-half of both sides of plaintiff\u2019s package was white, and all printing on the sides was in black, except the words \u201cTub-Kove\u201d which were in white letters. The predominating color of defendant\u2019s package was maize-yellow, the other color being dark blue. A scalloped white line extending entirely around the package separated the yellow and blue portions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>It is apparent that the colors used in the respective packages would not be the basis of customer confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">On the rear side of plaintiff\u2019s package, on a black background, \u201cDirections for Applying Cove Sealing Strip\u201d appeared in white letters, the instructions being contained in 7 paragraphs. In Paragraph 5 appears, \u201cFor the best fit in sharp corners, follow the simple mitering steps below.\u201d Two designs, labeled \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB,\u201d followed. On defendant\u2019s package the instructions printed in black on a yellow background are almost identical to those on plaintiff\u2019s package. The fifth paragraph provides, \u201cFor the best fit in sharp corners, follow the simple mitering steps below,\u201d followed by two designs labeled \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB,\u2019 same being very similar to those appearing on plaintiff\u2019s package. On either end of plaintiff\u2019s package its corporate name and address appear printed in black letters on a white background. On defendant\u2019s package its corporate name and address likewise appear printed in black letters on a yellow background.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The district court found that while defendant\u2019s package is not identical to that of plaintiff, when viewed in their entirety their similarity, and defendant\u2019s use of the dominant features of plaintiff\u2019s package, are immediately apparent. The court observed, \u201cExcept to the very careful observer, the plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s packages resemble each other as much as do the Gold Dust Twins.\u201d The court found neither of plaintiff\u2019s marks to be descriptive, but also found that they had acquired a secondary meaning. The court further found that there had been confusion as to the marks in the past, and that there is a likelihood of confusion in the future. The court concluded that the words \u201cTub-Kove\u201d constitute a valid trade-mark as applied to flexible sealing strips such as those manufactured by plaintiff; also that the angular design against a circular background constituted a valid trade-mark as applied to the same products. The court concluded that plaintiff\u2019s trademark registrations are valid, and that the marks were infringed by defendant, and ordered that the further use thereof by defendant be enjoined. The trial court also sustained plaintiff\u2019s charge of unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">Defendant urges that the term \u201cTub-Kove\u201d is descriptive and that no secondary meaning was proved. Defendant also argues that due to the differences in dress and color between plaintiff\u2019s and defendant\u2019s packages, there was no reasonable probability of confusion. Defendant also points out that on the two ends of its package its corporate name and address prominently appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">We consider first the alleged invalidity of plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark \u201cTub-Kove,\u201d Registration No. 529,264. Is it descriptive as applied to sealing strips? \u201cTub\u201d describes a tub, so we direct our attention to \u201cKove.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">\u201cCove\u201d is a well recognized English word having several meanings, one of which is given by <em>Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2d Ed., Unabridged, </em>as \u201ca concave molding\u201d; also \u201ca member whose section is a concave curve\u201d; also, as a verb, \u201cto arch over; to build in a hollow concave form.\u201d A \u201ccoved ceiling\u201d is defined as \u201ca ceiling the part of which next to the wall is constructed in a cove.\u201d <em>Century New Dictionary and Encyclopedia </em>gives as a definition, \u201cAny kind of a concave molding; the hollow of a vault,\u201d and a cove ceiling as \u201ca ceiling formed in a coved or arched manner at its junction with the side walls.\u201d Witnesses experienced in the art explained that there are floor cove strips, wall cove strips, ceiling cove strips, etc. In its directions on the back of its package, plaintiff described its product as a \u201ccove sealing strip.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">Plaintiff always used the term \u201cTub-Kove\u201d in connection with its sealing strips. The strips, as applied to the tub and wall surfaces, can properly be described as a concave molding for a tub, and the words are descriptive unless saved by the fact that plaintiff spelled \u201ccove\u201d as \u201cKove.\u201d The pronunciation would be the same. Spelling \u201ccove\u201d as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>\"Kove\u201d does not make the word less descriptive. In Steem-Electric Corp. v. Herzfeld-Phillipson Co., 7 Cir., 118 F.2d 122, 126, we said, \u201cCan plaintiff by changing one letter in the word \u2018steam\u2019 so as to make it read \u2018steem\u2019 make it any less descriptive? It is our view that the answer must be in the negative.\u201d In Standard Paint Co. v. Trinidad Asphalt Mfg. Co., 220 U.S. 446, 455, 31 S.Ct. 456, 55 L.Ed. 536, the court held the word \u201cRubberoid\u201d being a descriptive word was nonetheless descriptive when spelled \u201cRuberoid,\u201d and that the latter could not be appropriated as a trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The Patent Office refused registration of \u201cTub-Kove\u201d on the Principal Register; thereafter plaintiff registered the mark on the Supplemental Register under \u00a7 23 of the Trade-Mark Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1091. By the terms of the statute a mark which is merely descriptive when applied to the goods of an applicant may be registered on the Supplemental Register. In our view \u201cTub-Kove\u201d is descriptive and is not valid as a technical trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">However, where a mark has acquired a secondary meaning, it will be protected irrespective of any original weakness. If a generic term has acquired a secondary meaning, latecomers must adopt means to avoid public deception. Jewel Tea Co., Inc. v. Kraus, 7 Cir., 187 F.2d 278, 283. The district court found that the mark \u201cTub-Kove\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning. The burden was on the plaintiff to establish that the primary significance of \u201cTubKove\u201d in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer. Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U.S. 111, 118, 59 S.Ct. 109, 83 L.Ed. 73. In other words has the trade-mark \u201cTub-Kove\u201d come to represent in the minds of the public the source or origin of the goods, rather than the goods themselves ?</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The proof in this record is rather meager that. \u201cTub-Kove\u201d in the minds of the consuming public meant the plaintiff and not. the plaintiff\u2019s product. However, we are required to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Doing so, we cannot say that the court\u2019s finding as to a secondary meaning of \u201cTub-Kove\u201d was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">We think the district court was clearly correct in holding the design mark, Registration No. 553,206 valid. This mark is in effect a bull\u2019s-eye design, which was used on the top or cover of plaintiff\u2019s package. The fact that two letters of \u201cTub-Kove\u201d and two letters of the word \u201cSealing\u201d intruded somewhat on the black circle of the design does not destroy the validity of the mark. The eyes of a purchaser, would be drawn to the design so prominently displayed on the cover of plaintiff\u2019s package. The defendant adopted a very similar design, showing an angular figure on a dark circular background. Defendant even copied the cross-section view of plaintiff\u2019s strip, although the cross-section view of it own product was different. The defendant presented no evidence as to how it happened to use a design so similar to that used by plaintiff. One who makes use of another\u2019s trade-mark has the burden of justifying such use and to show his right has been exercised with reasonable regard to the rights of the owner of the mark. Miles Shoes, Inc. v. R. H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc., 2 Cir., 199 F.2d 602.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Defendant argues that proof is lacking that in purchasing defendant\u2019s kit anyone was deceived by defendant\u2019s design into the belief he was purchasing plaintiff\u2019s kit. To sustain an action of trade-mark infringement and unfair competition, \u201cit is not necessary to show actual cases of confusion since the test under the statute, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1114(1), is likelihood of such confusion.\u201d Independent Nail &amp; Packing Co., Inc. v. Stronghold Screw Products, Inc., 7 Cir., 205 F.2d 921, 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Defendant also relies on a disclaimer which, plaintiff filed during the prosecution of its application for the design trade-mark. The disclaimer was, * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>no claim being made herein to the representation of the goods separate and apart from the trade-mark as shown * * *. \u201d This disclaimer was required by the Patent Office because the cross-section of the strip which forms the angular design is a representation of the plaintiff\u2019s strip in its applied form. Plaintiff would not have been in a position to complain about defendant\u2019s conduct being unfair if on the face of its package defendant had displayed a true representation of a cross-section of its own strip in some other way than in a bull\u2019s-eye design. However, defendant did not do this. It copied the general appearance of plaintiff\u2019s bull\u2019s-eye design and then copied the cross-section of plaintiff\u2019s strip which would, quite naturally, result in a likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Whether there is an infringement of a trade-mark does not depend upon the use of identical words or design, \u201cbut it is sufficient if one adopts a trade name or a trade-mark so like another in form, spelling, or sound that one, with a not very definite or clear recollection as to the real trade-mark, is likely to become confused or misled. Northam Warren Corp. v. Universal Cosmetic Co., 7 Cir., 18 F.2d 774, 775. See: Independent Nail &amp; Packing Co., Inc. v. Strongheld Screw Products, Inc., supra, 205 F.2d at page 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Defendant also urges that plaintiff is estopped in this action because it supplied to Sears-Roebuck &amp; Co. the material which Sears-Roebuck packaged and sold to its customers under its trade-mark, \u201cHarmony Plouse.\u201d Sears-Roebuck did not use the mark \u201cTubKove\u201d nor did it utilize the bull\u2019s-eye design. It described the contents of its package as \u201cCove Sealing Strip.\u201d But plaintiff does not complain that defendant has entered into competition with it in selling a plastic strip which can be cemented at the junction of a bathtub and wall. It complains that defendant identified its product as \u201cTfib Cove\u201d in competition with plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark \u201cTub-Kove\u201d; that defendant placed a bull\u2019s eye containing an angular design on its package resembling plaintiff\u2019s bull\u2019s-eye trade-mark; and that in its bull\u2019s-eye design defendant even illustrated the patented cross-section of plaintiff\u2019s strip as though defendant\u2019s package contained such a strip. The evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that defendant was guilty of such conduct, and that same constituted both trade-mark infringement and unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">The issue of unfair competition is of course determined by the law of Illinois. We discussed in some detail our interpretation of the Illinois law in connection with a trade-mark and unfair competition case in Independent Nail &amp; Packing Co., Inc. v. Stronghold Screw Products, Inc., supra. It would unduly extend this opinion to repeat what we said there. Suffice it to say that in our opinion the plaintiff has proved its contention of unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Defendant complains of the imposition of $1,500 punitive damages, and that it is required to pay $1,500 attorney fees to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">We do not think this is a case where punitive damages should have been allowed. Before filing this suit plaintiff did not notify defendant that it was infringing its trade-marks or that plaintiff charged it with unfair competition. Immediately upon the commencement of this suit defendant ceased the use of \u201cTub Cove\u201d and the use of the bull\u2019s-eye design. The trial court stated that any profits defendant had made were- very nominal and that he doubted if plaintiff\u2019s damages would exceed $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">In a case of willful and wanton infringement the trial court has discretion to award punitive damages, but such damages should only be awarded in extreme cases, Aladdin Mfg. Co. v. Mantle Lamp Co. of America, 7 Cir., 116 F.2d 708, 716; such damages \u201care not a favorite in law,\u201d Id., 116 F.2d at page 717. See: Post v. Buck\u2019s Stove &amp; Range Co., 8 Cir., 200 F. 918, 43 L.R.A.,N.S., 498. Here the validity of the mark \u201cTub-Kove\u201d and whether any secondary meaning had attached to that mark were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>close questions. That defendant had used entirely different colors on its package than plaintiff had used was a mitigating consideration. Although plaintiff is entitled to an injunction, as determined by the trial court, we think it an abuse of discretion to have allowed punitive damages, and the judgment will be modified by eliminating the allowance of $1,500 as punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">The allowance of $1,500 attorney fees is in a somewhat different category. As pointed out by this court, in the Aladdin case, supra, 116 F.2d at page 717, \u201cCounsel\u2019s fees necessitated by the tort have been said in some instances to be recoverable as a part of the compensatory damages and in other cases as a part of exemplary damages.\u201d In the case at bar the trial court assessed only a part of the attorney fees incurred by plaintiff in this action. We think the allowance of $1,500 to cover part of plaintiff\u2019s litigation expenses was proper as compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The judgment will be modified by striking therefrom the assessment of $1,500 as punitive damages, and as thus modified is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
