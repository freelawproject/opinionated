We think that these were properly calculated under Rule 50 of the rules of that court. They were the direct consequence \u201e ,, m <em>^ </em>, of the Tax Court s findings and opinion , , and made necessary by the differences between those findings and opinion and the earlier determination by the Corn-missioner. They did not constitute new issues.</p>\n<p id=\"A2U\">The decisions of the Tax Court, 19 T.C. 641, will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
