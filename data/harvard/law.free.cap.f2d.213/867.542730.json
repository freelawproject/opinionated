Appellant has failed to exhaust his remedies under state law and the order of the court below would be affirmed on that ground if the appeal were properly before us. Appellant has failed, however, to secure the certificate of probable cause required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 as prerequisite to appeal and no judge of this court is of opinion that such certificate should be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-25\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
