They should not occur at all. For on this appeal we are compelled to reverse a conviction of crime, which was supported by substantial evidence, because of the many improper things said and done by the special prosecutor who tried the case for the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">The indictment, charging income tax evasion, was tried to a jury with protracted examination and cross-examination of prosecution and defense witnesses about the income, expenses and accounts of a business over a number of years. Throughout the trial the prosecutor repeatedly interrupted his opponent\u2019s interrogation of witnesses, inevitably diverting the attention of the jury, by heckling comments and improper suggestions. The following examples are illustrative of the many such improprieties scattered throughout the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">Displeased with a line of questioning, the prosecutor interrupted defense counsel with this suggestion: \u201cJust ask him if he will answer yes to anything you ask.\u201d When defense counsel introduced a restatement of a question by saying, \u201cI want to frame this question correctly,\u201d the prosecutor observed, \u201cAfter listening to me you should get it correct.\u201d When defense counsel explained that the purpose of certain questioning was \u201cto tie that all up\u201d the prosecutor volunteered the prediction that the witness \u201cwill tie himself up.\u201d When defense counsel inquired whether the members of the jury were able to see certain material being exhibited to them, the prosecutor interrupted to say, \u201cMaybe they don\u2019t want to look at it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">Beyond this, from time to time the prosecutor derided, badgered, and attempted to browbeat opposing counsel and witnesses in most extraordinary fashion. When, after a colloquy, defense counsel agreed to withdraw a question, the prosecutor\u2019s open court comment was \u201cEvery time he runs into a brick wall, he withdraws.\u201d He derided the documentary material assembled by the defense by saying: \u201cNow to expedite this, would counsel please take out of this debris any years other than 1945 * * His cross-examination of witnesses became choleric and accusatory. Addressing one witness: \u201c * * * You can\u2019t scare me by glaring at me. * * * \u201d To another: \u201cYou sneered at me in the hall.\u201d To a third: \u201cYou had better keep your seat, brother.\u201d And to opposing counsel: \u201cYou are not running me ofi: of any spot, Mister.\u201d To still another witness : \u201cI know you are an \u2018eager beaver\u2019 but I would like to get in a question.\u201d When defense counsel objected that in cross-examination the prosecutor \u201cis yelling right down at his ear * * * rattling the witness\u201d \u2014 the retort was, \u201cHe is already rattled.\u201d Perhaps the worst of these verbal assaults appears in this interchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-17\">Prosecutor to Defense Counsel: \u201cGo and sit down.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-18\">Defense Counsel: \u201cI will stand up if I want to stand up * * * and you can\u2019t tell me to sit down. You are being unmannerly.\u201d '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Prosecutor: \u201cI wonder how unmannerly I will get with you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">In all, appellants have set out in their Appendix forty-eight examples of alleged improprieties of the prosecutor while the evidence was being introduced. Some of the things said, like those quoted above were obviously improper. Others were trivial to the point of being inconsequential, if considered individually. But pervading the hearing as they did they must have disrupted and impeded the orderly presentation and rational consideration of the evidence. A trial is an adversary proceeding and may properly be contested with vigor and spirit. But it must not become a Donnybrook Fair during which evidence cannot be properly presented and the brawling of counsel diverts the jury from the serious business of comprehending, remembering and mentally organizing the testimony. In this connection it has been urged by the government that the conduct of defense counsel was not exemplary and that some of the excesses of the prosecution were provoked. If that is true, then the trial had degenerated even more than we have indicated. In any event we think it clear that the trial judge, who did no more than interpose occasional mild admonitions interspersed with assurances that he regarded counsel on both sides as fine gentlemen, let the trial get too far out of hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">But the worst was yet to come. The closing argument gave counsel an opportunity to summarize and present in perspective the strong case the government could make on the record. Indeed, the prosecutor seemed to recognize this when he began his closing presentation by promising \u201cto discuss the issues in this case in a cool, calm dispassionate manner.\u201d But less than one hundred words later he plunged into a diatribe, featuring corruption in Washington and introduced by the statement in feigned southern accent, \u201cPerhaps you-all are familiar with Mr. Theron Caudle.\u201d Nothing is to be gained by restating in detail the irrelevant discussion of the \u201cmess in Washington\u201d and \u201cin other places\u201d which followed. It is enough to say that this improper beginning served as a frame of reference for a subsequent charge, itself equally improper because unsupported by evidence, that an attempt had been made to \u201c \u2018fix\u2019 this case.\u201d That in turn was followed by a warning to the jury that if defendants\u2019 accountants \u201ccan get away with this one, there will be a lot of \u2018messes\u2019 that they will be hired to clear up.\u201d In this connection it merits mention that at some points the summation was nothing but a lampooning of these accountants: for example, \u201cNow the Boy Wonder, Mr. Schietinger, never mentioned that $6,801.02, nor the Bull of the Pampas, Mr. Sauer \u2014 \u2018S\u2019 and \u2018S\u2019, smooth, slick, slippery, they all start with \u2018S\u2019 \u2014 the gentlemen who have built up this case. # * *\u00bb\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The closing argument also exceeded all bounds of propriety in an attack upon the twenty character witnesses who had testified to the good reputation of the defendants. In attempting to make the legitimate point that wrongdoers sometime enjoy a good reputation, counsel dramatized the career of Alger Hiss, with comment and sinister innuendo as to his role at Yalta and in the formation of the United Nations at San Francisco. Dealing more directly with the character witnesses in this case, the prosecutor first described them as \u201cwell trained\u201d and \u201cwell schooled\u201d and then inquired rhetorically, \u201cOh God, why is there perjury in this world?\u201d Yet, the record does not suggest in any way that the character witnesses had misrepresented the reputation of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">More generally the pattern of this closing, in so far as it had pattern, seems to have been a dramatic representation of the prosecutor, the trial judge and the jury as engaged against odds in the com-batting of evil on a very broad front. This involved an excoriation of wrongdoers so comprehensive as to include the expression of very dim views as to the character and ability of the bench and the bar. The jury was told that \u201cThere are not so many learned, wise, courageous judges, sitting on the bench today.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Immediately thereafter tribute was paid to the sitting judge as a distinguished exception. As to the bar, after the prosecution had identified himself with the great \u201coldtime lawyers,\u201d he deplored the \u201cnew group of lawyers growing up, men who hide and hinder and hamper and secrete and evade and avoid and mislead juries,\" leaving it to be implied that defense counsel belonged among these perverse moderns.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Finally, this speech had a peroration. It concluded with an exhortation that the jury \u201cmay be inspired with some of the courage and the wisdom and the foresight of our great President, when he promised the people of the United States that he would \u2018clean up the messes\u2019 wherever he found them.\u201d This was the final word in the argument of a case where there had been no evidence of either actual or attempted corruption of officials in connection with defendants\u2019 tax liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">At the conclusion of this speech the trial judge denied a motion for a mistrial. And he made no effort to minimize or correct the prejudicial effect of any part of what the jury had just heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">In many cases it is difficult to decide whether there has been a serious enough deviation from fairness and propriety in the conduct of a trial to warrant the upsetting of a verdict which otherwise is supported by the evidence. But here there were obvious flagrant departures from fairness and so many improprieties that we have not even tried to enumerate them. The record of what was said and done at this trial is much too bad to let any conviction stand upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">A separate contention has been made on behalf of the defendant, Charles F. Schmidt, that on the evidence his acquittal was mandatory. He was convicted under Section 145(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 145(b), of a wilful attempt to evade income taxes owed by a corporation by causing false and fraudulent corporate returns to be filed. He now argues he could be convicted at most of the lesser offense of aiding in the preparation of a false return. However, there was evidence that he was the secretary of the corporation and responsible for the keeping of its books and the preparation of its income tax returns. We are satisfied that the evidence of his role in the evasion of corporate taxes was sufficient to go to the jury on the charge made against him in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">The judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
