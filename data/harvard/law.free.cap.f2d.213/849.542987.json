The order reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b898-31\">\u201cOn Dec. 5,1952, movant was sentenced by this Court to five years imprisonment after his plea of guilty to an information charging, in part, that he did \u2018unlawfully, feloniously and with intent to do bodily harm, make an assault upon one Paul Oliver Sadler, an inmate of said United States Penitentiary, with a piece of metal sharpened in the semblance of a knife, dagger, dirk and scissors, which piece of metal when sharpened as aforesaid was a dangerous weapon, .in violation of Title 18, Sec. 113(c) U.S.C.A.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b898-32\">\u201cIn his motion, made pursuant to the provisions of 28 U.S.C.A., Sec. 2255, movant contends that the sentence is excessive in that the information does not charge an offense under 18 U.S.C.A., Sec. 113(c) but charges only the offense of unlawfully assaulting by striking and wounding another (See. 113 (d)) and the offense of unlawfully assaulting another, (Sec. 113(e)). Movant places most emphasis on the contention that the information does not charge an assault \u2018with a dangerous weapon\u2019. He points out that nowhere in the information is it charged that the assault was made \u2018without just cause or excuse\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-17\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>\u201cIn a collateral attack upon an information the question is not whether the information is vulnerable to direct attack by motion or demurrer, but whether it is so fatally defective as to deprive the court of jurisdiction. The information shows upon its face that it was based upon 18 U.S.C.A., Sec. 113(c). It clearly seeks to charge an assault with a deadly weapon. While this information does not allege the absence of excuse for the attack, it does expressly allege that the attack was unlawfully made. No exceptional circumstances are alleged which would justify a collateral attack upon tbe information. See Hill v. Sanford, 5 Cir., 131 F.2d 417, certiorari denied 318 U.S. 774, 63 S.Ct. 771, 87 L.Ed. 1143; Barnes v. United States, 8 Cir., 197 F.2d 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-26\">\u201cThe motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief. For the reasons set forth above the motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-27\">\u201cThis the 6th day of January, 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-28\">\u201c(S.) Frank A.
