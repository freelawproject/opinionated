Kennith Frank, Jr., became a resident of the District of Columbia in September, 1951. Less than three months thereafter Alvin P. Adams sued him in the Municipal Court to recover $2,125 allegedly due for services rendered under a contract made in California in 1946. When the action was filed, it was barred' by the three-year statute of limitations, \u00a7 12-201, D.C.Code 1951, unless the limitation period did not begin to run until Frank became a resident of the District of Columbia. The Municipal Court, applying \u00a7 12-205 of the Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held limitation had not run and gave Adams judgment against Frank for the sum which he claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">The Municipal Court of Appeals held that \u00a7 12-205 was inapplicable, that the action was barred by the three-year 'statute, and reversed the judgment of the Municipal Court. We allowed an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">We approve and adopt the opinion of the Municipal Court of Appeals, reported in 1953, 98 A.2d 789.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-11\">.
