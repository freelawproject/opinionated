This exception is that where the record plainly shows that there is no evidence at all in support of the record or such a paucity of it as to show a miscarriage of justice, the court will relieve against the judgment of conviction by reversing it and discharging the defendant or at least remanding the cause for trial anew.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-20\">The United States, in its turn, conceding that if the record made the showing contended for by appellant, this court could and would, notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s failure to move for a verdict, relieve him from the judgment, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>sists that the record wholly fails to make out such a case. It, therefore, urges upon us that what appellant is in effect asking us to do here is to ignore the rule established by the cases,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, proceeding as though the requisite motion had been made below, search the record for error, and that this, under settled law, we should not, indeed may not, justly do.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">A study of appellant\u2019s brief and a reading of the record leaves us in no doubt that it is apparent on the face of the record that there is not presented here such a condition of \u201cunfairness and injustice\u201d as would require us to correct an obvious miscarriage of justice and that we may not be required to, indeed we ought not to, subject the record to the intensive scrutiny and search which would be required of us if appellant had, as he should have done, tested the evidence below by a motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">No reversible error appearing, the judgment must be, and it is hereby, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-21\">. \u201cIt is not contended by the appellant that any prejudicial errors were committed by the Trial Judge upon the trial of this case. This appeal is based solely upon the contention that the guilt of the accused was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt. That the evidence taken as a whole is more consistent with innocence than with guilt and that the error committed was committed by the jury in returning a verdict of \u2018guilty as eharg-ed\u2019 in the absence of sufficient evidence to sustain such a verdict.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Av5m\">.
