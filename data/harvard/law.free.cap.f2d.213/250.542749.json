This car was built for the purpose of carrying ice and perishables, but at the time in question was used for the carriage of miscellaneous freight. There were ice tank bulkheads across both ends of the car, extending 3 feet inwardly at either end. The inside length of the reefer between these bulkheads was 33 feet and <em>1% </em>inches. The inside width was 8 feet 10 inches. At the center of the car were double doors through which freight was loaded and unloaded, these having a width of 5 feet, On being opened the doors folded back along the outer surface of the car and at the hinge side they extended some fches int\u00b0 doorwaf space, thua offenn\u00ab a further P\u00b0sslble impediment to the removal of lengthy freight. The pipe C\u00eduest\u00edon was ^ *nch Pipe 21 feet in len\u00abth- There were 7 len\u00abths of <em>P^e m </em>the bundle&gt; fastened together with wires either end, the bundle weight being approximately 167 pounds. While lying da* on tbe door \u00b0f the reefer with the rear end at the bulkhead, the front end of the extended some distance bey\u00b0nd the farther side of the doorway,</p>\n<p id=\"aix-dedup-0\">The work of unloading freight was done by appellee and one Scott, a senior or head brakeman, the first order of business apparently being the removal of the P\u00cdP*5- Appellee took up the forward end of the bundle at the doorway while Scott took the rear end, carrying it to the opposite rear corner of the car for ,, , the purpose of shortening\u201d the overlap , , <em>,, </em>, T , , . beyond the doorway. In order to get his end of the bundle through the door appellee was obliged to raise it to a position well above his head, while Scott held the rear end close to the floor. In the exertion of twisting and maneuvering to accomplish his task appellee suffered the hurt to his back.</p>\n<p id=\"aoi-dedup-0\">The ^ of the suit is that the car_ rier wag negligent in causing heavy pipe of guch length to be placed \u00a1n car of the character and dimensions of the reefer, rather than in a flat car, or a gondola, or a box car; and that appellee sustained his injury in consequence thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"AY9u\">Appellant calls attention to admissions of appellee and of Scott to the effect that there was \u201cnothing wrong\u201d with the inside of the car \u2014 no slush, mud, or slippery substance on the floor or any shortcoming of that sort, hence, it is said, there was admittedly no failure on appellant\u2019s part to furnish appellee with a safe place to work. Of course, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>reefer was not per se unsafe. Whether unsafe or no was a matter dependent on the nature of the freight carried. Cf. Blair v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co., 323 U.S. 600, 65 S.Ct. 545, 89 L.Ed. 490. The car afforded no hazard to the loading or unloading of package or other-freight which could without substantial difficulty be put through the doors. But the jury might reasonably find that it was neither suitable nor safe for the handling of the lengthy bundle of heavy pipe appellee was obliged to wrestle with in the manner heretofore indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"AM_\">It appears to be conceded that the bulkheads at the ends of the reefer were removable, so that it would have been feasible for appdlant by remoymy them, to have extended the length of the car a total of 6 feet,- thud obviating the difficulties \"described 'above. '- -But appellant counters by\"'saying 'that it wad possible to shove the r\u00e9ar end of the bundle of pipe into the \u2022'space' between ' the bulk-' head and the floor-of the c\u00e1r, hence that the mere presente; bf je bulkheads should have caused no difficulty However, the bundle of pipe was itself 4 inches m ^diameter, and there -was evideuce from wMch-it could have been found that- the- space between Jmlkhead and floor was mot . greater- than that, Moreover the witness Scott,-an expen<em>e</em>nced hand,' testifiedthat the safest way to unload the pipe was the manner- . , ,, m which the unloading' was actually effected. We may add that on appellants motion the jury- were given the advan-, tage of inspecting a emular refrigerator car at the carrier s San Francisco yards at which time the car contained a similar length of iron pipe.</p>\n<p id=\"Auj\">_ Finally, appellant contends that it was currently obliged by an outstanding order of the Office of Defense Transportation to use refrigerator cars for the haul- ,, , ... age of freight m less than carload lots. The showing in this respect was sketchy and unsatisfying. The witness testifying on the subject admitted that the order did not require the use of refrigerator cars in situations where their use was dangerous to the handlers of the freight,</p>\n<p id=\"AB3V\">The case was one so clearly within the province of the jury to determine that more extended discussion or citations of precedent would add nothing to the learning on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"AS6\">Affirmed,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
