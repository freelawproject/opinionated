An appeal by the same prisoner from the dismissal of a prior application was before us in Caroll v. Swenson, Warden, 4 Cir., 180 F.2d 579. The petition appears to be entirely without merit and no certificate of probable cause as a prerequisite to the right to prosecute the appeal has been obtained, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. The appeal will accordingly be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"A49\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
