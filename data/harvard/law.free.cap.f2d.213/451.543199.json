Among them were lumber, office furniture, fixtures and the like in Marion, Virginia. On July 7,1952, the appellant, a Virginia corporation, brought two actions in a Virginia court against Abbott Lumber Co., Inc., one being a distress for rent, the other an attachment action to recover for work and services in processing lumber. All the property above mentioned was attached and the trustee (ap-pellee), having filed bonds and secured the release of the property from attach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>ment, sold the lumber and now holds the proceeds. The remainder of the property is on the premises where it was attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">On August 23, 1952, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed in the court below against Abbott Lumber Co., Inc., and it was duly adjudicated a bankrupt, the appellee becoming the trustee in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">When the bankrupt\u2019s property was attached in one Virginia action or dis-trained in the other substantially all of it was located in a portion of premises which was occupied by the bankrupt who was then insolvent in the bankruptcy sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We think the order sustaining summary jurisdiction was correct since the bankrupt was in possession of the actual property when the petition in bankruptcy was filed with the exception of the lumber which had been released on bond and sold, and as to that it was in constructive possession. See Aldrich Shoe Co. v. Kagan, 1 Cir., 173 F.2d 457; In re Rand Mining Co., D.C., 71 F.Supp. 724; In re Worrall, 2 Cir., 79 F.2d 88. Such possession gave the bankruptcy court <em>in rem </em>jurisdiction to hear and determine summarily the rights of claimant to the property under liens obtained by attachment or other legal process. Section 67, sub. a(4), 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 107, sub. a(4). We interpret the words \u201csubstantially all\u201d to show that the bankrupt had possession of all but what should be disregarded under the <em>de minimis </em>rule. And on the merits any lien obtained by virtue of the Virginia suits was clearly null and void under \u00a7 67, sub. a(1) of the Act because the bankruptcy followed within four months. This, of course, does not affect any priority as to rent claims to which the appellant may be entitled under \u00a7 64, sub. a(5) of the Act and as to which we understand the appellant is satisfied with the order as made.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\"> It does, however, assert a lien upon the lumber under \u00a7 43-33 of the Virginia Code for the amount due it for the processing and contends that such a statutory lien is not within the provisions of \u00a7 67, sub. a of the Bankruptcy Act but that \u00a7 67, sub. b applies. We agree, but since this lumber was in the constructive possession of the bankrupt and not in that of the appellant as above noted, the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to determine the issue, Isaacs v. Hobbs, Tie &amp; T. Co., 282 U.S. 734, 51 S.Ct. 270, 75 L.Ed. 645, and we find no error in its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
