Heiner, 1930, 281 U.S. 238, 50 S.Ct. 286, 287, 74 L.Ed. 826, dealt with a trust reserving a contingent life estate to the settlor, Mrs. May, following a life estate to her husband. The Court held that \u00a7 302(c) of the 1926 Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> did not cover the settlor\u2019s life interest. In its opinion, the Court said: \u201cThe record fails clearly to disclose whether or no Mrs. May survived her husband. Apparently she did not. But this is not of special importance, since the refund should have been allowed in either event.\u201d If, then, \u00a7 302(c) had remained without amendment, May v. Heiner would have required a refund in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-15\">However, the Joint Resolution of March 3, 1931, 46 Stat. 1516 \u2014 enacted to amend \u00a7 302(c) at the urgent prompting of the Treasury which was alarmed by the serious consequences to the fisc of the May v. Heiner interpretation \u2014 included the added phrase or \u201ca transfer under which the transferor * * *' for * * * any period not ending before his death * * In 1932, Congress amended \u00a7 302(c) by \u00a7 803(a) of the 1932 Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which included a phrase \u2014 substantially like that added in the Joint Resolution \u2014 \u201cfor any period which does not in fact end before his death\u201d, and also a second new phrase* \u201cfor any period not ascertainable without reference to his death\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-17\">If we look solely to this statutory language, it is entirely clear that \u2014 without any assistance from or need for any in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>terpretive Regulation \u2014 it covers a contingent life interest like that in the trust before us here. So the Seventh Circuit held in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Nathan\u2019s Estate, 7 Cir., 159 F.2d 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Appellants, however, point to the Committee Reports on the 1932 amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These Reports state that the first pharse, \u201cor for any period which does not in fact end before his death\u201d, is but \u201cclarifying\u201d; and they give as an illustrative example of its coverage a case where the settlor \u201cis to have the income from and after the death of another person until his own death and such other person predeceases him.\u201d If those Reports control the interpretation of the statute, then this first phrase does not apply to the sort of contingent life estate, of a settlor who predeceases the preceding life tenant, considered in May v. Ileiner, and we have the astonishing result that the Joint Resolution, which had added virtually the same phrase, failed of its intended purpose.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">We must, then, construe an amendatory statute the text of which is clear and unambiguous \u2014 and undeniably reasonable if one accepts its literal meaning <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 while its context \u2014 its \u201clegislative history\u201d \u2014 alone is ambiguous: (1) According to the older notion, the background or context which legitimately may be considered in construing legislation consists primarily of the circumstances surrounding the appeal to the legislature and the \u201cmischief\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d which the legislation aimed to remedy.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here the literal text is entirely in accord with such circumstances and with the aim of the statute, <em>i. e., </em>the undoing of the May v. Heiner interpretation. (2) More recently, it has become legitimate, in the federal courts, also to consider more or less what Continental lawyers call \u201ctravaux preparatoires,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> including Committee Reports. But in respect of the statute we are now considering, (2) is at odds with (1). We think it has never been sound doctrine that a court may look at the text of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>Act only when the legislative history is ambiguous. But, even under such a doctrine, in the case of the 1932 \u2022 amendatory Act, we think we would be obliged to stick to the text without regard to the context. Consequently, although we confess that our conclusion is not free from all possible doubts, we think that, because of the astonishing result of resorting to the Committee Reports, we should ignore those Reports to the extent that they war with the plain and reasonable meaning of the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">There is also the second statutory phrase, \u201cfor any period not ascertainable without reference to his death,\u201d which, glove-like, fits the facts here. This second phrase the Committee Reports apparently considered a change of substance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To be sure, the Reports, in giving examples of the coverage of this second phrase, did not mention a case like that at bar where the settlor predeceases the holder of the preceding life interest. As, however, Congress deemed the addition of this second phrase a substantial change, it may well be that it was intended to eradicate any part of the May v. Heiner interpretation which the Joint Resolution of 1931 and the first phrase in the 1932 amendment may conceivably have left intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-13\">Accordingly, we agree with Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Nathan\u2019s Estate, 7 Cir., 159 F.2d 546.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We find further support in the discussion of the \u201crationale\u201d of May v. Heiner in the subsequent case of Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Estate of Church, 335 U.S. 632, 645-646, 69 S.Ct. 322, 337, 93 L.Ed. 288.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It is difficult to believe that Congress, in the 1932 statute, did not thoroughly eliminate that much-criticized rationale.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-14\">2. In the Nathan\u2019s Estate ease, the trust was created in 1941, after the issuance, in 1937<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and 1938 <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of Regulations which unmistakably interpreted the statute to cover a contingent life estate like that of the settlor\u2019s here, even if the settlor dies before the preceding life interest. However, here Marks, the settlor, created <em>the </em>trust <em>on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>December 21, 1935, when there was still outstanding an interpretative ruling, issued in 1934, which construed the 1932 statute as excluding such a contingent life estate.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Appellants contend that the settlor reasonably relied upon that 1934 interpretative ruling when he created the trust, and that therefore it would be unconstitutional to apply, retroactively, to this trust the interpretative Regulations promulgated subsequently in 1937 and 1938.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">The record is barren of evidence that the settlor actually did rely on the 1934 ruling. Even if we were to presume reliance, and even if we assumed that, where there has been reasonable reliance on a valid interpretative ruling, a retroactive change in the administrative interpretation violates due process, still we think there would be these sufficient answers to appellants\u2019 contention:</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">(a) The Seventh Circuit in Nathan\u2019s Estate held, we think correctly, that the statute is so clear that it needs no administrative interpretation, that such an interpretation is supererogatory.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It follows that the 1934 ruling lacked validity, since it contradicted the statute, and that therefore the settlor\u2019s reliance is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">(b) The facts here show an absence of reasonable reliance by the settlor on the 1934 ruling, even if it be considered valid. For, as already noted, previous to his death, which occurred November 22, 1939, two Regulations \u2014 one in 1937 and another in 1938 \u2014 superseded the 1934 ruling, and specifically interpreted the statute as covering a trust containing a contingent life estate of the kind he reserved. The settlor thus had ample warning, and had ample time, to divest himself of his contingent life interest<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> True, the trust seems to have been irrevocable. But, without revoking it, he could have released his interest. In the alternative, he could have given it to someone else; for, under the New York \u201claw,\u201d applicable to this trust, a future contingent interest in personal or real property is alienable. National Park Bank v. Billings, 144 App.Div. 536, 129 N.Y.S. 846, affirmed 203 N.Y. 556, 96 N.E. 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b934-8\">. Section 302(c) then provided that the gross estate should include property, \u201cTo the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b934-9\">. Section 803(a)\u2014carried into present \u00a7 811(c) (1) (B), 26 U.S.C.A.\u2014reads as follows : \u201cTo the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or .after his death, or of which he has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, under which he has retained for his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or for any period which does not in fact end before his death (1) the possession or enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, the property, or (2) the right, either alone or in conjunction with any person, to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom; except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth- * \u2756 * <em>\u00bb</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b935-6\">. See 1939-1 Cum.Bull. (Pt. 2) 490, 532. So far as pertinent, they read as follows: \u201cThe purpose of this amendment to section 302(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926 is to clarify in certain respects the amendments made to that section by the joint resolution of March 3, 1931, which were adopted to render taxable a transfer under which the decedent reserved the income for his life. The joint resolution was designed to avoid the effect of decisions of the Supreme Court holding such a transfer not taxable if irrevocable and not made in contemplation of death. Certain new matter has also been added, which is without retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">\u201cThe changes are: (1) The insertion of the words \u2018or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his dentil,\u2019 is to reach, for example, a transfer where decedent reserved to himself semiannual payments of the income of a trust which he had established, but with the provision that, no part of the trust income between the last semiannual payment to him and his death should be paid to him or his estate, or where he reserves the income, not necessarily for the remainder of Ms life, but for a period in the ascertainment of which the date of his death was a necessary element. (2) The insertion of the words \u2018or for any period which does not in fact end before his death,\u2019 which is to reach, for example, a transfer where decedent, 70 years old, reserves the income for an extended term of years and dies during the term, or where he is to have the income from and after the death of another person until his own death, and such other person predeceases him. This is a clarifying change and does not rejjresent new matter.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b935-16\">. See Bittker, The Church and Siegel Cases, 58 Yale L.J.

We stress the reasonableness of the literal meaning, for the situation might well be different if that meaning yielded unreasonable consequences. See, e. g., Holy Trinity Church v.

Appellants argue that the Seventh Circuit, in Nathan\u2019s Estate, did not consider the Committee Reports. We do not agree. For that decision was on an appeal from a decision of the Tax Court, 6 T.C. 601, which discussed Estate of Currie, 4 T.C. 1175; and, in the Currie case, the Tax Court quoted in full the pertinent part of those Reports. Moreover, the Seventh Circuit opinion in Nathan\u2019s Estate cites and discusses the Tax Court\u2019s opinion in the Currie case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b936-8\">. Although the Church case dealt with the phrase \u201cintended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death,\u201d we think the reasoning of the opinion serves to dispose of the elaborate argument of appellants in the instant case that the settlor, Marks, had not \u201cretained\u201d anything. See especially 335 U.S. at pages 645-646, 69 S.Ct. 322.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b936-9\">. The Conference Report on the Technical Changes Act of 1949, 63 Stat. 891, 20 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, states \u201c * * * the expression \u2018not ascertainable without reference to his death\u2019 as used in \u00a7 811 (c) (1) (B) * * * includes the right to receive the income from transferred property after the death of another person who in fact survived the transferor. * * * \u201d See Report of Conference Committee on H.R. 5628, p. 5, 81st Cong. 1st Sess. The government suggests that this statement \u201cspecifically affirms\u201d the rule of Nathan\u2019s Estate. Congressional views as to the meaning and intent of earlier legislation merit consideration according to circumstances, equally with other informed commentary commonly accepted as judicial aids in statutory interpretation, and may at times be highly persuasive. See Galvan v. Press, 74 S.Ct. 737; United States v. Stafoff, 260 U.S. 477, 480, 43 S.Ct. 197, 67 L.Ed. 358; First National Bank in St. Louis v.
