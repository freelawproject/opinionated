Taxpayer transferred that interest to the wife of one of his partners, receiving in payment thereof her cheek, equivalent to taxpayer\u2019s original capital contribution plus his share of accumulated unwith-drawn partnership profits, credited to his capital account. On the facts, hereinafter detailed, we are asked to decide if capital gains treatment should be accorded to the entire payment received by this taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-22\">Dismissal of plaintiff-taxpayer\u2019s complaint to recover $8,156.10 of taxes paid, on individual income, and deficiency interest for the calendar year 1945 precipitated this appeal of the lower court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>judgment. Taxpayer properly invoked the jurisdiction of the district court, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(a)(1), to claim a refund of income taxes which he asserts were erroneously collected under adjustments made by the Commissioner<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to his tax return for that calendar year. The Commissioner had proposed a deficiency assessment of $7,109.12. Though this taxpayer disagreed with a part of these adjustments, he paid that deficiency plus interest of $1,158.49, on December 6, 1948, in order to toll the running of interest. Taxpayer\u2019s subsequent claim for refund of $8,156.10 was rejected by the Commissioner, and this complaint followed. Sitting without a jury the district judge made findings of fact and conclusions of law resolving issues crys-talized by that complaint and the government\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Portions of the stipulated facts, pertinent to our opinion, follow. Taxpayer, an engineer, entered into a written partnership agreement, on December 1, 1943, with Joseph Doering and David C. Fee to operate a job machine shop business under the name of Brenner Manufacturing Company, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Capital contributions made by these three partners and their respective profit and loss sharing arrangements were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">Capital Share of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A37\">Contri-Profits or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACCd\">Partner bution Loss</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aib\">Plaintiff-Taxpayer ...... 25%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqsG\">Joseph Doering .......... 50%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"avs-dedup-0\">David C. Fee ............. ....... $ 5,500 25%</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Books of the partnership were kept and its income tax returns filed on an accrual and fiscal basis of accounting, ending June 30. Taxpayer filed his tax returns on a cash and calendar year basis. He received and reported, for calendar year 1944, his distributive share of Brenner\u2019s net profits for the period December 1, 1943 to June 30, 1944.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">A breakdown of the taxpayer\u2019s partnership interest as of February 28, 1945, reflected in his investment account, on Brenner\u2019s books, showed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-13\">Original Investment: $ 5,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AveO\">Profits: July 1, 1944 to February</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH1t\">28, 1945 .............................$24,531.92</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aaj-dedup-0\">Less: Withdrawal made January</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a2s-dedup-0\">14, 1945 ............................. 1,885.92 22,646</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APU\">Book Value: $28,146</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-19\">No balance sheet was shown taxpayer, he merely accepted the word of his partner, Joseph Doering that this was the book value. But the partnership books and records were open at all times to examination by this taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-20\">On February 28, 1945 this taxpayer told Doering and Fee that he desired to retire from their partnership, and offered to sell them his partnership interest for a sum equal to that book value. A controversy thereupon arose as to whether Doering or Fee would be the buyer of taxpayer\u2019s partnership interest, and thus delayed the sale. But this difficulty was surmounted by an agreement, dated April 13, 1945, between taxpayer and Florence K. Doering, wife of Joseph Doering, partner of Fee and this taxpayer. Both Fee and Joseph Doering consented to that instrument under the terms of which Mrs. Doering paid taxpayer $28,146 (the aforesaid book value) for \u201c * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>all his right, title and interest in the partnership * * * including any and all property of such partnership and the right to an accounting from all the partners thereof other than (taxpayer) * * *. \u201d This written agreement also contained a recital that the taxpayer \u201c * * * does hereby resign from any participation in the management of * * * \u201d the partnership. That agreement was made effective as of February 28, 1945 which was the date for which taxpayer\u2019s partnership interest had been valued. Expenses of $750 were incurred by the taxpayer in connection with his sale thus made pursuant to the agreement with Florence Doering.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">No partnership return was filed by Brenner for the period July 1, 1944 to February 28, 1945. But on September 15, 1945 a partnership income tax return for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1945, reporting ordinary net income of $145,426.19 was filed showing the following partnership net income to be distributable :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">Taxpayer ....................................$ 24,531.92</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aol-dedup-1\">Joseph Doering ............................. 73,129.75</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AR-\">David C.

Taxpayer reported, in his personal tax return for the calendar year 1945, as his distributive share of partnership net income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1945 only so much of partnership profits for that fiscal year as were actually distributed to him by the partnership prior to the time he sold his interest therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">However, in that same tax return, for 1945, taxpayer also reported $10,948 as a taxable long-time capital gain realized on the sale of his partnership interest in Brenner, which he detailed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-14\">Gross sales price: $28,146-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-15\">Dess :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-16\">Cost or other basis.................$5,500</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-17\">Expenses of sale.................... 750 6,250-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-18\">Total ................................... $21,896-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-19\">Long term capital gain \u2014 50%.................. $10,948-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-20\">As a result of auditing taxpayer\u2019s income tax return for the year 1945, the Commissioner increased taxpayer\u2019s distributed share of the net profits, of Brenner, for July 1, 1944 to February 28, 1945, from $24,531.92 (per Brenner\u2019s-books) to $24,882.22, and treated the $24,882.22 as ordinary income, taxable in full. For the purpose of determining-taxpayer\u2019s gain or loss on the sale of his partnership interest, there was included in his cost basis, his distributive share of unwithdrawn partnership earnings-for the period July 1, 1944 to February 28, 1945, <em>i. e.,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-21\">Cost of Partnership Interest:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-22\">Original investment .................... $ 5.500.00<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-23\">Profits for period July 1, 1944</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-24\">to February 28, 1945.........$24,882.22</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-25\"><em>Less </em>withdrawals ............. 1,885.92 22,996.30</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-26\">Cost ...................................... $28,496.30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-27\">Received from Sale:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-28\">Sale price ..................... $28,146.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-29\">Less expense of sale........... 740.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-30\">Net Receipts ................................. $27,396.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-31\">Loss on sale ................................. 1,100.30-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-32\">50% taken into account as long term capital loss ............................ 550.15-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-33\">Florence and Joseph Doering became equal partners in Brenner, after Florence Doering acquired David C. Fee\u2019s partnership interest, by purchase made subsequent to the year 1945. No amendment or discontinuance of the name Brenner Manufacturing Company was filed with the Register of Deeds of Milwaukee County, pursuant to section 343.722, Wisconsin Statutes, 1945. And no notice of the termination of the partnership, pursuant to the partnership agreement, was served upon taxpayer by either Fee, Joseph or Florence Doering.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-34\">Returns of partnership income for Brenner were duly filed with the Wisconsin Department of Taxation for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>fiscal years ended June 30, 1944, 1945, 1946 and 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We disagree with the district court\u2019s \u25a0conclusions of law, on these pleadings \u2022and stipulated facts, that the original partnership between taxpayer, Joseph Doering and David C. Fee was dissolved in 1945 when taxpayer retired from their firm and Mrs. Doering was admitted in his place. We also think that the trial .judge erroneously concluded that taxpayer\u2019s distributive share of Brenner\u2019s earnings from July 1, 1944 to February 28, 1945 was taxable as ordinary income.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">It was expressly found below, that after entering into the agreement with Florence Doering, taxpayer ceased to be associated with Joseph Doering and David C. Fee in carrying on Brenner\u2019s business; that he retained no ownership in the partnership nor its property \u25a0and he retained no right to participate in the future profits or management of that business.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">We are asked by the government to depart from our holding in Swiren v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 1950, 183 F.2d 656 because of a subsequent enunciation of policy in Watson v. Commissioner, 1953, 345 U.S. 544, 73 S.Ct. 848, 97 L.Ed. 1232. While on the other hand taxpayer would have us adhere to our theory announced in the Swiren case, supra, where we viewed a lawyer\u2019s sale of his interest in a partnership law firm as the sale of a capital asset despite the fact part of the purchase price paid him was for amounts due for personal services. In the Swiren case [183 F.2d 660] the retiring partner was paid, at the time of his withdrawal from the firm, a sum coinciding with the amount of fees uncollected at that time by his firm, plus his share in other assets of the partnership. We pointed out that \u201cuncollected fees for work in process not yet completed had not been transformed on the date of taxpayer\u2019s sale of his interest into gross income within the meaning of Sec. 183(b)(2), Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 183(b)(2).\u201d 183 F.2d 656, 660. Those fees were for personal services and we particularly observed that \u201cTaxpayer was on a cash receipts basis, as was the partnership.\u201d At the same time we there said: \u201c * * taxpayer\u2019s partnership interest as a whole was a capital asset within Sec. 117 of the Internal Revenue Code * * * .\u201d 183 F.2d 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">Watson v. Commissioner, 1953, 345 U.S. 544, 73 S.Ct. 848, was reviewed by the Supreme Court after Congress amended \u00a7 117(j) of the Internal Revenue Code.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To be sure, the taxpayer there, who owned an undivided interest in an orange grove, sold her interest midway in the 1944 growing season, including an unmatured crop then on the trees. She was engaged in the business of growing and selling oranges produced by that grove. The decision of the Ninth Circuit requiring that she treat that part of her profit from this sale which was attributable to the unmatured crop as ordinary income was affirmed. In rejecting taxpayer\u2019s contentions seeking capital gain treatment for the unharvested crop the Supreme Court stressed that the status of the unmatured crop as real property was a matter of federal law emphasized by the affirmative statement of Congress, cited above. Mr. Justice Burton, speaking for the Watson case majority pointed out, 345 U.S. 551-552, 73 S.Ct. 848, 853,</p>\n<p id=\"b329-16\">\u201cThe Commissioner\u2019s treatment of the proceeds of sales of unmatured crops as ordinary income in the absence of a statutory requirement to the contrary is consistent with the policy evidenced in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Williams v. McGowan, 2 Cir., 152 F.2d 570, 572, 162 A.L.R. 1036 * * *. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Clearly that Congressional amendment was the decision point of Watson v. Commissioner, supra, and the above-quoted mention of Williams v. McGowan is not persuasive on the facts in this present appeal for reasons which are hereafter discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\"> We can put to one side as well settled the proposition that a partnership interest is a capital <em>asset</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and when sold warrants treatment as does that class of assets. In the instant appeal taxpayer\u2019s partnership was on an accrual basis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When he sold to Florence Doering, as of February 28, 1945, his capital account had been credited with $24,-531.92 which represented his share of the partnership profits earned and accrued for the period July 1, 1944, to February 28, 1945. This record is devoid of evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>dence demonstrating that any part of the $24,531.92 embodied taxpayer\u2019s share of earnings for past services.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Of course, if prior to selling his partnership interest this taxpayer had eventually drawn out portions of the $24,531.92 such amounts would have been taxable as ordinary income. We think that this record fails in establishing, to our satisfaction, that taxpayer\u2019s sale to Florence Doering was merely a mechanism for this taxpayer to receive earnings resulting from prior activities at capital gain rates. We are also aware that with Brenner operating on a fiscal year, as its annual accounting period, and this taxpayer on a calendar year basis of reporting, taxes on such profits would be postponed until a succeeding taxable year.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">By reducing the foregoing facts to their essential terms we think our decision pivots on whether taxpayer simply received a return of his original capital investment, $5,500 plus an advance withdrawal of his share of partnership earnings or whether he actually sold a capital asset in which was bundled up his original investment, profits, rights to future participation in profits and interests in the partnership assets. It must be remembered that under his agreement with Florence Doering this taxpayer sold \u201c * * * all his right, title and interest in the partnership * * \u201d That the selling price neatly coincides with the figures posted in taxpayer\u2019s capital account, on the partnership books, is beside the mark. He simply sold his interest in the partnership for its book value.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">We think the appeal pending before us is distinguishable, factually,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> from Williams v. McGowan, 2 Cir., 1945, 152 F.2d 570 and particularly because Judge Learned Hand directed attention to the basic aspect of that case by saying: \u201cWhen Williams bought out Reynolds\u2019 interest, he became the sole owner of the business, <em>the firm, had ended upon any theory, </em>and the situation for tax purposes was no other than if Reynolds had never been a partner at all, except that to the extent of one-third of the \u2018amount realized\u2019 on Williams\u2019 sale to the Corning Company, his \u2018basis\u2019 was different. * * We have to decide only whether upon the sale of a going business it is to be com-minuted into its fragments, and these are to be separately matched against the definition in \u00a7 117(a)(1), or whether the whole business is to be treated as if it were a single piece of property.\u201d 152 F.2d 572; italics supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-15\">But it clearly appears on the record we are now reviewing, that there was actually a sale of taxpayer\u2019s total and aggregate interest; that he withdrew from the partnership and Brenner Manufacturing Company actually continued business after this taxpayer\u2019s severance. Moreover the agreement between tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>payer and Florence Doering contains no specific allocation of the total selling price to any particular component part of the partnership interests sold and we cannot, under such facts, undertake to reduce $28,146.00 into matching fragments.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">The government has urged that this taxpayer has \u201crealized\u201d partnership profits for the July to February period in question. And it might also be argued that as to this taxpayer, he had a right to his distributive share of the partnership profits when they were accrued. But we find he sold out his entire partnership interest, quit the firm, and disposed of a capital asset. He was entitled to the long term capital gain treatment as sought in the complaint filed below. Our disposition of this appeal precludes any need to discuss, or dispose of, the constitutional question raised by taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The judgment of the District Court must be vacated and the cause remanded to that court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Judgment of the District Court is vacated and this cause remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\">.

While Bureau rulings do not reach the same status as Treasury Department Regulations we think Rev.Rul. <em>144, 16 </em>R.B. 1953-29, 30 deserves mention as indicating administrative reaction to the situation at hand:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u201cAdvice is requested respecting the effect on a partnership, for Federal income tax purposes, of the death, withdrawal, substitution or addition of a partner. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">G.G.M. 26379, O.B. 1950-1, 58, holds that a sale of a partnership interest under certain circumstances is treated as a sale of a capital asset, distinct from the partner\u2019s interest in the partnership assets, and thereby recognizes that for tax purposes a partnership may continue beyond changes in membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Accordingly, it is held that a change in the membership of a partnership resulting from the death, withdrawal, substitution, or addition of a partner, or a shift of interest among existing partners does not, in itself, effect a termination of a partnership for Federal income tax purposes. Ordinarily, a partnership will be treated as continuing where the business of the partnership, or a substantial portion thereof, is continued. The returns of a continuing partnership should continue to be filed on the basis of the annual accounting period previously established by the partnership. A partnership\u2019s basis in its assets is distinct from the partners\u2019 bases in their partnership interests, and is not affected by changes in such partnership interests. The bases of the interests of the partners in the partnership interests are increased by the amount paid for a retiring partner\u2019s interest, and in the event of the death of a partner the basis of his partnership interest to his estate is the fair market value of such interest at the date of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">In view of the foregoing, O.D. 228, C.B. 1, 190 (1919) is hereby revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">It is not intended herein to state that a partnership is invariably to be treated as a unit intervening between a partner and partnership transactions and income for Federal tax purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">Of <em>course </em>the current position of the Internal Revenue service is reflected in G.C.M. 26379, 1950\u20141 Cum.Bull. 58, 59 where Chief Counsel states, inter alia:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-14\">\u201cIt is accordingly the opinion of this office that the sale of a partnership interest should be treated as the sale of a capital asset under the provisions of \u00a7 117 of the Internal Revenue Code.

On September 17th of the same year, Williams sold the business as a whole to the Corning Building Company for $63,926.28 \u2014 its agreed value as of February 1, 1940 \u2014 \u2018plus an amount to be computed by multiplying the gross sales of the business from the first day of February, 1940 to the 28th day of September, 1940,\u2019 by an agreed fraction. This value was made up of cash of about $8100, receivables of about $7000, fixtures of about $800, and a merchandise inventory of about $49,000, less some $1000 for bills payable. To this was added about $6,000 credited to Williams for profits under the language just quoted, making a total of nearly $70,000.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
