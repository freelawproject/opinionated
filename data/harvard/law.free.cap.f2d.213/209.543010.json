Incidentally presented are the usual and routine factual issues as to whether the Board\u2019s findings of unlawful interrogation and threats against the employees for their union activity, and respondent\u2019s discriminatory demo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tion of one employee and discharge of another for union affiliation, in further violation of Sections 8(a) (1) and (3) of the Act, are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(a) (1) and (3). The decision and order of the Board are reported at 106 N.L.R.B. 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Respondent, an Alabama corporation, at times here material was engaged in the manufacture and sale of cotton yarn at its Talladega, Alabama plant. When operating at capacity, the plant employed approximately 157 workers, and maintained twisting and spinning departments in three eight hour shifts under the supervision of Marion Shiflett. Another one of respondent\u2019s supervisors, Seybourn Pilkington, was responsible for operations in the plant\u2019s carting room. Respondent\u2019s president, Robert McMillan, and its superintendent, Hunter Murphy, had charge of the overall supervision of manufacturing operations. ^</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">In early 1949, as a result of time studies made of the various steps involved in its manufacturing operations, respondent made numerous changes in the working conditions and duties of its employees, imposing upon certain employees increased tasks which they regarded as burdensome. This circumstance, together with lay-offs of both the second and third shifts at respondent\u2019s plant and a general wage cut affecting all employees, caused considerable unrest and dissatisfaction among respondent\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Respondent first discovered the union\u2019s organizational efforts within its plant when, in early June, 1949, one of its employees, Haywood, reported having observed another employee, Chester Magouyrk, in consultation with a union organizer at Magouyrk\u2019s home. Superintendent Murphy, when informed of this fact, immediately held a meeting of certain supervisory and non-supervisory employees of respondent, at which he warned them of the presence of the union representative and directed them to forestall any attempt to organize the employees pending his discussion of the matter with President McMillan. At a subsequent meeting, Superintendent Murphy told the same employees, \u201cto go in the mill and talk to all the help and get them out of the union \u2014 that they wasn\u2019t going to have no union down at the mill.\u201d President McMillan later addressed the same employees in a similar vein, informing a number of them that, as supervisory employees, respondent was relying upon them \u201cto get out there and stop\u201d the union. After interrogating Marion Shiflett as to the number of employees who had already joined the union, McMillan directed the group generally to tell the employees \u201cthey would make more money by not joining.\u201d According to the credited testimony, McMillan\u2019s parting comment upon that occasion was that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t going to be any union there\u2014 that he wouldn\u2019t run under a union contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">The supervisory employees, Shiflett and Pilkington, though personally anxious to remain neutral, nevertheless attempted to comply with McMillan\u2019s and Murphy\u2019s instructions. On two occasions, acting at the request of Superintendent Murphy, they questioned a number of employees as to their attendance at union meetings and took notes of the information received for respondent\u2019s benefit. Shiflett was found to have questioned employees as to their membership in the union, and Pilkington to have asked an employee how he intended to vote in the election and to have warned another employee that some workers would be discharged for their union activities. A number of other supervisory employees of respondent were also found to have engaged in questioning the employees regarding their union activities and as to how they intended to vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">President McMillan participated personally in the anti-union campaign. He threatened to close the plant if it were unionized, and that house rents in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\u201cvillage\u201d, respondent\u2019s employee housing project, would be raised and the employees\u2019 bonus abandoned upon the advent of the union. Though engaging in other specific acts of employee interrogation, McMillan apparently singled out for particular treatment the employee, Chester Magouyrk, of whose leadership in- the union\u2019s organizational efforts<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> respondent had been fully aware since Haywood\u2019s surveillance of Magouyrk in consultation with the union organizer. In July, 1949, McMillan ordered Shiflett to remove Magouyrk from his doffing job, which paid approximately $1.00 per hour, and demote him to the job of roving, which paid only <em>15f, </em>per hour, and was the lowest paid job in the mill. Shortly thereafter, McMillan called Magouyrk to his office and accused him of being paid by the union to organize the mill, and asked whether he realized he \u201chad caused women and children to suffer \u2014 probably caused somebody to be killed because of the union.\u201d A few days later McMillan again called Ma-gouyrk to his office and ordered him, as head of the union, to remove some union leaflets which had been posted on the plant bulletin board. Shortly after this instance, he also forced Magouyrk to pick up and dispose of other union leaflets scattered in the spinning room, telling him, \u201cYou are going to cause this mill to shut, down.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">With reference to the alleged discriminatory discharges of the two supervisors, Shiflett. and Pilkington,. the credited testimony further reveals that in July, 1949, McMillan told Shiflett that Shiflett\u2019s son, Harold, had joined the union, and that \u201cHe (McMillan) didn\u2019t want him in the union.\u201d Superintendent Murphy asked Shiflett to do something about Harold\u2019s union membership, and when Shiflett protested there was nothing he could do, Murphy replied, \u201cIf he belonged to me I could do something * * * I would run him off from home to get him out of the union.\u201d About a- week before the Board conducted election on August 25, 1949, McMillan personally interviewed Shiflett in his office and told him that unless he got the employees out of the union, \u201cHe (McMillan) was going to get him another overseer.\u201d Murphy also told Shif-lett that he would be held accountable for the attitude of respondent\u2019s employees and that, if the. union won the election, he would be fired. About two days before the union election, McMillan told Shiflett that another one of his sons, Edwin, had been observed keeping company with the union representative and asked Shiflett what he intended to do about it, to which Shiflett replied that his sons were grown men and they could do as they pleased. McMillan then warned that unionization would cause Shiflett to lose his job and his home, and his son Harold to lose both his job and a Studebaker automobile he was then purchasing. Pilkington received much the same treatment during the union\u2019s organizational campaign as was accorded Shiflett. He had attended the meetings held by Murphy and McMillan in which the supervisors were warned to \u201cbreak the union up\u201d, had repeatedly questioned the employees as to their union activities at respondent's behest, and had made periodic reports as to the effectiveness of the anti-union campaign to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Despite the efforts of respondent\u2019s supervisory employees, including Shif-lett and Pilkington, the union prevailed in the election. Shortly thereafter, respondent carried out its pre-election threat by promptly firing Shiflett, with the observation that he already knew the reason for his discharge. Pilking-ton was discharged the following morning for the asserted reason, as stated by Murphy, that he \u201cjust didn\u2019t try hard enough\u201d to keep the union out of the plant. Edwin Shiflett was also discharged on October 4, 1949, ostensibly for tangling yarn on the bobbins, but ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>tually, as the Trial Examiner and Board found, because of his union activities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This employee had joined the union in August, 1949, and thereafter actively participated in the union\u2019s organizational campaign. As heretofore noted, Murphy and McMillan had openly evidenced their resentment of his union membership, and had tried unsuccessfully to force him to renounce the union through pressure on his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Relying mainly on the above testimony, the Board found that respondent engaged in unlawful interrogation and threats against its employees for their union activity, in violation of Section 8(a)(1) of the Act; that it further violated Section 8(a)(3) and (1) of the Act by discriminatorily demoting Chester Magouyrk and discharging Edwin Shiflett because of their union activities; and, finally, that the discharge of Supervisors Shiflett and Pilkington, because of their failure to wage a sufficiently effective pre-election anti-union campaign, constituted unlawful interference, restraint, and coercion of respondent\u2019s non-supervisory employees, in violation of Section 8(a)(1) of the Act. Both the Trial Examiner and the Board rejected respondent\u2019s factual contention that Shiflett and Pilkington were discharged for justifiable cause under the Act because of their pro-union activities, and found instead that their discharges actually resulted from their failure to prevent the unionization of respondent\u2019s non-supervisory employees. However, though the Trial Examiner and Board were in agreement as to the underlying cause of their discharge, they reached divergent views as to whether, under the circumstances, their discharge was violative of the Act, so as to justify their reinstatement and back pay award.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Respondent again urges here, as it\u2019 did before the Trial Examiner and Board, its jurisdictional contention that- the allegations concerning the discharges of Shiflett and Pilkington were barred by the limitation provision of Section 10 (b) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(b), which section requires that a charge, in order to support a finding of violation, be filed within six months of the date on which the alleged unfair labor practice was committed. It is argued that the alleged violation with respect to th\u00e9 discharge-' of these\u2019 two supervisors was not \u2018properly co\u2019gniz\u00e1ble by the Board in is-suing its complaint under the above 'limitation provision, since this alleged violation was not specifically set forth fintil- the fourth amended charge was filed on September 12, 1950, over a year after the discharges were effected on -August 25th and 26th, 1949. The Trial -Examiner and the Board, relying upon the broad allegations of violation of Section 8(a)(1) of the Act contained in the original and first amended charges,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>both of which were timely filed under Section 10(b), held them sufficient for jurisdictional purposes to embrace and include the additional 8(a)(1) violation as to the two discharged supervisors, as alleged in the Board\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">On this jurisdictional issue, respondent concedes in brief that \u201cthe Board may issue a complaint based upon amendments to charges * * * so long as the additional charges * * are similar in nature and origin to the violations alleged in the original charge.\u201d See Kansas Mill. Co. v. N. L. R. B. 10 Cir., 185 F.2d 413, 415; N. L. R. B. v. Brown &amp; Root, Inc., 8 Cir., 203 F.2d 139, 146. Indeed, this Court has held that the Board may properly allege in its complaint violations not particularized in the charge, even though the charge antedates the unfair labor practice. See N. L. R. B. v. Westex Boot &amp; Shoe Co., 5 Cir., 190 F.2d 12, 13; Stokely Foods v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir., 193 F.2d 736, 737-738; N. L. R. B. v. United States Gypsum Co., 5 Cir., 206 F.2d 410, 411-412. However, in the light of the language used in the charges and the theory of violations contained therein, respondent insists that the above rule is not here applicable to sustain the Board\u2019s jurisdiction and order in this regard, but urges as here controlling the principle that an amended charge will not be held to relate back to the date of the original charge for jurisdictional purposes where it attempts to set forth a new cause of action. See N. L. R. B. v. I. B. S. Mfg. Co., 5 Cir., 210 F.2d 634, 637; N. L. R. B. v. Vare, 3 Cir., 206 F.2d 543, 546; Joanna Cotton Mills v. N. L. R. B. 4 Cir., 176 F.2d 749, 754. We think that the rule of the I. B. S. Mfg. Co. case, supra, prohibiting an untimely charge from invoking the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over \u201can entirely new and different cause of action\u201d, is not applicable or controlling in respondent\u2019s favor here, for it seems to us that the theory of indirect interference and restraint involved in the discharge of the two supervisors, as first set forth in the fourth amended charge, is fairly embraced within the general allegation of direct interference and restraint of the same employees contained in the original and first amended charges. See N. L. R. B. v. Westex Boot &amp; Shoe Co., supra. Unlike the situation presented in the I. B. S. Mfg. Co. case, supra, where an alleged violation of the 8(a) (5) refusal to bargain provision was held to constitute a departure from the timely charged 8(a)(1) and (3) violations, the disputed charges here are based upon the same section of the Act, and were brought in both instances on substantially the same theory and for the same purpose, i. e., to preserve and protect the right of respondent\u2019s employees under Section 8(a)(1) to engage in concerted activities, free from respondent\u2019s interference and restraint. Under such circumstances, we conclude that the allegations in the complaint with respect to the discharge of the supervisors do not constitute such a departure from the cause of action alleged in the original and first amended charges as would invalidate the Board\u2019s jurisdiction and order.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">On the merits of this issue, respondent first insists that the substantial and credible record evidence compels a finding that the two supervisors were justifiably discharged for their pro-union activities, rather than for their failure effectively to coerce respondent\u2019s employees into renouncing the union. In an attempt to upset this adverse finding of fact by both the Trial Examiner and Board, respondent attacks as inconsistent the Board\u2019s findings in the representation proceeding as to the pro-union sympathies of these same two supervisors,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> with its findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>in tliis unfair labor practice proceeding of their anti-union activities at respondent\u2019s behest. Respondent ingenuously suggests, b\u00f3'th \u2022 in brief and upon the oral argument, that the Board, though impliedly recognizing in its prior finding respondent\u2019s lawful right to discharge these supervisors for their con-cededly unprotected pro-union activity, has nevertheless unfairly - penalized respondent in this proceeding for exercising that right. However, we think that the Trial Examiner and Board properly rejected this alleged inconsistency as unsupported by the record.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Relying mainly upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Republic Steel Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 311 U.S. 7, 61 S.Ct. 77, 85 L.Ed. 6, respondent next insists that, in ordering reinstatement and back pay in favor of these two supervisors, the Board has unlawfully exceeded its statutory discretion and authority because its order is penal ;rather than remedial in nature, and for the additional reason that reinstatement of supervisors, as such, is prohibited by express language of the amended act exempting them from the statutory definition of \u201cemployee\u201d. See 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 152(3), 164(a) and 160(c). The discretionary basis for the Board\u2019s order, as set forth in that section of its decision entitled \u201cThe Remedy\u201d, reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">\u201cWe have found that the Respondent discharged Marion K. Shiflett and Seybourn Pilkington and thereby, in violation of Section 8(a)(1) of the Act, interfered with, restrained, and coerced its non-supervisory employees in the exercise of their rights guaranteed under Section 7 of the Act. In order to restore to the non-supervisory employees their full freedom to exercise these- rights' and thus to effectuat\u00e9 the policies of the\"Act, we find it-necessary to provide for the reinstatement with back pay of Marion K. Shiflett and Seybourn Pilkington. Accordingly, we shall order the Respondent to offer Marion K. Shiflett and Pilkington full and immediate reinstatement to-their former or substantially equivalent positions, without prej'udice to-their seniority or other rights and privileges, and to make them whole for any loss of pay they may have-suffered by reason of their discharge * * *. \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">Under the facts' and circumstances-, of this case, we construe the Board\u2019s; order as remedial rather than penal,, within the rationale of Phelps Dodge Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 313 U.S. 177, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L.Ed. 1271, and Republic Steel Corp. v. N. L. R. B. supra, and as a lawful exercise of the Board\u2019s statutory discretion under Section 10(c) to \u201ceffectuate the policies\u201d of this Act. See 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(c); Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. N. L. R. B., 319 U.S. 533, 543, 63 S.Ct. 1214, 87 L.Ed. 1568; National Licorice Co. v. N. L. R. B., 309 U.S. 350, 365, 60 S.Ct. 569, 84 L.Ed. 799; N. L. R. B. v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, 303 U.S. 261, 265, 58 S.Ct. 571, 82 L.Ed. 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Prior to enactment of the Taft-Hart-ley Act in 1947, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 141 et seq., the discharge of a supervisory employee for refusing whole-heartedly to engage in unfair labor practices on behalf of an employer was recognized in this Circuit and elsewhere as unlawful interference and restraint of the statutory rights of ordinary employees, as protected under Section 8(1) of the Act. See N. L. R. B. v. Richter\u2019s Bakery, 5 Cir., 140 F.2d 870, 871, 872; N. L. R. B. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>v. Vail Mfg. Co., 7 Cir., 158 F.2d 664, 666-667; Eagle-Picher Mining <em>&amp; </em>Smelting Co. v. N. L. R. B., 8 Cir., 119 F.2d 903, 911, 913. The amended Act made no material change in Section 7 or in Section 8(1) of the old Act, though the statutory definition of \u201cemployee\u201d under Section 2(3) was revised to exclude \u201cany individual employed, as a supervisor.\u201d Under this revised section, supervisors may be discharged for union activities, and employers are under no obligation to bargain collectively with them. However, the amended Act did not diminish the protection previously accorded ordinary employees under Section 8(a)(1),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> nor do we construe the amendment excluding supervisors from the term \u201cemployee\u201d as prohibiting the Board from ordering their reinstatement and back pay under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">In the Phelps Dodge case, supra, 313 U.S. at page 191, 61 S.Ct. 845, in considering the proper relation of the Board\u2019s remedial powers under Section 10(c) to the old statutory definition of \u201cemployee\u201d under Section 2(3), the Supreme Court held that the Board\u2019s remedial powers are not expressly limited and restricted under the statutory provision authorizing reinstatement and back pay. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160 (c). Under that decision, it seems to us that the Board still has discretion under the amended Act to dissipate the effects of an unfair labor practice and restore the status quo by directing reinstatement of supervisors and foremen, even though they are not \u201cstatutory employees\u201d, where it has been found, as here, that their discharge interferes with, restrains and coerces the rights of ordinary employees in violation of Section 8(a)(1) of the Act. See also, Virginia Electric &amp; Power Co. v. N. L. R. B., supra. Though the Board concededly has no authority, statutory or otherwise, to reinstate supervisors as \u201cemployees\u201d to redress their private grievance and penalize respondent, we see no reason why the Board, in the exercise of its statutory discretion, does not have the same remedial power to redress acts of indirect interference and restraint of ordinary employees through discharge of supervisors, as it admittedly has to redress acts of direct interference and restraint with the rights of the same employees to uninhibited self-organization. The contention that the discharge of supervisors for refusal to violate the Act may be effected with impunity because of their supervisory status evinces undue preoccupation with the statutory definition, rather than with the underlying purpose and intent of the Act as a whole. We conclude, therefore, that the discharge of Supervisors Shiflett and Pilkington for their failure to prevent unionization of respondent\u2019s plant by means of unfair labor practices at respondent\u2019s behest, was violative of Section 8(a)(1) of the Act, and that the Board properly ordered them reinstated with back pay. See Eastern Coal Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 4 Cir., 176 F.2d 131, 136-137; N. L. R. B. v. Universal Camera Corp., 2 Cir., 179 F.2d 749, 755, reversed on other grounds, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456; N. L. R. B. v. Richter\u2019s Bakery, supra; Eagle-Picher Mining &amp; Smelting Co. v. N. L. R. B., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">We consider it premature on the basis of the present record to consider the effect of respondent\u2019s assertion in brief that the Board\u2019s reinstatement and back pay order can have only punitive, rather than remedial effect, because respondent is no longer engaged '' business. Neither the Trial Exam,ner nor the Board have made any finding that respondent has permanently ceased its manufacturing operations, nor does it appear that they have even considered the materiality of any such proof as affecting the proposed remedy. We assume that respondent is not hereby foreclosed from offering further proof be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\u2022fore'the Board that its permanent cessation of operation renders the reinstatement provision of the Board\u2019s order impossible of compliance. See N. L. R. B. v. Vail Mfg. Co., supra, 158 F.2d at page 667.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Pretermitting further discussion of the purely factual issues involved, we conclude that the findings of both the Trial Examiner and the Board of respondent\u2019s unlawful interference and restraint of its employees through interrogation and threats, as well as its discriminatory ' demotion of Chester Magouyrk and discharge of Edwin Shiflett for union activities, in violation of Section 8(a)(1) and (3) of the Act, are clearly supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456; N. L. R. B. v. Calcasieu Paper Co., 5 Cir., 203 F.2d 12; N. L. R. B. v. Jamestown Sterling Corporation, 2 Cir., 211 F.2d 725; cf. N. L. R. B. v. Southeastern Pipe Line Co., 5 Cir., 210 F.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The order of the Board is hereby enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b258-18\">. The Union here involved is Textile Workers Union of America, C.I.O.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-5\">. Chester Magouyrk had obtained signatures of 75 of respondent\u2019s employees to applications for union membership, and his home in the \u201cvillage\u201d had served more or less as a meeting place for union activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b261-5\">. Tlie Trial Examiner further found that Supervisor Sliiflett\u2019s son, Harold Shiflett, was discriminatorily discharged for union activity, but the Board rejected this inference of respondent\u2019s discriminatory motivation as unsupported by the record, and dismissed the charges in this respect. Petitioner does not here seek review of that finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b261-6\">. The Trial Examiner, in recommending that the allegations as to the discriminatory discharges of Supervisors Shiflett and Pilkington be dismissed, concluded in part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u201cThe undersigned knows of no case in the Board\u2019s history that parallels tlie factual situation found here. Here we have two supervisory employees who carried out the Respondent\u2019s instructions to \u2018keep the boys out of the Union,\u2019 and then when they were discharged because they failed to satisfy the Respondent in this regard, a charge is filed in their behalf with the Board on the theory that their discharges interfered with, restrained, and coerced the non-supervisory employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed them in Section 7 of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 157. Putting it another way it amounts to this; on the one hand their acts of interference, restraint, and coercion are chargeable to the Respondent as violations of Section 8(a) (1), and rightly so, on tlie other hand their discharge for not working \u2018hard enough\u2019 to satisfy the employer in their efforts to thwart the Union is likewise violative of the same section of the Act. As far as tlie undersigned has been able to ascertain from Board Decisions and Orders, tlie Board has consistently refused to go into what \u2018actual\u2019 effect violations of Section 8(a) (1) have on the employees who have been victims of such conduct. Eor example, the Board \u2018infers\u2019 that interrogation of employees about their union affairs is per se violative of the Act, it does not go into the question as to whether or not it in fact had such an effect. This is as it should be not only for practical purposes, but as an effective way of administering the Act and to promulgate its policies. Who can say how much impact the discharges had on the non-supervisory employees, in the face of 3 months of activity on the part of the same supervisors on behalf of the Respondent in its campaign against the Union? The undersigned cannot answer this question nor will he attempt to do so. Would it not be just as reasonable to infer, upon the facts found herein, that if the two overseers were reinstated that they would be more vigorous in their anti-union activity than they had been before their discharge? Then how could their reinstatement with back pay effectuate the policies of the Act? Suffice it to say however that upon the facts found hereinabove, the undersigned is convinced and he so finds that the Respondent did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>not violate Section 8(a) (1) of the Act by discharging Overseers Marion K. Shiflett and Seybourn Pilkington. Consequently he recommends that this allegation in the complaint be dismissed in its entirety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">The Board, however, rejected the Trial Examiner\u2019s conclusion in the following language:</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u2018 \u201cIt is clear froim the foregoing, as the Trial Examiner found, that the Respondent was motivated in discharging Shiflett and Pilkington- by their failure; to prevent the Union from becoming the bargaining representative- of its employees. Unlike the Trial Examiner, however, we find that- these discharges interfered with, .restrained, and coerced rank and file employees in the exercise of their self-or.-ganizational rights guaranteed; in Section 7 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u201cIt cannot be seriously argued that the discharges were intended to maintain the Respondent\u2019s neutrality. The Respondent\u2019s opposition to the Union, which was too well known to the rank and file employees, would belie such an assertion. Indeed, not only did Shiflett and Pilking-ton, though half-heartedly and under continuous pressure from the Respondent\u2019s officials, engage on the Respondent\u2019s behalf in conduct prohibited by the Act, but the Respondent\u2019s officials themselves and other supervisors also engaged in unfair labor practices. Moreover, the record discloses that non-supervisory employees were aware that Shiflett and Pilkington were acting\" under instructions from the Respondent to defeat the Union\u2019s organizing -, campaign. Thus; non-supervisory employees were . present at meetings, when the Respondent directed Shiflett and Pilkington to get (the employees out of the Union, when Pilking-ton protested against .Superintendent Murphy\u2019s orders to supervisors to \u2018break the Union up,\u2019 and when Murphy instruct-: ed Shiflett to secure his sons\u2019 withdrawal from the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">\u201cIn these circumstances, where, as here, the .discharges followed immediately on tli,e heels of the Union\u2019s victory in the Board-conducted election, the discharges \u00a1plainly demonstrated to rank and file employees that this action was part of its plan to thwart their self-organizational activities and evidenced a fixed determination not to be frustrated in its efforts by any half-hearted or perfunctory obedience from its supervisors. In our opinion, the net effect of this conduct was Jto cause non-supervisory employees reasonably to fear that the Respondent would take similar action against them if they continued to support the Union. For .this reason, we find that the discharges violated Section 8(a) (1) of the Act.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b262-9\">. The Trial Examiner held that respondent was placed on notice generally as to all of its Section 8(a) (1) violations by the allegation in the original charge that it \u201chas engaged in and is engaging in unfair labor practices within the meaning of Section 8(a), subsections (1) and (3)\u201d of the Act. The Board noted further language in the original charge stating \u25a0that \u201cBy these acts, and by other acts and conduct, within the past six months, the employer * * * has interfered with, restrained, and coerced its employees in the exercise of their-rights as guaranteed in Section 7 of - the Act.\u201d Further observing that the first amended charge, \u201cLike the original charge, * * * contained a broad allegation of interference with, restraint, and coercion of employees in violation of Section 8 (a) (1)\u201d, the Board held that \u201cas the discharge of Shiflett and. Pilkington occurred within 6 months, of the -filing and service of the (first) amended charge, and especially as the allegations of the complaint in question are .merely an enlargement of the broad 8(a) (1) allegation of the (first) amended charge, we find \u2019 that the discharges were properly alleged in the complaint.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b263-7\">.

The Trial Examiner agreed with the finding of the Regional Director in his report te the effect that the pro-union statements of the two supervisors were \u201cmild in comparison with the systematic interrogation of the employees which they performed at the direction of the employer.\u201d The Board further found \u201cthat the question of the respondent\u2019s motivation in discharging Shiflett and Pilking-ton was plainly neither litigated nor in issue in the representation case involving objections to the election.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b265-5\">.
