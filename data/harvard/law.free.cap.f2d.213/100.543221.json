United States of America, 213 F.2d 96, is sufficient to dispose of appellant\u2019s attacks upon the validity of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3294, and upon the sufficiency of the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-21\">As to the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction, it was stipulated that the defendant had not paid the tax imposed by 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3290. When the Constable went to execute the search warrant on the defendant\u2019s home, no one would answer the door, and on breaking in, the Constable found defendant and his wife stuffing \u201cCuba or bolita tickets\u201d into a stove. Other paraphernalia used in the game, including pads, money, money wrappers, and an adding machine were found in the search. The telephone was ringing continuously, and on being answered, Cuba numbers were being called in. The defendant made no response to his wife\u2019s accusation, \u201cI told you you had better quit; I told you you had better quit.\u201d' There was no dearth of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-22\">The Court charged the jury that \u201cProof of an actual sale of numbers by the defendant is not necessary to prove that the defendant was engaged' in the occupation of accepting wagers * * \u201d, and to this charge the defendant objected. His counsel now properly concedes that it \u201cmay well be a correct legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>proposition in so far as it goes as a general rule\u201d, but insists that, while the Court instructed the jury as to what <em>wasn\u2019t </em>necessary for conviction, it failed to instruct them as to what <em>was </em>necessary. A reading of the Court\u2019s charge convinces us that it was not fairly subject to such criticism, but carefully preserved all of the rights of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
