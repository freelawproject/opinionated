Watson and the appellant, Charles Reynolds, with violating the narcotics statutes. A seventh count charged Reynolds alone with purchasing, selling, dispensing and distributing certain capsules containing a mixtur\u00e9 of morphine sulphate, not in or from the original stamped package.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">When the case was called for trial October 19,1953, Watson withdrew his plea of not guilty and pleaded guilty to Counts 1 and 6. Although no disposition had been made of tha other four counts against Watson, the trial proceeded against Reynolds alone, who was found guilty under all seven counts.. He was fined and sentenced to imprisonment for from three to ten years on each count, the sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">On this appeal Reynolds alleges error in the trial judge\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that it might infer from the government\u2019s failure to introduce Watson as a witness that his testimony would have been unfavorable to the prosecution. He asserts Watson was available to the government but could not be called by him because he was a co-indictee. This assignment of error, which relates only to the first six counts in which Watson and Reynolds were both charged, need not <em>be </em>considered. Reynolds\u2019 conviction under the seventh count, in which he alone was accused, \u2014 with respect' to which we find no error \u2014 is sufficient to support the sentence imposed upon him.
