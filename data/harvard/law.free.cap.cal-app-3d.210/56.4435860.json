(Statutory references are to this code unless otherwise noted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">Represented by its district attorney, the County of San Joaquin (County) brought this action to determine paternity of, and to obtain support for, minor A. L. W. in 1981. Defendant Robin Woods admitted paternity and during the next several years the trial court entered orders requiring defendant to pay support and providing for his visitation with the minor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>In 1985 defendant and the minor\u2019s mother agreed to a stipulated order specifying the times and places of defendant\u2019s visitation with the minor. Thereafter defendant filed numerous show-cause proceedings alleging the mother was in contempt because she refused to permit the visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">In August 1987 the trial court granted County\u2019s motion to strike the visitation language from the stipulated order on the ground the issues in this child support enforcement action were limited to paternity and support, and the issue of visitation could not be joined. The trial court stated that defendant must litigate the visitation issue in a separate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Defendant appeals from this order. In unpublished portions of this opinion we reject defendant\u2019s contentions (a) the trial court could not remedy the illegality of the 1985 visitation order because County had failed to appeal an earlier visitation order assertedly entered in 1982, and (b) the district attorney acted improperly in moving to strike the visitation order. In this published portion, we conclude the trial court lacked statutory jurisdiction to adjudicate the visitation dispute. We shall affirm the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\n<em>It Is Immaterial That County Did Not Appeal From the 1982 Visitation Order. </em>\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">\n<em>The Trial Court Properly Concluded Visitation Could Not Be Litigated in This Child Support Action Brought by a County Through Its District Attorney.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">Defendant contends sections 11350.1 and 11475.1 pose no jurisdictional bar to the adjudication of vistitation rights in this case. Defendant contends it was appropriate for the district attorney to have litigated the visitation issue in this support obligation enforcement action. Defendant makes no claim that the Legislature could not limit the issues to be determined in this wholly statutory action. (See <em>Abelleira </em>v. <em>District Court of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 288-289 [109 P.2d 942, 132 A.L.R. 715]; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Omnibus R. R. Co. </em>(1867) 33 Cal. 212, 216-217.) Rather he argues as a matter of statutory interpretation that the cited statutes do not prohibit the trial court from adjudicating visitation disputes. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">As County\u2019s complaint alleges, County brought this action at the mother\u2019s request pursuant to section 11475.1 which provides in part that, \u201cThe district attorney shall take appropriate action, both civil and criminal, to enforce this [support] obligation when the child is receiving public assistance, including Medi-Cal, and when requested to do so by the individual on whose behalf the enforcement efforts will be made when the child is not receiving public assistance, . . <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>The district attorney was authorized to bring this action even though neither the mother nor the minor child, A. L. W., was receiving public assistance. <em>(Worth </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1150, 1153 [255 Cal.Rptr. 304].)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Section 11350.1 provides in pertinent part: \u201cNotwithstanding any other statute, <em>in any action brought by the district attorney for child support of a minor child or children, </em>the action may be prosecuted in the name of the county on behalf of the child, children or caretaker parent. ... In an action under this section there shall be no joinder of actions, or coordination of actions, or cross-complaints, and <em>the issues shall be limited strictly to the question of paternity, if applicable, and child </em>support.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">In the trial court defendant argued section 11350.1 applied exclusively to an action brought to recover public assistance pursuant to section 11350<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and did not apply to an action brought pursuant to section 11475.1 where no public assistance had been paid. Although somewhat unclear, defendant appears to reiterate this argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">/</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>The argument is not well taken. By its plain language, section 11350.1 applies to \u201cany action brought by the district attorney for child support.\u201d An action brought pursuant to section 11475.1 is such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Moreover, in <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Ferguson </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 549 [156 Cal.Rptr. 565] the court discussed sections 11350 and 11350.1 and noted that \u201cSection 11475.1 is also part of the same statutory scheme. Though not incorporated in the same chapter, it was enacted the same day as sections 11350 and 11350.1. It generally charges the organizational unit in the office of the district attorney with responsibility to enforce the obligations of parents to support their children. <em>No intent to abrogate the procedural limitations above discussed [in sections 11350 and 11350.1] is evident.\" </em>(P. 560, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Finally, we think the evident intent of section 11350.1 is to confine the efforts of the district attorney, a public servant, to the litigation of parentage and support issues without distraction by other more personal disputes between the parties, as happened in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">We therefore hold that section 11350.1 specifies procedures to be followed in this action brought under section 11475.1. Section 11350.1 plainly states that the issues in actions such as this shall be limited to the questions of paternity and child support. Here defendant made no attempt to litigate the denial of visitation as a defense to his obligation to pay child support. Rather, the parties obtained an order containing a detailed visitation schedule and thereafter litigated compliance with the order apart from any duty of support. We therefore have no occasion to decide whether frustration of visitation is a defense to a child support obligation or, if it is, whether its litigation would be appropriate in an action brought under section 11475.1. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1694; <em>Moffat </em>v. <em>Moffat </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 645, 652 [165 Cal.Rptr. 877, 612 P.2d 967]; <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Marshman </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 1117, 1120 [195 Cal.Rptr. 603]; <em>In re Marriage of Anderson </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 553, 559-560 [178 Cal.Rptr. 117]; <em>In re Marriage of Ciganovich </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 289, 294 [132 Cal.Rptr. 261]; compare <em>State of Washington </em>ex rel. <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Leyser </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 451, 460 [241 Cal.Rptr. 812]; <em>Solberg </em>v. <em>Wenker </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 475, 480-481 [209 Cal.Rptr. 545]; <em>In re Marriage of Daves </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 7, 10 [185 Cal.Rptr. 770].) Since the issue of visitation was unrelated to the issues of paternity or child support, section 11350.1 precluded litigation of the visitation issue in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Although the language of section 11350.1 is clear enough, we note that the statute has previously been construed to preclude claims such as visitation from being litigated in a support enforcement action. (See <em>D. G. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number><em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 535, 542 [161 Cal.Rptr. 117] [Uniform Parentage Act claim in which visitation may be litigated may not be brought in an action pursuant to section 11350.1]; see also <em>County of Alameda </em>v. <em>Sampson </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 584, 591 [163 Cal.Rptr. 915] [cross-complaint may not be brought in a section 11350.1 action].)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The trial court properly concluded defendant\u2019s visitation claim could not be litigated in this child support enforcement action authorized by section 11475.1. Defendant should obtain an adjudication of his visitation rights by filing a separate action under the Uniform Parentage Act. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7000, 7010, subd.
