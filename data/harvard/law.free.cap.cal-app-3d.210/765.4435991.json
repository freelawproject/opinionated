J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOt\">Defendant was charged in Placer County with the crimes of murder and attempted robbery together with an allegation of firearm use. The special circumstance of murder in the attempted commission of a robbery was also alleged. However, the People elected not to seek the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Following an order of change of venue to Alameda County, the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty of second degree murder and the firearm use allegation to be true.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">Defendant was sentenced to 15 years to life plus 2 years for firearm use. Defendant now appeals raising claims of instructional and procedural error. We will affirm for the reasons discussed hereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">I. <em>Accessory After the Fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-12\">II. <em>Felony Impeachment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">In the proceedings below, defendant filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude for impeachment purposes his prior felony convictions for robbery, burglary and sale of heroin. The trial court ultimately ruled that defendant\u2019s three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>convictions for sale of heroin and two convictions for burglary would be admissible, but that his robbery conviction would be inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Defendant now argues the trial court erred in permitting impeachment by defendant\u2019s prior convictions for drug sales and burglary. His argument is two pronged: 1) the trial court erred in applying post-Proposition 8 law to this pre-Proposition 8 case; and 2) the priors were inadmissible under preProposition 8 law.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In denying defendant\u2019s exclusion motion, the trial court explained that it had applied the ruling of <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111]. When defense counsel pointed out that the oifense here occurred <em>before </em>Proposition 8, the trial court declared that in its view, the law in effect <em>at the time of trial </em>controlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The Attorney General concedes that the trial court committed error in applying post-Proposition 8 law<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but argues the error was harmless. In applying <em>Castro, </em>it is argued, the trial court correctly engaged in the balancing process required under <em>People </em>v. <em>Beagle </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 441 [99 Cal.Rptr. 313, 492 P.2d 1], Defendant, on the other hand, asserts that he is entitled to the benefit of the line of pre-Proposition 8 cases which restricted the trial court\u2019s discretion rendering his priors inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">We conclude, however, that we need not reach the question of admissibility of defendant\u2019s priors. Since defendant did not testify at trial, the ruling on his motion to exclude his prior convictions for impeachment purposes is not reviewable on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Collins, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 383-388.)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Obviously, we reject defendant\u2019s novel argument that <em>Collins </em>applies only to post-Proposition 8 cases and hence has no application here. Although <em>Collins </em>was decided on August 11, 1986, after Proposition 8, the relevant holding is independent of that enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Proposition 8, as adopted by the electorate in June 1982, added article I, section 28, subdivision (f) to the California Constitution governing the use of prior convictions for impeachment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, a number of trial courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>and reviewing courts concluded that Proposition 8 had eliminated the discretionary power of trial courts recognized in <em>Beagle </em>to exclude certain prior felony convictions for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">However, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 301, the Supreme Court put this notion to rest holding that trial courts retain the discretionary power they have \u201calways\u201d had to exclude prior felony convictions under Evidence Code section 352. The <em>Castro </em>court concluded that Proposition 8 was not intended to supersede <em>Beagle </em>but only its progeny: \u201cThe intention of the drafters of the initiative was to restore trial court discretion as visualized by the Evidence Code and to reject the rigid, black letter rules of exclusion which we had grafted onto the code by the <em>Antick </em>line of decisions.\u201d (38 Cal.3d at p. 312.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The <em>Collins </em>decision followed the standing rule adopted in <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1984) 469 U.S. 38 [83 L.Ed.2d 443, 105 S.Ct. 460]. In <em>Luce, </em>the United States Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, determined that in order to preserve for review a claim of improper impeachment by a prior conviction admitted under Federal Rules of Evidence, rule 609(a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201ca defendant must testify.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 43 [83 L.Ed.2d at p. 448].) In <em>Collins, </em>the California Supreme Court recognized that \u201c[t]he federal rule of evidence implemented by the <em>Luce </em>decision ... is similar in effect to the provisions of our Evidence Code [section 352] at issue in <em>Beagle </em>and Castro.\u201d (42 Cal.3d at p. 385.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">In so doing, the <em>Collins </em>court underscored the policy considerations underlying the <em>Luce </em>procedural rule and seminal <em>Beagle </em>holding while simultaneously noting the similarity of the federal rule of evidence implemented with the statutory provisions at issue in <em>Beagle </em>and <em>Castro. </em>Stated differently, the rationale underpinning the use of priors for impeachment is the same whether tested under <em>Beagle </em>or <em>Castro, </em>but the <em>Luce </em>rule applies as a judicially declared rule of procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Moreover, the <em>Collins </em>court made the rule prospective only, noting that the decision established a new rule of law. \u201cUnder our prior decisions on this question a defendant was not required to testify in order to preserve for appeal a claim of improper impeachment by prior conviction; indeed, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>was not even asked to make an offer of proof <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fries </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 222, 232-234 [155 Cal.Rptr. 194, 594 P.2d 19]). And no such sweeping procedural change was stated or implied in either Proposition 8 or its supporting ballot materials. Thus our decision to adopt the <em>Luce </em>requirement establishes a new rule of law when there was a previous rule in this state to the contrary; in such circumstances we have the option of giving it prospective effect on policy grounds. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guerra </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 385, 399-406 [208 Cal.Rptr. 162, 690 P.2d 635].)\u201d (42 Cal.3d at p. 388.) The court thereafter held that the <em>Luce </em>rule will apply \u201conly prospectively to trials beginning after this decision is final.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 388.) Defendant\u2019s trial began in October 1986 \u2014well after <em>Collins </em>became final. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule24.)  Consequently, we conclude that because defendant did not testify, his claim of erroneous denial of his motion to exclude prior convictions for impeachment is nonreviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">III. <em>Address of Prosecution </em>Witness<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Newsom, J., and Holmdahl, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied August 9, 1989.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b687-14\"> The jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charge of attempted robbery which was later dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b687-15\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 765.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b688-10\">The crime here occurred on February 9, 1981.\u2014well before the passage of Proposition 8.
