It was further alleged that in the commission of all of the above crimes appellant personally used a firearm, to wit, a handgun, within the meaning of Penal Code section 12022.5, and that in the commission of counts II and III appellant intentionally inflicted great bodily injury upon Maria and thus was subject to the sentence enhancement of Penal Code section 12022.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-10\">Appellant pled not guilty to all counts and denied the enhancement allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-11\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s <em>in limine </em>motion to exclude any in-court identification of appellant by Maria.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-12\">The jury found appellant guilty of first degree murder (count I) and first degree attempted murder (count II) and found the enhancement allegations to be true. He was found not guilty of assault with a firearm (count III) since that was an alternative to attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-13\">The trial court sentenced appellant to state prison for an aggregate term of 39 years to life, computed as follows: for the murder (count I), appellant was sentenced to 25 years to life with a 2-year enhancement for firearm use; for the attempted murder (count II), appellant was given a consecutive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>sentence of 9 years with a 3-year enhancement for intentionally inflicting great bodily injury on Maria. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7.) The two-year enhancement for firearm use (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.5) on count II was stayed pursuant to Penal Code section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-4\">Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">Statement of the Facts <em>The Prosecution Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">At approximately 10 p.m. on April 22, 1983, Jose Kamey gave Maria a ride to the Los Panchos Bar in Mendota where she met her boyfriend, Armando. Maria and Armando drank beer and danced until about 1 a.m. While exiting the bar, Maria saw a man she did not know who was wearing a checkered shirt, Levi\u2019s pants and jacket, a brown cowboy hat, and boots. The man, later identified by Maria as appellant, asked Armando for a ride. Armando agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">Maria, Armando and appellant walked to Armando\u2019s car, which was parked approximately half a block from the bar. It appeared to Maria that the men were friends, or at least knew each other by name. She heard Armando address appellant as \u201cValente\u201d or \u201cClemente.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">Soon after they left in the car Maria noticed that the conversation changed from being friendly. Appellant threatened to kill Armando if he didn\u2019t pay off a $200 debt. Armando said he did not have enough money in his possession but offered to return to the bar and ask some friends for funds. Appellant refused the offer and challenged Armando to get out of the car and fight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-9\">The car came to a stop. Appellant threatened to shoot Maria if Armando didn\u2019t get out of the car and fight. Maria opened her door slightly, turned toward appellant, and asked him why he would hurt her when she did not owe him anything and she did not know him. She added, \u201cWhy are you gonna fire at me if I don\u2019t have any problem with you? If you want to, I\u2019ll lend Armando the money so he can pay you the amount that he owes you.\u201d Appellant replied that \u201che didn\u2019t want the money anymore because his intention was different. . . . [H]e wanted to do something else. ... To fire Armando and also fire at me. And for him to get off the car.\u201d The dome light illuminated the car\u2019s interior during this brief period of time, giving Maria \u201cmore time to identify the man\u201d and the opportunity to see \u201che had a weapon in his hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>Armando refused to exit the car. Instead, he told appellant \u201cthat if he wanted to fire at him, to go ahead and fire\u201d but he better \u201cshoot him good because if not, afterwards, they were gonna have some problems.\u201d Appellant answered with a shot to the back of Armando\u2019s head. Appellant then pointed the gun at Maria\u2019s face and fired as she raised her arm in a futile attempt to shield her face from the bullet. The bullet shattered a bone in her arm and penetrated her face at a point close to her nose and mouth, causing severe flesh wounds. Maria fell wounded to the ground outside the vehicle; while lying there, she heard two more shots.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After hearing footsteps and staying on the ground for about three minutes, she got up and began walking down the road looking for help. A man stopped to assist and transported her to the fire station. She was taken to the hospital where she stayed for two weeks. She later had to return to the hospital for two more operations on her arm, and one where a piece of bone was removed from her hip as a bone graft on her wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">Within two weeks after the attack, but while still in the hospital, Maria was contacted by Sergeant Israel Porras of the Mendota Police Department who listened to her describe the assailant and asked her to look over two photo displays. Maria picked out the photo of appellant as the assailant. On May 15, 1983, at Maria\u2019s home, a second photo lineup was conducted. She again picked out appellant\u2019s photo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">At trial, Maria identified appellant as the person who shot Armando and her. She testified that although appellant appeared somewhat different from the man who shot her, especially his hair, he still had many distinguishing features supporting the identification, such as his mustache, the style of his beard, his eyes, his facial and body characteristics, and his physique. She also identified a brown cowboy hat seized by the investigating officers from Armando\u2019s vehicle after the shootings as similar to the hat appellant was wearing the morning of the shootings. Hairs retrieved from this hat were compared against hair samples taken from appellant. The criminalist found that two of the unknown hairs exhibited the same characteristics as appellant\u2019s hairs. The criminalist testified that, although he could not definitely say the unknown hairs originated from appellant, he could not exclude appellant as the source of the unknown hairs. Further, Maria observed that the assailant had \u201ca tooth missing.\u201d The parties stipulated that if Litman Wolfe were called as a witness he would testify that he is a dentist; that he reviewed appellant\u2019s dental chart dated July 29, 1986; that appellant was missing his four upper center teeth; and that appellant had a partial upper denture which covered the missing teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>In addition to Maria\u2019s testimony, the prosecution presented other witnesses. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment, it reveals the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">Jose Kamey, the man who gave Maria a ride to Los Panchos Bar, testified that he saw Maria outside the bar with Armando and another person at about 1 a.m. on April 23, 1983. The other person \u201chad features similar to Clemente\u2019s,\u201d such as height and body build. Additionally, the other person was wearing a hat similar to the one he used to see appellant wearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">Jose de la Paz testified that he knew appellant because he had seen him in different bars in Mendota where he worked as a security guard. He recalled that on Friday, April 22, 1983, at.about 7:30 p.m., he saw appellant at the Los Panchos Bar when he drove his wife to work at that bar. Approximately one week later, the police asked De la Paz to look at some photo displays. When he did, he picked out appellant\u2019s photo as the person he saw at the Los Panchos Bar the previous Friday.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">Timothy Giles testified tie was a Mendota police officer in April of 1983 and saw appellant twice during that month. The first time was on April 12 at appellant\u2019s residence at 1817 Jenny Avenue, Mendota, when the officer responded to that address and called an ambulance for appellant\u2019s girlfriend, Maria Guardado, who was in labor. The second time was on April 22, when Officer Giles and Reserve Officer Adrian Herrera saw appellant on the 700 block of Seventh Avenue in Mendota. At the second meeting Officer Giles talked with appellant about the baby. Appellant told him it was a girl and everything was fine. Officer Giles indicated appellant was wearing a Levi\u2019s or western-style jacket and a brown cowboy hat similar to the cowboy hat retrieved from Armando\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">Lastly, Sergeant Porras stated that several hours before he was contacted at home on the morning of April 23 and informed about the shootings, he saw appellant leaning against the wall of Los Panchos Bar as he passed by in his car. Appellant was wearing a cowboy hat similar to the one in evidence. Officer Porras said that was the last time he saw appellant, whom he used to see regularly in Mendota.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">\n<em>The Defense Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">Appellant\u2019s defense was that he was in Mexicali when the crimes were committed and had nothing to do with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">Appellant\u2019s girl friend, Maria Guardado, testified that she was expecting a child in April 1983, and prior to the birth of the baby appellant told her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>he would be leaving for Mexico after the birth to visit a sick aunt. Miss Guardado stated the baby was born on April 12 and that she last saw appellant on April 17. She subsequently received a phone call from appellant in which he told her he was in Mexicali. Miss Guardado and the baby joined appellant in Mexicali on May 10, 1983. When she returned to California in November 1984, appellant was not with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">Juan Ramirez testified that appellant stayed with him in Mexicali for two weeks in April and May of 1983. Ramirez brought back the suitcase appellant had allegedly left behind. Ramirez did not bring appellant\u2019s cowboy hat back to California because Ramirez had used it until it was worn out. Ramirez stated that Maria Guardado was with appellant in Mexicali in April.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">Appellant testified on his own behalf and denied killing Armando or shooting Maria. He claimed that on April 23, 1983, he was in Mexicali visiting his ailing aunt. He also denied Armando owed him any money and denied that the cowboy hat introduced into evidence was his.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"Agq\">I., II.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-9\">\n<em>Was the Trial Court\u2019s Instruction That \u201cA Bone Fracture Constitutes Substantial And Significant Physical Injury Within the Meaning of Penal Code Section 12022.7\u201d Reversible Error?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-11\">The evidence of the nature and extent of Maria\u2019s injuries and treatment is undisputed. Appellant\u2019s defense was simply that he was in Mexicali when the crimes were committed. He did not in any way dispute the prosecution\u2019s evidence of Maria\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-12\">The bullet shattered a bone in Maria\u2019s arm and caused severe flesh wounds to her arm and face. She was immediately hospitalized after the attack for approximately two weeks and had two surgical operations performed on her arm and one on her face. She later returned to the hospital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>for two more operations on her arm, and one where a piece of bone was removed from her hip and used as a bone graft on her wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">The court instructed the jury, inter alia, as follows: \u201cIt is charged in Counts Two [attempted murder] and Three [assault with a deadly weapon] that in the commission of the crimes therein described, the defendant, with the specific intent to inflict such injury, personally inflicted great bodily injury on Maria Albizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">\u201cIf you find the defendant guilty of an offense or offenses charged in Counts Two and Three, it will then be your duty to determine whether or not the defendant, with the specific intent to inflict such injury, did personally inflict great bodily injury as herein defined on Maria Albizures in the commission of those offenses. The burden is on the People to prove this beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">\u201cThe term \u2018great bodily injury\u2019 as used in this instruction means a significant or substantial physical injury. Minor or moderate injuries of a temporary nature do not constitute great bodily injury within the meaning of this instruction.\u201d The court concluded the enhancement instruction with the following paragraph: \u201cA bone fracture constitutes substantial and significant physical injury within the meaning of Penal Code section 12022.7.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">Appellant assigns error to the concluding paragraph of the enhancement instruction. He contends the instruction effectively usurped the jury\u2019s function and directed a verdict on one of the statutory elements of the enhancement and, consequently, the instructional error is reversible per se.  He asserts, \u201cThe impact of the court\u2019s instruction here was simply to obviate the need for the jury to consider the nature and magnitude of the injury, because the court told the jurors that the injury described by the victim satisfied the statutory requirement, and consequently appellant\u2019s trial by jury on the enhancement was effectively limited . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>We will conclude the court erred in instructing that \u201c[a] bone fracture constitutes substantial and significant injury within the meaning of Penal Code section 12022.7.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">The first three paragraphs of the enhancement instruction accurately communicate the jury findings required to satisfy the elements of Penal Code section 12022.7. The elements are: (1) the defendant had the specific intent to inflict great bodily injury on the victim, and (2) the defendant personally inflicted great bodily injury on the victim. (CALJIC No. 17.20 (1979 rev.).) The second paragraph correctly states it is the jury\u2019s duty and responsibility to weigh the evidence and determine if the elements are proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">However, by giving the concluding paragraph of the enhancement instruction, the trial court erroneously reduced the prosecution\u2019s burden of proving that Maria sustained great bodily injury under section 12022.7. The court in effect told the jury that if Maria sustained a broken bone, the great bodily injury element was satisfied as a matter of law. Although the court did not expressly direct the jury to find (1) that Maria sustained a broken bone or (2) that the great bodily injury element was satisfied as a matter of law, the concluding paragraph was nevertheless erroneous since it permitted the jury to find that element satisfied simply by concluding that Maria sustained a broken bone. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Figueroa </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 714 [224 Cal.Rptr. 719, 715 P.2d 680], the court held, in a prosecution for sale of unqualified securities, the trial court\u2019s instruction that certain promissory notes in evidence were securities under the Corporate Securities Law was tantamount to a directed verdict on the security element of the offenses. In reaching its conclusion the court dispelled notions that the trial court could so instruct (1) if the evidence left little room for doubt and/or (2) because the issue was solely a question of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">The court summarized its holding by noting, \u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s instruction here cannot stand. Instead of permitting the jury to find for itself that the note given [the victim] was a \u2018security\u2019. . . , the trial court removed that issue from the jury and directed a finding on it. This was error, particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>since it was not a foregone conclusion that the note . . . <em>was </em>a \u2018security\u2019 under the statute.\u201d (41 Cal.3d at p.734, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">Responding to the People\u2019s contention the instruction was justified, the court in <em>Figueroa </em>reasoned that if a judge were permitted to instruct the jury an element had been established due to supposedly undisputed evidence, the right to a jury trial would become a hollow guaranty. (41 Cal.3d at p. 730.) The court also explained that although the definition of a security is a matter of law, whether a particular document satisfies the definition is a question of fact. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 730-734.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">The court based its holding on considerations of due process and the right to a jury trial. (41 Cal.3d at p. 731.) It concluded, \u201cIn many criminal cases, the prosecution\u2019s evidence will establish an element of the charged offense \u2018as a matter of law.\u2019 Similarly, in many instances, the accused will not seriously dispute a particular element of the offense. [Citation.] However, neither of these sometime realities of trial practice justifies the giving of an instruction which takes an element from the jury and decides it adversely to the accused. Such an instruction confuses the roles of judge and jury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 733, fn. omitted.) The concurring opinion in <em>Figueroa </em>aptly summarized the majority holding when it stated \u201cthe majority distills an absolute rule that apparently would prohibit in criminal trials, regardless of the state of the evidence, such instructions as one that a particular automobile is a motor vehicle or one that a particular gun is a firearm.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 742.) The concurring justices preferred to postpone \u201csuch judicial rule-making until the need arises.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">It has been observed that <em>Figueroa, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 714, articulated the following rules: \u201c(1) No matter how conclusive the evidence, the court may not directly inform the jury an element of the crime charged has been established. (See <em>Konda </em>v. <em>United States </em>(7th Cir. 1908) 166 Fed. 91.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">\u201c(2) The trial court determines what law applies to the charges to be deliberated by the jury, and to the extent possible, should state the law in \u2018abstract legal principles.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Figueroa, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 741.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">\u201c(3) Absent a stipulation by defendant that an element of the crime has been established, or is admitted, the trial court must \u2018 \u201cgo through the motions at least of submitting the issue to the jury even though the question appears . . . to be palpably lacking in factual character.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Id. </em>at p. 727, fn. 15, citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Austin </em>(10th Cir. 1972) 462 F.2d 724, 737.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">\u201c(4) Even such a simple concept as \u2018a gun is a firearm,\u2019 must be conveyed to the jury in definitional terms so as to permit the jury to apply the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>instruction in its factfinding/law-applying function.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lawson </em>(1987) 189 Cal.App.3d 741, 747-748 [234 Cal.Rptr. 557].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">The instruction that \u201c[a] bone fracture constitutes substantial and significant physical injury within the meaning of Penal Code section 12022.7\" was tantamount to stating \u201ca gun is a firearm\u201d in nondefinitional terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">This court, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lawson, supra, </em>189 Cal.App.3d 741, relied on <em>Figueroa </em>in concluding that the trial court\u2019s ruling that a particular instrument was a \u201csecurity\u201d within the meaning of violations charged under the Corporations Code was tantamount to a directed verdict on the security element of the offense and \u201camounted to prohibited factfinding by the court. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 754.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">The Attorney General argues \u201cthe instruction on \u2018bone fracture\u2019 was helpful and proper.\u201d He relies totally on <em>People </em>v. <em>Villarreal </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1139-1140 [219 Cal.Rptr. 371],</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">In <em>Villarreal, </em>the defendant was convicted by a jury of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury with a deadly weapon in violation of Penal Code section 245, subdivision (a)(1). The jury found true a great bodily injury allegation, within the meaning of Penal Code section 12022.7, based on multiple nasal fractures suffered by the victim in the attack. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Villarreal, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1138-1139.) Appellant contended the trial court erred in instructing the jury that \u201c \u2018[a] bone fracture constitutes a substantial and significant physical injury within the meaning of Penal Code section 12022.7.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1139.) The appellate court disagreed and affirmed the conviction, holding that the nasal fractures suffered by the victim constituted, as a matter of law, a substantial and significant physical injury within the meaning of Penal Code section 12022.7, and the trial court therefore properly so instructed the jury. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1139-1141.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-11\">The Attorney General\u2019s reliance on <em>Villarreal </em>is misplaced. It was decided six months before <em>People </em>v. <em>Figueroa, supra, </em>41 Cal. 3d 714, and, as appellant correctly points out, \u201c[n]o contention was made in <em>Villarreal </em>that the instruction violated the defendant\u2019s right to trial by jury, and <em>Villarreal </em>is not dispositive of the argument made here.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-12\">The recent Fourth District opinion of <em>People </em>v. <em>Nava </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1490 [255 Cal.Rptr. 903] expressly contradicts <em>Villarreal </em>and concludes that \u201cit was error in this case for the trial court to instruct the jury that a bone fracture was a significant and substantial injury within the meaning of section 12022.7.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1498.) The court observed, \u201cThere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1306\">*1306</page-number>are 206 bones in the human body ranging in size from the femur of the leg to the ungual phalange of the little toe. (Gray, Anatomy of the Human Body (26th ed. 1954) p. 119.) Bone fractures are also variable, ranging from compound fractures of major bones to hairline fractures of very small ones. At their worst, fractures may be life threatening and cause crippling injuries; at their least, they may cause nothing more than frantic jumping\u2014the result of a toe stubbed against an unmoving chair leg.

While reversal of the judgment for the error discussed in Part II of this opinion renders it unnecessary to decide what standard of prejudice should be used to assess the trial court\u2019s instruction, today\u2019s opinion should not be read as compelling a reversal in every case in which similar instructions were given. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at pp. 550-557.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Figueroa, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 734, fn. 24; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Lawson, supra, </em>189 Cal.App.3d 741, 754.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Odle </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 386, 415 [247 Cal.Rptr. 137, 754 P.2d 184], the Supreme Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on an element of a special circumstance\u2014that defendant \u201c \u2018knew or reasonably should have known that his victim was a peace officer engaged in the performance of his duties\u2019\u2014was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d under <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18 and, therefore, not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\"><em>Odie </em>relied on <em>Cabana </em>v. <em>Bullock </em>(1985) 474 U.S. 376 [88 L.Ed.2d 704, 106 S.Ct. 689] in concluding that a defendant does not have a federal constitutional right to have all elements of a special circumstance determined by a jury. \u201cThe decision whether a particular punishment\u2014even the death penalty\u2014is appropriate in any given case is not one that we have ever required to be made by a jury. Indeed, in <em>Spaziano </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>468 U.S. 447 (1984) [82 L.Ed.2d 340, 104 S.Ct. 3154], we specifically rejected the argument that the Sixth Amendment or any other constitutional provision provides a defendant with the right to have a jury consider the appropriateness of a capital sentence.\u201d <em>(Cabana </em>v. <em>Bullock, supra, </em>474 U.S. 376, 385-386 [88 L.Ed.2d 704, 716].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number><em>Odle </em>reaffirmed the exceptions to a reversible per se standard for federal constitutional error as set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 539 [205 Cal.Rptr. 265, 684 P.2d 826]: \u201c(i) If the erroneous instruction was given in connection with an offense of which the defendant was acquitted and had no bearing on the offense of which he was convicted; (ii) If the defendant conceded the issue; (iii) If the factual issue posed by the omitted instruction was necessarily resolved adversely to the defendant under other properly given instructions . . . ; or (iv) If the realized the element was in issue, presented all the evidence at their command on the issue, and the record both established the existence of the element as a matter of law and showed the contrary evidence not worthy of consideration (the <em>'Cant-rell-Thornton </em>exception\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cantrell </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 672 . . . ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 738 . . . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Odle, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at pp. 410-411.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">The court in <em>Odie </em>reviewed the record and observed, \u201cIn our view, these circumstances show conclusively that at a minimum, defendant reasonably should have known Swartz was a peace officer engaged in the performance of his duties. It would, indeed, require fantastic speculation on our part to hold that a reasonable jury could have found otherwise. We therefore conclude that the failure to instruct on the special circumstance was harmless under <em>Chapman. </em>It follows that it was also harmless under <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Odle, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 416.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">In <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1986) 478 U.S. 570 [92 L.Ed.2d 460, 106 S.Ct. 3101], the Supreme Court found harmless instructional error impermissibly shifting the burden of proof on the issue of malice in a murder trial. Noting that errors subject to a reversible per se standard are the exception rather than the rule, the court said: \u201cWe have emphasized . . . , that while there are some errors to which <em>Chapman </em>does not apply, they are the exception and not the rule. [Citation.] Accordingly, if the defendant had counsel and was tried by an impartial adjudicator, there is a strong presumption that any other errors that may have occurred are subject to harmless- error analysis. The thrust of the many constitutional rules governing the conduct of criminal trials is to ensure that those trials lead to fair and correct judgments. Where a reviewing court can find that the record developed at trial establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the interest in fairness has been satisfied and the judgment should be affirmed. As we have repeatedly stated, \u2018the Constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not a perfect one.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>478 U.S. at pp. 578-579 [92 L.Ed.2d at p. 471].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-7\">The United States Supreme Court, in <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 497 [95 L.Ed.2d 439, 107 S.Ct. 1918], held that even instructional error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>pertaining to an element of an offense may be subject to the harmless error standard of <em>Chapman. </em>In a prosecution for sale of obscene materials, the trial court\u2019s community standards instruction regarding value violated the objective standard constitutionally required. Nevertheless, the court held there was \u201cno reason to require a retrial if it can be said beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury\u2019s verdict . . . was not affected by the erroneous instruction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 502 [95 L.Ed.2d at p. 446].) The court concluded, \u201cWhile it was error to instruct the juries to use a state community standard in considering the value question, if a reviewing court concludes that no rational juror, if properly instructed, could find value in the magazines, the convictions should stand.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 503 [95 L.Ed.2d at p. 447], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">The court evaluated the effect of the erroneous instructions in <em>Pope </em>and <em>Rose, </em>as follows: \u201cThe problem with the instructions in both cases is that the jury could have been impermissibly aided or constrained in finding the relevant element of the crime: in <em>Rose, </em>by the erroneous presumption; in this case, by possible reliance on unreasonable community views on the value question. By leaving open the possibility that petitioners\u2019 convictions can be preserved despite the instructional error, we do no more than we did in <em>Rose. </em>To the extent that cases prior to <em>Rose </em>may indicate that a conviction can never stand if the instructions provided the jury do not require it to find each element of the crime under the proper standard of proof, . . . , after <em>Rose, </em>they are no longer good authority.\u201d <em>(Pope </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>481 U.S. at pp. 503-504, fn. 7 [95 L.Ed.2d at p. 447].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">Although the instruction in the instant case did partially invade the province of the jury as to an element of the enhancement, the standard of review for the error is \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d under <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at page 21 [17 L.Ed.2d at pages 708-709]. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Odie, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 415.)  Maria testified without contradiction about the shattered bone in her arm, the flesh wounds to her arm and face, and the five surgeries, including a bone graft, resulting from this vicious attack. Appellant did not in any way dispute the nature or extent of Maria\u2019s injuries. Under the facts of this case it is inconceivable that the jury, without receiving the erroneous instruction, would have concluded Maria did not sustain \u201cgreat bodily injury.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7; CALJIC No. 17.20 (1979 rev.).) There is no evidence in the record to support a finding that Maria\u2019s physical injuries were anything but \u201csignificant or substantial\u201d within the meaning of section 12022.7. Therefore, there was no material issue of fact relative to Maria\u2019s injuries for the jury to determine, and the instructional error was harmless. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cantrell </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 672 [105 Cal.Rptr. 792, 504 P.2d 1256]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 738 [114 Cal.Rptr. 467, 523 P.2d 267].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>Additionally, the jury resolved all but one of the Penal Code section 12022.7 enhancement elements adversely to appellant by its attempted first degree murder verdict, which was clearly unaffected by the erroneous instruction. Through that verdict the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was the person who attacked Maria and that he specifically intended to kill her. This latter finding goes well beyond the element in section 12022.7 that he specifically intended to inflict great bodily injury. The only enhancement element not determined by the attempted murder conviction was whether Maria sustained \u201cgreat bodily injury.\u201d All the evidence says she did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">Application of the harmless error rule here will \u201cpromote[] public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.\u201d <em>(Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 673, 681 [89 L.Ed.2d 674, 685, 106 S.Ct. 1431].)
