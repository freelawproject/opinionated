(appellant), the mother of Laura H. (minor), appeals from orders terminating her parental rights and finding minor adoptable. We conclude appellant\u2019s rights under Welfare and Institutions Code section 350, subdivision (b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were denied during in camera questioning of the minor and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1692\">*1692</page-number>Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">On November 2,1989, a dependency petition was filed pursuant to section 300, subdivision (b) alleging that appellant had failed to protect minor from abuse.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Minor was detained and placed with her maternal aunt and uncle. A default was ultimately entered against minor\u2019s father, whose whereabouts were unknown, and appellant pleaded nolo contendere to the dependency petition. The status quo was maintained at the six-month review hearing on October 22, 1990, and at the twelve-month review on May 3, 1991, appellant and her attorney entered into a stipulation terminating reunification services and setting the matter for a section 366.26 selection and implementation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">At the section 366.26 hearing, minor testified in camera but appellant\u2019s counsel was not present. The court terminated appellant\u2019s parental rights, found minor adoptable, and ruled that adoption was the least detrimental alternative. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-7\">Minor\u2019s father left near the time of her birth, and, when minor was one year old, appellant moved in with Dennis C. Minor became a dependent child after she was physically abused by Dennis C. and was detained out of appellant\u2019s home for three and one-half years. After her return, she remained in appellant\u2019s home for one year before she was again detained and declared a dependent child due to further abuse by Dennis C. Appellant did not contest the allegation that she had failed to protect minor from Dennis C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-8\">At the selection and implementation hearing, the social workers\u2019 reports indicated minor was conflicted about her living situation and professed strong feelings toward both the prospective adoptive parents, her maternal aunt and uncle, and appellant. Though minor appeared to favor adoption by her maternal aunt and uncle, she also indicated to a psychologist that \u201cI just can\u2019t make up my mind,\u201d and, according to that psychologist, was being forced to make a decision with potentially traumatic emotional consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-9\">In order to resolve the situation, the court proposed that minor, who was then nine years old, testify in camera pursuant to section 350, subdivision (b). However, the court indicated that only minor and her counsel would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1693\">*1693</page-number>present, along with a court reporter. Appellant\u2019s counsel did not object to this procedure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">During questioning by the court and minor\u2019s attorney, minor testified she wanted to live with her maternal aunt and uncle and expressed a desire not to live with appellant and Dennis C. However, minor indicated she wanted to stay in touch with her half siblings and stated she still loved appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">Appellant testified she did not object to minor staying with her maternal aunt and uncle until she was 16 or 18 years old when she could decide for herself where she wanted to live. However, appellant was against adoption and favored guardianship. Other members of appellant\u2019s family felt similarly. After reviewing minor\u2019s in camera testimony, appellant indicated minor was an accomplished liar and believed minor\u2019s testimony would have been different had she been present and able to look minor in the eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-7\">I. <em>Parent\u2019s Right to Counsel at the In Camera Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1207-8\">Appellant contends she was denied the right of confrontation by the fact her counsel was not present at the in camera hearing. We agree. Section 350, subdivision (b), section 366.26, subdivision (g), and California Rules of Court, rule 1412(c) provide that minor\u2019s testimony may be taken in chambers outside of the presence of minor\u2019s parent or parents if the parent or parents are represented by counsel and their counsel is present.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is no provision in either section which permits a minor\u2019s in camera testimony in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1694\">*1694</page-number>the absence of the parent\u2019s attorney. The court was without authority to exclude appellant\u2019s attorney from the hearing.* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">Respondent argues appellant waived her attorney\u2019s presence by failing to object to the procedure. However, there is no indication that appellant affirmatively waived her statutory right to counsel\u2019s presence. True, when the admissibility of evidence is at issue, a failure to object waives appellate review of the court\u2019s ruling. (3 Witkin, Cal. Evidence (3d ed. 1986) Introduction of Evidence at Trial, \u00a7 2012, pp. 1971-1972.) But this rule has no application to these facts, where a statutory right to the presence of counsel was ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">Section 366.26, subdivision (g) manifests an obvious intent on the part of the Legislature that courts consider, when possible and feasible, the minor\u2019s wishes before ruling in termination proceedings. If those wishes are to be personally expressed by the minor to the court, the statute requires that the parent\u2019s counsel be present. That statutory requirement reflects the Legislature\u2019s concern for a parent\u2019s due process right of confrontation. (Cf. <em>In re Amber D. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 718, 723 [286 Cal.Rptr. 751] [interpreting analogous Civ. Code, \u00a7 232, subd. (b), which sets forth an identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1695\">*1695</page-number>procedure in termination proceedings involving minors adjudged dependent children prior to Jan. 1, 1989].)  Thus, the statutory requirement under section 366.26, subdivision (g) protects the constitutional right of confrontation.* 1****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">While any constitutional right can be waived, mere acquiescence is not a waiver; a waiver must be knowing and intelligent. (See, e.g., 5 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (2d ed. 1989) Trial, \u00a7\u00a7 2802-2803, pp. 3403-3406 [waiver of right to counsel].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Though appellant\u2019s attorney did not object to the procedure, there is no showing that appellant was aware of her right to have counsel present at the in camera hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under these facts, appellant cannot have knowingly and intelligently waived this statutory right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1696\">*1696</page-number>or the constitutional right of confrontation which the statute was designed to protect.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-4\">Respondent also argues even if the court erred, any error was harmless.  We do not agree.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When a constitutional right is infringed upon, the appropriate standard of prejudice is the harmless beyond a reasonable doubt standard. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065].) Respondent argues the appropriate standard is the that of <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818 [299 P.2d 243]: Whether \u201c \u2018it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 837.) This standard has been' used to determine the effect of errors in juvenile dependency matters. <em>(In re Nalani C., supra, </em>199 Cal.App.3d at p. 1028.) But, the termination of parental rights demands greater standards and greater scrutiny than the institution of dependency proceedings. We need not resolve this conflict, however, for under either standard the court\u2019s error in failing to require counsel\u2019s presence in the absence of a valid waiver by appellant was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">Section 366.26 contains a final check to ensure termination of parental rights is in the best interests of the child, and is the least detrimental alternative. This check can be found in subdivision (c)(1), which provides that adoption is the preferred permanent plan when there is no probability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1697\">*1697</page-number>reunification unless one of four listed circumstances is applicable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This is an expression of the Legislature\u2019s recognition that a plan other than adoption may be appropriate and less detrimental to the rights of both parent and child. (See, e.g., <em>In re Jennifer M. </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 728, 735-738 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 428].) And, section 366.26, subdivision (g) reflects a legislative intent that court\u2019s consider, when possible, a minor\u2019s wishes before ruling in a termination proceeding. When that expression takes the form of in camera testimony, however, a parent is entitled to the presence of counsel at the in camera proceeding. In the absence of counsel\u2019s presence, such a procedure is not statutorily authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-5\">Appellant did not want minor to be adopted, but favored guardianship. Although the maternal aunt and uncle wanted to adopt, there is a distinct chance that minor, under cross-examination, may have indicated her preference for some other plan. The record is replete with examples of minor\u2019s equivocation and the dilemma she faced in choosing between her mother and her maternal aunt and uncle. Under these facts, appellant was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s absence at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-6\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1211-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-8\">The judgment is reversed, and the court is directed to hold a new section 366.26 selection and implementation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-9\">Sills, R J., and Sonenshine, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1205-13\"> All statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1206-10\"> Minor had previously been declared a dependent child in March 1985 and removed from appellant\u2019s home, and was not returned until October 1988.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1207-9\"> The court stated that \u201cI am going to avail myself of the opportunity under . . . section 350 to speak to the minor privately with the reporter and minor\u2019s counsel.

In determining whether there is a basis for the child\u2019s in-chambers testimony, the court may consider the petitioner\u2019s report or other offers of proof. The parent or guardian may elect to have the court reporter read back the child\u2019s testimony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"A0bn\"> At oral argument, minor\u2019s counsel argued for the first time that minor\u2019s in camera testimony was authorized by section 399, which states: \u201cAny minor being considered for placement in a foster home shall have the right to make a brief statement to the court making a decision on placement. The court may disregard any preferences expressed by the minor. The minor\u2019s right to make a statement shall not be limited to the initial placement, but shall continue for any proceedings concerning continued placement or a decision to return to parental custody.\"</p>\n<p id=\"AZSQ\">However, the applicability of section 399 is limited to those situations where a minor is being considered for foster placement, which was not the case here. Furthermore, the court mentioned section 350 specifically, but did not cite section 399. (See fn. 3, <em>ante.) </em>Thus, section 399 is of no assistance. Finally, that section does not, as argued by minor\u2019s counsel, give minors an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to speak to the court in the absence of a parent\u2019s attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1209-6\"> Respondent argues that the right to counsel in dependency cases is statutory, not constitutional, therefore no issue of constitutional dimension arose when minor was examined in camera and appellant\u2019s counsel was not present. But respondent\u2019s conclusion does not flow from its premise. The right to counsel may be statutory, but it is conferred to protect parental rights, which clearly are fundamental. Parental rights may not be terminated without due process, and the right to counsel is a prophylactic measure designed to ensure compliance with due process. Here, violation of the statutory right to counsel\u2019s presence at the in camera hearing detrimentally affected the constitutional rights that counsel\u2019s presence was intended to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"AB9Q\">Moreover, when a court denies a party a right guaranteed by statute, the effect may be a denial of equal protection or due process. Thus, even assuming the right to counsel at the in camera hearing was only statutory, it may have been unconstitutionally taken away. And, deprivation of a statutory right may result in denial of due process when the resulting prejudice is sufficiently great. <em>(Baires </em>v. <em>I.N.S. </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 856 F.2d 89, 91.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1209-8\"><em> ln re Gilberto M. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1194 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 285] seems to conclude otherwise. There, a father\u2019s acquiescence to the court\u2019s jurisdiction was held to preclude a jurisdictional challenge on appeal. The court also held that the father\u2019s failure to object to prior proceedings undertaken without benefit of appointed counsel waived the issue of the right to counsel on appeal, even though the juvenile court had failed to appoint counsel in violation of a statutory mandate. (\u00a7 317, subd. (b).) The court stated, \u201cOnce a waiver has occurred, as here, it is unimportant whether the right to counsel is merely statutory . . . or is a right of constitutional significance .... [The] failure to raise it then precludes . . . raising the issue now. . . .\u201d <em>(In re Gilberto M. supra, </em>6 Cal.App.4th at p. 1200.) We have no quarrel with the first portion of this statement for, as we have stated, both statutory and constitutional rights can be waived. Our disagreement lies with the notion that silent acquiescence can effect a valid waiver of statutory and constitutional rights. In <em>Gilberto, </em>the court analyzed the concept of waiver in the contexts of jurisdiction and fundamental rights and concluded in conclusory fashion, without citation to relevant authority, that acquiescence can constitute a waiver of the latter as easily as the former. We cannot agree. It is one thing to hold that submission to a court\u2019s jurisdiction waives the issue on appeal\u2014this is standard fare. But to infer that by failing to object, a party\u2019s silence can effect a waiver of fundamental rights, whether from ignorance, confusion, or other disability, is not analogous and flies in the face of established precedent. To the extent <em>Gilberto M. </em>so holds, we disagree with it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1209-15\"> Since the statutory right to have counsel present at the in camera hearing was appellant\u2019s, it required a personal waiver in order to be bypassed. The confrontation and due process concerns which the right was intended to address could not be ignored by counsel as a matter of tactics without a personal waiver from appellant. \u201cWaiver of the right to counsel should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1696\">*1696</page-number>a matter calling for the personal decision of the client\u2014not one consigned to counsel.\u201d <em>(In re Nalani C. </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 1017, 1027-1028 [245 Cal.Rptr. 264].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1210-7\">Were we required to do so, we would find that counsel\u2019s representation was ineffective in failing either to assert the right to be present at the hearing or to elicit a knowing and intelligent waiver from his client on the record. The right to counsel in termination cases is provided for by statute. (\u00a7\u00a7 316-317; Cf. <em>In re Nalani C., supra, 199 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 1026.) Counsel is required to act in a manner consistent with reasonably competent attorneys acting as diligent advocates, and when there is a failure of such duty which deprives appellant of a potentially meritorious defense or when it is reasonably probable that a determination more favorable to appellant would have resulted but for counsel\u2019s failings, ineffective assistance will be found. <em>(In re James S. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 930, 936 [278 Cal.Rptr. 295].) Here, the record is devoid of any tactical reason for counsel\u2019s acquiescence in the court\u2019s procedure. A minor\u2019s views are important in a termination proceeding; subdivision (g) of section 366.26 reflects a legislative determination that courts should consider the minor\u2019s wishes when possible. These wishes were expressed here through in camera testimony, which is only authorized when counsel for the parent or parents is present. The fact that counsel did not object to an unauthorized procedure where a conflicted minor gave critical testimony, but was not subjected to cross-examination, would lead us to conclude that counsel\u2019s representation was ineffective.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1210-8\"> We reject the notion that because respondent\u2019s counsel was also excluded from the in camera hearing, any error was harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1211-10\"> The four circumstances listed in section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1) are: \u201c(A) The parents or guardians have maintained regular visitation and contact with the minor and the minor would benefit from continuing the relationship. [j|] (B) A minor 10 years of age or older objects to termination of parental rights, [j|] (C) The child is placed in a residential treatment facility, adoption is unlikely or undesirable, and continuation of parental rights will not prevent finding the child a permanent family placement if the parents cannot resume custody when residential care is no longer needed. [j|] (D) The minor is living with a relative or foster parent who is unable or unwilling to adopt the minor because of exceptional circumstances, which do not include an unwillingness to accept legal responsibility for the minor, but who is willing and capable of providing the minor with a stable and permanent environment and the removal of the minor from the physical custody of his or her relative or foster parent would be detrimental to the emotional well-being of the minor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1211-11\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1689.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
