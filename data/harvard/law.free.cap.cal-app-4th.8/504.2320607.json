Code, \u00a7 11351) and transporting and offering cocaine for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352), and finding to be true the sentence enhancement and probation ineligibility allegations based on the amount of cocaine possessed for sale (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11370.4; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203.073). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Louis Anthony Medina worked as a part-time paid informant in narcotics cases for the Oakland Police Department. Previously, he had been arrested for possession of cocaine; he had successfully gone through a two-year diversion program, and the charges had been dismissed. Medina\u2019s first assignment as a police informant was with Oakland Police Officer John Gutierrez.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">As of the time of trial, Officer Gutierrez had been a police officer for 12 years. He had worked as a narcotics investigator for the last five years, most recently with the Alameda County Narcotics Task Force. As part of this job, Gutierrez worked extensively with informants such as Medina. In September 1990, Medina began working with Gutierrez on the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Medina\u2019s modus operandi as a police informant was to cultivate the impression among his acquaintances that he was a kind of \u201cmiddle man\u201d in the drug trade. He would then go about his daily routine and wait for individuals to approach him with proposed illegal narcotics transactions, without actively targeting suspected drug dealers or seeking out illegal activity. Medina would report all such propositions to Officer Gutierrez, who would then make the decision whether or not to proceed with an investigation. Medina could not take any further action on a drug transaction without Gutierrez\u2019s approval. Once he received instructions to proceed, Medina would act the role of a middleman or go-between, arranging to obtain a purchaser for a dealer of large quantities of narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">On September 13, 1990, Medina was approached by an acquaintance who remarked about the fact that Medina carried a pager or \u201cbeeper\u201d and drove different cars at different times. When Medina told him that \u201cthis is strictly for business,\u201d the man told him, \u201cI got somebody who can do a lot of business with you.\u201d Medina asked, \u201c[0]h, can he do kilograms?\u201d to which the man responded affirmatively. Medina gave the man his pager telephone number. Later, the man called Medina and arranged a meeting with a third man named \u201cHector,\u201d subsequently identified as Hector Gonzalez.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">At the meeting, Gonzalez told Medina that he had a \u201ccompadre\u201d in Redwood City who could supply Medina with kilogram quantities of cocaine. Medina gave Gonzalez his telephone number, told Gonzalez that he would have to talk to his own \u201cpeople,\u201d and asked Gonzalez to get in touch with him after Gonzalez had talked with his (Gonzalez\u2019s) \u201cconnection.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Medina called Officer Gutierrez that night and informed him about his meeting with Gonzalez.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">On September 19, 1990, Gonzalez called Medina and told him that his \u201ccompadre\u201d had received five kilograms of cocaine, of which he was willing to sell Medina two. They agreed on a price of $28,000 per kilogram. Medina went to the Oakland Police Department to talk with Gutierrez about the deal. While he was there, he received another page from Gonzalez. This time, Gonzalez confirmed the deal and the price; he told Medina to meet him and drive him to Redwood City, where Medina could purchase the two kilograms of cocaine from Gonzalez\u2019s \u201cconnection.\u201d Officer Gutierrez approved this arrangement. According to standard procedure, Gutierrez searched Medina and his vehicle for guns and drugs, and then followed him to Gonzalez\u2019s house. The plan was for Medina to contact the seller and introduce Gutierrez as his \u201cbrother-in-law.\u201d Gutierrez was wearing a detection wire; Medina was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">As Medina drove Gonzalez to Redwood City, Gonzalez said that his compadre, identified by the name of Jesus, \u201ccan do a lot of kilograms,\u201d that he was a person Medina \u201ccould trust\u201d for \u201cfurther negotiations\u201d in the future, and that the cocaine he was going to sell to Medina was \u201c[t]he best quality that there was out on the street, and not to worry about anything.\u201d Gonzalez told Medina that \u201cJesus . . . wants us to start off with two kilograms . . . , because he doesn\u2019t know you and he wants to get to know you. He wants to talk with you. And later on, if everything goes well, then, you guys can do it every week and can do more. Do five, four to five kilograms a week.\u201d Gonzalez asked Medina about the money; Medina told him that his \u201cbrother-in-law\u201d had the money, and that they had to see the cocaine first before letting Gonzalez see any money.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The initial plan had been for the drug transaction to take place at the Price Club in Redwood City, for reasons of ease in police surveillance; and for the \u201cbust\u201d to take place with the assistance of officers from the San Mateo County Narcotics Task Force. However, Gonzalez insisted that they stop at a Mexican restaurant called El Grullense. Gonzalez telephoned \u201cJesus,\u201d and told him they had arrived. Medina walked over to Gutierrez\u2019s car, which was stopped nearby, and told him what to expect. Gutierrez contacted the San Mateo officers and told them of the change in plans. About 10 minutes later, appellant arrived driving a late model red Mustang. At about the same time, an unmarked van containing San Mateo officers arrived and parked nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Appellant asked Medina for the money. Medina replied that the money was with Gutierrez, and that he had to \u201csee the dope first\u201d before showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>him the money. Appellant told Medina that if he had gotten in contact with him earlier, he would have sold Medina five kilograms instead of two. Medina and Gonzalez got into appellant\u2019s car, and appellant drove them to an alley near 5th and Page Streets in Redwood City. The undercover police vehicles did not follow. Appellant stopped his car at a house which he identified to Medina as his residence. All three got out of the car, and appellant opened the garage door. Medina, who was scared, asked if it was safe; appellant assured him that everything was all right, and that no police would be around. Appellant gave Medina the impression that he had done this before, and that he was confident of what he was doing and where he was doing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">Appellant took Gonzalez and Medina into the garage and closed the garage door. Appellant then went inside the house adjoining the garage. He returned a minute later with a brown paper bag, out of which he pulled a yellow package. Medina recognized the packaging as the same kind he had previously seen used for cocaine. He made a hole in the package with a key, took out some powder, examined it, and told appellant that it looked good. Appellant told him that the cocaine came with \u201ca full money back guarantee on it.\u201d Appellant then went back into the house and returned with a second kilogram of cocaine. Appellant wanted to conclude the transaction there in the garage, but Medina told him that they would have to return to his partner (Gutierrez), and he would give appellant the money. After Gonzalez told appellant, falsely, that he had seen and counted the money, appellant agreed to go back to Gutierrez\u2019s car. The three then left the garage and got back into appellant\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">As they drove back to El Grullense, appellant told Medina that now that he knew Medina was going to buy from him that day, he should have saved five kilograms for him. Appellant assured Medina that if everything went well, they could do four or five kilograms a week, \u201c[n]o problem.\u201d Medina complimented appellant\u2019s car, and appellant told him he had paid for it \u201call in cash.\u201d Medina asked about appellant\u2019s car phone, and appellant said that \u201cit\u2019s just for business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">When they had arrived at the restaurant, they agreed that Medina would take the two packages of cocaine to Gutierrez, and would then bring back the money. However, Medina walked up to Gutierrez and told him that the two kilograms of cocaine were in the backseat of appellant\u2019s car in a brown bag, and that \u201c[ejverything looked okay.\u201d Officer Gutierrez transmitted the arrest signal over his radio. After that, two police vans converged on appellant\u2019s car, and appellant and Gonzalez were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">In his defense, appellant presented the testimony of his three sisters, his brother-in-law, and his wife. Each of them testified that they answered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>several telephone calls to appellant from someone named Hector during the two weeks prior to appellant\u2019s arrest. Hector would always ask for appellant. If appellant happened to be home at the time, he would tell his family to tell Hector that he was not there.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Appellant testified that he first met Gonzalez at a bar where Gonzalez was selling tape cassettes of Mexican music. According to appellant, around September 8, 1990, Gonzalez began calling him up and trying to talk to him about \u201csome business\u201d involving a friend of Gonzalez\u2019s named \u201cTony\u201d who had some money and wanted to buy something. Appellant testified that Gonzalez \u201cgave me the idea more or less what kind of business it was. I said I was not interested.\u201d Later, on another day, appellant again encountered Gonzalez at the bar. Gonzalez began telling appellant about his family and how he needed money because his wife was pregnant. He told appellant that he had a friend named Tony who had $56,000, and that he wanted appellant to get some cocaine for Tony. Gonzalez had already gone to three other persons without success. Appellant told Gonzalez that it was dangerous and illegal, and refused to help him. Gonzalez left the bar, appearing \u201ca little sad.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Appellant testified that after Gonzalez left the bar, another person sitting nearby, named \u201cFrancisco,\u201d told him that he had overheard the conversation and that he could help appellant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant refused the offer, telling Francisco that it was dangerous and against the law. Francisco persisted, insisting that there would be no problem in helping Gonzalez obtain some cocaine. Later that evening Francisco gave appellant a ride home from the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Appellant further testified that for the next several days, Gonzalez continued to try to contact him, both at the bar and over the telephone at his home. Appellant did not want to talk with Gonzalez, so he told his wife to tell Gonzalez that he was not there. When Gonzalez did get in touch with him, appellant again told him that he was not interested in obtaining cocaine for \u201cTony.\u201d On September 19, 1990, appellant spoke with Gonzalez for the last time. Gonzalez called appellant at the bar and asked him to talk to his friend Tony. Gonzalez put Tony on the telephone, who urged appellant, \u201c[pjlease, why don\u2019t you try to help Hector.\u201d Tony told appellant that he was going to come to Redwood City \u201cwith an amount of money,\u201d that there were people in the bar who could get what he wanted, and \u201c[pjlease try to talk with that man.\u201d Tony then hung up on appellant. Later that evening, Gonzalez called appellant at the bar again, and told appellant that he and Tony were in Redwood City with $56,000. Tony got on the telephone, and urged appellant to ask one of his friends if he could obtain two kilograms of cocaine for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>$56,000. When appellant again refused, Tony said: \u201c[T]his is about your friend .... I know that your financial situation is not good. . . . [I]t\u2019s something that\u2019s going to go well. Nothing is going to happen to us. I am a good man. I am a Mexican. And I don\u2019t think there is anything inconvenient about doing that.\u201d Finally, appellant agreed to talk to Francisco.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">According to appellant he told Francisco that he knew someone with $56,000, and he asked Francisco to make direct contact with the man. Francisco refused, saying he did not know the person. However, he offered to go to appellant\u2019s house, wait outside, and pay appellant $500 if appellant would bring Gonzalez and Tony to appellant\u2019s house himself. Appellant thought about it for three or four minutes and then decided to do it. Appellant went to the agreed meeting place at El Grullense restaurant to meet Gonzalez and Tony. Tony had the voice of the man appellant had talked with on the telephone. Appellant suggested that they go to his house, and they agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Appellant drove Gonzalez and Tony to his house and left them in his garage while he went outside to look for Francisco. He found Francisco waiting by a white car. Francisco asked appellant if he had the money. When appellant said no, Francisco told him that he had to go back and get it. Appellant asked Francisco to talk to Tony, but Francisco said no, and added: \u201c[Y]ou tried to do it, and now you have to do the whole thing.\u201d Francisco gave appellant a bag, which appellant took back to the garage and gave to Tony. After Gonzalez and Tony examined the packages in the bag, appellant drove them back to the restaurant. Tony got out of the car and told them he was going to get the money. Shortly thereafter, appellant and Gonzalez were arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Under cross-examination, appellant testified that he knew that Gonzalez and \u201cTony\u201d were trying to buy two kilograms of cocaine from him, that this was dangerous and illegal, and that he would get in trouble for it. He testified that there were three reasons why he took part in the drug transaction: because he felt sorry for Gonzalez and wanted to help him; because he was afraid of Francisco; and because he himself needed some money for automobile payments and the monthly charge on his mobile phone. Appellant testified that he earned between $600 and $800 per month from his janitorial and yard work. He paid $300 per month on the automobile and car phone, while his share of the rent, food and utilities was approximately $525 per month. Appellant\u2019s testimony about how much money he expected to receive from Francisco for arranging the transaction\u2014whether $300 or $500 or an unknown amount\u2014was unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Despite appellant\u2019s testimony about his motivating desire to assist Gonzalez and his belief that Gonzalez was a good friend and a good person, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>acknowledged on cross-examination that he had never visited Gonzalez\u2019s home; he had never had Gonzalez to his own home; he had never met Gonzalez\u2019s wife; and he only knew Gonzalez from seeing him at the bar. None of the members of appellant\u2019s family testified to knowing or having ever met Gonzalez.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Instruction on Derivative Entrapment</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in not giving his requested special instruction on derivative entrapment, on the ground that \u201cthe police through Medina knew and took advantage of [Hector] Gonzalez\u2019s appeals to his friendship with appellant\u201d in order to induce appellant to commit the crime. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The trial court properly instructed the jury on entrapment, giving three separate instructions setting forth the objective theory of the entrapment defense; that is, that it is a defense to a criminal charge that the commission of the alleged criminal act was induced by the conduct of law enforcement agents, or persons acting under their direction and control, \u201cwhen the conduct was such as would likely induce a normally law-abiding person to commit the crime.\u201d Contending that the jury could find Hector Gonzalez to be the entrapping agent, rather than being limited to consider whether or not Medina engaged in entrapping conduct, appellant asked the trial court to give an instruction expressly stating that a person subject to manipulation by law enforcement agents, who engages in procuring the commission of a crime by another, may be considered an agent of entrapment even if he or she is unaware of the law enforcement agent\u2019s identity or object.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The defense of \u201cderivative entrapment\u201d is based on the decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>McIntire </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 742 [153 Cal.Rptr. 237, 591 P.2d 527], In that case, the Supreme Court stated: \u201cThe purposes of the entrapment defense can be fulfilled only if it is understood that one can act as the agent of a law enforcement official without realizing the identity of his principal; the unwitting agent, though he may not appreciate the true nature of his role, is nonetheless being manipulated as the officer\u2019s tool in a plan to foster a crime and entrap its perpetrator. . . . \u2018The function of . . . enforcement officials is to investigate, not instigate, crime; to discover, not to promote, crime.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Improper governmental instigation of crime is not immunized because it is effected indirectly through a pliable medium.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 748.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The difficulty with this approach in the instant case is that here, there was no factual showing that the police, through Medina, were consciously taking advantage of appellant\u2019s sympathy for Gonzalez\u2019s alleged financial plight, or that Gonzalez was in any way controlled or unconsciously manipulated by the police. Unless Gonzalez was the agent of the police, whether knowingly or unwittingly, the question of whether his statements or actions induced appellant to commit a crime is simply irrelevant. For there to be entrapment, the inducement must ultimately have come from the police, whether or not through an unwitting third party. In this case, the only evidence of Gonzalez\u2019s connection with the police was that <em>he </em>made the offer to sell cocaine to Medina, through another unnamed intermediary who made the first approach to Medina. There was <em>no </em>evidence that Medina or any other police agent manipulated Gonzalez in order to procure the commission of a criminal act by either Gonzalez <em>or </em>appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The salient fact on this record is that the evidence was simply insufficient to show entrapment\u2014that is, conduct such as would likely induce a normally law-abiding person to commit the crime in question. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barraza </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 675, 689-690 [153 Cal.Rptr. 459, 591 P.2d 947]; CALJIC Nos. 4.60, 4.61, 4.61.5.) Even if we were to accept the premise of appellant\u2019s argument that Gonzalez was the unwitting agent of Medina in seeking to procure appellant\u2019s commission of a crime, appellant\u2019s own testimony regarding his casual acquaintance with Gonzalez and the alleged actions and statements by Gonzalez about his financial needs are not the kind of conduct which would \u201clikely [] induce a normally law-abiding person to commit the offense\u201d of sale of narcotics. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Barraza, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at pp. 689-690; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Thoi </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 689, 695 [261 Cal.Rptr. 789]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 324, 332 [211 Cal.Rptr. 493].) In short, even if there was error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the subject instruction, there was no prejudice to appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Exclusion of Gonzalez\u2019s Statements to Defense Witnesses</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in excluding certain evidence of what Gonzalez said to appellant and appellant\u2019s relatives during his telephone calls to appellant\u2019s residence. Appellant\u2019s argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">In the first place, with regard to statements made by Gonzalez to appellant\u2019s relatives during his telephone calls, the record makes it clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>defense counsel did not intend to elicit any more facts than that Gonzalez called, asked for appellant, and left his name as \u201cHector.\u201d The trial court permitted this. Moreover, all the witnesses testified that Gonzalez did not leave any messages, but merely asked for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">With regard to appellant\u2019s own testimony about what Gonzalez said to him, the trial court <em>permitted </em>the admission of this evidence, specifically on the grounds that it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but to show appellant\u2019s state of mind in reacting to what Gonzalez said to him. Thus, appellant was allowed to testify that Gonzalez put pressure on him by making personal appeals to appellant for sympathy and assistance. What the trial court did <em>not </em>permit was testimony by appellant of what Gonzalez told appellant that Medina had told Gonzalez; specifically, that Medina was allegedly pressuring Gonzalez to procure cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">As the colloquy between the trial court, defense counsel and the prosecutor makes clear, appellant was unable to show that this testimony was admissible under Evidence Code section 1250 as a statement of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, because only <em>appellant\u2019s </em>state of mind was relevant to the entrapment defense, not the alleged states of mind of either of the \u201cdeclarants,\u201d Gonzalez and Medina.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The only possible relevance of Gonzalez\u2019s statements to appellant was as evidence that Medina was <em>in fact </em>pressuring or manipulating Gonzalez. Gonzalez\u2019s state of mind was irrelevant to this factual issue, which depended on what Medina <em>actually </em>said or did. In other words, the question was whether Gonzalez was actually an agent (albeit unwittingly) of Medina and the police, not what Gonzalez\u2019s mental state was at the time. As to this question, Gonzalez\u2019s out-of-court statements to appellant about what Medina said or did were inadmissible hearsay offered for proof of the asserted fact that Medina pressured Gonzalez to induce appellant to commit a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Denial of Requested Continuance</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Appellant called Hector Gonzalez as a defense witness at trial. As expected, Gonzalez declined to answer questions by invoking his privilege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>against self-incrimination. When it became apparent that Gonzalez would not testify, defense counsel asked the trial court for a continuance of the trial until after Hector Gonzalez had been sentenced in his separate criminal trial, claiming that Gonzalez would then be free to testify on appellant\u2019s behalf. The trial court denied this motion. Appellant now contends that this denial was erroneous. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Under Penal Code section 1050, criminal trials are given precedence over civil proceedings, and are to be expedited \u201cto the greatest degree that is consistent with the ends of justice.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1050, subd. (a).) \u201cContinuances shall be granted only upon a showing of good cause. Neither the convenience of the parties nor a stipulation of the parties is in and of itself good cause.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1050, subd. (e).) \u201c[T]he court has broad discretion to grant or deny the motion for continuance [citations].\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Grant </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 829, 844 [248 Cal.Rptr. 444, 755 P.2d 894].)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">In this case, contrary to the assumption of defense counsel, there was no guarantee whatsoever that Gonzalez would not continue to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination during the pendency of his appeal. Furthermore, appellant\u2019s attorney could not represent to the court what Gonzalez\u2019s testimony would be as he had been told by Gonzalez\u2019s attorney not to speak to Gonzalez and Gonzalez was not scheduled to be sentenced for almost six weeks. Appellant\u2019s attorney could do no more than represent that Gonzalez <em>might </em>be persuaded to allow his sentencing to be expedited. On the other hand, Gonzalez\u2019s own attorney had indicated to the prosecution that he would endeavor to continue his client\u2019s sentencing as long as necessary so that it would take place <em>after </em>the conclusion of appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the requested continuance. Recent additions to both the California Constitution and the Penal Code have guaranteed the People the right to a speedy trial. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 29; Pen. Code, \u00a7 1050, subd. (a).) It is clear from the record that Gonzalez was not likely to testify in appellant\u2019s trial under any circumstances.
