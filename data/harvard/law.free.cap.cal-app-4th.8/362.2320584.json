Trailer Park when she observed a parolee-at-large walking with appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">When the parolee saw the patrol car, he ran. The deputy followed the parolee and watched him run inside a market. It was the same market that the deputy had observed appellant enter moments before.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">The deputy entered the market looking for the parolee. Inside the market, the deputy contacted appellant and asked her the whereabouts of the parolee. Appellant denied seeing anyone. The deputy asked if she would step outside so they could talk. Appellant said, \u201cNo, Coker, or you will arrest me.\u201d Appellant and the deputy continued to talk. While talking with appellant, the deputy observed appellant\u2019s pupils to be constricted and visible puncture marks on the side of her neck. Appellant\u2019s mouth was noticeably dry and her speech was slow and deliberate. Deputy Coker formed the opinion that appellant was under the influence of heroin and arrested her for being under the influence of a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">After the arrest, appellant was transported to the Porterville substation. During a booking search, the deputy found a bindle containing a black tarry substance in appellant\u2019s undergarments. The substance was later analyzed and found to contain 0.1 gram of heroin. Appellant gave a urine specimen. A urinalysis confirmed the presence of morphine, codeine and Benzocaine in appellant\u2019s system.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">On July 17, 1990, appellant was charged by information in count one with violating Health and Safety Code section 11350, subdivision (a) (possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>of heroin), a felony, and in count two, with violating Health and Safety Code section 11550 (unlawfully using and being under the influence of a heroin), a misdemeanor. It was further alleged in connection with count one that appellant had served a prior prison term for being convicted of petty theft with a prior conviction within the meaning of Penal Code section 667.5, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">On July 18, 1990, appellant entered her pleas of not guilty to all counts and denied the special allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">On July 25, 1990, appellant filed a motion to suppress evidence pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5. Appellant contended that all of Deputy Coker\u2019s observations of appellant\u2019s physical condition, as well as the physical evidence obtained from appellant at the time of her arrest, should be suppressed as the products of an illegal detention. On August 3, 1990, Judge John P. Moran heard the motion and took it under submission. Judge Moran denied the motion on August 6, 1990, by written minute order.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">On August 15, 1990, appellant entered into a plea bargain wherein she pleaded guilty as charged and admitted her prior prison term, and Judge Howard R. Broadman agreed that he would not sentence appellant to more than two years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">On September 14, 1990, imposition of sentence on the felony possession of heroin count was suspended. Judge Broadman placed appellant on probation for a period of five years on certain terms and conditions, including that she serve 365 days in the county jail and that she \u201cnot get pregnant during the term of her probation.\u201d The \u201c667.5 enhancement\u201d was ordered stayed. Appellant appears to have been sentenced to 90 days in jail on the misdemeanor conviction for being under the influence of heroin, and to have served that time while awaiting her sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">On September 17, 1990, appellant filed her timely notice of appeal from the order denying her motion to suppress evidence. This court designated that appeal as No. F014606.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">On November 15, 1990, Judge Broadman modified the condition of probation which required that appellant serve a term in the county jail, changing it to \u201ctime served.\u201d Judge Broadman released her from custody and continued the matter to November 19, 1990, a Monday, at 8:30 a.m. in Department 7 for further hearing on her acceptance into the Third Floor drug program. He admonished appellant that \u201c[i]f you\u2019re not back in this courtroom at 8:30 a.m. on Monday morning with a full report as to what your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>status is with Third Floor, if you\u2019re not back in this courtroom at 8:30, you\u2019re going to go to prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">On November 19, 1990, appellant, according to undisputed testimony, appeared 22 minutes late for her 8:30 a.m. court appearance. Judge Broad-man called her case at approximately 8:30 a.m. and the following colloquy took place between Judge Broadman and appellant\u2019s attorney as the court summarily revoked her probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u201cThe Court: What did we find out about Zaring? She\u2019s not here?</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u201cMr. Mueting [Appellant\u2019s counsel]: Well, it\u2019s two minutes after 8:30.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\u201cThe Court: She\u2019s going to prison. That\u2019s the end of the story with Mrs. Zaring.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">\u201cMr. Mueting: She may have a reason. She may be there. I don\u2019t know. They indicated\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-9\">\u201cThe Court: No, no, she\u2019s not supposed to be there. She\u2019s supposed to be here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-10\">\u201cMr. Mueting: I don\u2019t know where she is right now. When I talked to the Third Floor they indicated that at this present time that she would be moved up on the waiting list. She was on one waiting list and moved to another waiting list, and that position would be open in about a week or so. Maybe two weeks. They recommended that she wait in custody to go in. I don\u2019t know where she is right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-11\">\u201cThe Court: You have two ladies of yours that I\u2019m out looking for. Have you heard from the pregnant one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-12\">\u201cMr. Mueting: No, I haven\u2019t heard from her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-13\">\u201cMr. Gallian: Miss Zaring\u2014my file indicates she was released on the 15th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-14\">\u201cThe Court: She was released on the 15th, and she was ordered to be back here at 8:30.1 told her she ought to camp out here so she wouldn\u2019t be late.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-15\">\u201cMr. Gallian: My file indicates we were jumping up and down asking you not to, and you said, \u2018I\u2019m going to give her this chance. If she doesn\u2019t show, she\u2019s going to prison.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>\u201cMr. Mueting: She may be here late. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">\u201c(Whereupon, unrelated matters were taken up.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">When appellant appeared at approximately 8:52 a.m., the following exchange took place between Judge Broadman and appellant as Judge Broad-man remanded her into custody and set bail at $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\u201cThe Court: Miss Zaring, you\u2019re remanded to the custody of the Tulare County Sheriff and placed on for a violation of probation hearing on December the 3rd. Bail set in the amount of $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">\u201cThe Defendant: Your honor, I was just a little bit late. I had to take my kids to school before I came over here from Porterville.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">\u201cThe Court: What did I tell you? Goodbye. Don\u2019t look at me that way.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">\u201c(Whereupon, the proceedings were concluded.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">The matter was set for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">On November 21, 1990, appellant was arraigned on her violation of probation. Her violation of probation hearing was set for November 27, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-13\">On November 27, 1990, Judge Broadman, after hearing sworn testimony from appellant, found that she had willfully violated the terms of her probation by not appearing in court \u201con time\u201d on November 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-14\">On November 29, 1990, Judge Broadman terminated probation and sentenced appellant to state prison for 16 months on her possession of heroin conviction under Health and Safety Code section 11350, plus 1 year for the prior prison term enhancement, for a total of 2 years and 4 months. Appellant was credited with serving 167 days in actual custody plus 84 days of conduct credits for a total of 251 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-15\">On January 2, 1991, appellant filed her timely notice of appeal from the judgment and sentence imposed. This court designated that appeal as No. F015192.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-16\">On March, 25, 1991, this court ordered the appeals in Nos. F014606 and F015192 consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-17\">On March 27, 1991, Judge Broadman recalled the sentence pursuant to Penal Code section 1170, subdivision (d), resentenced appellant to serve two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>years for the drug possession conviction, and stayed the one year imposed for the prior prison term enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Appellant contends on appeal that: (1) her motion to suppress evidence was improperly denied; (2) the probation condition prohibiting pregnancy must be stricken; (3) the court deprived appellant of procedural due process when it revoked appellant\u2019s probation and committed her to state prison; (4) the court abused its discretion in sentencing appellant to state prison rather than reinstating probation; and (5) the court erred in sentencing appellant to two years on the possession charge after having previously sentenced her to 16 months on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\"><em>The Motion to </em>Suppress<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">\n<em>The Probation Condition Prohibiting Pregnancy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">When Judge Broadman placed appellant on probation on September 14, 1990, a condition of that probation was that appellant \u201cnot get pregnant during the term of her probation.\u201d At the September 14 hearing, Judge Broadman and appellant had the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">\u201cThe Court: You are also ordered not to get pregnant during the term as condition of your probation which is a term of five years. I\u2019ll reconsider that term and condition of probation if you prove that you have gotten through this drug program ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-12\">\u201cI want make <em>[sic] </em>to make it clear that one of the reasons I am making this order is you\u2019ve got five children. You\u2019re thirty years old. None of your children are in your custody or control. Two of them on AFDC. And I\u2019m afraid that if you get pregnant we\u2019re going to get a cocaine or heroin addicted baby.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-13\">\u201cSo come in and report to the Court on the first day of November. Make sure that you comply with the terms and conditions. If you get pregnant, I\u2019m <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>going to send you to prison in large part because I want to protect the un-bom child. But more importantly\u2014that\u2019s the most important reason, but second of all, because you have violated a term and condition of your probation. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">\u201c[Appellant]: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Appellant now contends that the condition that she not get pregnant during the term of her probation is unlawful and must be stricken. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Respondent does not challenge appellant\u2019s right to contest the condition on this appeal, even though appellant agreed to the condition in the superior court. It has been held that a defendant may challenge, on appeal, a condition of probation. \u201cIf . . . the defendant accepts probation, he may seek relief from the restraint of any alleged invalid condition of probation on appeal from the order granting probation . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Bushman </em>(1970) 1 Cal. 3d 767, 776 [83 Cal.Rptr. 375, 463 P.2d 727], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lent </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 481, 486, fn. 1 [124 Cal.Rptr. 905, 541 P.2d 545]. See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Kiddoo </em>(1990) 225 Cal.App.3d 922 [275 Cal.Rptr. 298], at p. 927, and this court\u2019s opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1374, 1377 [277 Cal.Rptr. 444].)</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Penal Code section 1203.1 states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-9\">\u201cThe court ... in the order granting probation, may suspend the imposing, or the execution, of the sentence . . . upon those terms and conditions as it shall determine ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">\u201cThe court may impose and require any . . . <em>reasonable </em>conditions, as it may determine are fitting and proper to the end that justice may be done, that amends may be made to society for the breach of the law, for any injury done to any person resulting from that breach, and generally and specifically for the reformation and rehabilitation of the probationer, . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Dominguez </em>(1967) 256 Cal.App.2d 623 [64 Cal.Rptr. 290], the court addressed a probation condition of no pregnancy where the crime was robbery. In striking the condition, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-12\">\u201cA condition of probation which (1) has no relationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted, (2) relates to conduct which is not in itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>criminal, and (3) requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future criminality does not serve the statutory ends of probation and is invalid.\u201d (256 Cal.App.2d at p. 627.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The California Supreme Court adopted the <em>Dominguez </em>test in <em>Lent, supra, </em>where the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">\u201cThe Legislature has placed in trial judges a broad discretion in the sentencing process, including the determination as to whether probation is appropriate and, if so, the conditions thereof. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1203 et seq.) A condition of probation will not be held invalid unless it \u2018(1) has no relationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted, (2) relates to conduct which is not in itself criminal, and (3) requires or forbids conduct which is not reasonably related to future criminality . . . .\u201d [Citations.] Conversely, a condition of probation which requires or forbids conduct which is not itself criminal is valid if that conduct is reasonably related to the crime of which the defendant was convicted or to future criminality.\u201d (15 Cal.3d at p. 486, fn. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">But even in those instances in which a condition of probation satisfies the <em>Dominguez!Lent </em>test, \u201cwhere a condition of probation impinges upon the exercise of a fundamental right and is challenged on constitutional grounds we must additionally determine whether the condition is impermissibly overbroad.\" <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pointer </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 1128, 1139 [199 Cal.Rptr. 357], fn. omitted.) In <em>Pointer </em>a woman was convicted of child endangerment after she placed her two young children on a \u201crigorously disciplined macrobiotic diet\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1131, fn. omitted) which resulted in one of the children becoming \u201cseriously underdeveloped\u201d and the other suffering \u201csevere growth retardation and permanent neurological damage.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1133.) She was placed on probation, and as a condition of probation she was \u201cprohibited from conceiving a child.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1131.) In <em>Pointer, </em>as in the case presently before us, \u201c[t]he challenged condition was apparently not intended to serve any rehabilitative purpose but rather to protect the public by preventing injury to an unborn child.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1140.) The <em>Pointer </em>court, after concluding that the conception prohibition was reasonably related to the woman\u2019s child endangerment offense, then turned to the question of whether the conception prohibition was impermissibly overbroad, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">\u201cThere is, of course, no question that the condition imposed in this case infringes the exercise of a fundamental right to privacy protected by both the federal and state constitutions. [Citations.] Nor is there any question that for this reason the condition must be subjected to special scrutiny to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>whether the restriction is entirely necessary to serve the dual purposes of rehabilitation and public safety. [Citations.] \u2018 \u201cWhere a condition of probation requires a waiver of precious constitutional rights, the condition must be narrowly drawn; to the extent it is overbroad it is <em>not </em>reasonably related to the compelling state interest in reformation and rehabilitation and is an unconstitutional restriction on the exercise of fundamental constitutional rights.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citations.] \u2018If available alternative means exist which are less violative of a constitutional right and are narrowly drawn so as to correlate more closely with the purpose contemplated, those alternatives should be used [citations].\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (151 Cal.App.3d at p. 1139, fn. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The <em>Pointer </em>court concluded that the prohibition against conception was impermissibly overbroad. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\u201cWe believe this salutary purpose can adequately be served by alternative restrictions less subversive of appellant\u2019s fundamental right to procreate. Such less onerous conditions might include, for example, the requirement that appellant periodically submit to pregnancy testing; and that upon becoming pregnant she be required to follow an intensive prenatal and neonatal treatment program monitored by both the probation officer and by a supervising physician. If appellant bears a child during the period of probation it can be removed from her custody and placed in foster care, as was done with appellant\u2019s existing children, if the court then considers such action necessary to protect the infant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">\u201cWe conclude that the condition of probation prohibiting conception is overbroad, as less restrictive alternatives are available that would feasibly provide the protections the trial court properly believed necessary.\u201d (151 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1140-1141.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">In the present case, appellant and respondent disagree on whether the no pregnancy condition has a \u201crelationship to the crime of which the offender was convicted\u201d and thus satisfies the <em>Dominguez/Lent </em>test. Respondent contends that it does. Appellant, pointing out that the crimes which she committed did not endanger any child, and that there was no evidence before the court that any of her five children had been born addicted or born with any other ailment attributable to possession or use of drugs by appellant, contends that it does not. We need not decide this particular question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>however, because in this case, just as in <em>Pointer, </em>the no pregnancy condition is improper because it is impermissibly overbroad.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">In <em>Pointer, </em>the defendant was convicted of child endangerment because of her macrobiotic diet and her use of that diet with her children. In other words, her nutritional habits endangered her children as well as any unborn child. In the instant case, the crime of possession of heroin in and of itself does not appear to have any relationship to children bom or unborn. The crime was not against a child, it did not endanger a child, and precluding pregnancy has no readily perceivable effect on rehabilitation as that concept is interpreted in the law. It is now widely believed that a pregnant woman can expose a fetus to danger by ingesting certain drugs during pregnancy, and we think that such an endangerment would be deplorable, but we are constrained by our oath to refrain from imposing our personal views on people brought before the bench.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is the law which must guide our actions and not our preferences or inclinations. Recognizing that drug addiction could have an adverse impact on the unborn, we must conclude under the law that even if we were to assume arguendo that the safeguarding of the health of any yet to be conceived unborn child of appellant may properly be the subject of probation conditions, it is clear to us that other conditions, less drastic than an outright ban on pregnancy, could be used here to accomplish this objective, just as they could have been used in <em>Pointer. </em>We also note that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>other jurisdictions faced with the issue of whether a ban on pregnancy is a valid condition of probation have found the condition to be unlawful. (See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mosburg </em>(1989) 13 Kan.App.2d 257 [768 P.2d 313] and <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla.Dist.Ct.App. 1979) 378 So.2d 7. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Livingston </em>(1976) 53 Ohio App.2d 195 [7 Ohio Ops.3d 258, 372 N.E.2d 1335, 94 A.L.R.3d 1213] [condition that \u201cthe defendant not have another child during the five year probationary period\u201d is \u201cvoid and of no effect\u201d]).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">It is important to bear in mind that in imposing a condition of probation the consequences of a violation cannot be ignored. As the court in <em>Pointer </em>noted, there is a highly troubling aspect to a condition imposing a preclusion upon conception. Judge Broadman here stated \u201cif you get pregnant, I\u2019m going to send you to prison. . . .\u201d This is the same comment made by the judge in the <em>Pointer </em>case, although there the reviewing court noted that since the crime itself was child endangerment, the condition bore some relationship to the charge. In <em>Pointer </em>the reviewing court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">\u201cThis stern admonition doubtless made it apparent to appellant that in the event she became pregnant during the period of probation the surreptitious procuring of an abortion might be the only practical way to avoid going to prison. A condition of probation that might place a defendant in this position, and, if so, be coercive of abortion, is in our view improper.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pointer, supra, </em>151 Cal.App. 3d at pp. 1140-1141.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">We therefore conclude that whether or not the pregnancy condition imposed in this case might arguably bear upon the rehabilitative purposes of probation, the restriction imposed here is overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">There are other disturbing aspects of this case upon which we should comment. Specifically, we note the apparent imposition of personal social values in the sentencing decision. Some of the comments made by Judge Broadman in the instant case are remarkably comparable to comments made by the trial judge in <em>Dominguez. </em>In that case, the appellant was 20 years old, unmarried, pregnant, and had 2 small children. She had been on public assistance since her first pregnancy. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-9\">\u201c \u2018[Y]ou are not to live with any man to whom you are not married and you are not to become pregnant until after you become married. Now this will develop by just becoming pregnant. You are going to prison unless you are married first. You have already too many of those. Do you understand that [szc] I am saying?\u2019 The appellant replied affirmatively. The court then stated, \u2018Do you know where the Planned Parenthood Clinic is?\u2019 The defendant said she did not. The court said, \u2018If you insist on this kind of conduct you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>can at least consider the other people in society who are taking care of your children. You\u2019ve had too many that some others are taking care of other than you and the father. \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v <em>Dominguez, supra, </em>256 Cal.App.2d at p. 625.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">At the time of the violation of probation when the appellant became pregnant, the court stated to her attorney, \u201c \u2018[s]tart mentioning the responsibility or lack of it insofar as supporting the children she now has and the ability to support the one she is having. . . . She is abandoning that responsibility to somebody else. . . The court added, \u201c \u2018[i]t appears to me this woman is irresponsible; she is foisting obligations upon others, and one of the objectives of probation is to teach and encourage responsibility in all phases including the economics of life and being able to support the dependents who will naturally flow from this conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Dominguez, supra, </em>256 Cal.App.2d at p. 626.)</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Judge Broadman in the instant case stated in making his condition precluding pregnancy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">\u201cI want make [sic] to make it clear that one of the reasons I am making this order is you\u2019ve got five children. You\u2019re 30 years old. None of your children are in your custody or control. Two of them on AFDC. And I\u2019m afraid that if you get pregnant we\u2019re going to get a cocaine or heroin addicted baby.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">While he is often the center of controversy, the following comment of former Justice Robert Bork in a speech to the American Enterprise Institute well states our role as judges in the often difficult and trying task of rising above our personal views to render impartial judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">\u201cIn a constitutional democracy, the moral content of law must be given by the morality of the framer or the legislator, never by the morality of the judge. The sole task of the latter\u2014and it is a task quite large enough for anyone\u2019s wisdom, skill and virtue\u2014is to translate the framer\u2019s or the legislator\u2019s morality into a rule to govern unforeseen circumstances. That abstinence from giving his own desires free play, that continuing and self-conscious renunciation of power, that is the morality of the jurist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">In our view, the morality of having children while on public assistance, and the imposing of any constitutionally permissible legal deterrences to such a practice, are matters properly left to the wisdom and judgment of the legislature elected by the people, and not to the morality of individual judges. The comments by the trial court imply consideration of inappropriate factors in the sentencing process under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>Because in this case appellant has already served the prison term to which she was sentenced on March 27, 1991, and indeed had completed the serving of that prison term by the time her reply brief was filed in this court, we need not and do not address the question of whether the judge could properly have imposed, in this case, any condition of probation having to do with the monitoring of any possible future pregnancy of appellant. We do conclude, however, that under the facts of this case a ban on conception was illegal under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\n<em>The Revocation of Appellant\u2019s Probation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Appellant contends that Judge Broadman erred in concluding she was in violation of her probation and sentencing her to state prison based upon her appearance in court 22 minutes late. Appellant\u2019s contention is predicated on five separate arguments, namely that: (1) appearance at 8:30 on November 19, 1990, was not in fact a condition of her probation at all, but was merely a separate court order; (2) her probation violation hearing was not conducted before a neutral and detached hearing officer; (3) there was insufficient evidence that appellant willfully failed to appear at 8:30 a.m. on November 19, even if such an appearance was a required condition of probation; (4) Judge Broadman violated appellant\u2019s due process rights when he revoked her probation without having first given her written notice of the claimed violation of probation; (5) even if there was a probation violation, Judge Broadman abused his discretion in sentencing appellant to state prison rather than reinstating probation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">For reasons we detail, <em>post, </em>we have concluded that appellant\u2019s contentions are best resolved by deciding whether or not appellant\u2019s failure to appear at 8:30 on November 19, even if such an appearance was a condition of her probation, was conduct which would support Judge Broadman\u2019s commitment of appellant to state prison. On the facts of this case we conclude that there was no willful violation of what we will assume was a condition of probation, and that in finding such a violation Judge Broadman abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">At the time appellant was released to attempt to enter a drug treatment program, Judge Broadman stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\u201cI\u2019m going to, over the District Attorney\u2019s objection, I\u2019m going to order you released. If you\u2019re not back in this courtroom at 8:30 on Monday morning with a full report as to what your status is with the Third Floor [a drug treatment program], if you\u2019re not back in this courtroom at 8:30, you\u2019re going to go to prison. I\u2019m modifying the terms and conditions of probation to release you now. If you\u2019re not back in this courtroom at 8:30 and if your car\u2014you might want to camp out here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\">\u201cThe Defendant: I\u2019ll walk if I have to. I\u2019ll be here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">\u201cThe Court: You\u2019ll be here at 8:30.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes. What\u2019s the date on Monday, the 19th.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">At her probation violation hearing, appellant unsuccessfully objected to the lack of written notice of the alleged violation (see <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 471, 488-489 [33 L.Ed.2d 484,498-499, 92 S.Ct. 2593] and <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 778, 782 [36 L.Ed.2d 656, 661-662, 93 S.Ct. 1756]), and unsuccessfully contended that appearance at 8:30 a.m. on November 19 was not in fact a condition of probation. And to provide an explanation for her tardiness, appellant gave the following sworn testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">\u201cQ Miss. Zaring, can you explain how it is that you were late to court on that particular day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">\u201cA First of all, when I was released I did comply with all of the court orders that I was supposed to do. I made my appointments at Third Floor. I was supposed to be there at 11:00 o\u2019clock Monday morning after I left here from court. I had\u2014I didn\u2019t use any kind of drugs. I did everything I was supposed to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">\u201cOn Sunday night my mother-in-law had her mother come over to babysit the kids for us the next morning so that she could bring me to court. And I thought that I had a ride to court for sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">\u201cThe next morning she wasn\u2019t feeling well, so my mother-in-law didn\u2019t want to leave the kids with her. So she had to wait until she took them to school before she could bring me, and they couldn\u2019t be in school until 8:00. And I was here at eight minutes before 9:00. Still but there was\u2014there was no other way that I could come unless I hitchhiked or walked. And I would have been much later then. But this is the first time that I\u2019ve ever made any progress at all trying to do things right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-12\">Neither Judge Broadman nor the People had any questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>After further discussion as to whether or not the conduct was a violation of probation, Judge Broadman stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">\u201cIn this matter it appears to me that you violated your probation either in one or two or both instances. Number one, it was either implicit or explicit by the reading\u2014by releasing you at that time that you were to be in court on time, and that was a condition of your probation. However, even if you didn\u2019t interpret that to be a condition of your probation, it\u2019s clear that you were to obey all laws. It\u2019s also clear that my order was a valid order. And that you violated that order. And you violated that order willfully. And, therefore, I find that you are in violation of your probation.\u201d The court then set the matter for sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">At the time of sentencing on November 29, 1990, Judge Broadman expressed what we interpret as the court\u2019s conclusion as to the underlying facts supporting its probation revocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">\u201cMiss Zaring I gave a break to, substantial break. And I thought that she\u2014I believed her in the sense that she was finally going to get her life together. I think the People, the lawyer for the People even thought she was going to get her life together.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">\u201cAnd I gave her a break and said even though I was supposed to find unusual circumstances, extraordinary, or whatever those words are, to give her probation, and I found those in this case because we all kind of had a glow of hope for Miss Zaring to get off the drug, prostitution, petty theft strain of her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\u201cBut Miss Zaring in my viewpoint had never learned act for consequence. And so I told Miss Zaring in a long speech that she had to be here at 8:30, and the most important thing in her life was to be here at 8:30, and if she wasn\u2019t here at 8:30 she was going to go to prison. And I told her she should camp out here if she thought she was going to be late. Then she said, \u2018Yes, I will. I understand. I\u2019ll be here.\u2019 Then she came in and she said, well, she took her children to school.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">\u201cUnderstand I let her out early, so had she not been there I don\u2019t know how the children would have gotten to school or if they would have gotten to school. She chose to take her children to school and willfully violated that directive and agreement that we had. And so I found her in violation of her probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">Thus we conclude that Judge Broadman accepted appellant\u2019s statement as to why she was late and found that despite her explanation her conduct constituted a willful violation of her probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Penal Code section 1203.2, subdivision (a) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">\u201c. . . [T]he court may revoke and terminate such probation if the interests of justice so require and the court, in its judgment, has reason to believe from the report of the probation officer or otherwise that the person has violated any of the conditions of his or her probation, has become abandoned to improper associates or a vicious life, or has subsequently committed other offenses, regardless whether he or she has been prosecuted for such offens-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Buford </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 975 [117 Cal.Rptr. 333], the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">\u201cRevocation rests in the sound discretion of the court. Although that discretion is very broad, the court may not act arbitrarily or capriciously; its determination must be based upon the facts before it.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Buford, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d at p. 985.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">We have determined that the appropriate way to address this issue is to accept appellant\u2019s explanation of her conduct as true as Judge Broadman apparently also did and assume that the court-ordered appearance at 8:30 was, for the sake of argument, a condition of probation. Operating under the foregoing assumption, we conclude that Judge Broadman abused his discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u201c \u2018Judicial discretion is that power of decision exercised to the necessary end of awarding justice based upon reason and law but for which decision there is no special governing statute or rule. Discretion implies that in the absence of positive law or fixed rule the judge is to decide a question by his view of expediency or the demand of equity and justice. [Citation.] The term implies absence of arbitrary determination, capricious disposition or whimsical thinking. It imports the exercise of discriminating judgment within the bounds of reason.\u2019 [Citations.] A decision will not be reversed merely because reasonable people might disagree. \u2018An appellate tribunal is neither authorized nor warranted in substituting its judgment for the judgment of the trial judge.\u2019 [Citations.] In the absence of a clear showing that its decision was arbitrary or irrational, a trial court should be presumed to have acted to achieve legitimate objectives and, accordingly, its discretionary determinations ought not be set aside on review. [Citations.] \u2018Further, to be entitled to relief on appeal from an alleged abuse of discretion, it must clearly appear the resulting injury is sufficiently grave to manifest a miscarriage of justice. [Citation.]\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Preyer </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 568, 573-574 [210 Cal.Rptr. 807].)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Certainly, it cannot reasonably be concluded that Judge Broadman expected the appellant to \u201ccamp\u201d outside the courtroom until 8:30 in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>morning. Neither can it reasonably be concluded that had appellant had an accident or mechanical failure of her vehicle that such conduct would not be excusable.  In other words, the discretion that the trial court is empowered to use is predicated upon reason and law but is primarily directed to the necessary end of justice. As judges, such discretion requires the application of sound judgment that takes into consideration that life is not always predictable and that things do not always go according to plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">All these factors together are part of the trial judge\u2019s weighing process\u2014 with a balanced fair judgment the desired result.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The evidence presented by the appellant is uncontroverted. We therefore conclude that the appellant was confronted with a last minute unforeseen circumstance as well as a parental responsibility common to virtually every family. Nothing in the record supports the conclusion that her conduct was the result of irresponsibility, contumacious behavior or disrespect for the orders and expectations of the court. However, as a result of last minute circumstances, the appellant was approximately 22 minutes late to court, having driven some 35 miles from her home to the courtroom.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Collectively, we cannot in good conscience find the evidence supports the conclusion that the conduct of appellant, even assuming the order was a probationary condition, constituted a willful violation of that condition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Judge Broad-man\u2019s action in revoking appellant\u2019s probation under the circumstances presented herein and for the reasons stated by Judge Broadman are an arbitrary and capricious use of the court\u2019s power and constituted an abuse of discretion. As a consequence of that action appellant was committed to the Department of Corrections for two years. For the reasons stated, the order revoking probation was erroneous. In light of our resolution of this issue, we need not address appellant\u2019s remaining contentions regarding her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Appellant\u2019s conviction is affirmed. The sentence is reversed. We remand the case to the superior court for resentencing in accordance with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">Best, P. J., and Stone (W. A.), J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-14\"> See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 362.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-5\"> We note that in <em>Dominguez, supra, </em>the crime of which the accused was convicted was robbery. The court found the no pregnancy condition to have no relationship to the crime of robbery and no reasonable relationship to future criminality. The court stated: \u201cAppellant\u2019s future pregnancy was unrelated to robbery. Becoming pregnant while unmarried is a misfortune, not a crime. Appellant\u2019s future pregnancy had no reasonable relationship to future criminality. It is certainly not pragmatically demonstrable that unmarried, pregnant women are disposed to commit crimes. There is no rational basis to believe that poor, unmarried women tend to commit crimes upon becoming pregnant.

Respondent has quoted the Chief Justice\u2019s \u201cpublic comments\u201d in its brief and has provided the court with copies of the Petitti et al. and Hadeed et al. articles.

Because we hold in this case that the no pregnancy condition is unlawful regardless of whether it does or does not have a relationship to appellant\u2019s crime, and because we need not and do not decide the question of whether the condition has a relationship to appellant\u2019s crime, these four items would not aid us in reaching our decision, even if we were to take judicial notice of them.
