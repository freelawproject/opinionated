As a result of the failure to appear, a warrant is issued pursuant to Vehicle Code section 40515,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a new charge of failure to appear, in violation of Vehicle Code section 40508, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is appended to the underlying traffic charge. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 283, 285 [68 Cal.Rptr. 629].) In this case we hold that because Vehicle Code section 40508, subdivision (a), is a misdemeanor and not an infraction, the traffic defendant is entitled to a jury trial on the failure to appear charge, and the failure to advise the defendant of the right to a jury trial and obtain a waiver thereof constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 3\">*Supp. 3</page-number>Defendant Stephen E. Foster (hereinafter appellant) was cited for failing to stop at a red light, in violation of Vehicle Code section 21453.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant signed a written promise to appear on December 12, 1999. When appellant did not appear on December 12 1999, a second allegation was added, charging a failure to appear, in violation of Vehicle Code section 40508, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">Appellant did appear in court on February 8, 2000, at which time he was arraigned on the failure to appear and failure to stop for a red light charges. The minute order for the arraignment indicates appellant was advised of the rights applicable to an infraction, which do not include the right to a jury trial. On the day of the trial, the citing officer failed to appear, and the failure to stop at the red light charge was dismissed. The trial court, without taking a waiver of the right to a jury trial, found appellant guilty of the failure to appear, and imposed a fine of $100 plus the penalty assessment. This appeal is from the judgment on the charge of violating Vehicle Code section 40508, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">Appellant raises multiple issues on appeal, including that he was not advised of, and did not waive, his right to a jury trial on the misdemeanor charge of failure to appear. Because this contention is dispositive, we need not discuss the remaining issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">The Legislature has specifically declared that a violation of Vehicle Code section 40508, subdivision (a), constitutes a misdemeanor and not an infraction. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 40000.25.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A defendant charged with a misdemeanor has the right to a trial by jury. (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16; <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 288, 298 [110 Cal.Rptr. 329, 515 P.2d 273].) Where a defendant is charged with an offense other than an infraction, a jury trial must be held unless the defendant is advised of, and affirmatively waives, the right to trial by jury. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ernst </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 441, 446-448 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 238, 881 P.2d 298].) The record must clearly and affirmatively show the defendant personally waived the right to a trial by jury; a waiver will not be implied from silence or conduct. <em>(People v. Ernst, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 448; <em>People </em>v. <em>Holmes </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 442, 444 [5 Cal.Rptr. 871, 353 P.2d 583].) The failure to obtain a proper jury trial waiver constitutes a structural defect requiring reversal of the conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ernst, supra, </em>at p. 449.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 4\">*Supp. 4</page-number>The record establishes the trial court did not advise appellant of his right to a jury trial, and failed to obtain a proper jury waiver from appellant. The trial court\u2019s error in conducting a court trial without obtaining a proper jury waiver constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Beverly, P.
