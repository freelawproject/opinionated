There was also evidence tending to-show that the prisoner, by threats of violence or otherwise, forced her to swallow the poison, or forced it down her throat. The evidence likewise tended to show, that there was a mutual agreement between Mary Jane and the pris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>oner, that each should commit suicide by taking such poison, and that said Mary Jane, in pursuance of said agreement, either in the presence of the prisoner, and at the time the agreement was so made and the poison so furnished, or afterward and in the absence of the prisoner, took the poison and thereby caused her death. Some of the evidence so given consisted of statements made by the prisoner himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-5\">One ground of defense insisted upon at the trial was, that at the time of the commission of the alleged homicide the prisoner was insane; and evidence was given tending to establish that defense.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-6\">For the purpose of showing that the deceased had committed suicide of her own accord, and without participation by him, the prisoner called a witness with whom the deceased had resided some six years prior to her death, and offered to prove by the witness that the deceased, while living with the witness, was of a melancholy disposition of mind, and was predisposed to, and had threatened to commit suicide. But the court rejected the evidence so offered, :and the prisoner excepted to the order rejecting it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-7\">At the close of the evidence, the counsel for the prisoner asked the court to instruct the jury, among other things, that they had no right to reject or disregard the exculpatory parts of the prisoner\u2019s statements which had been given in evidence, unless there was some other evidence showing them to be false, or unless they were so unreasonable or absurd as to be, in the opinion of the jury, unworthy of credence. This instruction the court refused, and, instead thereof, instructed the jury, in substance, that the exculpatory parts of such statements, as well as those which import guilt, are to be received as evidence; and it is the province of the jury, in the light of all the evidence in the case, to decide upon the truth or falsehood of such \u2022exculpatory parts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-8\">The counsel for the prisoner also asked the court to instruct the jury as follows: \u201cMere extrajudicial confessions .alone can not be used to prove the body of a crime, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>also to identify the prisoner. They can not alone be received to prove the body of the crime at all.\u201d This' instruction the court refused, and, instead thereof, instructed the jury as follows : \"Mere extrajudicial confessions alone can not- be used to prove the body of the crime, and also to identify the prisoner.

To be still more specific, I would say that, to justify a verdict against the defendant, the evidence should establish that the defendant administered to the deceased the poison of which she died, if-she died of poison. It is not necessary, however, that the defendant should stand by and deliver it to her at the time she took it in her mouth and swallowed it. It is not necessary that she should have received it from his hand. If he delivered the poison to her for the purpose of being by her swallowed into her body ; or if he provided it for her where she could receive it, and so informed her; and if it was so provided and placed for the purpose of being by her swallowed into her body, and in pursuance of that she took it from the place where he so deposited it, and in either case swallowed it into her body; or if, by way of persuasion or agreement jointly to commit suicide or destroy their own lives, the defendant induced or persuaded the deceased to swallow the strychnia, with the intent on his part to destroy her life, he being present at the time of the transaction, and she, influenced by such persuasion or agreement, swallowed the same, knowing it to be a deadly poison, and intending thereby, by virtue of such agreement, to destroy her own life; or if by force in any manner he compelled her to swallow down the poison ; then, in either case, the facts stated would constitute an administering of poison within the meaning of the statute. But it is not enough that strychnia poison should have been administered \u2014 that is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>taken into the body; it should also have been unlawfully administered, and with the intent to kill the deceased.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">As to the defense of insanity, the court instructed the jury that the questions for them to decide were these: \u201cWas the defendant a free agent in forming the purpose to kill Mary Jane Lovell? Was he, at the time the act was committed, capable of judging whether <em>that act </em>was right or wrong? And did he at the time know it was an offense against the laws of God and man ? \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">As to the nature and effect of circumstantial evidence, the court said to the jury, among other things, that \u201c in no case ought the force of circumstantial evidence, where it is adequate to conviction, to be inferior to that which is derived from the testimony of a single witness.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-7\">To all which instructions, and refusals to instruct, the prisoner\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-8\">The prisoner\u2019s counsel then asked the court to reduce the whole of its charge to writing, and to read the same to the jury before the commencement of the arguments of counsel. This the court declined to do, stating that the charge would be given to the jury in writing after the conclusion of the arguments, which was subsequently done accordingly.

The state then produced and read the affidavit of the juror himself, who testified that he never had expressed or formed any opinion as to the guilt or iunocence of the prisoner previous to the trial; and the court thereupon overruled the motion for a new trial, and the counsel for the prisoner excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-10\">It is assigned for error, that the court refused the instructions asked; that it misdirected the jury in the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>ticulars excepted to, and in other particulars which, need not be specified; that a new trial was refused, and that the court rejected the evidence as to the predisposition of the deceased to suicide.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-5\"><em>J.

When, in a criminal prosecution, the state puts in evidence a statement made by the accused, claimed to be in the nature .of a confession, the jury have no right <em>arbitrarily </em>to discredit the exculpatory parts of such statement, if any such parts there be, unless there is some other evidence in the case showing them to be false, or unless they are so unreasonable and absurd in themselves as, in the opinion of the jury, to be unworthy of credence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-7\">II.

In Ohio, suicide is not a crime, never having been defined and declared such by the legislature of the state; .and there can not be a criminal accessory, nor a criminal principal in the second degree, to an act which is not itself a crime. Therefore, the mere inducing of another, by advice or persuasion merely, purposely to kill himself, is not punishable in Ohio, even though the inducer be present at the time of the self-killing by the other, such inducing never having been defined and declared a crime by the legislature; though, should one directly participate and assist in the doing of the physical act whereby another kills himself, the first might be guilty of criminal homicide, while the other would be a suicide.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-9\">If two agree that they will each commit suicide, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>agreement of each being the inducement to the other to do the suicidal act, and one of them, in pursuance of the agreement, does the suicidal act, and dies, the other, from some cause, not attempting to kill himself, or, attempting to do-so, failing to take his own life, the survivor, for the reasons already given, even though present at the commission of the suicidal act by the other, is not guilty of any crime or offense known to the laws of Ohio.

The refusal of the court to give the subjoined charge, without the addition, at the end, of the words, \u201cuninfluenced by another,\u201d was error, because the jury may have understood the court that if the accused had, by <em>mere words </em>or by <em>letter, </em>in the slightest degree influenced? the deceased to kill herself, he was guilty of murder, even though he was not present at the time of the doing of the-suicidal act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b162-7\">\u201c It is a rule, in criminal cases, that the coincidence of circumstances tending to indicate guilt, however strong and numerous they may be, avails nothing unless the <em>corpus delicti, </em>the fact that the crime has been actually perpetrated, be first established. The same principle requires that upon a charge of homicide, even where the body has been found, and though indications of a violent death, or death by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>poison, be manifest, that it shall still be fully and satisfactorily proved that the death was neither occasioned by natural causes, by accident, nor by the act of the deceased himself.\u201d See Peck, J., in <em>Truman </em>v. <em>Lore, </em>14 Ohio St. 144, 154; and in <em>Breese </em>v. <em>The State, </em>12 Ohio St. 146, 155; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Stetson, </em>Ib. 89; <em>Bain </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>10 Ohio St. 14.

Extrajudicial confessions are insufficient for the conviction of a defendant charged with a capital crime, unless-the <em>corpus delicti </em>be proved by evidence other than, and independent of, the confessions; and it is error for a court to charge, in such a case, that extrajudicial confessions \u201c may be taken <em>in connection with </em>other evidence in the case,, either positive or circumstantial, in making out what is-termed the <em>corpus </em>delicti.\u201d See Waterman\u2019s Note to 1 Archb.

It is error to instruct a jury that, \u201cin no case ought the force of circumstantial evidence, where it is adequate to conviction, to be inferior to that which is derived from the testimony of a single witness.\u201d So to instruct is to give the jury an incorrect test of the sufficiency, for couviction, of circumstantial evidence. <em>Cicely, a </em>slave, v. <em>Mississippi, </em>13 Smedes &amp; Marshall, 210.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-7\">IX. It is error, in charging a jury in a criminal case, to instruct them that <em>corpus delicti </em>is <em>the offense committed as charged. </em>Such a definition of the term is likely to mislead the jury, confounding, as it does, the <em>body of the crime </em>with <em>the commission of it </em>and with <em>the identification of the perpetrator. </em>See <em>Barney </em>v. <em>Dimmitt\u2019s Adm\u2019r, </em>Wright, 44; S. &amp; C. 1021-1023; S. &amp; S. 553, 554; Criminal Code, sec. 266.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b164-8\">X.

On the trial of a person charged with murder or manslaughter, where, on the testimony, the question is, whether the deceased committed suicide, or was killed by the accused, evidence tending to prove that the deceased had been predisposed to suicide, and had threatened to commit it, is competent; and it is error to exclude such evidence, even though it does not affirmatively show the existence of such a state of mind, or the making of such threats, to have been later than six years before the death of the deceased.

See 1 Whart. Amer. Crim. Law, sec. 122, and the other authorities <em>supra </em>in support of the fifth count of the indictment. Our statute does not change this rule of the common law, because there is no difference between murder at common-law and murder under our statute, so far as concerns this-question.

See authorities cited in <em>supra </em>to sustain the fifth count of the indictment. Again, this charge was <em>not, </em>as a whole, sound in law. And where a charge is asked, it must betaken as a whole, in determining whether the court erred in refusing it. The question on error, for refusal to charge, is whether the whole charge asked was law. <em>Inglebright </em>v. <em>Hammond, </em>19 Ohio, 337; <em>French </em>v. <em>Millard, </em>2 Ohio St. 44; <em>Blaney &amp; Morgan </em>v. <em>Hoke, </em>14 Ohio St. 295; <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Devlin, 2 </em>Ohio St. 606.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-9\">The words \u201c uninfluenced by another,\u201d added by the' court to the fifth charge asked by the prisoner, present the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>same question raised by the second and third charges requested, and the same authorities will apply.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-5\">The part of the charge of the court which relates to the question of insanity, is strictly according to the law as-it has been repeatedly laid down by this court. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>State, </em>12 Ohio, 494; <em>Farrer </em>v. <em>State, </em>2 Ohio St. 76; <em>Loeffner </em>v. <em>State, </em>10 Ohio St. 615; 2 Greenl. on Ev., sec. 372; <em>Com. </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>7 Met. 500.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b169-6\">V. There is no error in that part of the general charge-of the court, which is objected to on the ground that it took from the jury the decision of certain facts in the case. The court has the right, in its charge, to comment upon the evidence in the case. <em>Abram </em>v. <em>Will, </em>6 Ohio, 164. And such comments are not a subject of exception. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Barden, </em>34 N. Y. 437; <em>Nolton </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>3 Barb. 31. Nor is it error for the court, in charging the jury, to recapitulate the evidence in.the case. <em>Mimms </em>v. <em>State, </em>16 Ohio St. 221, see also the charge of Chief Justice Shaw, to-the jury, in the <em>Webster case, </em>5 Cush. 363.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AA4s\">VI.

The ruling of the Common Pleas, in refusing a new trial upon the ground that \u201c Dunnock had formed and expressed an opinion as to the guilt of the accused prior to his being impaneled as a juror,\u201d and subsequent to the finding of the indictment, was correct.

The instructions given differ but a shade from those that were asked, the only difference being that those which were asked seem to deny to the jury the \u201c right\u201d to judge for themselves, and in their own way, of the truth or falsehood of the exculpatory parts of the prisoner\u2019s statements. We think the court rightly stated the rule of law, namely, that the whole statement is to be received as evidence, and that it is the province of the' jury, in the light of all the evidence in the case, to decide upon the truth or falsehood of the exculpatory parts of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Nor do we think the court erred in its instructions as to what constitutes the administering of poison, within the meaning of the first section of the crimes act.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">To force poison down one\u2019s throat, or to' compel him by \u2022throats of violence to swallow, it, is an administering of poison. Neither deception nor breach of confidence is a necessary ingredient in the act. It matters not whether the poison be put into the hand, or into the stomach of the party whose life is to bes destroyed by it. If the poison reaches the stomach or body of the deceased, and does its work of death there, it is immaterial whether force or fraud was the means by which the guilty agent, effected his object. In either case it is an administering of poison, within the meaning of the act. We think counsel are wrong in assuming that the word <em>administer </em>always and necessarily implies \u201c service.\u201d If it does, it often implies \u201c service \u201d to a very unwilling master. Such is the case when the law is administered to a <em>criminal. </em>The word minister \u201d is said to be derived from the same root as the Latin word manus, the hand. Etymologically, therefore, the word \u201c administer\u201d would seem applicable to anything that could be done by the hand, <em>to </em>or <em>for </em>another. We think also that the court was right in instructing the jury, as in substance and effect it did, that it \u00cd3 immaterial whether the party taking the poison took it willingly, intending thereby <em>to </em>commit suicide, or was overcome by, force, or overreached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>by fraud. True, the atrocity of the crime, in a moral sense, would be greatly diminished by the fact that suicide was intended; yet the law, as we understand it, makes no discrimination on that account. The lives of all are equally under the protection of the law, and under that protection to their last moment. The life of those to whom life has become a burden \u2014 of those who are hopelessly diseased or fatally wounded \u2014 nay, even the lives of criminals condemned to death, are under the protection of the law, equally as the lives of those who are in the full tide of life\u2019s enjoyment, and anxious to continue to live. If discriminations are to be made in such cases as to the amount of punishment due to offenders, they must be made by the exercise of executive clemency or legislative provision. Purposely and maliciously to kill a human being, by administering to him or her poison, is declared by the law to be murder, irrespective of the wishes or the condition of the party to whom the poison is administered, or the manner in which, or the means by which, it is administered. The fact that the guilty party intends also to take his own life, and that the administration of the poison is in pursuance of an agreement that both will commit suicide, does not, in a legal sense, vary the case. If the prisoner furnished the poison to the deceased for the purpose and with the intent that she should with it commit suicide, and she accordingly took and used it for that purpose ; or, if he did not furnish the poison, but was present at the taking thereof by the deceased, participating, by persuasion, force, threats, or otherwise, in the taking thereof, or the introduction of it into her stomach or body; then, in either of the eases supposed, he administered the.poison to her, within the meaning of the statute. Her act of <em>taking </em>and <em>swallowing </em>it, in his presence and by his direction, was his act of <em>administering </em>it.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">It is said by counsel that suicide is no crime by the laws of Ohio, and that therefore there can be no accessories or principals in the second degree in suicide. This is true. But the real criminal <em>act </em>charged here is not <em>suicide, </em>but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>administering of poison. </em>And to this criminal act theremay be accessories, and principals in the second degree. If I furnish poison to a <em>guilty </em>agent, an accomplice, to be administered by him, and he administers it accordingly, I am an accessory before the fact; and if I stand stand by and counsel or encourage him in the act of administering the poison to another, I am a principal in the second degree. But no question of this kind arises in the present case, either upon the indictment or in the evidence. There is no claim or pretense that there was any <em>guilty third person </em>participating' in the transaction. The charge is that the prisoner, as principal in the first degree, is guilty of <em>administering poison, </em>and thereby causing death.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">We think, therefore, that the court did not err in its instructions as to what amounted to the administration of poison within the meaning of the crimes act.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">It is also objected that, the court misdirected the jury as to the kind and amount of evidence necessary to prove the <em>corpus delicti, </em>or body of the crime. As we understand the charge of the court, it is, in substance, that extrajudicial confessions alone are not sufficient to prove the body of the crime, but that they may be taken and used for that purpose in connection with the other evidence in the cause. This we understand to be the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Another objection to the charge of the court is, that the jury were instructed that <em>\u201cin no </em>case ought circumstantial evidence, where it is adequate to conviction, to be inferior to that which is derived from the testimony of a single witness.\u201d It is difficult to see how this instruction could prejudice the plaintiff' in error. If it is wrong, it is wrong in his favor. It is, therefore, unimportant to inquire-whether the proposition be law or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">The counsel also object to that part of the court\u2019s charge which relates to the defense of insanity, and insist that, instead thereof, the court should have given certain instructions which they asked. We see no substantial difference between the instructions asked and the charge given. The form of question submitted to the jury is substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the same as laid down in <em>Clark's case, </em>12 Ohio, 494 (note), and seems to ns to embody the true rule, namely: \"Was the accused a free agent in forming the purpose to kill? \"Was he at the time capable of judging whether <em>that, act </em>was right.or wrong? And did he know at the time that it was an offense against the laws of God and man?</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">It is also claimed that the court erred in refusing to reduce its charge to writing, and read the same to the jury, before the argument of the case. Her,e, again, we agree with the court below, and disagree with counsel. Under the provisions of the criminal code (S. &amp; S. 553, 554, sec. 1), as we read them, the court is not bound to reduce its instructions to writing, unless requested so to do before the argument of the case, nor to read or deliver the same, when so written, until after the close of the argument^ if any argument is made. This is reasonable, the design evidently being to give the court time and opportunity, without unnecessary delay of the trial, to prepare the instructions, and is evidently what was intended by the section of the code referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Another ground of error insisted upon, and which we think also unavailing, is the overruling of the prisoner\u2019s motion for a new trial, based on the alleged ground that one of the jurors had formed and expressed his opinion in the case. The evidence in regard to the fact of such formation and expression of opinion is conflicting. It is enough to say, in order to uphold the ruling and judgment of the court, that there was evidence fairly tending to disprove the fact alleged, and that we have no power to revise the finding of the court as to that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">There is but one other ground of error which we deem it necessary to notice, and this, we incline to think, is well taken. I refer to the order of the court rejecting testimony offered to prove the predisposition of Mary Jane Lovell to suicide. The testimony was rejected on the ground of remoteness, referring, as it did, to a period six years prior to the time of her death. It seems to us that this lapse of dime should go merely to the weight, and not to the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>petency of the testimony. <em>We </em>can not assume that this-state of mind, this predisposition to suicide, was merely temporary. It was equally open to both parties to trace the history of her mind down to a more recent period; and we can not assume that the prisoner had the means of doing so, or see on what ground he was bound to make known his purpose to do so. For the error in rejecting this testimony, although apparently of but small importance in the case, we feel bound to reverse the judgment,, and remand the cause for retrial and further proceedings..</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Other errors are assigned upon the record, but we deem it unimportant to consider them, further than to say that,, in our judgment, they are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
