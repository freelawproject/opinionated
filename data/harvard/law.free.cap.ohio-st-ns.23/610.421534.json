The city denied its liability, on the ground that the place where the injury happened was not a street or alley of the city. The case was submitted to a jury, who found a special verdict, substantially embodying the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-7\">In 1868, Jewett &amp; Crawford conveyed to the commissioners of Jefferson county a strip of ground for a county road. This grant was accepted by the commissioners, and the road accordingly opened, used by the public, and worked as a county road by the proper authorities. The road so opened and used connected with the streets of the city, and until February, 1872, lay partly within the city limits and partly outside, and at that date the territory including the entire road was annexed to the city. After its annexation, the road continued to be used as.a highway or street of the city, but no city ordinance was ever passed specially accepting or confirming it as such. On the 2d of July, 1872, the trustees of the water-works of the city dug a ditch in this road or street in which to lay water-pipes, leaving the same insecurely guarded, and on the 18th of July, 1872, the plaintiff\u2019s team, without fault on his part, and by the want of proper protection to the ditch, fell into the same, and was damaged to the amount of $200. The city council did not direct the particular place in which the pipes were to be laid, and did not sanction the act of digging the ditch, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>otherwise than by auditing and allowing the trustees\u2019 account for doing the work, without any knowledge as to-where the ditch had been dug. The accident happened in that part of the road originally lying in the city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b620-5\">Upon this verdict, the Common Pleas rendered a judgment for the city. On petition in error, this judgment was-reversed by the District Court, and the present motion is for leave to file a petition in error to reverse the judgment of the District Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b620-6\"><em>James A. </em>McCurdy, city solicitor, for the motion:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-7\">The road in question was not a public street or alley.

That the-road in question was not a legally established public highway at the time of its annexation to the city; and, 2. That if it were such, its annexation and continuous use by the public did not constitute it a street or highway of the city, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>for the reason that it was never <em>\u201c </em>accepted and confirmed ny an ordinance specially passed for such purpose,\u201d as required by section 440 of the municipal code (66 Ohio L. 222).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">We think neither of these propositions can be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Section 440 of the municipal code provides that \u201cno <em>'Street </em>or <em>alley </em>which has been or may be dedicated to public use by the proprietor of grounds in any corporation, shall be deemed a public street or alley, or be under the care or control of the' council, unless the dedication shall be accepted and confirmed by an ordinance specially passed for such purpose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Section 439 makes it the duty of the council to take \u201c the -care, supervision, and control of <em>all public highways, bridges, streets, avenues, sidewalks, and public grounds, </em>within the corporation,\u201d and to \u201c cause the same to be kept open and in repair, and free from nuisance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">It is quite obvious that the provisions of section 439 are -broader than those of section 440, and that there are some descriptions of \u201cpublic grounds\u201d or \u201cpublic highways,\u201d which may become subject to the control and supervision of the council, without any ordinance specially accepting them as such. We suppose the object of section 440 was to prevent proprietors of lands within the city limits from establishing new streets or alleys by a mere paper dedication. This was in effect decided in <em>Wisby </em>v. <em>Bonte, </em>19 Ohio St. 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">It can hardly be supposed that the legislature intended -by section 440 to vacate, or withdraw from city control, all streets and thoroughfares of the city which had already been established without any \u201c ordinance specially accepting and affirming them as such.\u201d This would be the effect of the construction contended for, if allowed. We suppose the provision was not intended to'have any application to cases where streets are established as such by public use, .and by acts of the city authorities improving them as such. If the road in question was a legal public highway at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>time of its annexation to the city, we think the simple fact of annexing it to the city, and its continuous subsequent use as a street, constituted it a \u201c public highway \u201d of the city, within the meaning of section 439 of the code, and subjected it to the control and care of the'city authorities. That it <em>was </em>a legally established public highway at and before its annexation, we entertain no doubt. Because the-statutes have pointed out certain.methods to be adopted for the establishment of public roads, it by no means follows that they can never be established by any other means. The grant of the owner made to the county commissioners, their acceptance of the grant, the'opening and working of the road by the public authorities, and its use as such by the public, were sufficient to establish it a legal public highway, and its annexation to the city and continuous use as one of its streets, constituted it a street of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
