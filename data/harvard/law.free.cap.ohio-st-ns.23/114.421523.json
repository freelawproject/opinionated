Of this amount, some $20,000 was paid in hand, and for the balance four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>notes were executed by Metcalfe to Eosdick, payable in one, two, three, and four years. Metcalfe went into possession, and a 'deed was duly executed by Eosdick conveying or demising the premises and proporty to Metcalfe, and duly recorded in the records of deeds ; but the deed was never verified or filed as a chattel mortgage. This deed contains the following provisions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-5\">\u201cThe said Samuel Eosdick, for and in consideration of the rents, covenants, and conditions hereinafter reserved and contained, hath perpetually demised, leased, and to farm let to the said James Metcalfe, his heirs and assigns, the following described real estate, situate in Hamilton county, and State of Ohio, to wit: Lot number one,\u201d etc., . . . \u201c together with the factory and buildings thereon; and all the machinery, fixtures, appurtenances, and utensils belonging to said factory.\u201d . . \u201cTo have and to hold the said premises to the said James Metcalfe, his heirs and assigns, forever, from the day of the date hereof upon the rents, covenants, and conditions hereinafter stated.\u201d The deed also contains covenants on the part of Metcalfe to pay said notes, a rent of $4,200 per annum, all taxes, etc.; and to keep the \u201c buildings and factory machinery insured for $50,000, until payment of said notes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-8\">The deed also contained the following provisions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b123-9\">\u201cAt all times during the continuance of the tenancy under these presents, the said Samuel Fosdick, his heirs and assigns, shall have a perfect lien preferable to all liens, in the nature of a mortgage, upon the said demised premises and the improvements thereou, for the payment of the notes, rents, taxes, levies, assessments, and premiums of insurance as aforesaid, that may become due and be payable under and by the terms of these presents as aforesaid, and remain unpaid, and the same shall continue and abide and be in full force until the same, with interest and penalties, are fully paid and discharged.\u201d . . . \u201cAt any time before said four notes are paid in full, the said James Metcalfe, his heirs and assigns, <em>may remove, at pleasure, </em>any portion of the machinery in said factory, upon, at the time of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>moval, substituting other machinery in its place of equal or greater value, but not otherwise; and until said notes are paid, the said machinery in said factory, or to. be put into said factory as aforesaid, shall be kept in good working order by the said James Metcalfe, his heirs and assigns; but after said notes are paid, the said machinery may be removed from or kept in said factory at the option of the said James Metcalfe, his heirs and assigns.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-5\">In 1868, Metcalfe having failed to fulfill his covenants with Fosdick, or to pay said notes, and being largely indebted to others, some of his other creditors caused the-property to be levied upon in attachment. The officer levying the writs of attachment took the machinery, utensils, and other movable articles belonging to the faetoryinto his possession; and while they were so in his possession, other creditors of Metcalfe caused like levies to be made upon them. Fosdick then filed his petition against Metcalfe, making his said attaching creditors also parties defendant thereto, and asking to have said creditors enjoined from selling the property so levied upon, and praying to have it sold for the payment of the purchase money, rents, etc., due to him from Metcalfe.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-6\">On the hearing of the case, the court held that the lien or claim of Fosdick upon the machinery, utensils, etc., belonging to the factory, as well as upon the real estate, was' superior to that of the attaching creditors, and ordered the property sold, and the proceeds applied accordingly. And it is now claimed that in so holding and ordering, the court erred to the prejudice of these attaching creditors, who, with Metcalfe, ask leave to file a petition in error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-7\"><em>H.

The lien is in the nature of a mortgage security, and to be enforced as a trust. The instrument reserving this lien is good between the parties. It is not a chattel mortgage, nor intended to operate as a chattel mortgage. It is a valid lien,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>not given by the lessee, but <em>reserved </em>by the lessor in his demise, an.d is prepotent and preferable to all previous incumbrances. It is like a lien reserved in a deed, or rent charge reserved in a lease. It is a charge fastened by the lessor upon the interest transmitted to the lessee, who takes- and holds subject to this charge. He gets nothing but what the lease gives. All else remains in the lessor, as it was before the lease was given. Mortgages in equity are trusts. <em>Shoenberger et al. </em>v.

That order of sale, however, settled all this. It finds the liens attached to all the property attached. But if, by any chance, it should be considered that these matters are still open for consideration, then we say that the demise in this ease covered, not only the lot and building, but also the fixtures, machinery, utensils, etc.* used in the factory. The demise, however, upon the machinery, etc., original and substituted, would, upon the payment of the four notes, accrued rents, taxes, insurance, etc.* as required by the lease, terminate.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b127-6\">Welch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAZ\">We see no error in the judgment of -the court below. The ground assumed by the plaintiffs in error is; that Fosdick had no <em>lien </em>upon the machinery, utensils, etc., belonging to and used in the factory, because (1) they were sold and delivered to Metcalfe, and (2) Fosdiok\u2019s <em>lien </em>upon them was a mere chattel mortgage, in the form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>of covenants in the deed or lease, which, not having been verified or filed as such chattel mortgage, is void as to creditors of Metcalfe. \u00a5e think these positions are unmaintainable. As between Fosdick and -Metcalfe, the whole property conveyed or demised is to be regarded as a unit. The machinery, -utensils, etc., belonging to the factory are to be regarded, as between Fosdick and Metcalfe, as appurtenant to and forming part of the real estate. The whole or absolute interest in the property did not by the deed pass to Metcalfe. He took the property subject to the \u201c lien \u201d or right reserved. To the extent of that reservation the property never passed to him. The power given by the deed to Metcalfe to remove portions of the machinery, and to substitute others in their palace, is to be regarded as a mere power to repair, and not as indicating an \u00a1absolute ownership in the movable articles. They could only be removed upon the <em>condition </em>that others as good should, \u201cat the time of removal,\u201d be substituted in their palace. Until so removed, they remained the property of Fosdick to the extent of his right reserved. As we understand the facts of the case, the articles of property in controversy had never been so removed by Metcalfe, but remained, at the time of their seizure by the officer, as parts and parcels of the establishment, equally as at the date of the deed. That being the case, it seems to us the court was right in holding that the so-called \u201clien\u201d of Fosdick was not by way of mortgage, but by virtue of a preservation in the deed, and should therefore be preferred to the liens of the attaching creditors of Metcalfe.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\n<em>Motion overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
