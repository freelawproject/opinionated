The company duly organized in Pennsylvania, in 1865, but it had not, at the time the proceedings now brought in review were pending, done any business in that state, except to- keep up its organization. In 1866, the company was prosecuting its mining business in Ohio, and John H. Edson was its agent there. As such agent, Edson had in his possession certain articles of personal property belonging to the company, for the recovery of which property Antonio Pelletier brought an action of re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>plevin against Edson; and the plaintiffs in. error, Hanna and Finley, became Pelletier\u2019s sureties in a replevin bond or undertaking, executed in conformity to the statute, and conditioned that Pelletier should duly prosecute his action aforesaid, and pay all costs and damages which might be awarded against him. Pending the action, and after the replevin of the property, and the execution of the undertaking, on motion of said International Petroleum Company, and by consent of the parties in the cause, the company was made party defendant in lieu of Edson; and such proceedings were thereafter had that the company recovered a judgment against Pelletier for $1,297 damages, and $32.83 costs \u2014 which judgment remaining, in part, unpaid, for want of property whereon to levy, the company brought its action against Hanna and Finley upon their undertaking, to recover the amount of the judgment remaining unpaid. The cause was submitted to the court upon demurrer to the answer \u2014 the petition and answer setting forth substantially the facts above recited. Thereupon the court sustained the demurrer, and rendered a judgment in favor of the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-5\">To reverse this judgment a petition in error was filed in the District Court, and reserved for decision here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-6\">The grounds of error insisted upon are: 1. The International Petroleum Company could not own property, or be a party to a suit in Ohio; 2.

The substitution in the replevin suit is directly authorized, and indeed required, by the civil code, secs. 34, 35, 40-44 (S. &amp; C. 958), in such a case. The undertaking took the place of the property and became the means of reimbursing the real party in interest.

The argument seems to be, that this company was not a corporation, either because it was empowered by its charter to do business outside the state of its creation, as well as inside the state, or else, because-at the time these proceedings were had, the company had^ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>done no business, beyond its mere organization, in the State of Pennsylvania. We are unable to see why the incorporation should be invalidated on either or both of these-, grounds. The question is simply, whether a corporation,, authorized by its charter to do business both at home and. abroad, and which, after due organization at home, commences its foreign business first, has a legal existence as a, corporation. We answer that it has. The life of a corporation dates from its organization, and not from the time-it begins to do business; and the insertion in its charter of a power to act outside the state of its creation does not invalidate the charter. The company was a legal corporation-in Pennsylvania as soon as organized there, and without commencing business there. Being such, it surely had the right to sue for and recover its property wherever found,, provided the laws of the place did not deny it the right:</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">We are likewise unable to agree with counsel in their second ground of objection to these proceedings. We-think that the substitution of the company as defendant, in place of its agent Edson, did not release the sureties in the-undertaking. By the terms of that instrument the sureties undertook that the plaintiff should duly prosecute his-\u201caction aforesaid,\u201d and pay \u201call costs and damages\u201d awarded against him. The costs and damages here sought to be recovered were awarded \u201c against him,\u201d and they were awarded against him in the <em>same \u201c </em>action.\u201d It was a proper case for the change of parties; the change worked no prejudice to the rights of Pelletier; and it was made in pursuance of provisions of law which were in force-at the date of the undertaking. This undertaking is in the statutory form. Its language is broad enough, to cover a case like the present; and we suppose it was the intention of the legislature that it should cover such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
