The plaintiff claimed title by descent, and issue was taken as to the validity of a marriage, by which her title was sought to be defeated. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff had released her title to them, and issue was also \"taken as to whether the deed of release had been obtained \u00a1by fraud. These two were the only issues in the case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The jury, by their verdict, \u201c found <em>the issues </em>joined in the cause\u201d in favor of the defendants, and judgment was entered accordingly. The plaintiff now seeks to reverse the judgment, on the ground that the court erred in its instruction to the jury touching the validity of the <em>marriage </em>in question.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b635-5\"><em>John W. Morrison </em>and <em>M. D. Stallcup, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b635-6\"><em>J. H. Wallace, </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b635-7\">Under the verdict the third defense is established, and hence errors in the charge as to the other issues worked no injury. <em>Harman </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>14 Ohio, 502; <em>Kugler </em>v. <em>Wiseman, </em>20 Ohio, 361; <em>Ohio L. I. &amp; T. Co. </em>v. <em>Goodin, </em>10 Ohio St. 557; <em>Portage Co.

The jury therefore found that a valid <em>deed of release </em>had been executed by plaintiff to the defendants. It is immaterial, therefore, to inquire whether the court erred in its instructions touching the marriage, as those instructions could in no wise affect the result of the ease or prejudice the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
