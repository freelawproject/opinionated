The former fund w\u00ab,s held for the purpose of relieving sick and needy members of the order, and the latter to provide for the widows and orphans of deceased members. The assessor returned this $2,77 4 for taxation, and taxes having been assessed thereon, and the county treasurer being about to proceed to collect the same after they had become due, the lodge, claiming that said fund was exempt from taxation, began an action in Medina Common Pleas to enjoin him from so doing. The treasurer answered, denying that said moneys were held for' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>the purpose of purely public charity. The Common Pleas-dismissed the petition, and, after appeal, the District Court did the like. A motion for a new trial having been made- and overruled, a bill of exceptions, presenting all the evidence, was taken, and the lodge now asks leave to file a petition in error to reverse the judgment of the District Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b153-4\"><em>J.
