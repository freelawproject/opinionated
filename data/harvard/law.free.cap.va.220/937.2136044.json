In accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict, the defendant was sentenced to serve 12 months in jail and to pay a fine of $1,000. The dispositive question in the case is whether the defendant suffered a violation of his Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-13\">The evidence shows that on September 27, 1977, two Albemarle County Sheriff\u2019s Department plainclothesmen, Detective Craft and Captain Higgins, went to an apartment building to interview the occupant of a third-floor unit in connection with a homicide investigation. Receiving no response to their knock, the officers started down the stairs and, between the second and third landings, passed the defendant as he proceeded up the stairway. The officers waited and observed the defendant as he knocked at the door of the same apartment they had just left.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>When the defendant received no answer at the door, he started down the stairs. Thinking that the defendant might be able to provide information concerning the occupant of the apartment, Captain Higgins hailed the defendant and asked to talk to him, but he \u201ckept going on down the flight of steps.\u201d The defendant halted only after Craft and Higgins identified themselves as police officers and repeatedly called upon him to stop. By this time, he had reached the bottom of the stairs and was outside the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">The officers caught up with the defendant and observed that he was \u201chighly nervous\u201d and \u201cvisibly shaking.\u201d In response to several inquiries concerning his name, he gave only his nickname, \u201cPatty.\u201d Detective Craft thought the defendant was \u201cacting mighty strange.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">The defendant was carrying in his hand a \u201crolled up brown paper bag.\u201d When called upon to produce some identification, he placed the bag between his legs and fumbled for his wallet. At this point, suspicious that the defendant \u201chad something in the bag that wasn\u2019t right,\u201d Detective Craft pointed to the bag and asked what was in it. The defendant replied, \u201cnothing man, nothing.\u201d Craft asked again what was in the bag, this time reaching down and grasping the bag with his hands and shaking it. Releasing \u201chis grip with his legs,\u201d but keeping his hand on the bag, the defendant replied to Craft\u2019s inquiry by saying, \u201cmarijuana, man.\u201d Thereupon, Captain Higgins placed the defendant under arrest and gave him the \u201cMiranda warnings.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Detective Craft \u201ctook the bag in [his] possession.\u201d Later analysis revealed that the bag contained nearly a pound of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">At trial, the defendant moved to suppress both the marijuana and his statement that the bag contained the drug. He asserted that this evidence had been obtained from him as a result of an unreasonable search and seizure. The motion was denied, and the disputed evidence was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">On appeal, the defendant makes no complaint concerning the officers\u2019 actions in stopping him and requiring identification from him. He argues, however, that when Detective Craft grabbed the bag in question and shook it, contemporaneously inquiring about its contents, a search occurred within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. And, the defendant continues, because the search was warrant-less and \u201cthe officers admitted that they had no probable cause to believe the bag. . . contained contraband,\u201d the only exception to the warrant requirement possibly available to the Commonwealth was a \u201c \u2018stop and frisk\u2019 search\u201d within the meaning of <em>Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>392 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>U.S. 1 (1968). But, the defendant asserts, because the officers also admitted that \u201cthey had no suspicion that [he] possessed a dangerous weapon,\u201d the search cannot be justified as part of a \u201c \u2018stop and frisk\u2019 within the <em>Terry </em>case.\u201d Accordingly, the defendant concludes, his statement that the bag contained marijuana and the drug itself should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">Responding to the defendant\u2019s arguments, the Attorney General does not rely upon any of the exceptions to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement as justification for the officers\u2019 conduct in this case. Instead, the Attorney General contends that the confrontation between the officers and the defendant was \u201cneither a \u2018search\u2019 or \u2018seizure\u2019 nor was it \u2018unreasonable\u2019 as prohibited by the Constitution.\u201d While he does not rely upon <em>Terry </em>to establish a \u201cstop and frisk\u201d exception here, the Attorney General says, the case does \u201cset forth broad guiding principles to aid police in their conduct\u201d and recognizes that there are \u201ca myriad of valid confrontations between police and citizens on the street which could be construed as infringing upon personal security, but [are] otherwise reasonable and, consequently, not offensive of the Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">The test of the reasonableness of police conduct, the Attorney General points out, is \u201cwhether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u201d <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 20. There is no question in this case, the Attorney General opines, that the officers\u2019 initial actions in stopping and questioning the defendant were justified; the only conduct that is complained of consists of Detective Craft\u2019s later action when he grasped and shook the bag in question. But Craft explained in his testimony, the Attorney General asserts, that he grasped and shook the bag merely \u201cto emphasize the object of his question\u201d concerning the contents of the bag. This explanation and the other evidence clearly reflect, the Attorney General concludes, \u201cthat the officers acted within permissible boundaries\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">From these arguments, it is obvious that the determinative question is whether Detective Craft\u2019s action in grasping and shaking the bag held by the defendant constituted a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. It is apparent also that the parties agree that, while the <em>Terry </em>case is not directly in point, its teachings are indispensable to a resolution of the question presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-8\">In establishing the \u201cstop and frisk\u201d exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement, the Supreme Court in <em>Terry </em>recognized the necessity for \u201ca narrowly drawn authority to permit a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>search for weapons for the protection of the police officer, where he has reason to believe that he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual, regardless of whether he has probable cause to arrest the individual for a crime.\u201d 392 U.S. at 27. The Court made clear, however, what type of conduct it considered sufficient to constitute a search. In the course of its opinion, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-5\">\u201c[I]t is nothing less than sheer torture of the English language to suggest that a careful exploration of the outer surfaces of a person\u2019s clothing all over his or her body in an attempt to find weapons is not a \u2018search.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-6\">^ V</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-7\">\u201cWe. . .reject the notions that the Fourth Amendment does not come into play at all as a limitation upon police conduct if the officers stop short of something called a \u2018technical arrest\u2019 or a \u2018full-blown search.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-8\">\u201cIn this case there can be no question, then, that [the police officer] \u2018seized\u2019 petitioner and subjected him to a \u2018search\u2019 when he took hold of him and patted down the outer surfaces of his clothing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-9\">\u00ed ^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1101-10\">\u201cThe scope of the search in this case presents no serious problem. . .. [The police officer] patted down the outer clothing of petitioner and his two companions. He did not place his hands in their pockets or under the outer surface of their garments until he had felt weapons, and then he merely reached for and removed the guns. He never did invade Katz\u2019 person beyond the outer surfaces of his clothes, since he discovered nothing in his pat-down which might have been a weapon. [The officer] confined his search strictly to what was minimally necessary to learn whether the men were armed and to disarm them once he discovered the weapons. He did not conduct a general exploratory search for whatever evidence of criminal activity he might find.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29-30.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">Thus, it is clear from <em>Terry </em>that a mere pat-down of the outer garments of a suspect is a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Furthermore, our own definition of the term \u201csearch\u201d is consonant with this viewpoint. In <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 71, 73, 216 S.E.2d 48, 50 (1975), we said that a search \u201c \u2018implies a prying into hidden places,\u2019 \u201d that the term means \u201cto conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>an \u2018exploratory investigation,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cit involves an \u2018invasion and quest.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">We believe that Detective Craft\u2019s grasping and shaking of the bag held by the defendant, contemporaneous with the officer\u2019s inquiry concerning the contents of the bag, constituted a prying into hidden places, an exploratory investigation, and an invasion and quest. The police action here, therefore, no less than the pat-down of the outer garments of the suspect in <em>Terry, </em>was a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Crowder </em>v. <em>United States, </em>379 A.2d 1183, 1185 (D.C. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">Because the present search was warrantless and without sanction of an exception to the warrant requirement, it was unreasonable. Accordingly, both the statement made by the defendant and the marijuana seized from him following the search were the fruits of illegal police action and should have been suppressed. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 601-02 (1975); <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 485-86 (1963). <em>See Reese </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1035, 265 S.E.2d 746 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">With the defendant\u2019s statement and the marijuana excluded, the evidence is insufficient to sustain the defendant\u2019s conviction. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed, and the prosecution against the defendant will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1099-9\"> <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
