This contention presents the sole question for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The record shows that shortly after 6:00 p.m. on June 21, 1978, the proprietor of Rogerson\u2019s Market on Jefferson Avenue in Newport News closed his store and secured the premises for the night. About 12:45 a.m. the next morning, Detective Bowling of the Newport News Police Department was driving along Jefferson Avenue. As he passed Rogerson\u2019s Market, he saw the defendant, with whom he was acquainted, standing with another subject in the recessed entrance of the market. The defendant held in his hand a brown paper bag. When he and his companion saw Detective Bowling, they \u201ctook off running.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AFB\">Detective Bowling turned his car around at the next intersection, and, as he \u201cstarted back,\u201d he received a radio message from the police dispatcher. The message recited that an employee of a nearby Burger King had reported a \u201cburglary in progress\u201d at Rogerson\u2019s Market. Bowling began searching the area and soon found the defendant several blocks away, talking with a group of people in front of a \u201cshot house.\u201d At the detective\u2019s request, the defendant returned to Rogerson\u2019s Market. There, Bowling learned that the front glass door had been broken and that $1.50 in loose change and 100 to 150 packs of cigarettes were missing from inside the store. Beneath some nearby bushes, Bowling found a brown paper bag containing loose change and approximately 50 packs of cigarettes. The bag was similar to the one Bowling had earlier observed in the defendant\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The defendant was arrested and charged with the Rogerson burglary. He denied any involvement in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">When, at trial, Detective Bowling commenced testifying concerning the radio report of a \u201cburglary in progress\u201d at Rogerson\u2019s Market, defense counsel objected on the ground that the testimony \u201cwould be hearsay evidence.\u201d Responding, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney stated that the testimony would lay \u201cthe foundation for the action [Detective Bowling] subsequently took.\u201d Overruling the defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">\u201cI\u2019m going to let it in, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, not for the truth of what was said on the police dispatch, but simply as information received by [Detective Bowling] and what he did as a result of receiving it, but not for the fact that what was said on the radio was true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">The trial court\u2019s action was in accord with prior decisions of this court. Indeed, as the Attorney General states in his brief, \u201cthe present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>case is directly controlled\u201d by our decisions in <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>201 Va. 724, 113 S.E.2d 667 (1960), and <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>209 Va. 297, 163 S.E.2d 565 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The <em>Fuller </em>case involved a prosecution for the murder of a policeman, Officer Padgett, who was killed when he attempted to arrest Fuller without a warrant for an assault on Jessie Brown. Over Fuller\u2019s hearsay objection, a fellow policeman was permitted to testify that, preceding the murder, Brown had reported to him and Padgett that Fuller had struck Brown on the head with an object at a certain address and that \u201ca woman at that address \u2018might be dead.\u2019 \u201d In admitting the testimony, the trial court instructed the jury that the evidence was admissible \u201conly for the purpose of showing why the police officers arrested Fuller without a warrant.\u201d 201 Va. at 729, 113 S.E.2d at 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">In affirming the trial court\u2019s action, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">\u201cThe hearsay rule does not operate to exclude evidence of a statement, request, or message offered for the mere purpose of explaining or throwing light on the conduct of the person to whom, it was made. The evidence was admitted not for the purpose of showing the guilt or innocence of the defendant; but for the purpose of showing the reason for the police officers\u2019 action in arresting him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">201 Va. at 729, 113 S.E.2d at 670.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">The <em>Foster </em>case involved a prosecution for the burglary of an ABC Store. The alleged hearsay statement there in dispute was that the police \u201chad gone to investigate noises heard in that building.\u201d Over the accused\u2019s hearsay objection, the trial court admitted the statement, remarking that it was \u201cproper evidence to show why [the police officer] was there.\u201d Citing <em>Fuller </em>and affirming, we said that the \u201cstatement as phrased did not violate the hearsay rule and was admissible to show why the officers went to the scene of the alleged crime.\u201d 209 Va. at 303, 163 S.E.2d at 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">We perceive no real factual or legal difference between the present case, on the one hand, and <em>Fuller </em>and <em>Foster, </em>on the other. If any difference exists, it lies in the fact that the admonition given the jury concerning the limited purpose for admission of the disputed statement was clearer and stronger in this case than in the others. Besides specifying the one purpose for which the statement properly could be used, the trial court here twice told the jury that it could not consider the statement as evidence of the truth of the matter therein asserted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Thus, the trial court effectively eliminated the likelihood that the jury would misuse the statement as proof of the defendant\u2019s participation in the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Finding no error in the defendant\u2019s convictions, we will affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
