He seeks reversal, contending that the trial court erred (1) in failing to suppress his confession, (2) in refusing to strike the evidence, and (3) in granting an instruction on voluntary intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">The record shows that after midnight on January 30,1977, Betty Jean McKay closed her restaurant and, accompanied by two friends, departed for her home with business receipts totaling approximately $3,000. When Ms. McKay and her companions entered her home about 4:00 a.m., they were accosted by two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>waiting burglars, one of whom was armed. All three victims were forced to lie on the floor; the hands and feet of all three were bound, and Ms. McKay\u2019s friends were gagged. Upon fleeing, the assailants took Ms. McKay\u2019s business receipts, several hundred dollars of other funds, and various items of personal property. The victims freed themselves from their bonds and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Investigation revealed that the burglars had entered the home by breaking \u201cthe basement door out.\u201d It was also ascertained that, while awaiting the arrival of their victims, the intruders \u201craided the refrigerator and ate the food.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">None of the victims could furnish identification of the assailants. On March 4, 1977, however, the defendant was arrested on warrants charging him with burglary and robbery in the McKay incident. The next day, he confessed to his participation in the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">In a pretrial hearing, the defendant sought unsuccessfully to have his confession suppressed on the ground that \u201chis own peculiar suggestible nature\u201d caused him to confess involuntarily. At this hearing, it was shown that, on the day of his arrest, the defendant was given his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>warnings and was questioned by Detective McKeever of the City of Roanoke Police Department. In a two-hour session, during which the detective recited some of the details of the crimes, the defendant made no response other than to answer inquiries eliciting \u201cpersonal information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Later the same day, the defendant\u2019s father sought out and talked to Detective McKeever concerning the defendant\u2019s predicament. McKeever told the father that the police had \u201cevidence and witnesses who could place [the defendant] at the scene of the offense.\u201d The father then visited the defendant in jail and urged him to \u201ctell the truth\u201d because \u201cthey had the evidence on him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The next day, after repeating the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Detective McKeever again questioned the defendant. In a session lasting two and one-half hours, the defendant recited his father\u2019s admonition to him to \u201ctell the truth\u201d and then confessed in a detailed statement that supplied particulars of the crimes not previously known to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">During the suppression hearing, the defendant called as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>witness Dr. Robert Showalter, a psychiatrist and assistant director of the Forensic Psychiatry Clinic at the University of Virginia Hospital. Dr. Showalter examined the defendant in mid-September, 1977, some 7 1/2 months after the offenses occurred and approximately 6 months after the defendant gave his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Dr. Showalter testified that the defendant told him \u201cvery little\u201d concerning the crimes because the defendant \u201cpersisted in claiming amnesia.\u201d The doctor stated that he felt the amnesia was not \u201cof a particular self-serving nature,\u201d but was the result of a \u201ctoxically based organic brain syndrome,\u201d caused by the defendant\u2019s prolonged and excessive use of drugs. The doctor testified further that the defendant also suffered from severe dyslexia, an \u201corganically based reading deficit,\u201d which, from the defendant\u2019s early years, had prevented \u201cmeaningful relationships with peers\u201d and had caused the defendant to become \u201ca very compliant and very dependent young man.\u201d These difficulties, the doctor said, operated to cause the defendant, in a stressful situation such as police interrogation, to \u201creturn to a very childlike state,\u201d in which he was highly susceptible to suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Dr. Showalter admitted that the defendant\u2019s confession sounded \u201cintelligible\u201d and was \u201ccognitively intact.\u201d The doctor opined, however, that the two-hour police interview on the day of the defendant\u2019s arrest, during which Detective McKeever \u201crecycled\u201d before the defendant information concerning the crimes, prompted the defendant\u2019s memory of the events and, in the coercively stressful and suggestive situation in which he found himself the next day, caused him to recite in the confession the specific details of the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">As the Commonwealth concedes, the prosecution had the burden of showing that the defendant\u2019s confession was voluntary. <em>McCoy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>206 Va. 470, 474, 144 S.E.2d 303, 307 (1965). Voluntariness is a factual question, and the prosecution\u2019s burden may be satisfied by proof by a preponderance of evidence. Voluntariness determines admissibility, and the question, therefore, is one for decision by the court and not the jury. <em>Witt </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 670, 674, 212 S.E.2d 293, 296-97 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Here, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence clearly was sufficient to establish at least a prima facie case of voluntariness. Against this prima facie showing, the defendant did not offer the challenges usually made to the admissibility of confessions. No claim was asserted that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were inadequate or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>were not understood; indeed, the record shows that, at the beginning of each of his two periods of interrogation, the defendant was fully advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and he signed a printed form waiving those rights. Neither was any allegation made of police misconduct in obtaining the confession; to the contrary, during the suppression hearing, defense counsel disavowed the \u201cimplication\u201d that the police, \u201cin any way, did anything wrong, in that they coerced a statement out of\u201d the defendant. Nor was it contended that the defendant was intoxicated or that he was uneducated or unintelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The argument advanced against the admissibility of the confession was that, in the stressful atmosphere of police interrogation, a defendant highly susceptible to suggestion unwillingly said what the police prompted him to say. To uphold this proposition, however, would require acceptance of the testimony of Dr. Show-alter as conclusively sufficient to overcome the prima facie case of voluntariness made out by the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. The trial court obviously refused to accept the doctor\u2019s testimony as so sufficient. On this record, we cannot disagree with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In the final analysis, Dr. Showalter\u2019s testimony reduced itself, as he acknowledged, to the proposition that \u201cthere are rare, unusual situations [,] and this <em>may be </em>one of them, in which the mental state of the individual is so compromised, so as to raise serious question as to the ability of the individual to give a free and voluntary statement\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, at best, Dr. Showalter\u2019s testimony raised only a <em>possibility </em>that the defendant\u2019s statement may not have been \u201cfree and voluntary.\u201d The mere existence of this possibility was insufficient to overcome the Commonwealth\u2019s case of voluntariness. We will not disturb, therefore, the trial court\u2019s factual finding that the statement was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The defendant contends next that the trial court should have struck the evidence because of the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to show that he acted with criminal intent in the commission of the crimes. The Commonwealth offered no \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d of intent, the defendant argues, and the only facts introduced at trial relating specifically to his conduct \u201cnegate any intent to rob or steal and show only an intent to comply with the demands of \u2018the man,\u201d\u2019 meaning the defendant\u2019s alleged accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">In this connection, the defendant points to two excerpts from his confession. The first relates to a point in time after the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>and his alleged accomplice had entered the McKay residence but before the victims had arrived. This excerpt reads: \u201cTwo cars drove [up] and I said \u2018let\u2019s get out of here, they\u2019re having a party\u2019 and the man said \u2018no, you\u2019re staying and go in the kitchen and wait.\u2019\u201d The other excerpt concerns incidents occurring after the victims\u2019 arrival. This excerpt reads: \u201cI got the money bag and I was told to search them for wallets and so I searched them for wallets and I said \u2018there wasn\u2019t any\u2019 and he said \u2018look again.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The defendant relies also upon a statement he made to Detective McKeever, not contained in the confession, to the effect that he participated in the crimes because he \u201cfelt that harm would come to himself or his wife if he didn\u2019t go [along].\u201d Additionally, the defendant cites the testimony of one of the victims that he overheard one of the robbers instruct the other to \u201ctie them up.\u201d Finally, the defendant adverts to the psychiatric testimony concerning his susceptibility to suggestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">We believe that it was for the jury to decide whether the defendant acted with criminal intent in the commission of the crimes. While the Commonwealth may not have produced \u201cconcrete evidence\u201d of intent, such a failure is not unusual; of necessity, intent often is established by circumstantial evidence. There was abundant circumstantial evidence before the jury from which it could have inferred criminal intent. Furthermore, without apparent objection, the jury was instructed that \u201ca man is presumed to intend that which he does, or which is the immediate or necessary consequences of his act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The scraps of evidence relied upon by the defendant as conclusively negating criminal intent are insufficient for that purpose. For the most part, this evidence was not inconsistent with a finding that the defendant acted with criminal intent. To the extent that the evidence may have indicated a lack of the requisite intent, nothing more than a jury issue was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The defendant\u2019s final contention is that the trial court erred in granting Instruction No. 4, which told the jury that \u201cvoluntary drunkenness or drug intoxication is no excuse for crime.\u201d The defendant argues that this instruction not only was unsupported by evidence but also had the effect of misleading the jurors to believe that they could not consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s use of drugs in determining whether he possessed the requisite criminal intent at the time the offenses were committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>These arguments obviously are inconsistent; they are also without merit. The record shows that, before he participated in the commission of the crimes, the defendant consumed both drugs and alcohol, so the instruction was supported by evidence. The instruction also correctly stated the law. Except in cases of first degree and capital murder, where proof of voluntary intoxication may negate deliberation and premeditation, <em>see Waye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 698, 251 S.E.2d 202, 211 (1979), such intoxication, whether from drugs or alcohol, is no defense to a criminal charge. <em>Chittum </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 12, 18, 174 S.E.2d 779, 782-83 (1970); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>135 Va. 524, 529, 115 S.E. 673, 675 (1923).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Finding no reversible error in the rulings below, we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-11\"><em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
