Answering the motion, the City admitted that it planned to construct the project but denied that it was required to comply with the Code sections relied upon by the County Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Ruling that these Code sections were inapplicable to the City\u2019s project, the trial court dismissed the County Board\u2019s motion for declaratory judgment. Whether this ruling was correct is the sole question for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">The Code sections relied upon by the County Board are 15.1-37.1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>15.1-332.1,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 15.1-456,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> all parts of Title 15.1 which relates to \u201cCounties, Cities and Towns.\u201d So far as pertinent here, \u00a7 15.1-37.1 provides that, under certain circumstances, a county, city, or town, in connection with its public water supply system, may construct a dam or acquire land therefor in another political subdivision but not with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>out the approval of the governing body of the other political subdivision; \u00a7 15.1-332.1 provides that no county or municipality shall impound any waters within the boundaries of another county or municipality without first obtaining the approval of the other county or municipality;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u00a7 15.1-456 provides that no public utility facility, whether publicly or privately owned, shall be constructed in any locality that has adopted a comprehensive development plan unless the facility is shown on the plan or is thereafter approved by the locality.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The City says that it is not required to comply with the foregoing Code sections because it is exempted by Code \u00a7 15.1-1, when read in conjunction with a provision of its charter, \u00a7 2(9). Code \u00a7 15.1-1 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">\u201cExcept when otherwise expressly provided, the provisions of this title shall in nowise repeal, amend, impair or affect any other power, right or privilege conferred on cities and towns by charter or any other provisions of general law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In pertinent part, \u00a7 2(9) of the City\u2019s charter empowers it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">\u201cTo acquire in any lawful manner in any county of the State, or without the State, such water lands, and lands under water as the council of said city may deem necessary for the purpose of providing an adequate water supply for said city and of piping or conducting the same; to lay all necessary mains; to erect and maintain all necessary dams, pumping stations and other works in connection therewith .. ..\u201d Acts 1952, ch. 216.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">It is the City\u2019s position that the charter provision quoted above grants it the authority to acquire such lands in the county to provide an adequate water supply as its council may deem necessary and that Code \u00a7 15.1-1 preserves this power inviolate against any provision of Title 15.1 that does not <em>expressly </em>\u201crepeal, amend, impair or affect\u201d the power. Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-37.1, -332.1, and -456, relied upon by the County, do not expressly affect the exercise of the power conferred by its charter, the City argues, and thus the charter provision prevails over the Code sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>We disagree with the City. Section2(9) of the city charter deals with the subject of the City\u2019s power to acquire lands for the construction of dams and the development of its public water supply system. Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-37.1 and -332.1 deal with precisely the same subject. But the Code sections contain caveats providing that a political subdivision cannot construct a dam or impound waters in another locality without the approval of the other locality. We believe that, in \u00a7 \u00a7 15.1-37.1 and -332.1, the General Assembly clearly has \u201cotherwise expressly provided,\u201d in the language of \u00a7 15.1-1, that the exercise of the power granted the City under \u00a7 2(9) of its charter shall be affected by the caveats contained in the Code sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">To make clearer what already is abundantly clear, we note that the City\u2019s power under its charter provision is to \u201cacquire in any lawful manner\u201d land in a county for the construction of a dam. But \u00a7 15.1-37.1 provides that a county, city, or town cannot even acquire land for a dam in another locality, much less construct the dam, without approval of the governing body of the other locality. Obtaining such approval, therefore, is a precondition to the lawful exercise of the power granted the City by its charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">With respect to Code \u00a7 15.1-456, while this section does not deal specifically with dams and the impoundment of waters, it does relate to a \u201cpublic utility facility . . . whether publicly or privately owned,\u201d and this language would include the project the City proposes in the present case. Section 15.1-456 is part of Chapter 11 of Title 15.1, entitled \u201cPlanning, Subdivision of Land and Zoning.\u201d Article 4 of that Chapter, which includes \u00a7 15.1-456, provides for the preparation and adoption, which may take place in stages, of a comprehensive plan for the physical development of a locality. Once adopted, the plan, or part thereof, according to \u00a7 15.1-456, \u201cshall control the general or approximate location, character and extent of each feature shown on the plan.\u201d And, as has been noted, unless a feature, such as a public utility facility, is shown on an adopted plan, it shall not be constructed without approval of the governing body of the locality.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Much, therefore, of what has been said concerning \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-37.1 and -332.1 may be said also with respect to \u00a7 15.1-456. In addition, however, we believe that the case of <em>City of Richmond </em>v. <em>County Board, 199 </em>Va. 679, 101 S.E.2d 641 (1958), bears directly upon the question whether the City in this case must comply with \u00a7 15.1-456. There, the charter of the City of Richmond authorized the city to \u201cestablish, maintain and operate, within or without the city, a jail for the confinement of prisoners.\u201d The county, pursuant to authority granted by the statutory ancestor of Title 15.1, had enacted a zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ordinance and had established a district for jails and jail farms. The city proposed to construct a jail in the county outside the district established therefor. The city cited Code \u00a7 15-2 (now Code \u00a7 15.1-1) as the reason it was not required to comply with the county zoning ordinance. We held that the Code section did not exempt the city from compliance with the county zoning ordinance. Here, Code \u00a7 15.1-1 does not exempt the city from compliance with \u00a7 15.1-456.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">We conclude, therefore, that the County Board was entitled to a declaration that the City was required to comply with Code \u00a7\u00a7 15.1-37.1, -332.1, and -456. Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for entry of an order declaring the rights of the parties consistent with the views expressed in this opinion and for such further proceedings as the parties may deem necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-11\"> <em>\u00a7 15.1-37.1.
