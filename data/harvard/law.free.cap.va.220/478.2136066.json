R. Ellis with the intent to commit larceny, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-91. The question presented in this appeal is whether the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Between July 4 and 16, 1978, someone broke into the Ellis home. A television set, a citizen\u2019s band (C.B.) radio, an AM-FM radio, steaks, hamburger, and cigarettes were removed from the house. The Commonwealth based a substantial portion of its case upon the testimony of Floyd Bain, Jr., the defendant\u2019s brother-in-law. Bain testified that he saw Jesse Parrish, who was living with him at the time, take out of Bain\u2019s car and carry into the Bain home a television set, cigarettes, \u201chamburger and all kind of meat\u201d when they returned from visiting Lucy Guynn, defendant\u2019s mother. Bain also testified that, while at defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home \u201cthat same night <em>that </em>television [was brought] home, [defendant] was trying to sell <em>that, </em>and I don\u2019t know whether he sold <em>it </em>or not, I seen him trying to sell <em>that </em>and the C.B. radio and a clock radio of some type. . .to Roy Ayers.\u201d (emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Shortly thereafter, police officers found in Bain\u2019s home the television set, which Ellis identified as the one stolen from his home. The C.B. radio and clock radio, neither of which Bain could describe more precisely, were not recovered and consequently could not be produced at the defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">The defendant testified that he did not break into the Ellis home. Although claiming to know nothing about the theft, he acknowledged being with Parrish earlier on the day Parrish took the television into the Bain home. Jesse Parrish, testifying for the defendant, admitted taking the television from the Ellis home. He denied taking the other items and claimed that the defendant did not participate in the burglary. Parrish further testified that he and defendant were together shortly before he stole the television. In rebutting Parrish\u2019s statement that the defendant was not involved, the Commonwealth introduced a written statement signed by Parrish in which Parrish claimed that defendant broke into the Ellis home and brought the television out to the porch. According to his written statement, Parrish then took the television to defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s home, where he placed it in Bain\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The defendant contends that the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, merely establishes that he was in possession of goods similar to those taken from the Ellis home. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>The Commonwealth can establish a prima facie case that a defendant broke and entered by (1) proving that goods have been stolen from a house into which someone has broken and entered; (2) justifying the inference that both offenses were committed at the same time, by the same person, as a part of the same criminal enterprise; and (3) proving that these goods were found soon thereafter in the possession of the defendant. <em>Schaum </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 498, 501, 211 S.E.2d 73, 76 (1975); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 748, 750, 195 S.E.2d 703, 705 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">In the present case, the evidence establishes that on the same night Parrish claimed to have taken the television from the Ellis home, the defendant was attempting to sell various items, including the television set, to Roy Ayers. The jury could have reasonably concluded from this evidence that the defendant was in possession of goods stolen from the Ellis home soon after the breaking and entering occurred. Under the <em>Schaum </em>test, the Commonwealth thus established a prima facie case of the defendant\u2019s guilt of breaking and entering and theft of the goods. It is also noteworthy that Bain\u2019s observation of the articles taken from his car and the articles defendant attempted to sell provided a complete accounting of almost all the articles taken from the Ellis home.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the court below is</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
