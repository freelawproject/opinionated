Alford was convicted of \u201cfailure to comply with no smoking ordinance\u201d in violation of the Code of the Ctiy of Newport News, c. 33, art. IV, Ordinance No. 2446-78 (May 15, 1978). Fined $10 and costs, defendant appeals her conviction on the ground the ordinance is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Defendant operates a restaurant consisting of a \u201cmain dining room\u201d capable of seating 70 diners and another room that is not used \u201cexcept for banquets\u201d. The ordinance, enacted as an amendment to the \u201cSmoke and Air Pollution Control\u201d chapter of the City Code, provides that it is \u201cunlawful for any person to smoke... in any restaurant [with a seating capacity of 50 or morel, except in those areas specifically designated as public smoking areas\u201d. Smoking is also prohibited in health care facilities, schools, elevators, and certain other places frequented by the public. \u201cAny person who owns, manages or otherwise controls any. . .place in which smoking is prohibited, is required to post. . .signs. . .which read:</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">NO SMOKING City Ordinance Prohibits the Carrying of Lighted Tobacco Products of Any Kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">$25 Fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">At oral argument, the City\u2019s attorney advised the Court that the ordinance is construed to require that this sign be posted \u201cin the entrance way\u201d. He stated further that \u201cthe way we are attempting to enforce the ordinance [is! by allowing one table\u201d to be designated as a non-smoking area. This accords with defendant\u2019s testimony concerning the instructions she was given by an enforcement officer. Defendant refused to comply, and a warrant was served against her. Although there was evidence of violations at another restaurant and several other places covered by the ordinance, no other citations had been issued at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">Invoking due process and equal protection arguments, defendant challenges the facial constitutionality of the ordinance in all its parts. We consider only whether the ordinance is constitutional as construed and applied by the City in defendant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">The due process guarantee does not forbid reasonable regulation of the use of private property. \u201cThe legislature may, in the exercise of the police power, restrict personal and property rights in the interest of public health, public safety, and for the promotion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>general welfare.\u201d <em>Gorieb </em>v. <em>Fox, et als., </em>145 Va. 554, 560, 134 S.E. 914, 916 (1926); <em>see also Mumpower </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>176 Va. 426, 11 S.E.2d 732 (1940). The purpose of the no smoking ordinance, manifest upon its face, is to protect the non-smoking public from what the ordinance terms \u201cthe toxic effect of smoke\u201d. Whether tobacco smoke is toxic may be arguable, but that question is one for the legislature and not the courts. And it is clearly within the police power of the legislature to abate what it finds to be injurious to the public health.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">But, no matter how legitimate the legislative goal may be, the police power may not be used to regulate property interests unless the means employed are reasonably suited to the achievement of that goal. \u201cThe mere power to enact an ordinance. . . does not carry with it the right arbitrarily or capriciously to deprive a person of the legitimate use of his property.\u201d <em>Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Carper, </em>200 Va. 653, 662, 107 S.E.2d 390, 396 (1959). As applied to defendant in this case, the means employed by this ordinance are not reasonably suited to the achievement of the legislative goal. The requirement to designate one of several dining tables located in the same room as a non-smoking area hardly limits the amount of smoke in the air. If smoke exhaled in such an environment is toxic, its harmful effects are ambient. Yet, the ordinance requires posting a sign which leads the non-smoking diner to expect that the place he has chosen to patronize is a wholly protected environment. By relying on the sign, he will be exposed to \u201cthe toxic effect\u201d from which the ordinance purports to protect him. Hence, these requirements tend to defeat the very legislative purpose the ordinance is supposed to promote.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">We hold that, as applied in this case, the ordinance constitutes an unconstitutional exercise of the City\u2019s police power. The judgment entered against defendant on November 29, 1978 will be reversed, and final judgment dismissing the warrant will be entered here.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">\n<em>Reversed and warrant dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
