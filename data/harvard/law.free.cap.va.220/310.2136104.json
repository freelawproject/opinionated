(licensee), operates a full-service restaurant in Williamsburg and holds a license to serve alcoholic beverages. The restaurant was renovated in early 1976, and the game of backgammon was employed as part of the new motif. Pursuing this decorative scheme, licensee installed a 22-foot counter surfaced with five wood-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>inlaid backgammon boards. A local inspector for the Commission advised licensee that its new counter could not be used for the service of alcoholic beverages because it was not a \u201ctable\u201d or \u201ccounter\u201d as defined in the Commission\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">By letter dated May 25, 1976, licensee\u2019s counsel requested permission to use the counter as designed. The Commission considered and denied the request. Licensee then arranged an informal conference with Commission personnel and on July 8, 1976, the request was reconsidered and again refused. Fearing that use of the counter would jeopardize its ABC license, licensee removed it and filed this action for declaratory judgment. The Commission\u2019s demurrer on jurisdictional grounds was overruled. By letter opinion and final order dated August 25, 1977, the court held that the Commission had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding the backgammon table did not satisfy regulatory standards, suspended the Commission\u2019s action, and remanded the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We consider first the question whether the court had jurisdiction to entertain licensee\u2019s challenge to the Commission\u2019s action by way of motion for declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16, section 16 of the Administrative Process Act (hereinafter, APA), provides <em>inter alia </em>that any \u201cparty aggrieved by and claiming unlawfulness of a case decision . . . shall have a right to the direct review thereof ... by an appropriate and timely court action against the agency. . . . Such proceedings include those for declaratory judgments. . . .\u201d The term \u201ccase decision\u201d is defined in APA section 4(D), Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4(D), as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">\u201cany agency proceeding or <em>determination </em>that, under laws or <em>regulations </em>at the time, a named party as a matter of past or present fact, <em>or of threatened or contemplated private action, </em>either is, is not, or may or may not be (i) <em>in violation of such law or regulation </em>or (ii) in compliance with any existing requirement for obtaining or <em>retaining </em>a license or other right or benefit.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">The reviser\u2019s notes list as examples of \u201ccase decisions\u201d those \u201cof a declaratory nature issued in advance of contemplated private activities\u201d or those \u201cforbidding named parties from acting or refraining from acting or threatening to act in some way required or forbidden by the . . . regulations . . . under which the agency is operating\u201d. Reviser\u2019s NoteD, Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">Clearly, the Commission\u2019s refusal to permit licensee\u2019s use of its counter for the service of alcoholic beverages constituted a \u201ccase de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>cisi\u00f3n\u201d within the meaning of the APA. Under APA section 16, case decisions generally are subject to judicial review by declaratory judgment. As the Commission says, section 15 provides for certain exceptions to this general right of review. Pertinent to our inquiry is the provision that judicial review shall not lie to any agency action which \u201cis placed beyond the control of the courts by constitutional or statutory provisions <em>expressly </em>precluding court review\u201d. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:15 (emphasis added). As the reviser\u2019s notes indicate, such express preclusions are very \u201crare\u201d. The Commission has cited no express provision precluding review of this case decision, and our independent research has disclosed none. The Commission argues, however, that the licensee\u2019s request for permission to serve drinks over this counter is essentially equivalent to an original application for license, and Code \u00a7 4-31(f) (Repl. Vol. 1973) expressly precludes review of decisions on such applications.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This argument fails for obvious reasons. First, under APA section 15, any preclusion of review must be made expressly and plainly, not by implication or analogy. Second, licensee already had a license and the question raised by its request was hardly equivalent to those posited by an original application. If anything, the proceeding before the Commission more closely resembled a revocation or suspension proceeding. Under Code \u00a7 4-37 (d), all such proceedings are subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the circuit court properly overruled the Commission\u2019s demurrer and took jurisdiction of licensee\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">On review, courts are guided by APA section 17 which provides that \u201cthe function of the court shall be to determine only whether the result reached by the agency could reasonably be said... to be within the scope of the legal authority of the agency\u201d; in making this determination, the reviewing court \u201cshall take due account of the presumption of official regularity, the experience and specialized competence of the agency, and the purposes of the basic law under which the agency has acted.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">The \u201cbasic law\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> under which the Commission acted and the purposes thereof are crucial to the function of the reviewing court. Those purposes must be gleaned from an analysis of the overall statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>tory and regulatory scheme for the control of alcoholic beverages. The General Assembly has authorized the Commission to issue \u201cmixed beverage restaurant license[s]\u201d to persons operating a restaurant \u201cwhose gross receipts from the sale of meals . . . and nonalcoholic beverages served on the premises\u201d exceed gross receipts from the sale of alcoholic and other beverages. Code \u00a7 4-98.2. The term \u201cmeals\u201d is defined as \u201can assortment of foods commonly ordered in bona fide full-service restaurants as principal meals of the day.\u201d Code \u00a7 4-98.1. See also Code \u00a7 4-2(22) defining the phrase \u201cRestaurant licensed by the Commission\u201d. In turn, the Commission has defined the phrase \u201cBona fide, full service restaurant\u201d as an \u201cestablished place of business where meals with substantial entrees are habitually sold to persons and which has adequate facilities and sufficient employees for cooking or preparing and serving such meals for consumption at tables in dining rooms on the premises.\u201d ABC Reg. \u00a7 51 (d) (3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Manifestly, the central objective of the legal scheme is to create a class of licensees.whose business is primarily that of food service and who, in order to offer a full range of that service, may incidentally sell alcoholic beverages. To ensure that \u201cmixed beverage restaurant\u201d licensees retain their character as \u201cbona fide, full-service restaurants\u201d (as distinguished from bars or saloons offering food only incidentally to the sale of alcohol), the Commission has promulgated regulations prescribing certain standards for a licensee\u2019s equipment and furnishings. These standards include those for minimal lighting and accessibility, Reg. \u00a7\u00a742 and 41(c); minimum surface area of tables, Reg. \u00a7 41(c); and maximum percentage of seating provided at counters, Reg. \u00a7 41 (b2). Moreover, licensees are forbidden to serve alcoholic beverages to patrons not seated at a \u201ctable\" or \u201ccounter\u201d,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and those terms are defined in Reg. \u00a7 41 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-6\">\u201c(bl) \u2018Table\u2019 defined. \u2014 A \u2018table\u2019 shall be considered to be an article of furniture generally having a flat top surface supported by legs, a pedestal or a solid base and designed to accommodate the serving of food and refreshments (though such food and refreshments need not necessarily be served together) and provided with seating for customers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">\u201c(b2) \u2018Counter\u2019 defined. \u2014 While the definition of a \u2018table\u2019 herein-above set forth shall be sufficient to include, a \u2018counter\u2019, insofar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>as the surface area is concerned, a \u2018counter\u2019 shall have characteristics sufficient to make it readily distinguishable from the \u2018tables\u2019 used by a licensee, either by the manner of service and use provided, or by the type of seating provided for patrons, or in both such regards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Finally, the General Assembly has authorized the Commission to suspend or revoke a license for the use of nonconforming equipment. Code \u00a7-4-37(a) (2) (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Against this statutory and regulatory background, the Commission refused to permit licensee to serve alcoholic beverages at its counter. The Commission reasoned that \u201chaving such a game played on the counter would render it a gaming device and not a table designed to accommodate the serving of food and refreshments. Further, the game involves the throwing of dice and could involve illegal gambling.\u201d In a letter to licensee\u2019s counsel, the Commission\u2019s Secretary further explained that the Commission felt the use of counters \u201cdesigned as much, if not more so, for amusement purposes than food service\u201d should be limited \u201clest the bona fide, full service restaurant concept envisioned by the General Assembly in the Mixed Beverage Laws be unduly jeopardized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">It is true, as licensee says, that the literal definitions in Reg. \u00a7 41 do not require that tables or counters be designed <em>solely </em>or <em>primarily </em>to accommodate the service of food and refreshments. But such a requirement would be virtually futile; it would be difficult, if not impossible, to design a \u201cflat top surface\u201d which would accommodate the service of food and drink but not the playing of most board games. The definitions must necessarily be construed and applied to support \u201cthe purposes of the basic law\u201d, and the interpretation made by the Commission vested with the authority to administer the law is entitled to special weight in the courts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201cThe rationale of the statutory scheme is that the [administrative agency] shall apply expert discretion to the matters coming within its cognizance, and judicial interference is permissible only for relief against the arbitrary or capricious action that constitutes a clear abuse of the delegated discretion. The reviewing judicial authority may not exercise anew the jurisdiction of the administrative agency and merely substitute its own independent judgment for that of the body entrusted by the Legislature with the administrative function.\u201d <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Board of Adjustment of City of Newark, </em>9 N.J. 405, 423, 88 A.2d 607, 615-16 (1952), quoted with approval in <em>Board of Zoning Appeals </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>201 Va. 942, 948, 114 S.E.2d 753, 758 (1960).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>Taking \u201cdue account of the presumption of official regularity, the experience and specialized competence of the [Commission], and the purposes of the basic law under which the [Commission] has acted\u201d, we are of opinion that its ruling cannot \u201creasonably be said... to be [beyond] the scope of [its] legal authority\u201d, Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17, and we hold that the reviewing court erred in concluding that its action was arbitrary and capricious.
