J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AFY\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-12\">In this appeal, Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO) challenges the State Corporation Commission\u2019s disallowance of a fuel cost adjustment reflecting fuel costs incurred because of a shut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>down of the Surry Number 2 nuclear unit for 9.6 days in November 1977. The Commission determined that the shutdown was caused by a leak in a steam generator tube, that the energy replacement cost resulting from the outage was $4,696,766, and that the cost charged to Virginia jurisdictional customers through VEPCO\u2019s fuel adjustment clause was $3,287,736. The Commission ruled that VEPCO\u2019s evidence failed to support the reasonableness of the additional fuel costs incurred and ordered that $3,287,736 be refunded to Virginia customers in the form of a credit through VEPCO\u2019s 1979 fuel cost adjustment clause. Claiming that the Commission incorrectly applied the governing principles of law, VEPCO contends that the leak in the steam generator tube resulted from human error, rather than imprudent management. In addition, VEPCO asserts that the duration of the outage was dictated by an entirely independent problem, a leaking pressurized valve, and that it should be allowed to recover the fuel costs associated with this concurrent problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">Subject to review by the Commission, electric utility companies are authorized to pass along to consumers increases in their fuel costs. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 56-249.3, -249.4, and -249.6. Because nuclear energy is substantially cheaper than other sources for generating electricity, VEPCO and other electric utility companies attempt to maximize the use of their nuclear generators. Whenever nuclear generators are being serviced, VEPCO\u2019s fuel costs increase. These increases are reflected in its fuel adjustment clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">Prior to 1977, VEPCO\u2019s Surry Nuclear Units 1 and 2 began experiencing a high number of forced shutdowns due to the denting and subsequent cracking of steam generator tubes because of corrosion of the tube support plates. These tube failures result in the leakage of radioactive coolant from the primary system of the generating unit into a non-radioactive secondary system.. Such tube leakage requires a forced shutdown, at which time the defective tube is located and plugged to prevent additional leakage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">In conjunction with Westinghouse Electric Corporation, VEPCO devised a plan to avoid such tube failures. The developed program included a computer prediction of areas where tube failures would be likely and an instrument probe of only those areas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In probing the tubes, field operators use an Eddy Current probe, which generates an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>electrical signal producing an oscilloscope picture recorded \u00f3n magnetic tape. This signal is also recorded on a strip chart, on which field operators mark the identity of the probed tube. The tape and strip chart are then reviewed by an interpreter, who is responsible for determining whether further investigation of a tube is warranted. To minimize the duration of an outage, the interpreter works long hours during inspections. He reports his findings on an Eddy Current Test Sequence data sheet. Substantially dented tubes (those not allowing passage of a .610-inch probe) are then plugged, and slightly dented tubes (those not allowing passage of a .650-inch probe but allowing passage of a .610-inch probe) are scheduled for reinspection at the next scheduled shutdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-4\">In March 1977, pursuant to VEPCO\u2019s new inspection program, workers inspected the steam generator tubes at the Surry Unit Number 2. In September 1977, another inspection of the tubes at this unit was conducted, and the unit was brought back into service on October 12. On November 18, VEPCO was forced to shut down operations at Surry Unit Number 2 because of a leaking steam generator tube in its \u201cA\u201d generator. This unit was inoperative for 9.6 days. The leaking tube, R5C26 (row 5, column 26), had been probed in March 1977. Since that inspection revealed that this tube was slightly dented, it had been scheduled for reinspection in September. No inspection of R5C26 took place in September, however. Although no strip chart or oscilloscope trace existed for tube R5C26, the interpreter incorrectly noted that it had been examined and was determined to be \u201cO.K.\u201d According to VEPCO\u2019s Director of Nuclear Operations, the interpreter \u201cjust probably was going too fast and it was a long day and he put down data that did not exist.\u201d A total of 6,144 tubes was scheduled for inspection in September; this total included 421 tubes examined in March and scheduled for reinspection because of the March probe results.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">After the shutdown, VEPCO instituted a procedure for double-checking tube inspections. The new procedure involves a comparison of the strip charts and the Eddy Current Test Sequence data sheet. Furthermore, the new procedure also calls for greater scrutiny of tubes determined to be slightly dented.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">Code \u00a7 56-249.4(B)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requires the Commission to \u201creview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>and evaluate\u201d information concerning fuel cost adjustments and to disallow any increases that \u201ccannot be supported\u201d by testimony received at the quarterly hearings and by information submitted by the utility. The parties to this appeal agree that the Commission is empowered to disallow any expenses resulting from managerial inefficiency, waste, imprudence, or abuse of discretion. <em>See West Ohio Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>294 U.S. 63, 72 (1935); <em>Norfolk </em>v. <em>Chesapeake, Etc., Tel. Co., </em>192 Va. 292, 311-13, 64 S.E.2d 772, 783-84 (1951).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> VEPCO contends, however, that the Commission did not properly apply this principle in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">In its opinion of November 2, 1979, the Commission determined that, although VEPCO\u2019s management provided checks upon the work of the field operators conducting the Eddy Current probe, it failed to provide any safeguards against possible errors by the interpreter. The Commission noted that VEPCO produced no evidence indicating that the costs of providing such a safeguard were economically unfeasible. The Commission also determined that, in light of the severe economic consequences flowing from a single error by the interpreter, VEPCO\u2019s failure to provide a check upon possible interpreter error was an imprudent managerial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">VEPCO argues that the Commission should have considered the overall performance of the program designed to eliminate the problems associated with tube denting. The overall performance of the program, however, was not at issue. The issue before the Commission was whether VEPCO\u2019s management was imprudent in failing to provide a check upon the interpreter, who the company knew worked long hours and whose work was critical to the avoidance of costly shutdowns. The Commission could properly determine that VEPCO\u2019s failure to provide such a safeguard was an imprudent management decision even though the overall program, had been successful in sharply reducing the number of forced shutdowns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">Whether additional fuel costs have resulted from imprudent management is a question of fact generally reserved for the Commission. The Commission\u2019s findings of fact are presumed to be correct; those challenging such findings must carry the heavy burden of demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>strating that the Commission\u2019s ruling is contrary to the evidence or without evidence to support it. <em>Shenandoah S&amp;L </em>v. <em>Front Royal S&amp;L, </em>220 Va. 718, 721-22, 261 S.E.2d 325, 328 (1980). Because VEPCO has failed to carry that burden, we affirm the Commission\u2019s ruling that VEPCO may not recover from its Virginia customers the additional fuel costs occasioned by the failure to provide a safeguard against interpreter error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-4\">VEPCO also contends that the Commission erred in its calculation of the amount of the fuel costs resulting from the tube leakage. VEPCO argues that, although the tube leak \u201cnecessitated an outage. . .on November 18, 1977,\u201d a leak in a pressurized valve was a \u201cseparate and independent circumstance requiring the outage.\u201d VEPCO thus concludes that it should be allowed to recoup the replacement fuel costs associated with the entire outage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">In a report filed with the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) four days after the shutdown, VEPCO notified the NRC of the tube leakage and did not mention a concurrent cause of the shutdown. In VEPCO\u2019s quarterly fuel hearing before the Commission in March 1978, the Commission directed VEPCO to file a report on \u201cthe forced outage\u201d at Surry Unit 2, including information concerning steps taken \u201cto minimize the possibility of similar occurrences in the future\u201d and \u201creplacement energy costs associated with the outage.\u201d In a response dated March 31, 1978, VEPCO replied that replacement cost \u201cassociated with the forced outage of Surry Unit 2 for the period November 18-27, 1977 is $4,696,766.\u201d VEPCO\u2019s report addressed only measures taken to rectify the problem of tube leaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">In the Commission\u2019s hearing held on June 25, 1979, VEPCO\u2019s Director of Nuclear Operations testified, however, concerning \u201c[a]nother thing I might mention.\u201d The Director suggested that a pressurized valve leak, discovered three days prior to the tube leak, \u201cin all probability\u201d would have necessitated a shutdown \u201cin a few days.\u201d The Director also testified that work on the valve leak began as soon as possible after the shutdown for the tube leak and that the outage would have lasted only 4.5 days if workers had solely remedied the tube leak. Prior to this time, no VEPCO official had indicated that there was a concurrent cause for the shutdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">In its opinion, the Commission stated that it was faced \u201cwith conflict, or at least ambiguity,\u201d concerning energy replacement costs associated with the tube leak. It viewed the VEPCO report, which did not mention the valve leak, as inconsistent with the Director\u2019s testimony. The Commission concluded that it was fully warranted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>relying upon VEPCO\u2019s report dated March 31, 1978. VEPCO, on the other hand, argues that there is no conflict between the March 31 report and the Director\u2019s testimony. Further, VEPCO claims that it was not obliged to forward to the Commission information concerning the valve leak because the Commission\u2019s inquiry focused upon the tube leak only.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">We agree with the Commission that there is an inconsistency between the March report and the Director\u2019s testimony. VEPCO\u2019s failure to mention in its report to the Commission that a valve leak was a concurrent cause of the forced outage and VEPCO\u2019s nineteen-month delay in mentioning the valve'leak significantly undermine its claims. It is also significant that in setting forth measures taken \u201cto minimize the possibility of similar occurrences in the future,\u201d VEPCO restricted its response to the tube problem. VEPCO claims, however, in its reply brief that the Commission\u2019s inquiry was \u201cclearly directed to consideration of the steam generator inspection and plugging program.\u201d Since the scope of the Commission\u2019s inquiry was so clear, it was incumbent upon VEPCO to respond with equal clarity. VEPCO either should have confined its answer concerning \u201creplacement energy costs associated with the forced outage\u201d to the costs associated with the tube leak or should have noted that the forced outage resulted from a concurrent cause. In light of the clear focus of the inquiry, VEPCO\u2019s response can be properly construed as a claim that the costs occasioned by the tube leak amounted to $4,696,766. Although the Director\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with the March report, we cannot conclude that the Commission\u2019s finding of fact concerning the costs associated with the tube leak was \u201ccontrary to the evidence or without evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Shenandoah S&amp;L </em>v. <em>Front Royal S&amp;L, </em>220 Va. at 722, 261 S.E.2d at 328 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, the Commission\u2019s order is</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1092-7\"><em> </em>An inspection of all steam generator tubes of a nuclear unit would have been a massive task.
