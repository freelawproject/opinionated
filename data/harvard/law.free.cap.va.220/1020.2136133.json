Burns, formerly Estelle B. Batleman, administratrix d.b.n.c.t.a. of the estate of her late husband, Dr. Bernard B. Batleman, appeals from a decree determining, <em>inter alia, </em>Dr. Batleman\u2019s interest in an investment venture named the Equitable Associates. We are asked to review the chancellor\u2019s rulings as to the nature and extent of that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-8\">The Equitable Associates was formed in 1963 when Dr. Batleman and others decided to purchase a leasehold estate in land in Norfolk. Created in 1903, the leasehold was a 20-year term perpetually renewable so long as the lessee fulfilled certain covenants. Pursuant to the requirements of the lease, an office building, known as the Equitable Building, had been built and maintained by a previous lessee. The lessor held a power of termination conditioned upon the lessee\u2019s breach of any covenant that remained uncured for sixty days after notice from the lessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-9\">Instead of acquiring the leasehold in their own names, the investors had the leasehold conveyed by deed from the seller to Robert C. Nusbaum as trustee. Citing Code \u00a7 55-17.1,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the recorded conveyance did not name the beneficiaries of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>An unrecorded agreement among the trustee, the investors, and S. L. Nusbaum and Company, Incorporated (the Nusbaum Co.), detailed the investment plan. The Nusbaum Co. was appointed management agent to lease the office space and to attend to the daily operation of the building. In addition, the Nusbaum Co. supplied 25 percent ($5000) of the original cash invested. Dr. Batleman and his brother-in-law, Dr. Harold A. Epstein, each invested $2500 or 12.5 percent of the total. The remaining 50 percent was divided among three individuals named Belkov, Myers, and Burton. The agreement specified that the investors would hold their fractional beneficial interests as tenants in common. Each beneficial owner was entitled upon demand to a deed from the trustee conveying legal title to his undivided interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">Shortly after the venture was formed, the Nusbaum Co. declared that it was holding its 25 percent interest as nominee for V. H. Nusbaum, Jr., Robert C. Nusbaum, Stanley L. Harrison, and Henry A. Shook (collectively, the Nusbaum Group), each of whom had an equal stake in the venture. Within a few months, H. H. B., Inc. (HHB), a corporation formed and owned by Dr. Batleman, Dr. Epstein, and Dr. Batleman\u2019s father, had purchased the 50 percent originally held by Belkov, Myers, and Burton. This brought to 75 percent the total interest of the Batleman Group, <em>i.e., </em>HHB and Drs. Batleman and Epstein. With Epstein\u2019s approval, Dr. Batleman, who was president of HHB and who routinely made investment and financial decisions for his brother-in-law, represented the Batleman Group in all its dealings with the Nusbaum Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">Rental income from the office building usually was insufficient to cover operating expenses, taxes, insurance, and mortgage payments. Consequently, the Nusbaum Co. advanced money to fund the deficits and then called upon the investors for reimbursements according to their respective interests. Dr. Batleman made reimbursements greater than one eighth of the losses in 1966, 1970, and 1972. For those years, he paid 75 percent of the deficits, or the entire amount owed by the Batleman Group. Financial records of the Equitable Associates reveal that Dr. Batleman\u2019s disproportionate payments increased his share of the total \u201ccapital\u201d, or equity, while the shares of HHB and Dr. Epstein decreased ratably. The Nusbaum. Group always paid 25 percent of the losses, and its share of capital remained constant at 25 percent. The Equitable Associates\u2019 financial statement for the year ending December 31, 1972 allocated to Dr. Batleman approximately 61 percent of the total capital account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">Dr. Batleman died on December 19, 1972. In his will, he left one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>third of his net personal estate to his wife. The residue of his estate was devised and bequeathed to his parents \u201cfor. . .their joint lives, with the remainder to the survivor of them.\u201d Dr. Batleman\u2019s father qualified as executor, but he died on July 1, 1973. His widow passed away shortly thereafter, leaving a daughter, Beatrice B. Epstein (Dr. Epstein\u2019s wife), as sole beneficiary. Thus, Mrs. Epstein became entitled to that portion of Dr. Batleman\u2019s estate willed to his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-4\">Estelle Batleman elected to renounce her husband\u2019s will and to claim her statutory share of his estate. Accordingly, she is entitled, under Code \u00a7 64.1-16, to one half of the surplus of Dr. Batleman\u2019s personal estate. After the death of Dr. Batleman\u2019s father, she qualified as administratrix d.b.n.c.t.a. of Dr. Batleman\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">In November 1974, Mrs. Batleman, in her individual capacity and as administratrix, filed a bill of complaint requesting, <em>inter alia, </em>a determination of the \u201cextent and character of Decedent\u2019s interest in the Equitable Associates and its liability to pay this estate the value of Decedent\u2019s share.. .as well as any unrepaid advances\u201d. Among defendants named were Dr. Epstein, Mrs. Epstein, and the Equitable Associates; HHB and the individual members of the Nusbaum Group were not included.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">Mrs. Batleman contended that Dr. Batleman\u2019s interest in the Equitable Associates was personalty. It appears from the report of the commissioner in chancery that this contention was premised upon the theory that the trust <em>res, </em>a leasehold, was personal property. Mrs. Batleman also claimed that the Equitable Associates was a partnership and that Dr. Batleman\u2019s contributions, insofar as they exceeded one eighth of the venture\u2019s losses, had increased his ownership interest from the original 12.5 percent. Deciding that the Equitable Associates was not a partnership and that the leasehold was realty, the commissioner ruled that Dr. Batleman\u2019s interest was that of a tenant in common with an undivided interest in real estate. Because not all the investors were before the court, the commissioner refrained from deciding the extent of Dr. Batleman\u2019s interest. These rulings were affirmed by the chancellor who, by decree entered April 27, 1977, declared that Dr. Batleman\u2019s interest in the leasehold \u201cwas not a partnership interest, but was an undivided interest of a tenant in common in real estate\u201d. The decree continued the cause to allow interested parties to intervene, but purported to be final \u201cas to the matters adjudicated\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">In the meantime, the leasehold had been sold in 1976 for $175,000. Pursuant to agreement among all interested parties, the net proceeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>were placed in escrow. This proceeding subsequently focused upon distribution of the escrowed fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">In May 1977, HHB and all members of the Nusbaum Group intervened. Mrs. Batleman asserted a dower interest in her husband\u2019s one-eighth share and, as administratrix, claimed an \u201cequitable lien\u201d for $58,279.54, which she alleged was the amount of. Dr. Batleman\u2019s \u201cexcess contributions\u201d. The other investors maintained that such contributions had increased Dr. Batleman\u2019s share of the equity in the venture. Members of the Nusbaum Group contended they were entitled to compensation for more than $87,000 they allegedly had paid to cover the venture\u2019s losses after Dr. Batleman\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">Concerning the Nusbaum Group\u2019s claim for funds advanced, V. H. Nusbaum testified that, by May 1975, the Nusbaum Co. had advanced almost $82,000, not including $5,480.31 members of the group had repaid the company since Dr. Batleman died. In July of 1975, the members of the Nusbaum Group borrowed $80,000 in order to further reimburse the Nusbaum Co. According to V. H. Nusbaum, $60,000, or 75 percent of the loan, was applied to \u201cthe collective interest of\u201d the Batleman Group. Nusbaum further testified that, through December 1975, the Batleman Group owed $87,689.16 excluding any interest on the $80,000 loan. The Nusbaum Co. did not charge the investors interest on the funds it advanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">Evidence regarding the nature of Dr. Batleman\u2019s \u201cexcess contributions\u201d consisted of financial records and the testimony of Dr. Epstein and Louis Wasserman, accountant for the Equitable Associates and the three members of the Batleman Group. As noted earlier, the Equitable Associates\u2019 financial statements showed that Dr. Batleman\u2019s payments increased his percentage of the equity in the venture. Dr. Batleman\u2019s share of the net profits or losses did not always correspond with his proportion of equity. For income tax purposes, Dr. Batleman claimed the losses stated in the records of the Equitable Associates. According to Wasserman, Dr. Batleman\u2019s payments of the Batleman Group\u2019s entire obligation increased his share of total capital while the shares of HHB and Dr. Epstein decreased. Wasserman also testified that the financial records of the members of the Batleman Group did not show that the other members were indebted to Dr. Batleman as a result of his disproportionate payments. Dr. Epstein testified that his brother-in-law had \u201chandled\u201d HHB\u2019s affairs until he died, that \u201cwhatever [Dr. Batleman] wanted to do was fine with me\u201d, and that Dr. Batleman had never demanded payment from either him or HHB for any funds paid on their behalf. Dr. Epstein, who succeeded Dr. Batleman as president of HHB, explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>Dr. Batleman had increased his ownership interest and, while expressing some uncertainty, acknowledged that Dr. Batleman had \u201cacquired\u201d his additional interest from him and HHB.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-4\">Citing Code \u00a7 55-2, which provides in part that \u201c[n]o estate of inheritance or freehold or for a term of more than five years in lands shall be conveyed unless by deed or will\u201d, the chancellor ruled by letter opinion that the investors\u2019 proportions of ownership had not been altered by any \u201cadvancements\u201d. He also ruled that, from the escrowed fund, the Nusbaum Co. should be compensated to the extent it had not already been reimbursed and that the members of the Nusbaum Group should be reimbursed for 75 percent of the $80,000 loan. Mrs. Batleman objected on the ground that Dr. Batleman\u2019s disproportionate payments, like the payments made by the Nusbaum Group, should be treated as advances, but the chancellor overruled her objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">On February 17, 1978, the chancellor entered a decree adjudicating the parties\u2019 rights in the fund. The Nusbaum Co. was awarded $27,689.15 as compensation for operating expenses paid, plus $10,202.07 as reimbursement for 75 percent of the interest on the loan. (Apparently, the Nusbaum Co., not the Nusbaum Group, had paid the interest.) The decree provided that, aside from their individual shares, members of the Nusbaum Group would receive $60,000 collectively. This left $51,548.94 for distribution based upon the investors\u2019 ownership interests. Dr. Batleman\u2019s 12.5 percent interest, payable to Mrs. Epstein subject to claims of the estate\u2019s creditors, amounted to $6,443.62. From this sum, Mrs. Batleman, individually, was awarded dower of $1,271.75. The chancellor in no way compensated the estate or Mrs. Epstein for Dr. Batleman\u2019s having paid more than one eighth of the losses in 1966, 1970, and 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">On appeal, the administratrix maintains the court erred in ruling that Dr. Batleman\u2019s interest was realty and in not indemnifying the estate for \u201chis advances or disproportionate capital payments\u201d. She does not claim that his ownership interest exceeded 12.5 percent. Mrs. Epstein assigns cross-error to the ruling that the ownership interest was only 12.5 percent. Also assigning cross-error, the Nusbaum Co. and members of the Nusbaum Group contend that the chancellor should have allowed them to recover the remaining 25 percent of the interest paid on the $80,000 loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">Before discussing the merits, we address three procedural points raised by appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-8\">Asserting that Mrs. Batleman stands to gain personally if this appeal is successful, appellees first argue that she, in her individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>capacity, is a \u201cnecessary party\u201d to this appeal. We disagree. If the administratrix prevails, the estate will directly benefit; any benefit to Mrs. Batleman will be indirect. The personal representative, not a beneficiary of the estate, is the proper party to litigate on behalf of the estate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Graveley </em>v. <em>Graveley, </em>84 Va. 145, 153, 4 S.E. 218, 221 (1887); see <em>Isbell </em>v. <em>Flippen, </em>185 Va. 977, 981, 41 S.E.2d 31, 33 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">Next, appellees maintain that Mrs. Batleman, as administratrix, should not be allowed to prosecute this appeal because her interests allegedly conflict with those of Mrs. Epstein. Appellees view Mrs. Epstein as a beneficiary of Dr. Batleman\u2019s estate since she \u201cstands in [her parents\u2019] shoes\u201d. The conflict, if any, between the administratrix and Mrs. Epstein existed in the circuit court, but no one there attempted to prevent the administratrix\u2019s conduct of this suit. Following entry of the February 17, 1978 decree, appellees did assert that a conflict existed, but they sought no ruling on the point. The challenge they make here comes too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">Appellees further contend that the decree of April 27, 1977 was final as to the issues whether Dr. Batleman\u2019s interest was personalty and whether the investment venture was a partnership. Appellees argue that the administratrix may not attack the decisions on these issues since she did not timely appeal from that decree. The fallacy of their argument is that the 1977 decree was not a final order, <em>i.e., </em>\u201c \u2018 \u201cone which disposes of the whole subject, gives all the relief contemplated, provides with reasonable completeness for giving effect to the sentence, and leaves nothing to be done in the cause save to superintend ministerially the execution of the order.\u201d 4 Minor\u2019s Institutes, 860.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Truck Corporation, </em>205 Va. 579, 585, 139 S.E.2d 31, 35 (1964), quoting <em>March\u2019t &amp; Taylor </em>v. <em>Mathews Co., </em>139 Va. 723, 734, 124 S.E. 420, 423 (1924).</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">Turning to the substantive issues, we initially consider whether the chancellor erred in holding that Dr. Batleman\u2019s interest in the investment venture was realty. To support her claim that the interest was personalty, the administratrix argues (1) that the trust was a \u201cVirginia Land Trust\u201d in which, she asserts, a beneficiary\u2019s interest must be personalty,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) that Dr. Batleman\u2019s interest was an interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>in a partnership, and (3) that the leasehold held in trust was a chattel real and not real property. The last argument is logically primary; if the leasehold is personalty, the investors\u2019 interests must be personalty regardless of the organizational form assumed by the group.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-4\">The leasehold in question is an estate for years, albeit one subject to perpetual renewal. At common law, an estate for years was considered personalty which, for purposes of distribution, passed to a deceased lessee\u2019s personal representative. <em>Prince William </em>v. <em>Thomason Park, </em>197 Va. 861, 867, 91 S.E.2d 441, 446 (1956). Absent statutory modification, this remains the law in Virginia. <em>Id. </em>The question is whether the renewability of the leasehold in this case somehow makes it real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">Answering this question affirmatively, the commissioner in chancery relied upon <em>Norfolk </em>v. <em>Perry Co., </em>108 Va. 28, 61 S.E. 867 (1908), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>220 U.S. 472 (1911). That case involved a perpetually renewable, 99-year lease made by the City of Norfolk as lessor. The lessees, who had covenanted to pay all \u201cpublic taxes. . . due on [the] land\u201d, challenged the City\u2019s authority to impose a real estate tax on the leasehold. Describing the lessees as \u201cthe substantial and real owners of the property\u201d, the Court ruled that \u201ccertainly for the purposes of taxation, the mere legal title remaining in the landlord will be disregarded and the burden of taxation placed where it belongs, upon the lessee to whom the value and the benefit belongs [sic].\u201d 108 Va. at 30-31, 61 S.E. at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">Appellees contend that the instant case and <em>Perry </em>are \u201cindistinguishable\u201d and that <em>Perry </em>requires us to hold that the leasehold here is realty. We do not agree. The fundamental flaw in appellees\u2019 position is the fact that <em>Perry </em>did not hold that the leasehold there was realty. Rather, <em>Perry </em>decided \u201cthat an owner of a perpetual leasehold <em>may be taxed as though he were the virtual owner of the fee.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> Prince William </em>v. <em>Thomason Park, supra, </em>197 Va. at 868, 91 S.E.2d at 446 (emphasis added). True, the <em>Perry </em>Court did say that the lessees could devise the leasehold \u201cand their heirs will take in case there is no. . .devisee.\u201d 108 Va. at 30, 61 S.E. at 868. This language, unsupported by any authority, is pure dictum.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">We reject that <em>dictum. </em>In Maryland, the first jurisdiction in America <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>in which the perpetually renewable estate for years was used, 2 R. Powell, The Law of Real Property \u00b6 242 [1], at 372.12 (2d ed. 1977), the courts have always held that the lessee\u2019s interest is personalty. <em>Neuman </em>v. <em>Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>271 Md. 636, 641, 319 A.2d 522, 525 (1974); <em>Holzman </em>v. <em>Wager, </em>114 Md. 322, 333, 79 A. 205, 207 (1911). Hence, the fact that an estate for years may be renewed forever does not alter its status as personalty. We are aware that statutes in some states alter the effects of that status. <em>See, e.g., Taylor </em>v. <em>DeBus, </em>31 Ohio St. 468, 472 (1877). But there is no statute in Virginia providing that a perpetually renewable leasehold is to be treated like realty for purposes of 'dower or descent and distribution. Accordingly, we conclude that Dr. Batleman\u2019s interest in the subject leasehold was personal property that passed to his personal representative for administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">We now focus our attention upon the chancellor\u2019s ruling and the parties\u2019 contentions concerning the effect of Dr. Batleman\u2019s payments exceeding his pro rata share of the operating deficits. Mrs. Batleman contends that such payments entitled Dr. Batleman to indemnification if the investors were partners, see Code \u00a7 50-18 (b) and (c),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> or contribution if the investors were simply tenants in common, see <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>211 Va. 797, 799-800, 180 S.E.2d 516, 518 (1971). Mrs. Epstein, on the other hand, maintains that the excess payments increased Dr. Batleman\u2019s ownership interest from the original 12.5 percent. On brief, Dr. Epstein and HHB \u201cconcur\u201d in Mrs. Epstein\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">As we have observed, the final decree made no allowance for the payments in question. This does not mean, however, that the chancellor failed to rule on the question of the legal consequences of the payments. His reasoning on the subject is expressed in his letter opinion. Having stated that Code \u00a7 55-2 \u201cis the authority for determining . . . ownership\u201d, the chancellor held that the statute\u2019s requirements for altering ownership had not been met. Since only Dr. Batleman\u2019s disproportionate payments were relevant to that question, this holding referred to those payments. Moreover, the chancellor\u2019s rejection of the administratrix\u2019s objection to his refusal to treat Dr. Batleman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>payments like those of the Nusbaum Group obviously was a ruling that Dr. Batleman\u2019s disproportionate payments were not advances giving rise to a right to indemnity or contribution. Thus, the scope of the chancellor\u2019s decision regarding the payments is clear; he concluded that they were intended to increase Dr. Batleman\u2019s share of ownership<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but that Code \u00a7 55-2 prevents recognition of the increase. Determination of the nature of Dr. Batleman\u2019s contributions depends upon his intentions and those of the other members of the Batleman Group. What those parties intended was a question of fact. Because credible evidence supports the chancellor\u2019s implicit finding, we affirm his decision that Dr. Batleman\u2019s disproportionate payments were designed to increase his ownership interest. Hence, the issue becomes whether the chancellor\u2019s application of Code \u00a7 55-2 was correct. We believe it was error to apply the statute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-4\">While its Virginian statutory antecedents date back to 1705,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 55-2, sometimes called the statute of conveyances, <em>see, e.g., Smith </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>153 Va. 746, 756, 151 S.E. 295, 298 (1930), apparently is based in part upon section three of the English Statute of Frauds, 29 Chas. II, c. 3 (1677).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In its borrowings from the English Statute,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the General Assembly has never adopted sections seven through nine. Section seven required all \u201cdeclarations or creations of trusts. . .of any lands, tenements or herditaments\u201d to \u201cbe manifested and proved\u201d by a signed writing or the will of the settlor. Section eight exempted trusts arising by operation of law, <em>i.e., </em>resulting and constructive trusts, from the requirements of section seven. The ninth section of the English Statute mandated that \u201cgrants and assignments\u201d of trusts \u201cbe in writing, signed by the party granting or assigning. . .or by such last will or devise\u201d. Thus, as section seven prohibited oral trusts in realty, section nine proscribed oral transfers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>of the interest of a trust beneficiary, G. G. Bogert &amp; G. T. Bogert, Trusts and Trustees \u00a7 190 (2d rev. ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">The omission of sections seven and eight compelled this Court in 1915 to hold that our statute of frauds does not bar the establishment by parol of an express trust in land. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>117 Va. 433, 84 S.E. 637 (1915). A statute identical to Code \u00a7 55-2 existed then (Code of 1887, \u00a7 2413), but the Court did not mention that portion of the statute of frauds as an impediment to the oral creation of a trust. Rather, the major point of debate, see 117 Va. at 438, 84 S.E. at 639, was whether an oral trust in land was precluded by the provision that \u201c[n]o action shall be brought upon. . .any contract for the sale of real estate, or for the lease thereof for more than a year unless it be in writing.\u201d But we cannot assume the Court was ignorant of the then existing predecessor to \u00a7 55-2. Some two years after deciding <em>Young, </em>this Court referred to that statute as part of our statute of frauds. <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Goria Bros., </em>121 Va. 491, 504, 93 S.E. 675, 679 (1917). And before <em>Young, </em>the Court had held that the same statute did not apply to a parol trust in the proceeds of realty. <em>Riggan\u2019s Adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Riggan, </em>93 Va. 78, 90, 24 S.E. 920, 924 (1896). It is clear, therefore, that the holding in <em>Young </em>signifies that the statutory language \u201c[n]o estate of inheritance or freehold or for a term of more than five years in lands shall be conveyed unless by deed or will\u201d does not apply to the creation of a trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">Despite the manifest import of <em>Young, </em>it was suggested in <em>Brame </em>v. <em>Read, </em>136 Va. 219, 224, 118 S.E. 117, 119 (1923), that to permit one holding legal title to land to create a trust by oral declaration alone, <em>i.e., </em>without a contemporaneous transfer of legal title by deed as had occurred in <em>Young, </em>\u201cwould be to convey an estate in land by parol, which is expressly prohibited by statute.\u201d <em>Brame\u2019s </em>suggestion is inexplicable <em>dictum. </em>The <em>Brame </em>Court had already expressly reaffirmed the <em>Young </em>rule. 136 Va. at 221, 118 S.E. at 118. Nothing in <em>Young </em>indicates that the Court viewed the written conveyance of legal title as essential to the rule announced there. As one commentator has acutely observed, \u201c[i]t is difficult to justify the distinctions drawn. . . . If. . .the statute. . .precludes establishment of the oral trust in the [situation envisioned by the <em>Brame </em>Court] it should also preclude establishment of the trust in the <em>[Young] </em>situation, because in both situations the beneficial interests in the land are orally transferred to the <em>cestui que trust.\u201d </em>J. Ritchie, N. Alford &amp; R. Effland, Cases and Materials on Decedents\u2019 Estates and Trusts 511 (5th ed. 1977). The indefensibility of the <em>Brame dictum </em>is highlighted by the fact that the case relied upon by <em>Brame, Jesser </em>v. <em>Armentrout, </em>100 Va. 666, 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>S.E. 681 (1902), explicitly left undecided the question whether a trust in land could be created orally. We conclude that <em>Brame </em>left the full import of <em>Young </em>unimpaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-4\">Given that Code \u00a7 55-2 does not bar the <em>establishment </em>of an oral trust in land or in a leasehold for more than five years, we see no reason why the statute should operate to bar the oral <em>transfer </em>of a beneficiary\u2019s interest in a trust. A settlor\u2019s creation of an oral trust for the benefit of another is, like a transfer by a beneficiary, a conveyance of an equitable interest. In addition, we attach significance to the legislature\u2019s omission from our statutes of section nine of the English Statute. As the exclusion of sections seven and eight implies a legislative decision to permit oral trusts, the absence of a proscription equivalent to section nine evinces a legislative intent to allow beneficiaries to convey their interests without a writing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 138 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">The investors in the case at bar were, of course, beneficiaries of a trust. Transfers of their beneficial interests were not, -as between transferor and transferee, barred by Code \u00a7 55-2.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that the chancellor erred in applying the statute to preclude recognition of the transfers from HHB and Dr. Epstein to Dr. Batleman. We will remand the case for determination of the final interests of these three investors, and Dr. Batleman\u2019s interest in the escrowed fund will be administered as part of his personal estate.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">Next, we consider the cross-error assigned by the Nusbaum Co. and the Nusbaum Group. The chancellor ordered that the company be reimbursed from the escrowed fund for 75 percent of the interest paid on the $80,000 loan. Reimbursement was limited because the chancellor found that only three quarters of the loan proceeds had been used to cover the Batleman Group\u2019s obligation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>that the other 25 percent was attributable to the Nusbaum Group\u2019s obligation. These appellees now contend that the award to the Nusbaum Co. should have included the other 25 percent of the interest on the loan. They argue that, because the Batleman Group\u2019s cumulative obligations to fund the deficits subsequent to Dr. Batleman\u2019s death (including those accruing after the company had received the loan proceeds) exceeded $80,000, all the loan proceeds benefitted the Batleman Group. We do not find this argument persuasive. V. H. Nusbaum, president of the Nusbaum Co. and a member of the Nusbaum Group, acknowledged that only $60,000 was \u201capplied to . . . the collective interest\u201d of the Batleman Group. He also testified that the company did not charge the investors interest on funds it advanced. This evidence supports the chancellor\u2019s finding concerning interest, and we affirm his ruling on this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-4\">Finally, we raise <em>sua sponte </em>an issue of costs on this appeal. Having substantially prevailed here, the administratrix is entitled to recover her legitimate costs. But she may not recover costs of reproducing \u201cparts of the record . . . included in the appendix unnecessarily at [her] direction\u201d. Rule 5:38. Some 80 percent of the appendix was designated by the administratrix. Of this portion, approximately one half is immaterial to the issues on appeal. Accordingly, we impose upon her the burden of 40 percent of the cost of producing the appendix. Other costs will be borne by appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1183-10\"> When the leasehold was conveyed, Code \u00a7 55-17.1 read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1183-11\">\u201cNo trust relating to real estate shall fail nor shall any use relating to real estate be defeated because no beneficiaries are specified by name in the recorded deed of conveyance to the trustee or because no duties are imposed upon the trustee.

She did initially contend that the Equitable Associates was a partnership, but she then was claiming that the disproportionate payments had increased Dr. Batleman\u2019s equitable ownership. After entry of the 1977 decree, she maintained that Dr. Batleman\u2019s ownership had not been increased beyond the original 12.5 percent, but that his \u201cexcess contribution\u201d gave his estate an \u201cequitable lien\u201d of $58,279.54 upon the sales proceeds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1191-5\"> Dr. Batleman\u2019s share was augmented by transfers of portions of the shares of HHB and Dr. Epstein.

No error is assigned to that ruling. Hence, we do not consider the administratrix\u2019s assertion, grounded in partnership law, see Code \u00a7\u00a7 50-31(4), -43, that the value of Dr. Batleman\u2019s interest should be determined as of the date of his death. And, since resolution of the question whether the Equitable Associates was a partnership is not necessary to disposition of the issues properly before us, we do not review that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
