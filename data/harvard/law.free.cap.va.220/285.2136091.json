Kayhoe, in its own behalf, and on behalf of C &amp; T\u2019s unpaid suppliers and subcontractors<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, sought to recoup and recover partial payments made by Kayhoe to the subcontractor. C &amp; T, in turn, paid these funds over to Bank, which held a perfected security interest in and to certain contract rights, accounts receivable and the proceeds therefrom of C &amp; T. The trial court, after hearing the case on stipulations of fact, entered judgment for Bank and the general contractor appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">Kayhoe was the general contractor on two construction projects involving commercial property in Henrico County. In August, 1975, Kayhoe and C &amp; T entered into two written agreements, one for each project, whereby C &amp; T undertook, for an agreed consideration in each instance, to provide all labor, material, equipment, tools and services necessary to install all plumbing, heating, air conditioning, ventilation and electrical equipment required by the plans and specifications for each project. C &amp; T, because of financial difficulties, ceased doing business on January 12, 1976. It filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy on February 26,1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>When it abandoned its contracts with Kayhoe on January 12, 1976, C &amp; T was indebted to thirteen suppliers and subcontractors Tor materials furnished or services performed on the Kayhoe projects. These unpaid suppliers and subcontractors notified Kayhoe and the property owners of their respective claims. At the time this action was instituted, they were in the process of perfecting their mechanic\u2019s liens on the real estate. This action was originally instituted by Kayhoe against C &amp; T and Bank, but a nonsuit was subsequently entered on the claim against C &amp; T.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">For a number of years prior to August, 1975, and thereafter until the following December, Bank had been lending money to C &amp; T. These loans were secured by a security interest in C &amp; T\u2019s accounts receivable, contract rights and the proceeds therefrom, with exceptions not relevant here, pursuant to an \u201cAccounts Receivable and Contract Rights Security Agreement\u201d dated February 26, 1966. It was stipulated that the security interest under this agreement was duly perfected and continued by the requisite filings under the effective provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Upon receipt of money subject to the security interest, C &amp; T deposited such receipts in a special account designated \u201ccollateral account\u201d at the Bank. The funds so deposited were applied by Bank to repayment of its loans to C &amp; T.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">C &amp; T\u2019s total contract price for the two projects was $51,657. Progress payments on the projects totaling $43,574.26 were made by Kayhoe to C &amp; T and deposited by it in the collateral account. Between August 11, 1975, and January 2, 1976, loans totaling $524,000 were extended to C &amp; T by Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">At the time the progress payments on the two projects were deposited in the collateral account and applied by Bank to reduce C &amp; T\u2019s loans, Bank was not aware that C &amp; T had faded to meet its obligations to suppliers and subcontractors on the two projects. The Bank, of course, was aware that C &amp; T was obligated by its agreement with Bank to deposit payments received from almost all of its accounts receivable and contract rights in the collateral account.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Here, as before the trial court, the general contractor argues two legal theories under which it says it was entitled to recover the payments received by the Bank from the progress payments made by Kayhoe to C &amp; T.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">The primary theory advanced by Kayhoe is that the progress payments made to C &amp; T were \u201cimpressed with a trust for the benefit of those having potential mechanic\u2019s lien claims.\u201d Such a trust, Kayhoe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>says, is created by the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 43-13<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, -19<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In support of its argument, Kayhoe cites cases from three of our sister states, Michigan<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, Texas<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, and Wisconsin<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>. We find these cases inapposite because in each of those jurisdictions the mechanics\u2019 lien statute expressly created a trust in the funds paid over to a contractor or subcontractor for the benefit of his materialmen and laborers.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">No such provision is contained in our statute. In <em>Overstreet </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>193 Va. 104, 67 S.E.2d 875 (1951), we had occasion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>consider a constitutional challenge to Code \u00a7 43-13. There we pointed out that the statute created \u201ca moral obligation closely akin to a legal trust relation extending to both the owner and to those whose material or labor has entered into a structure, that the compensation paid therefor by the owner should not be misapplied.\u201d 193 Va. at 111, 67 S.E.2d at 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">While this criminal statute creates a moral obligation, it contains no language creating a legal trust for the benefit of materialmen and laborers. Nor does the statute purport to affect or extend the rights and remedies otherwise available in a civil proceeding to materialmen and workmen under the mechanics\u2019 lien statutes. We therefore reject Kayhoe\u2019s trust fund argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Kayhoe\u2019s other argument, closely akin to its trust fund argument, is that Bank\u2019s security interest in C &amp; T\u2019s receivables is subordinate to the liens of C &amp; T\u2019s unpaid materialmen or subcontractors. This argument is grounded in Code \u00a7 43-19, and particularly the last sentence of the statute, which provides: \u201cNo such assignment or transfer shall in any way affect the validity or the priority of satisfaction of liens given by [the mechanics\u2019 lien laws].\u201d Kayhoe also argues that the provisions of Code \u00a7 8.9-310<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> clearly demonstrate the intent of the Uniform Commercial Code that a perfected security interest will not be given priority over liens securing claims arising from work intended to enhance or preserve the value of the collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Again we find no merit in Kayhoe\u2019s position. A mechanic\u2019s lien is purely a creature of statute. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Brumback, </em>177 Va. 36, 39, 12 S.E.2d 801, 802 (1941). It has no existence in the common law, and, independently of statute, is unknown in equity. <em>Burks Pleading and Practice </em>\u00a7 455 (4th ed. 1952). Such a lien is a liability <em>in rem. Fairbanks, Morse &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Cape Charles, </em>144 Va. 56, 61, 131 S.E. 437, 439 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">But the same statutes which create a mechanic\u2019s lien also impose limitations on the amount for which such a lien may be perfected. Code \u00a7 43-7 provides that the amount for which a subcontractor may perfect a lien \u201cshall not exceed the amount in which the owner is indebted to the general contractor at the time the notice is given, or shall thereafter become indebted to the general contractor upon his con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>tract. . . .\u201d In the case of one performing labor or furnishing material to a subcontractor, the \u201clien . . . shall not exceed the amount for which such subcontractor could himself claim a lien. . . .\u201d Code \u00a7 43-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In <em>John T. Wilson Co. </em>v. <em>McManus, </em>162 Va. 130, 173 S.E. 361 (1934), in discussing the same provisions as they appeared in the ancestors of our present statutes, we pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">\u201cIt seems equally clear that the legislature has placed those who under agreement with a subcontractor perform work or furnish material used in the building on the same basis with such subcontractor. Before a subcontractor is entitled to claim a lien on a building he, under his contract with the general contractor, must have performed some work or furnished some material for which the general contractor is under contractual obligation to pay. The maximum amount for which he is entitled to claim a hen is governed by the condition of accounts between the owner and the general contractor at the time notice is given. If the general contractor is not indebted to the subcontractor, the subcontractor is not entitled to a lien. In fixing the amount of the lien to which persons performing labor or furnishing material to a subcontractor are entitled, the legislature has declared that such lien \u2018shall not exceed the amount for which said subcontractor could himself claim a lien.\u2019 The language is plain, unambiguous, and its meaning reasonably clear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">162 Va. at 135, 173 S.E. at 362-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">By thus limiting the amount for which a mechanic\u2019s lien may be perfected by a subcontractor, or by those furnishing labor or materials to him, the General Assembly clearly recognized the practice common in the construction industry of making partial payments while construction is under way<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>. We hold, therefore, that, in the absence of fraud or wrongful conversion, Code \u00a7 43-19 does not affect disbursements against the contract price made before lien notice is given.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Code \u00a7 8.9-310, as can be seen from the italicized language in footnote 7, <em>supra, </em>and the Virginia Comment appended to that statute, has no application here as it deals only with liens attaching to personal property which is still in the possession of one who claims the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">For the reasons set forth below, the judgment of the trial court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-13\"> For purposes of this litigation, Bank has stipulated that Kayhoe has standing to assert the rights of C &amp; T\u2019s unpaid suppliers and subcontractors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-7\"> Code \u00a7 43-13 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">\u201cAny contractor or subcontractor who shall, with intent to defraud, retain or use the funds, or any part thereof, paid by the owner or his agent, the contractor or lender to such contractor or by the owner or his agent, the contractor or lender to a subcontractor under any contract for the construction, removal, repair or improvement of any building or structure permanently annexed to the freehold, for any other purpose than to pay persons performing labor upon or furnishing material for such construction, repair, removal or improvement, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor in appropriating such funds to his own use while any amount for which he may be liable or become liable under his contract for such labor or materials remains unpaid, and may be prosecuted upon complaint of any person or persons who have not been fully paid any amount due them, and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine of not less than five hundred nor more than two thousand dollars, or by confinement in jail not less than thirty days nor more than twelve months, or by both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the jury or the court trying the case without a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The use by any such contractor or subcontractor of any moneys paid to him under the contract, before paying all amounts due or to become due for labor performed or material furnished for such building or structure, for any other purpose than paying such amounts, shall be prima facie evidence of intent to defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">In any prosecution under this section the burden of going forward with the evidence shall be on the defendant to establish that all funds received by the defendant from the owner or his agent, the contractor or lender were used to pay persons performing labor upon or furnishing materials for such construction, repair, removal or improvement.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b448-11\"> Code \u00a7 43-19, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-12\">\u201cEvery assignment or transfer ... by a subcontractor of his contract with the general contractor, in whole or in part, or of any money or consideration coming to him under his contract with the general contractor, and every writ of fieri facias, attachment or other process against ... subcontractor to subject or encumber his interest arising under such contract, shall be subject to the liens given by this chapter to laborers, mechanics, and materialmen.
