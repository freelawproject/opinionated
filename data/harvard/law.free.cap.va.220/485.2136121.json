Tried by a jury on both indictments in a single trial, the defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and of \u201cthe use of a firearm in the commission of a felony.\u201d Sentenced to 12 months in jail and 1 year in the penitentiary, respectively, the defendant is here on an appeal involving only his firearms conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">The record shows that on the evening of June 4, 1978, the defendant attended a dance at the \u201cMusic Note,\u201d a nightclub in Stafford County. There, he engaged with several others in a dice game outside the dance hall. At a point in the game, the defendant accused another participant, Ernest Pollard, of taking $10 of the defendant\u2019s winnings. When Pollard denied taking the money, the defendant said, \u201cI know which road you are going to take and you are going to die tonight.\u201d The defendant left the game and drove away in his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">Later, accompanied by Rosa Lee, Emily Parker, and Virginia Parker, Pollard left the dance and drove into Fauquier County en route to the Parker home. As the vehicle passed a fire tower, Rosa Lee saw the defendant\u2019s car \u201csitting back\u201d in a side road a \u201cfew feet\u201d from the tower. Then, \u201ca shot was fired and it hit [the] rear tire on the left side\u201d of the automobile operated by Pollard. A second shot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>struck the rear of the car, travelled through the trunk and the rear seat, and struck Emily Parker. She was mortally wounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Police investigators discovered \u201can empty cartridge, a 30-30,\u201d in a mudhole in the side road where Rosa Lee had observed the defendant\u2019s automobile. Laboratory tests indicated that a bullet removed from the vehicle occupied by Emily Parker \u201ccould originally have been loaded\u201d in the cartridge case.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">On appeal, the sole question for decision is whether the defendant\u2019s firearms conviction is proper. As has been noted, the defendant was indicted for the use of a firearm while committing <em>murder. </em>The verdict returned by the jury, however, found the defendant guilty of the use of a firearm in the commission of a <em>felony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Construing the verdict returned by the jury as tantamount to a finding that he used a firearm while committing murder, the defendant contends that the verdict is invalid because it is \u201clegally inconsistent\u201d with the voluntary manslaughter verdict returned on the homicide indictment. The defendant says also that under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, as enunciated in <em>Ashe </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436 (1970), his acquittal of the underlying murder charge, inherent in his conviction of the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter, is \u201cbinding\u201d upon the Commonwealth and bars his conviction of the use of a firearm in the commission of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">We do not agree with the defendant, however, on the possible application of the concepts of legal inconsistency and collateral estoppel. These concepts could apply in any event only if the verdict on the weapons indictment is interpreted as a finding of guilt that the defendant used a firearm while committing murder. We cannot interpret the verdict in this manner. In plain and unambiguous language, the verdict states that the defendant is guilty of \u201cthe use of a firearm in the commission of a felony.\u201d It should be unnecessary to say that, while all murders are felonious, not all felonies are murders. The weapons verdict returned in this case, therefore, is a finding of guilt of an offense quite different from the offense of using a firearm while committing murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">In an alternative argument, the defendant postulates that, at best, the weapons verdict constitutes a finding that he used a firearm in the commission of manslaughter or in the commission of some other undesignated felony. These matters, the defendant says, are \u201ctotally outside of what the Virginia legislature contemplated\u201d in its enactment of the present weapons statute and, therefore, do not constitute criminal offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">We believe that the weapons verdict in this case, as we have pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>viously noted, plainly convicts the defendant of the use of a firearm while committing, not murder, but some undesignated other felony. Under the weapons statute as it read prior to 1976, such a verdict might have been proper. At that time, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 read, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to use or attempt to use any pistol, shotgun, rifle, or other firearm or display such weapon in a threatening manner while committing a felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In 1976, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 was amended to read, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-7\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to use or attempt to use any pistol, shotgun, rifle, or other firearm or display such weapon in a threatening manner while committing or attempting to commit murder, rape, robbery, burglary or abduction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Thus, as a result of the 1976 amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1, the use of a firearm \u201cwhile committing a felony\u201d no longer is sufficient to constitute a violation of the statute. Now, a violation occurs only when a firearm is used with respect to the specified felonies of murder, rape, robbery, burglary, and abduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The offense in this case and the prosecution therefor took place after the effective date of the amendment to Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. Yet, under instructions erroneously framed to permit such action, the jury was given free rein either to convict the defendant of the no-longer existing offense of using a firearm in the commission of a felony or to convict him of using a firearm while committing murder. The jury convicted the defendant of the non-existent offense. Clearly, therefore, the defendant\u2019s firearms conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">The erroneous instructions which led to the anomalous result reached below were granted, if not at the Commonwealth\u2019s request, in the absence of any objection. These instructions became the law of the case. Accordingly, we do not believe that the Commonwealth is entitled further to prosecute the defendant on the weapons indictment, and it will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-11\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
