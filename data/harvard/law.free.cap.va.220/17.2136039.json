Rhodes (Hutcherson &amp; Rhodes, </em>on brief), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-7\"><em>Thomas D. Bagwell, Assistant Attorney General (Marshall Coleman, Attorney General, </em>on brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b178-8\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Indicted upon two counts of statutory burglary and two counts of grand larceny, the defendant, John Michael Hutchins, was convicted by a jury and, in accordance with the verdicts, was sentenced to serve a term of 5 years in the penitentiary on each count. On appeal, the defendant\u2019s sole claim of error concerns the closing argument of the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">The record shows that on April 18, 1978, the defendant and several companions, all residents of the Roanoke area, journeyed to Smith Mountain Lake in Franklin County, where the burglaries and larcenies took place. Several days later, the stolen articles were found in a Roanoke apartment occupied by the defendant and one of his alleged accomplices.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">At the defendant\u2019s trial and over his repeated objection, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney was permitted to state in rebuttal argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-12\">\u201cThis case is about the security of Franklin County property owners. That\u2019s what the case is about. The United States, and the United States says that you have a right to secure property in your home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-13\">\u201cWhat\u2019s the criminal law to do? The criminal law is to protect you and to protect your property and to protect you from defendants like this gentleman right here . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u201cI didn\u2019t hear [defense counsel] talk anything about punishment. Punishment is an all, as equally important function of the jury. If you find this man guilty you have to make up your mind what you\u2019re going to do with him. And that\u2019s something that I can\u2019t tell you what to do, and the Judge can\u2019t tell you what to do. You\u2019ve got the instructions before you. The instructions say that you can give this man from one year to twenty years in the penitentiary. Now, if you don\u2019t think this is a serious crime, don\u2019t give him one year in the penitentiary. Let him loose. Doesn\u2019t do anybody any good to slap somebody on the wrist. If you think it\u2019s a serious crime, punish him. It\u2019s not a pleasant notion to get used to, and I don\u2019t think, or I wouldn\u2019t speculate, but it\u2019s not pleasant. It\u2019s not pleasant to sit in front and judge a fellow human being. But you\u2019ve heard me say this before, and I\u2019ll say it again. What message are you going to send out to the people of Franklin County? Are you going to send out, \u2018Come on down. It\u2019s down there. It\u2019s yours for the picking. We don\u2019t care. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s serious. We\u2019re going to slap him on the wrist and turn him loose.\u2019 That\u2019s the kind of message . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">\u201cThat\u2019s what they call triumphs. And that\u2019s what a jury speaks to. It speaks to the whole world.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In contending that this argument was improper and prejudicial, the defendant relies upon <em>Dingus </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>153 Va. 846, 149 S.E. 414 (1929). In that case, the Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">\u201c[W]e want a verdict at your hands that will say to the criminals of Wise County and the criminals of Tazewell County and the criminals of Kentucky and Tennessee, that they cannot make Russell County their playground.\u201d 153 Va. at 851, 149 S.E. at 415.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>In holding this argument improper, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">\u201c[E]very person charged with crime is entitled to have his case determined solely by the evidence produced at his trial. There is no testimony in this case as to criminals of Wise County, Tazewell County, or those of Kentucky or Tennessee; and no such evidence referring to other criminals could have been introduced against the accused, had it been offered. The accused could neither be punished for their crimes nor have his punishment enhanced because of their iniquities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The Attorney General attempts to distinguish <em>Dingus </em>by saying that, while there was no evidence in that case concerning the criminal activities of outsiders, it was shown here that the defendant and his companions left the Roanoke area and entered Franklin County to commit burglaries and larcenies. This evidence, the Attorney General submits, permitted the prosecutor in this case to argue as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The difficulty with the Attorney General\u2019s position is that he not only engages in bootstrapping but, in attempting so to distinguish <em>Dingus, </em>he also emphasizes the vice in the type of argument involved here. What this argument does is create an atmosphere wherein a defendant may be convicted and punished, not just for the offense on trial, but to set an example to deter some unknown future criminal activity by some as yet unidentified outside criminal actor. The potential harm in such an argument is that it tends both to inflame a juror\u2019s natural prejudice against an outsider entering his jurisdiction for criminal purposes and to divert the juror\u2019s attention from the evidence produced at trial and focus it upon extraneous and inadmissible matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">This is not to say that we disagree with the observation made in the Attorney General\u2019s brief that it is proper for a prosecutor to ask a jury to fix a punishment in a particular case that will deter others from committing like offenses. The prosecutor\u2019s request, however, must not appeal, as part of the argument here appealed, to the jurors\u2019 passions by exciting their personal interests in protecting the safety and security of their own lives and property. And the prosecutor\u2019s statement must not confuse, as the argument here sometimes confused, the use of punishment <em>and </em>conviction for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>deterrent purposes. Conviction for an offense must be based solely upon evidence of guilt, and not upon considerations of deterrence. Failure to make this important distinction may result in substantial prejudice to a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">We recognize the proposition that often it is difficult to draw the line between proper and improper argument, and usually it is preferable, therefore, to leave to the trial court the task of deciding upon which side of the line a particular argument may fall. But where, as here, it appears probable that the defendant has been substantially prejudiced by an improper argument, and the trial court has failed to take corrective action, we must remove the prejudice by ordering a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
