Colvin, Jr.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> After both parties had rested, the trial court found that \u201c[tjhere isn\u2019t too much dispute in the direct evidence\u201d but that the \u201cinferences and conclusions from the evidence do differ making it. . .a proper case for the jury\u201d. Upon that finding, the court overruled both motions to strike. On October 27, 1976, the jury returned a verdict for Lane, and the plaintiff moved to set the verdict aside. By order entered September 27, 1977, the trial court held that \u201cLane is liable to the plaintiff as a matter of law\u201d, set the verdict aside, and ordered that another jury be empanelled to assess damages. That jury awarded the plaintiff damages in the sum of $18,000, and the verdict was confirmed by final order entered December 1, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">Lane assigns error to the order setting aside the first jury\u2019s verdict; the plaintiff assigns cross-error to an evidentiary ruling in the damage trial. No error is assigned to the evidentiary rulings or the rulings on instructions in the liability trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">Colvin, a farm worker employed by Lane, lived with his wife and three children in a tenant house on Lane\u2019s farm. Returning from a shopping trip late one evening in December 1973, the Colvins saw a strange car parked near a woodshed at their home. As Colvin backed out of the driveway, the strange car followed and, with its horn blowing, pursued Colvin along the highway. After twice reversing his direction, Colvin arrived at Lane\u2019s home, told him what had happened, and asked him to investigate. Leaving Mrs. Colvin and the children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>with Mrs. Lane, Lane took his .30 caliber rifle, and he and Colvin drove to the tenant house where they saw a light burning in the bathroom. Colvin, who could not remember leaving that light burning, entered the house and got his .22 caliber rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Lane and Colvin then drove back to Lane\u2019s home, and Colvin left with his family. A short time later, Mrs. Colvin and the children returned, reported that the strange car was back, and asked Lane to \u201cplease go over there and help.\u201d Mrs. Colvin was \u201cin hysterics\u201d and the children \u201cwere all crying\u201d. Mrs. Lane called the sheriff, and Lane got in his pickup truck and drove to the tenant house.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">As he entered the driveway, he saw the strange car facing him. Lane got out of his truck and \u201chollered\u201d for Colvin. Colvin, standing behind a bush, answered, and Lane walked to the car where he saw what appeared to be a man \u201csleeping on the wheel.\u201d Knocking on the window and getting no response, Lane opened the car door and shook the man. The man grabbed Lane, tore his jacket, pushed him against the door, got out of the car, cursed Lane, and started to run. Colvin attempted to stop him, but the man struck Colvin in the face and knocked him down. Lane ordered the man to halt and fired his rifle \u201cin the air\u201d. With Colvin in pursuit, the man ran behind the woodshed. Lane, who had gone back to his truck to \u201cunjam\u201d his rifle, followed and found the two men \u201cscuffling\u201d over Colvin\u2019s rifle. Colvin was \u201cdown on one knee\u201d. The other man was \u201cover top of [Colvin], holding the rifle\u201d, and Lane \u201cgrabbed the fellow by the back of the neck\u201d and \u201cpulled him off\u201d. The man struck at Lane and Lane fell backwards to the ground. By the time he had gotten to his feet, the other two men had run a distance of approximately 150 feet. At this point, Lane thought he saw Colvin\u2019s arms \u201ccome up in the air\u201d. As Lane approached, Colvin was holding his rifle, which was broken into two pieces. The other man was lying on the ground. Lane could detect no pulse or breathing, and Colvin said that he supposed he had hit the man too hard with his rifle.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Realizing that there was a man \u201cdead in the field and I was there with a gun\u201d, Lane \u201cgot scared\u201d and \u201cmade up this story, trying t\u00f3 - delete myself from being involved.\u201d At Lane\u2019s suggestion, Colvin \u201ckicked in\u201d the door of the house, and, when the deputy sheriff arrived, they told him that Colvin had chased an intruder from his home and that Lane had arrived only in time to see him running toward the woodshed. After consulting with his wife, Lane corrected the story in an interview with the officers the next morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">The decedent, who was bearded, was identified as Eugene Scott. Scott once worked two weeks on Lane\u2019s farm and was clean-shaven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>at that time. Lane testified that he had not recognized Scott until he saw his face in the light of the officer\u2019s flashlight. Lane further testified that he had not heard Colvin\u2019s rifle fire and that he had not learned until the officers told him the next morning that the cause of death was a bullet wound in the back of the neck. According to the pathologist who performed the autopsy, the entrance wound was located \u201cjust below the hairline and just to the right of the midline\u201d; the bullet lodged in the brain, indicating that it had \u201ctraveled to the left and upward\u201d; and, assuming that the \u201cextraneous debris\u201d found \u201c[i]n and around the entrance wound\u201d was gun powder, the shot was fired at close range, \u201csomewhere around two feet, as a maximum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">We review this case upon the theory employed by counsel and the court below. The motion for judgment alleged that the two defendants were \u201ceach inciting, encouraging, aiding and abetting the other, with the common intention and unlawful purpose\u201d of injuring Scott and that \u201c[i]n the execution of such common intention and purpose, one of the defendants wrongfully and unlawfully shot and killed Eugene Scott\u201d. The trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[tjhere is no evidence\u201d that Lane killed Scott. Under an instruction offered by the plaintiff and amended by the trial court, the jurors were directed to find for the plaintiff if they believed that Colvin \u201cintentionally shot the decedent\u201d and that Lane \u201cwas present, aiding and abetting in such shooting\u201d. \u201cAiding and abetting\u201d was defined as \u201cencouraging or inciting the commission of the unlawful act by words, gestures, looks or signs, or in some manner offering aid in its commission.\u201d The plaintiff assigns no cross-error to the instructions as given, and, indicating no approval, we consider them the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Under Code \u00a7 8.01-430, a trial court is empowered in a civil action to enter judgment <em>non obstante veredicto </em>\u201cupon the ground that [the verdict] is contrary to the evidence, or without evidence to support it\u201d.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">\u201c[This power] can only be exercised where the verdict is plainly wrong or without credible evidence to support it. If there is a conflict in the testimony on a material point, or if reasonable men may differ in their conclusions of fact to be drawn from the evidence, or if the conclusion is dependent on the weight to be given the testimony, the trial judge cannot substitute his conclusion for that of the jury merely because he would have voted for a different verdict if he had been on the jury. The weight of a jury\u2019s verdict, when there is credible evidence upon which it can be based, is not overborne by the trial judge\u2019s disapproval.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNeely, </em>204 Va. 218, 222, 129, S.E.2d 687, 689-90 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Where the evidence fairly supports multiple inferences, a trial judge ruling on a motion to strike must adopt those inferences most favorable to the party whose evidence is challenged, even though he may believe different inferences are more probable. <em>R. F. &amp; P. Railroad </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>218 Va. 636, 643, 238 S.E.2d 826, 830 (1977). By the same logic, when conflicting inferences have been resolved by a jury and those necessarily underlying the conclusion reflected in the verdict are reasonably deducible from the evidence, a trial judge should not set the verdict aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Considering the motions to strike and finding that the \u201cinferences and conclusions from the evidence do differ\u201d, the trial court ruled that this was \u201ca proper case for the jury.\u201d We agree with that finding and that ruling; we disagree with the subsequent holding that \u201cLane is liable to the plaintiff as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">On brief, the plaintiff argues that the evidence raises inferences that Lane \u201cinitiated the armed assault during which Scott was killed\u201d; that Lane\u2019s warning shot \u201ctriggered Colvin\u2019s armed pursuit of Scott\u201d, a pursuit in which Lane \u201cactively participated\u201d; and that \u201cthere is no reason why [Lane] aided Colvin regain possession and control of [Colvin\u2019s] rifle other than that Colvin should use it against the intruder\u201d. Even if the inferences the plaintiff draws justify a conclusion that Lane was, in the language of the jury instructions, \u201cpresent, aiding and abetting [Colvin] in such shooting\u201d, other inferences and a different conclusion are reasonably deducible from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Specifically, we believe it is reasonable to infer that Lane\u2019s purpose in arming himself was not to initiate or incite an armed assault but to apprehend a stranger who had invaded his farm in the middle of the night and terrorized the family of his tenant; that Lane\u2019s warning shot, which he aimed into the air and not at Scott, was prompted by the same purpose; and that Lane\u2019s reason for intervening in the struggle was to rescue Colvin, who appeared to be in imminent peril, and to prevent Scott, who was attempting to seize Colvin\u2019s rifle, from using the weapon himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">The plaintiff acknowledges that \u201cthere is no evidence that Lane gave verbal assent to the shooting.\u201d Indeed, it appears that there was no conversation whatever between Lane and Colvin from the time Scott fled from his car until he was killed. Nor do we find any evidence of \u201cgestures, looks or signs\u201d to compel a conclusion that Lane was \u201caiding and abetting\u201d as defined in the jury instructions or that he shared the tortious intent alleged in the motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Going beyond the law of the case underlying the jury\u2019s verdict, the trial judge stated that the facts disclosed by the evidence, \u201ccoupled with the position of Lane as employer of Colvin indicates that Lane was a dominant factor in the whole episode.\u201d Pointing to that statement, the plaintiff contends on appeal that Lane was liable as a matter of law for Colvin\u2019s tort under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior. </em>Such a theory of liability was never alleged in the motion for judgment, the trial judge refused the plaintiff\u2019s instruction based upon that theory, and the plaintiff assigned no cross-error to that refusal. Accordingly, we will not notice this argument on appeal. Rule 5:27.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Applying the law of the case, we are of opinion that the evidence and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom fairly support the conclusion reached by the first jury, and we hold that the trial court erred in setting their verdict aside. The judgment will be reversed, the first verdict will be reinstated, and final judgment for Lane will be entered here.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b739-14\"> The plaintiff was unable to serve Colvin with process, and Lane testified at trial that he did not know where Colvin was.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
