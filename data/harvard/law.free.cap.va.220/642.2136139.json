Turner (Turner) to Rick\u2019s Movers, Inc. (Rick\u2019s). We consider two issues raised on appeal by seven protesting carriers<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> (the protestants).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">Turner, who had operated under his certificate for 15 years, testified that he \u201chad a heart attack and. . .just couldn\u2019t look after\u201d his business. He terminated operations in July 1978 and later contracted to sell his certificate to Rick\u2019s. On January 2, 1979, the contracting parties filed their application for approval of the transfer pursuant to Code \u00a7 56-338.14. Applying the presumption of continuance of public convenience and necessity and the burden of proof rule expounded in <em>Park Bros. </em>v. <em>S &amp; M Systems Corp., </em>216 Va. 322, 218 S.E.2d 441 (1975), the Commission approved the application upon a finding that Rick\u2019s \u201c \u2018is fit, has the capability and will furnish adequate and proper service\u2019 \u201d and that the protestants had failed to show \u201c \u2018ruinous or unreasonable competition, or that the transfer will not serve the public convenience and necessity\u2019 \u201d, quoting 216 Va. at 326, 218 S.E.2d at 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">First, the protestants argue that the Commission erred in applying <em>Park Bros, </em>to the case at bar because, they assert, the presumption \u201cis rebutted and disappears\u201d in the face of evidence that Turner had terminated operations under his certificate some six months before the transfer application was filed. In <em>Cavalier Corp. </em>v. <em>Diamond Transfer, </em>220 Va. 651, 261 S.E.2d 314 (1979), this day decided, we rejected a similar argument based on facts essentially the same as those at bar; our decision there is controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Next, the seven Richmond-based protestants contend that the <em>Park Bros, </em>presumption of continuance of public convenience and necessity should not be applied \u201csave in cases involving a request to transfer an \u2018active\u2019 certificate to another carrier in the same area.\u201d Turner\u2019s base of operations was in Radford, and Rick\u2019s is in Richmond. \u201cAssuming a continuing need for this certificate,\u201d the protestants reason that \u201cthe need could only have been in Radford.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>The Household Goods Carriers Act \u201cdoes not require a point of origin to be specified [in a certificate] and, in our opinion, no such designation is contemplated by the Act.\u201d <em>Cook Transfer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 384, 389, 83 S.E.2d 733, 736 (1954); <em>accord, Fawley Motor Lines </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 624, 101 S.E.2d 510 (1958); <em>McDaniel </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 287, 99 S.E.2d 623 (1957). As the Commission notes on brief, \u201c[a] certificated carrier. . . is allowed to transfer [its] base of operations, or to establish branch offices at will without additional authority from the State Corporation Commission\u201d. If the Commission is not limited to a particular locality in determining the public convenience and necessity underlying the issuance of a certificate, the <em>Park Bros, </em>presumption of continuance which springs from that determination is not so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Finding no error below, we will affirm the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b803-11\"> Brooks Transfer and Storage Co., Inc.; Centre Carriers Corp.; M.
