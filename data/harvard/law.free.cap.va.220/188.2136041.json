There, the pair participated in robbing the station manager. During the course of the robbery, the manager was shot three times and fatally wounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In a single bench trial, the defendant was tried upon separate indictments for capital murder in the commission of armed robbery [Code \u00a7 18.2-31 (d)] and for robbery (Code \u00a7 18.2-58). At the trial, testifying for the Commonwealth, Gillespie named the defendant as the triggerman in the victim\u2019s death. Testifying in his own behalf, the defendant cast Gillespie in the role of triggerman. Finding that Gillespie was \u201cthe principal in the first degree\u201d in the case,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court convicted the defendant, in the words of the conviction order, \u201cof murder in the commission of a robbery at least as a principal of the second degree (Virginia Code Section 18.2-31(d)), as charged in [the] indictment.\u201d The court also convicted the defendant of robbery. For the murder conviction, the defendant received a sentence of 40 years in the penitentiary, with 20 years suspended, and, for the robbery conviction, a like term and suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Relying upon <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>433 U.S. 682 (1977), the defendant contends that his conviction of robbery was barred by his conviction of murder in the commission of armed robbery because \u201cproof of the underlying felony, robbery with a firearm, was needed to sustain [his] murder conviction.\u201d In <em>Harris, </em>the accused and a companion robbed a grocery store clerk and the companion killed the clerk. The defendant was convicted of felony-murder in connection with the death. Thereafter, the defendant was convicted of robbery. In a brief per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court first noted that the concession in the state appellate court\u2019s opinion that \u201c[i]n a felony murder case, the proof of the underlying felony [here robbery with firearms] is needed to prove the intent necessary for a felony murder conviction.\u201d Then, reversing the robbery conviction, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">\u201cWhen, as here, conviction of a greater crime, murder, cannot be had without conviction of the lesser crime, robbery with firearms, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars prosecution for the lesser crime after conviction of the greater one. . . . \u2018[A] person [who] has been tried and convicted for a crime which has various incidents included in it, . . . cannot be a second time tried for one of those incidents without being twice put in jeopardy for the same offence\u2019 \u201d (footnote and citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>433 U.S. at 682-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">At first blush, it might seem that <em>Harris </em>supports the defendant\u2019s position that his conviction of robbery was barred, on double jeopardy grounds, by his conviction of murder. Closer analysis of the situation, however, clearly prompts a different view.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In this analysis, it is important to focus upon the nature of the defendant\u2019s conviction for homicide. As has been noted, the defendant was indicted for murder under Code \u00a7 18.2-31, which, in pertinent part, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">\u201cThe following offenses shall constitute capital murder, punishable as a Class 1 felony: <em>&lt;(</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">\u201c(d) The willful, deliberate and premeditated killing of any person in the commission of robbery while armed with a deadly weapon . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">As has been further noted, the trial court found the defendant guilty, as the conviction order states, \u201cof murder in the commission of a robbery at least as a principal of the second degree (Virginia Code Section 18.2-31 (d)), as charged in [the] indictment.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This statement had dual effects. First, it recognized, as this court later held in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 146, 149, 255 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1979), that only the triggerman can be a principal in the first degree to capital murder under \u00a7 18.2-31 (d); accordingly, because the trial court found that Gillespie, and not the defendant, was the triggerman in the present case, the defendant was not convicted as a principal in the first degree, and to this extent, but this extent only, he was acquitted of participation in the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">Second, the statement necessarily constituted a finding not only that the victim\u2019s murder occurred in the commission of armed robbery but also that the killing was willful, deliberate, and premeditated. This follows because, if there was such a status as that ascribed to the defendant by the trial court, <em>viz., </em>a principal in the second degree to capital murder, that status could have arisen only if, as \u00a7 18.2-31(d) required and as the indictment alleged, the killing at issue was shown both to have occurred in the commission of armed robbery and to have been willful, deliberate, and premeditated.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">While the conviction order has these effects, we do not believe that the defendant could have been or, indeed, was convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>murder under Code \u00a7 18.2-31 (d). We say this for several reasons. Code \u00a7 18.2-18, in pertinent part, provides that \u201cexcept in the case of a killing for hire under the provisions of \u00a7 18.2-31 (b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> an accessory before the fact or principal in the second degree to a capital murder shall be indicted, tried, convicted and punished <em>as though the offense were murder in the first degree\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Further, the punishment imposed upon the defendant for his murder conviction, a term of 40 years, is not an appropriate sentence under \u00a7 18.2-31 (d). Capital murder under \u00a7 18.2-31(d) is a Class I felony, punishable by death or life imprisonment. Code \u00a7 18.2-10(a). The 40-year sentence actually imposed in this case is appropriate only for a Class 2 felony. Code \u00a7 18.2-10(b). The only homicide classified as a Class 2 felony is murder of the first degree. Code \u00a7 18.2-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We believe, therefore, that, despite the conviction order\u2019s reference to capital murder under \u00a7 18.2-31 (d), the defendant was convicted of murder of the first degree under Code \u00a7 18.2-32. In pertinent part, this section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">\u201cMurder, other than capital murder, by poison, lying in wait, imprisonment, starving, or by any willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing, or in the commission of, or attempt to commit, arson, rape, robbery, burglary or abduction, except as provided in \u00a7 18.2-31, is murder of the first degree, punishable as a Class 2 felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Admittedly, \u00a7 18.2-32 embodies the felony-murder concept. And, concededly, the conviction order entered in this case, the oral opinion rendered by the trial court, and the evidence presented below all show that the felony-murder concept was employed to support the defendant\u2019s conviction of murder. But \u00a7 18.2-32 also contains other separate grounds for supporting a first degree murder conviction, including the situation where the killing is shown to be willful, deliberate, and premeditated. And, here, the indictment upon which the defendant was tried, the conviction order entered below, the trial court\u2019s oral opinion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the evidence<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> all clearly demonstrate that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the defendant\u2019s murder conviction was grounded not only upon the felony-murder concept but also upon the proposition that the killing was willful, deliberate, and premeditated.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">In these circumstances, we do not believe that there exists in this case the double jeopardy problem the Supreme Court dealt with in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, supra. </em>Unlike the state appellate court in <em>Harris, </em>we need not concede that \u201cproof of the underlying felony [here robbery with firearms] is needed to prove the intent necessary\u201d for this defendant\u2019s murder conviction. In our situation, as we analyze it, proof of the intent necessary for the defendant\u2019s murder conviction is supplied by the independent showing that the killing was willful, deliberate, and premeditated. This is not a case, therefore, where, as with <em>Harris, </em>\u201cconviction of a greater crime, murder, cannot be had without conviction of the lesser crime, robbery with firearms.\u201d Conviction of the murder here <em>can </em>be had, without resort to the evidence concerning armed robbery, simply by relying upon the independent proof that the killing was willful, deliberate, and premeditated.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">By the same analysis, we do not believe that, under the circumstances of this case, the defendant\u2019s conviction for armed robbery involves a conviction of a \u201clesser included\u201d offense, of the \u201csame\u201d offense, or of \u201can incident included in\u201d a greater offense. We reach this conclusion by application of the test set forth in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>432 U.S. 161 (1977), a case cited in <em>Harris </em>and relied upon by the defendant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In <em>Brown, </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">\u201cThe established test for determining whether two offenses are sufficiently distinguishable to permit the imposition of cumulative punishment was stated in <em>Blockburger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304 (1932):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">\u2018The applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not....\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">This test emphasizes the elements of the two crimes. Tf each requires proof of a fact that the other does not, the <em>Blockburger </em>test is satisfied, notwithstanding a substantial overlap in the proof offered to establish the crimes . . . .\u2019 <em>Iannelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>420 U.S. 770, 785 n. 17 (1975).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>432 U.S. at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Believing firmly, as we do, that the present defendant\u2019s conviction of homicide is for first degree murder and that this conviction is supported independently by proof and by a factual finding that the killing was willful, deliberate, and premeditated, we are of opinion that the present case satisfies the test set forth in <em>Brown. </em>The two offenses involved here \u2014 on the one hand, willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder, and, on the other, armed robbery \u2014 \u201c \u2018each requires proof of a fact that the other does not\u2019 \u201d. Willful, deliberate, and premeditated murder requires proof of specific intent to kill and of a killing, without the necessity of showing theft or intent to steal from the victim. Armed robbery requires proof of theft or intent to steal from the victim, without the necessity of showing an intent to kill or a killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Finding no violation of the defendant\u2019s rights concerning double jeopardy, we will affirm the judgments appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\"> Because of this finding, the trial court acquitted the defendant of a charge of using a firearm in the commission of a felony.
