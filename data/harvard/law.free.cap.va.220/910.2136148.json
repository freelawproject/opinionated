Purporting to be decedent\u2019s son, Brian Donnell James, an infant suing by his mother, Velma James, filed a claim for death benefits against Allstate and its insurer, Travelers Insurance Company. Decedent\u2019s mother withdrew her claim in favor of the infant\u2019s claim. The Deputy Commissioner denied Brian\u2019s claim on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he was the decedent\u2019s son. On review, the full Commission, with one Commissioner dissenting, reversed and entered an award for the infant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">No documentary evidence of paternity was introduced. As noted in the Commission\u2019s opinion, testimonial evidence showed that the decedent and the child\u2019s mother had never been married but had been \u201c \u2018going together\u2019 during the period of the child\u2019s conception, birth and for some time thereafter\u201d; that \u201cthe deceased brought the infant to his own mother\u2019s home\u201d; that \u201che bought the infant things that he needed\u201d; and that \u201cthe infant\u2019s facial features resemble those of the deceased.\u201d The decedent\u2019s mother testified that the decedent told her \u201cthat Brian was his. And I can see it.\u201d The child\u2019s maternal grandmother said that the decedent \u201ctold me he was the father of the child\u201d. The infant\u2019s mother stated that the decedent \u201ctold his mother, his family, and friends\u201d that Brian was his son and that he provided support for the child \u201c[w]henever he could.\u201d There was no evidence contradicting this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">Code \u00a7 65.1-66 provides that \u201can acknowledged illegitimate child\u201d is one of the \u201cpersons . . . conclusively presumed to be dependents wholly dependent for support upon the deceased employee\u201d; such a person is entitled to death benefits under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Code \u00a7 65.1-65. Except for the requirement of acknowledgement by the decedent, the Act prescribes no test for determining paternity. Allstate and Travelers urge us to apply the evidentiary standards defined in Code \u00a7 20-61.1. Headlined \u201cSupport of children of unwed parents by father; evidence of paternity\u201d, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>section provides that, before a court may order such support, there must be an admission of paternity in open court, an admission of paternity in writing under oath, or evidence of certain other conduct establishing paternity beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">\u201cWe do not agree that Code \u00a7 20-61.1 is applicable ... or that this section provides the only means by which paternity can be established.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 40, 43, 235 S.E.2d 325, 328 (1977). Subject to constitutional constraints, <em>see generally Lalli </em>v. <em>Lalli, </em>439 U.S. 259 (1978); <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>406 U.S. 164 (1972), the legal status of illegitimate children is properly a matter of legislative prerogative. When, as a public policy determination, the General Assembly decides to prescribe special evidentiary standards for proof of paternity, it knows how to do so. It did so when it enacted Code \u00a7 20-61.1. It did so again when it transported the provisions of that section into Code \u00a7 64.1-5.2 governing descent and distribution. Acts 1978, c. 647. It could have done the same for purposes of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. It did not. For us to do so would be to rewrite Code \u00a7 65.1-66. Declining the invitation to invade the legislative domain, we hold that the evidentiary requirements of Code \u00a7 20-61.1 do not apply to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">The Act requires a claimant who purports to be an illegitimate child of an employee who has suffered a compensable accident to prove the employee\u2019s acknowledgement of paternity. Whether there has been such an acknowledgement is a question of fact. Here, three witnesses testified that the decedent acknowledged Brian as his son. Their testimony was uncontradicted, and we cannot say it was incredible. We have long held that, upon review of the Commission\u2019s decision, \u201cwhen there is no conflict of evidence, then, if there be any [credible] evidence to support the findings of fact, such findings are conclusive and binding.\u201d <em>National Surety Co. </em>v. <em>Rountree, </em>152 Va. 150, 159, 147 S.E. 537, 539 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">The Commission\u2019s award will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1072-8\"> Manifestly, the legislative purpose of the evidentiary standards in the child support and inheritance statutes is to minimize the risk of fraudulent paternity claims. We recognize a similar risk in filings under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. \u201cBut a person who claims to be a decedent\u2019s child has the burden of proving that the decedent was his parent. We should not assume that finders of fact will not intelligently and justly resolve issues of paternity based upon the evidence before them and guided by the law.\u201d <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Sneed, </em>211 Va. 640, 643, 179 S.E.2d 620, 622 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
