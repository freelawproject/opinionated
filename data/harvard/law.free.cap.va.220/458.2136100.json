The main question we will consider is whether there was credible evidence to support the jury\u2019s decision, approved by the trial court, in favor of the purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">In October of 1975, appellees Jon M. French and Helen V. French, his wife, defendants below, executed a written contract to buy a dwelling, and appurtenant real estate, near the City of Waynesboro, from appellants Norris G. Armentrout and Alma N. Armentrout, his wife, two of the plaintiffs below. The sellers were represented in the transaction by an employee of appellant Simon M. Painter, Sr., t/a Valley Realty, another plaintiff below.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-14\">Subsequently, when the purchasers refused to perform the contract, two actions were instituted against the Frenches in the General District Court of Augusta County. Valley Realty sued to recover a sales commission in the amount of $1,500.00, and the Armentrouts sued to recover damages of $2,552.89. Both civil warrants alleged the respective amounts were due because of \u201cbreach of contract.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Frenches removed the actions to the circuit court. In their affidavits of substantial defense filed in the circuit court under Code \u00a7 16.1-92, the Frenches denied they had breached the contract and asserted that \u201cthe existence of a defective septic system in the house offered for sale rendered the house unsaleable and unfit for occupancy without correction.\u201d The cases were consolidated and tried before a jury which rendered verdicts in favor of the purchasers in each case. We granted the plaintiffs an appeal from the trial court\u2019s December 1976 orders which overruled their respective motions to set aside the verdicts and which entered judgments for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">At the outset we note that no bills of particulars were filed by plaintiffs in the circuit court to amplify the bare allegations of the civil warrants. So initially we will indicate the theory upon which the actions were tried below by summarizing relevant instructions that are unchallenged on appeal and which thus are the law of the case. The trial court told the jurors that if they believed from a preponderance of the evidence that the Frenches entered into the contract of purchase of October 10, 1975 with the Armentrouts, that the Frenches refused to perform the contract, and that the Frenches \u201cwere not justified in refusing to perform\u201d the contract \u201cby any act or default on the part of\u201d the Armentrouts, then a verdict must be found for plaintiffs. In several instructions the trial court stated that only one material fact was in issue which was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">[Wjhether or not the septic system was in such state of disrepair that it rendered the house unsalable and unfit for occupancy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">The court also instructed the jurors that unless they believed \u201cfrom a preponderance of the evidence that the smell in the recreation room of the house was caused by a problem with the septic system then the smell or odor by itself, no matter how obnoxious, shall not be considered by the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">The court further instructed the jury that in order for defendants \u201cto avoid their contractual obligations\u201d the burden was on the Frenches to prove by clear, cogent and convincing proof: (1) that the Armentrouts \u201cexpressly or by a course of conduct were guilty of misrepresentation or concealment with regard to the septic system\u201d; (2) that the \u201cseptic system was in fact in such state of disrepair as to render the house unsalable and unfit for occupancy\u201d; and (3) that such misrepresentation or concealment, if proved, induced the defendants to enter into the contract. The court stated that unless the defendants had \u201ccome forward\u201d with such proof, then the jury must find for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Consequently, it is apparent that our sole inquiry in this main phase of the appeal is to determine whether there was sufficient credible evidence, which was clear, cogent and convincing, to prove that the septic system was in such a state of disrepair to render the dwelling unsalable and unfit for occupancy. We will now examine the evidence touching this issue in the light most favorable to defendants who come here armed with the verdict of a jury which has been confirmed by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The house in question was situated on a lot of approximately 1.5 acres and was described as a \u201csplit foyer house\u201d with four bedrooms. Within the lower level of the home was a recreation room containing a fireplace. The home had been built in 1971 by a local electrical contractor, who occupied it for eight or nine months and sold it to one McIntosh. The Armentrouts purchased it from McIntosh and, at the time of the contract, had occupied the home for about five months. Testimony revealed that Armentrout had \u201cput the house on the market\u201d about one month after he purchased it.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The Frenches, parents of three young children, were planning to buy their first home. Mr. French, an employee of Virginia Electric and Power Company, had reviewed three or four books \u201con real estate purchasing\u201d to prepare for the venture.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">In October of 1975, several days before the contract in issue was executed, Mrs. Jean Byrd, an employee of Painter and Valley Realty, took the Frenches to see the Armentrout dwelling about 6:30 p.m. on a Wednesday. The visit had been prearranged and the Frenches stayed inside the house about one-half hour. As soon as they entered the home, the Frenches noticed a \u201cheavy cooking odor\u201d which was \u201creal garlicky or oniony.\u201d After speaking to the Armentrouts, who apologized for the strong odor, the Frenches went \u201cdownstairs\u201d and looked into the recreation room where the Armentrouts\u2019 older daughter was sitting, apparently with her \u201cboyfriend.\u201d The room was \u201cvery dark\u201d and dimly lit. The Frenches remained there only a few minutes, noticing and smelling a fire which was \u201croaring\u201d in the fireplace; no offensive odor was detected.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">As the group was inspecting the upper level of the home, Armentrout mentioned to French that the septic tank had been recently \u201cpumped\u201d or \u201cdrained.\u201d French was surprised by the statement because, he testified, he had previously lived in a house where the septic tank did not require cleaning for 11 years. French then asked Armentrout the reason for the pumping and Armentrout answered, \u201cFor my own satisfaction.\u201d Upon Armentrout\u2019s assurance that the septic system \u201cchecked fine,\u201d French pursued the subject no further at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>During the initial visit, according to the testimony, the Armentrouts \u201ckept reiterating\u201d that the reason they were leaving their home so soon after they had purchased it was that he had been transferred by his employer to Covington, Virginia. Byrd testified, however, that Armentrout had told her that their daughter\u2019s dissatisfaction with her new school necessitated the move. Armentrout, who was living in Staunton at the time of the trial held in December of 1976, testified that he sold the home because \u201cI am going back to Covington, after this year,\u201d and \u201cmy little girl wasn\u2019t satisfied with the school down there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">As the Frenches\u2019 initial visit to the home was ending, the Armentrouts told French he was at liberty to examine the home again at any time as long as the visit was prearranged. Prior to execution of the contract, French returned to look through the home accompanied by his \u201csupervisor at work.\u201d On that day, the weather was \u201clike Spring,\u201d and the men were \u201cin shirt sleeves.\u201d At the time, they detected no odor in the house except the smell of a fire again burning in the recreation room fireplace. French quoted his supervisor as commenting, upon leaving the home, that in view of the warm weather it was \u201cawfully strange\u201d the Armentrouts had a fire burning in the recreation room.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Because, in Mrs. French\u2019s words, they \u201cfell in love with [the house] right away\u201d and because they \u201cdidn\u2019t have any reason to distrust anybody,\u201d the defendants executed the contract to purchase the home for $44,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The contract called for the transaction to be closed on November 28, 1975. By agreement of the parties, the Armentrouts moved on November 1 and delivered possession of the premises to the Frenches who began moving into the home on November 6; they had not been in the dwelling since the two October visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The Frenches entered the house, which \u201chad been closed up for a day,\u201d at the lower level through a utility room. French testified that when they opened the door to the recreation room, \u201coh, gosh \u2014 that odor hit us.\u201d Mrs. French testified the smell \u201cjust practically knocked you over.\u201d French compared the odor to that present in a filthy public toilet. Mrs. French, a registered nurse, concluded that the smell came from urine and compared the odor to that from an outdoor toilet. At the time, they noticed a bottle of room deodorant on the mantle over the fireplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">During the next several days, the Frenches tried without success to eliminate the smell by washing the walls of the lower level of the home and by repeatedly cleaning the recreation room and the \u201ctwo-tone green shag\u201d rug covering the room\u2019s cement floor. After the cleaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>efforts over the general area of the ground level of the home failed to eliminate the offensive odor, French noticed the smell seemed stronger in one comer of the recreation room. He raised the rug in that area, saw that it was stained underneath, and noticed \u201cthe saturation\u201d which had taken place at that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">In the process of cleaning, French also discovered that the floor drain in the utility room \u201chad been stopped up\u201d so that water would not flow out. In addition, the toilets began to malfunction after the family had lived in the house a few days; when flushed, the water appeared ready to overflow the bowl to the degree that the family stopped using the commodes.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">As the result of these cascading problems, French telephoned Armentrout. Armentrout first denied and then admitted he had been aware of the smell but claimed to have no knowledge of the cause of the problems French was experiencing. Armentrout stated he had cleaned the recreation room rug which \u201cseemed to help [the odor] for a little while\u201d but the smell would \u201creturn and then go away, and then come \u2014 and be stronger at times than others.\u201d Armentrout told French he had suspected \u201ca septic tank problem, or a leakage\u201d but when he had the system \u201cpumped and checked,\u201d he had \u201celiminated that\u201d as a cause of the problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">During November, at French\u2019s request, C. T. Bradley, a local building contractor, examined the dwelling. Bradley testified that the odor was so strong on the day he went to the home that it brought tears to his eyes and burned his eyes \u201cso bad [he] couldn\u2019t stand it.\u201d Bradley stated the odor smelled like urine and concluded that \u201ca septic tank was spilling out, or overrunning, or something like that.\u201d When asked his opinion \u201cabout the livable condition of that house with that odor,\u201d Bradley opined that he would not move his family into the house under the conditions existing there.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">French, believing a \u201cserious septic problem\u201d existed, then consulted an attorney who notified the realtor that the Frenches would not close the purchase. Thereafter, Byrd contacted the Frenches, stating a desire \u201cto work the thing out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">As a result, the realtor sent Raymond Beathe to meet French at the home on November 25 to evaluate the problems. Beathe, employed by a construction company, was the person who had drained the septic tank for Armentrout. Following the examination, Beathe told French the cause \u201ccould be septic tank leakage.\u201d Beathe examined \u201cthe tanks behind the toilets\u201d and told French the floats in the tanks had been altered so the tanks would not fill up with water. When French asked the effect of such alterations, Beathe stated that \u201ca lot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>of people do this, you know, when they have water flushing out onto the floors frequently . . . [tjhey\u2019ll do this so they don\u2019t get as much water, or hardly any at all, out on the floor \u2014 or sometimes none.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">While Beathe was at the home, the Armentrouts and realtors Painter and Byrd arrived. During the ensuing discussion, Byrd asked Beathe what should be done \u201cto check out the system\u201d in order to \u201conce and for all, . . . clear the air\u201d and determine the cause of the problems. Beathe replied there was \u201conly one way . . . and that\u2019s to dig it up.\u201d French then proposed that the system be dug into and offered to pay for the digging if no defect was discovered. He told the group that Dr. Malcolm Tenney, the regional medical director for Northwest Virginia for the Virginia State Department of Health, had agreed to examine the system when it was uncovered. French\u2019s request to dig was refused, Painter stating, \u201cMr. French, as far as I\u2019m concerned, you signed for this house, and you\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d The meeting ended with French referring Painter to French\u2019s attorney for any further discussions about the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">At the trial, Dr. Tenney testified the \u201conly way\u201d to test a septic system which is suspected of leaking is to dig up the pipe connecting the house to the septic system and to examine the pipe to determine whether it is ruptured. He also stated that \u201cslow [emptying] toilets\u201d indicate, among other things, a \u201cstoppage\u201d in the pipe connecting the house to the septic system, a break in such pipe, a filled septic tank, or a flooded septic drain field. Tenney also described other causes of a malfunctioning septic system, such as a tilted distribution box resulting from settling of the earth or from pressure of heavy equipment working on the surface of the ground. He also testified that cleaning the septic lines using a \u201cRoto-Rooter\u201d often breaks the pipe at a critical juncture as it leads into the system. The evidence disclosed that Armentrout, after he had lived in the house for about two months, had a \u201cRoto-Rooter\u201d used to unclog the septic system.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The evidence offered by the plaintiffs tended to show that the odor and problems experienced with the sewage disposal were not caused by a defective septic system. For example, the urine odor was attributed to pets housed by owners previous to the Armentrouts or to a lack of water in the sewer drains which permitted sewer gas to leak into the home. Witnesses called by the plaintiff had examined the system at various times and testified that it operated properly. Warren D. Drumheller, who, along with his wife, purchased the home in March of 1976 from the Armentrouts for $43,000.00 through Valley Realty, testified that he had experienced no difficulty with the septic system during the nine months of his occupancy to the time of trial. He stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>that the odor was eliminated from the recreation room when he replaced the rug. He did say, however, that the odor lingered in one of the lower-level bedrooms. Drumheller also testified that he found rags stuffed both in the clothes washer drain downstairs and in the utility room floor drain. Armentrout denied knowledge of any malfunction of the septic system, denied placing rags in the drains, denied altering the float assembly in the toilets, and denied having any work done on the sewer system prior to the sale to the Drumhellers.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Plaintiffs contend, first, that as a matter of law the defendants failed to establish prima facie, by clear, cogent and convincing evidence, that the septic system was defective and that the Armentrouts either expressly, or by a course of conduct, were guilty of misrepresentation or concealment with regard to the septic system so as to warrant rescission of the transaction. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">We think the defendants carried the required burden sufficient to raise a jury issue on the foregoing questions. Reasonably to be inferred from the facts heretofore recited is that the septic system was defective. Bradley concluded that the septic tank was \u201cspilling out\u201d and \u201coverrunning,\u201d Beathe said the cause of the odor \u201ccould be septic tank leakage,\u201d and Tenney, who was prevented from making a meaningful inspection by plaintiffs\u2019 refusal to allow the digging, testified that the problems being experienced by the Frenches could be caused by a malfunctioning system for any number of reasons. When this evidence is coupled with the witnesses\u2019 description of the odor, the logical conclusion is that the sewage disposal system was defective at the time the contract was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Furthermore, the evidence was entirely sufficient to raise a question for the jury upon whether the Armentrouts were guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation. The jury properly could have concluded the Armentrouts were aware of the septic tank malfunction and of the offensive odor existing during the period immediately prior to French\u2019s first visit. Rags had been stuffed in drains which could have prevented the sewage from backing up into the lower level of the home. The mechanism in the toilets had been altered to reduce the flow of water and the hazard of overflowing. The jury could logically have concluded the Armentrouts performed these acts and thus knew of the septic problem. Also, the rug in the recreation room furnished evidence of a long-standing odor and a liquid problem, certainly known to the occupants of the house. In addition to those circumstances, the evidence showed that the Armentrouts decided to sell the home within months of their occupancy, assigning conflicting reasons for the sudden move. Furthermore, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Armentrouts attempted successfully to mask the foul smell by using fires and cooking odors when the prearranged visits were scheduled. And finally, the jury properly could have believed that the refusal to accept French\u2019s offer to pay for digging up and inspecting the system was a further indication of the plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to conceal a known defective condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Urging that the doctrine of <em>caveat emptor </em>applies to the transfer of real estate with respect to the physical condition of the premises, plaintiffs argue, second, that the Frenches were bound to accept the property in its October 10, 1975 condition because of the terms of the purchase agreement and because of the Frenches\u2019 conduct prior to execution of the writing. Plaintiffs point to paragraph 9 of the printed contract which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">Purchaser represents that an inspection satisfactory to Purchaser has been made of the property, and Purchaser agrees to accept the property in its present condition except as may be otherwise provided in the description of the property above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Plaintiffs contend, assuming for purpose of argument that a fraudulent misrepresentation was made, that as a matter of law the Frenches had no right to rely on such misrepresentation. They argue that French was put on notice that the septic system might be defective by Armentrout\u2019s statement during the first October visit that the tank had been pumped. Accordingly, plaintiffs argue, defendants were under a duty to make inspections and to ascertain the true condition of the premises, and having failed so to do, defendants cannot now avail themselves of the alleged misrepresentation, <em>citing Poe </em>v. <em>Voss, </em>196 Va. 821, 86 S.E.2d 47 (1955), and <em>Masche </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>188 Va. 857, 51 S.E.2d 144 (1949). We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">The principle of law set forth in <em>Poe </em>and <em>Masche </em>is that a purchaser of real estate must discover for himself the true condition of the premises if he has information which would excite the suspicions of a reasonably prudent person. <em>Horner </em>v. <em>Ahern, </em>207 Va. 860, 864, 153 S.E.2d 216, 219 (1967). But a very important exception to that rule is that the seller \u201cmust not say or do anything to throw the purchaser off his guard or to divert him from making the inquiries and examination which a prudent man ought to make.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defendants\u2019 evidence here brings their case within the foregoing exception. In response to French\u2019s inquiry during the first visit about the condition of the septic system, Armentrout assured French that it \u201cchecked fine\u201d and that \u201ceverything works fine.\u201d At the same time, according to defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>evidence as we have already said, Armentrout knew of the smell, knew a \u201cRoto-Rooter\u201d had been used to clear the system, knew of the rag-stuffed drains and knew of the sluggish toilets. Yet Armentrout did not disclose any of this information which was relevant to French\u2019s inquiry. Thus, prior to the execution of the contract, diverted by Armentrout\u2019s conduct, French justifiably thought he had made the satisfactory inspection referred to in paragraph 9 of the contract. He also was distracted at that time from making further inquiry on the subject by the affirmative misleading statements of fact by Armentrout.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Finally, plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in giving Instruction F. <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Mistakenly characterizing the charge as a finding instruction, plaintiffs argue it was misleading, incomplete and vague. They note it was patterned after opinion language in <em>Jefferson Standard Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hedrick, </em>181 Va. 824, 833-34, 27 S.E.2d 198, 202 (1943), quoted in the dissent in <em>Poe </em>v. <em>Voss, </em>196 Va. at 828, 86 S.E.2d at 51, which, they say, was inappropriate to be included in an instruction in this case. Plaintiffs argue the instruction did not impose upon defendants a burden to establish the fraud by clear, cogent and convincing proof nor did it impose upon defendants the burden to prove the existence of the material fact that the system was so defective as to render the house.unsalable and unfit for occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">We do not think the trial court committed reversible error in giving the instruction. The defendants\u2019 burden upon the fraud and materiality issues had been fully and adequately set forth in other instructions. Perhaps Instruction F was unnecessary, but we do not think the jury could have been misled in view of the provisions of the other instructions dealing in clear terms with the one issue of fact in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">For these reasons, the judgments below will be</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\"> Instruction F provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">The Court instructs the Jury that if Mr. Armentrout represents as true what is really false, or conceals the difficulty he had experienced with the septic system in such a way as to induce a reasonable person to believe it, and Mr. and Mrs. French, to whom the representation is made, or from whom the facts are concealed, act on it, believing that no difficulty in the septic system has been experienced, there is such fraud as will justify a rescission of the Contract of Sale. Whether the representation is made innocently or knowingly, if acted on, the effect is the same. In the one case the fraud is constructive; in the other, it is actual.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>POFF, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A1R\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">I concur in the Court\u2019s conclusion and the <em>ratio decidendi. </em>I think it is important, however, to emphasize that the analysis rests upon the law of the case as defined in the instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In my view, the law of the case is not the law of Virginia. Contrary to the trial court\u2019s instruction, a purchaser of a house who seeks to rescind an executory contract of sale for fraudulent misrepresentation concerning the condition of the property need not show that the property was so defective as to be \u201cunsaleable and unfit for occupancy\u201d. A defect of less consequence may be a fact material to the formation of the contract. Misrepresentation of such a fact m.ay support rescission for fraud in the inducement. <em>See, e.g., Brame </em>v. <em>Guarantee Finance Company, </em>139 Va. 394, 408, 124 S.E. 477, 481 (1924); <em>Max Meadows Land and Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>92 Va. 71, 77, 22 S.E. 845, 847 (1895).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
