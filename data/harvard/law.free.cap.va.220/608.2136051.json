The trial court confirmed the jury\u2019s determinations in a December 1978 judgment of conviction, from which we granted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Only two witnesses testified during the brief trial. The arresting officer stated that in April of 1978, he observed defendant, a resident of Front Royal, operating a motor vehicle on a public highway in Warren County. Having previously determined that Yager was an habitual offender, the officer arrested defendant who then exhibited a valid Maryland driver\u2019s license. At trial, the Commonwealth introduced into evidence a certified copy of a 1972 court order declaring Yager an \u201chabitual offender\u201d and prohibiting him from operating a motor vehicle on the highways of Virginia. Defendant\u2019s wife testified only to matters in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the jury was charged in one instruction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Over defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court refused to give Instruction 3,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which focused on the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and Instruction 5,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> dealing primarily with the so-called \u201cpresumption of innocence.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The first issue we address is defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in refusing Instruction 3 which specifically placed the burden on the Commonwealth to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Recognizing Instruction 1 \u201cmentioned\u201d the term \u201creasonable doubt,\u201d defendant contends the instruction was \u201csilent as to the Commonwealth\u2019s burden.\u201d We do not think refusal of Instruction 3 was prejudicial error; Instruction 1 adequately covered the subject under the peculiar facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Pursuant to the statute under which Yager was charged, note 1 <em>supra, </em>there are but two simple elements of the offense: (1) whether defendant has been adjudicated an habitual offender and (2) whether he operated a motor vehicle in this State while the order of the court prohibiting such operation was in effect. Instruction 1 effectively set forth those two elements and required them to be found beyond a reasonable doubt. While, as the Attorney General observes, \u201cit would have been preferable for this instruction to state in express terms that the Commonwealth had the burden of establishing defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d we agree with his argument that, in this case, the \u201cpractical effect of the instruction was the same.\u201d It was implicit from the language used where the burden of proof lay. Moreover, the prosecutor on two occasions, in his opening statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>and again during closing argument, told the jury that the burden of proof was on the Commonwealth. Under these circumstances, it is inconceivable that the jury misunderstood where the burden of proof was placed, and Instruction 3 thus was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The second issue to be considered is defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court\u2019s failure to grant Instruction 5 on the presumption of innocence denied him \u201cthe right to a fair trial. . .by jury.\u201d He relies on the settled rule established by the case law of this Commonwealth that generally \u201cthe accused is entitled to an instruction on the presumption of innocence, and it is reversible error for the trial court to refuse such an instruction when requested.\u201d <em>Whaley </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 353, 355, 200 S.E.2d 556, 558 (1973); <em>Allen v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 805, 808-09, 180 S.E.2d 513, 516 (1971); <em>Widgeon </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>142 Va. 658, 666, 128 S.E. 459, 461 (1925). He correctly points out that many years ago this court, relying on <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>156 U.S. 432 (1895), held that the lack of a presumption of innocence instruction is not sufficiently cured by giving a reasonable doubt instruction. <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>162 Va. 818, 829, 174 S.E. 856, 861 (1934) .<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The Attorney General, on the other hand, urges that the trial court committed no reversible error in refusing to grant Instruction 5. He says that \u201c[i]n the context of this case, no presumption of innocence instruction was necessary.\u201d He argues that in all previous de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>cisions of this court holding that such an instruction was necessary, each case involved disputed facts \u201cso that such an instruction might well have affected the jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d citing <em>Whaley </em>and <em>Campbell. </em>He contends that in this case there was no question whatever that defendant\u2019s guilt was established beyond all doubt and that the \u201cobvious purpose\u201d of defendant\u2019s evidence was merely to reduce Yager\u2019s punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">The Attorney General also relies on the recent case of <em>Kentucky </em>v. <em>Whorton, </em>441 U.S. 786 (1979). In <em>Whorton, </em>the Supreme Court considered whether the refusal of a state trial judge to give an instruction on the presumption of innocence violated the Court\u2019s previous holding in <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>436 U.S. 478 (1978). In <em>Taylor, </em>the Court held the trial court\u2019s refusal to give defendant\u2019s requested instruction on the presumption of innocence \u201cresulted in a violation of his right to a fair trial as guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490. Subsequently, the Kentucky Supreme Court, in <em>Whorton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>570 S.W.2d 627 (1978), read <em>Taylor </em>to mean that when a presumption of innocence instruction was requested and denied, reversible constitutional error was absolutely committed. <em>Id. </em>at 633. The Supreme Court of the United States reversed that decision. The Court said in <em>Whorton </em>that the decision in <em>Taylor </em>was confined to its facts and that there was no intention in <em>Taylor </em>to create a rule that an instruction on the presumption of innocence is constitutionally required in every case. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">In short, the failure to give a requested instruction on the presumption of innocence does not in and of itself violate the Constitution. Under <em>Taylor, </em>such a failure must be evaluated in light of the totality of the circumstances \u2014 including all the instructions to the jury, the arguments of counsel, whether the weight of the evidence was overwhelming, and other relevant factors \u2014 to determine whether the defendant received a constitutionally fair trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">441 U.S. at 789. The Court remanded <em>Whorton </em>for a determination of whether the failure to give such an instruction deprived the defendant of Due Process of Law in fight of the totality of the circumstances of the case. The Attorney General urges us to adopt such a test in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">Defendant argues that <em>Whorton </em>is not controlling because it was based on an interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Federal Constitution. He notes that no Kentucky cases or state constitutional provisions were cited in <em>Whorton. </em>Defendant points out that his legal position rests on Virginia case law and upon Article I, \u00a7 8 and \u00a7 11, of the Constitution of Virginia \u201cwhich grants all criminal defendants the right to a fair trial by an impartial jury.\u201d The Attorney General rejoins that \u201cVirginia does not constitutionally require anything beyond what was set forth in <em>Whorton\u201d </em>because Virginia\u2019s Article I, \u00a7 11 Due Process Clause is virtually identical to the same clause in the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">We will agree with defendant and assume, without deciding, that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct on the presumption of innocence. Nevertheless, we believe such error, if it was error, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, given the facts and circumstances of this case. <em>See Harrington </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 250 (1969); <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18 (1967); <em>Goins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 285, 288, 237 S.E.2d 136, 138 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Code \u00a7 8.01-678 provides, in part, that no judgment shall be reversed on appeal when it \u201cplainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d Our Criminal Rule 3A:2(a) provides, in part, that errors which do not affect substantial rights shall not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">In the present case the evidence of guilt was uncontroverted and overwhelming. The defendant\u2019s substantial rights were not affected in any way. There was positive, unimpeached evidence proving defendant an habitual offender who operated a motor vehicle in this State while the order adjudicating him as such was still in effect. The whole thrust of defendant\u2019s evidence was aimed at mitigation of punishment. Not once during the evidence or in argument did defendant\u2019s counsel dispute Yager\u2019s guilt, and he could properly have taken no other course of action. As a matter of fact, defense counsel told the jury that defendant \u201cwas declared a habitual offender in 1972, 6 years before this incident\u201d and that he was \u201cbefore the Court today facing one to five years in the Penitentiary simply because he. . . got himself into trouble by operating a motor vehicle.\u201d Under the unique circumstances of this case, giving the challenged instruction could not have changed the guilt finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Nor is there any likelihood that the giving of a presumption of innocence instruction would have altered the sentence, which was one year above the minimum. Defendant points to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Grosso </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 177 </em>Va. 830, 844-45, 13 S.E. 2d 285, 290 (1941), and says the fact that the punishment exceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>the minimum prevents application of the harmless-error rule. We do not agree. In <em>Grosso, </em>the court was faced with a number of \u201csubstantial\u201d errors, not just a refusal to give a presumption of innocence instruction. Clearly it was their combined weight which led the court to believe that the errors were not harmless. Such is not the case here where there was one alleged error, and for a flagrant, unexplained felonious act defendant received a modest sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">In conclusion, this is one of those rare cases in which it was not reversible error to refuse to instruct on presumption of innocence. But this decision should not be taken as a signal that we have softened our adherence to the principle, \u201cfirmly engrafted in our jurisprudence\u201d and \u201ca landmark of the law,\u201d <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>162 Va. at 828, 174 S.E. at 861, that the accused in most every case is entitled to an instruction on presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of conviction will be</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-14\"> \u00a7 46.1-387.8.

Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2511 (3d ed. 1940), states:</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">It is now generally recognized that the \u2018presumption of innocence\u2019 is an inaccurate, shorthand description of the right of the accused to \u2018remain inactive and secure, until the prosecution has taken up its burden and produced evidence and effected persuasion; <em>i.e., </em>to say in this case, as in any other, that the opponent of a claim or charge is presumed not to be guilty is to say in another form that the proponent of the claim or charge must evidence it.\u2019 Wigmore ,407. The principal inaccuracy is the fact that it is not technically a \u2018presumption\u2019 \u2014 a mandatory inference drawn from a fact in evidence. Instead, it is better characterized as an \u2018assumption\u2019 that is indulged in the absence of contrary evidence. (Citations omitted). 436 U.S. at 484 n.12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b772-7\"> The principle that there is a presumption of innocence in favor of the accused and the principle that the prosecution bears the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt are not logically separate and distinct. <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>436 U.S. at 483. Nevertheless, legal scholars advise against abandoning the instruction on the presumption of innocence, even when a complete charge on the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is provided. <em>Id. at </em>484. The reason for this admonition is that the lay juror may obtain \u201csignificant additional guidance from an instruction on the presumption of innocence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Justice Powell quotes Wigmore\u2019s description of this effect on the ordinary citizen:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-8\">\u2018[I]n a criminal case the term [presumption of innocence] does convey a special and perhaps useful hint over and above the other form of the rule about the burden of proof, in that it cautions the jury to put away from their minds all the suspicion that arises from the arrest, the indictment, and the arraignment, and to reach their conclusion solely from the legal evidence adduced. In other words, the rule about burden of proof requires the prosecution by evidence to convince the jury of the accused\u2019s guilt; while the presumption of innocence, too, requires this, but conveys for the jury a special and additional caution (which is perhaps only an implied corollary to the other) to consider, in the material for their belief, <em>nothing but the evidence, i.e., </em>no surmises based on the present situation of the accused. This caution is indeed particularly needed in criminal cases.\u2019 Wigmore 407.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 484-85 (emphasis Wigmore\u2019s).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
