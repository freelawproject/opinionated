West (formerly King), natural mother of David M. King, II, was awarded a final divorce from David\u2019s natural father. In the divorce proceeding, the mother was awarded custody of David, and the father was ordered to support him. The father, however, has left the state and provides no support for David.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">On May 5, 1977, Gladys King, David\u2019s paternal grandmother, served upon the mother a notice that on May 24, 1977, the grandmother would move the juvenile and domestic relations district court for entry of an order permitting her \u201cto have visitation rights\u201d with David, who was then four years old. On July 12, 1977, the court denied the grandmother\u2019s \u201c[vjisitation request,\u201d and she appealed to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">By order entered February 24, 1978, the circuit court awarded the grandmother \u201ctemporary limited visitation\u201d with David, the visits to occur \u201con the second and fourth Friday of each month from 12:00 Noon on Friday to 6:30 P.M. on Saturday.\u201d The mother is here on an appeal from the circuit court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">Testifying in circuit court, the grandmother stated that she had maintained a close relationship with David since his birth. For a period of two months, she said, David and his mother had lived with her, but the arrangement terminated because she disapproved of the mother\u2019s activities. The grandmother emphasized that she sought only visitation with, not custody of, David.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-12\">The mother testified and voiced her strong opposition to the grandmother\u2019s visitation with David. She had started a new life for herself, the mother said, and did not want her former husband\u2019s family included. She suffered great upset, the mother stated, when David visited his grandmother, and, after the visits, he was \u201cvery stubborn and harder to manage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-13\">On her appeal here, the mother contends that \u201c[njeither the Juvenile Court nor the Circuit Court had jurisdiction to order visitation by [the grandmother] over [the mother\u2019s] objection.\u201d At common law, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>mother argues, a grandparent had no rights of visitation with a grandchild, and no Virginia statute confers such a right.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">The grandmother contends, however, that a Virginia statute, Code \u00a7 16.1-241, does vest a juvenile court, and hence a circuit court on appeal, with jurisdiction to order grandparental visitation. In pertinent part, \u00a7 16.1-241 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-6\">\u201c[Ejach juvenile and domestic relations district court shall have . . . exclusive original jurisdiction . . . over all cases, matters and proceedings involving:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-7\">\u201cA. The custody, visitation, support, control or disposition of a child:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-8\">\u2022\u00a1\u00ed \u00a5 ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-9\">\u201c3. Whose custody, visitation or support is a subject of controversy or requires determination....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">The grandmother says that the \u201cplain language\u201d of this statute \u201cdoes not restrict the jurisdiction of the court to disputes regarding custody and visitation between parents.\u201d The language of the statute is broad enough, the grandmother asserts, to vest \u201cjuvenile and circuit courts [with] jurisdiction to determine any question of visitation where there [is] a controversy,\u201d whether between parents or between parent and grandparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">We agree with the grandmother that the language of \u00a7 16.1-241 (A) (3) is broad, but we believe that therein lies its fatal weakness to accomplish the result she seeks in this case. As between a parent who has been awarded custody of a child, on the one hand, and, on the other, third persons, including grandparents, the rights of the custodial parent are paramount; the parent has the authority to control the child and to determine with whom it visits. If these rights are to be derogated by a grant of jurisdiction purporting to permit the award of grandparental visitation privileges despite the custodial parent\u2019s objection, then the grant should be specific, reflecting the legislative intent in unambiguous language.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>In our opinion, the language of \u00a7 16.1-241 (A) (3) is completely inadequate to confer jurisdiction to award the visitation privileges sought by the grandmother here. For this reason, the order of the trial court will be reversed, and the grandmother\u2019s motion will be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b916-12\"> For an example of the specificity required, see former Code \u00a7 16.1-158.1, which was adopted in 1972 but repealed in 1977 by the same act that adopted \u00a7 16.1-241, upon which the grandmother relies here. Acts 1977, c. 559. In pertinent part, \u00a7 16.1-158.1 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-13\">\u201c[The juvenile] court shall have jurisdiction upon petition, to hear and determine, in cases where either the father or mother of an unmarried minor child is deceased, whether the parents of such deceased person may be granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>reasonable visitation privileges to such child during its minority, upon a finding by the court that such visitation privileges would be in the best interests of the minor child, the court may so order and have the power to enforce, or upon cause shown, revoke, such order.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
