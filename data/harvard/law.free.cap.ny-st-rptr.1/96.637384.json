The plaintiff claims that he intended to allege a trespass as a breach of the covenant for quiet enjoyment. If such was his intention, he does not appear to have done so in his pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">A trespass is not necessarily a breach of such a covenant, and if it is sought to plead it as a breach, the pleadings should plainly show that \"it is so pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">That is not the case here. We must be governed by the words of the pleadings, without reference to other considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">This complaint, in our opinion, sets forth a cause of action in contract, and a cause or action in tort. These causes of action cannot be joined. <em>Keep </em>v. Kaufman, 56 N. Y., 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">The judgments of the courts below should be affirmed, with leave to the plaintiff to serve an amended complaint within twenty days from notice of the entry of this judgment, upon the payment, within the same time, of costs, from the service of the demurrer, including those on appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-12\">Bookstaver, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
