I am of the opinion upon this evidence, principally adduced by the plaintiff, that the plaintiff\u2019s parents, who had charge and control of her at the time, were guilty of negligence that contributed to the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">It is immaterial whether the plaintiff was <em>sui juris </em>or <em>non-sui juris, </em>for the reason that if the former, then she must be regarded as capable of forming a judgment as to whether, if she put her hand on the gate, it might result to her injury\u2014if the latter, then, although not chargeable with contributory negligence <em>per se, </em>yet she cannot recover without proving that her parents, in whose charge she was, did not contribute to the injury. If the question was in the least material under the circumstances, I should unhesitatingly adopt the last situation, for it would be absurd to credit a child of tender years with sufficient intelligence to anticipate and avoid possible danger from the \u25a0operating of a mechanical contrivance like the gate upon this ferry-boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">It is unquestioned law \u201cthat negligence in respect of the duty which is actionable is the omission to do something which a reasonable man would do, or the doing something which a reasonable man would not do; the failure to do what a person of ordinary prudence would have done under the circumstances of the situation, or doing what such a person, under such circumstances, would not have done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">It is equally well settled that \u201cthough negligence,whereby \u2022 actual damage is caused, is actionable, yet 5 the plaintiff has himself contributed to his loss, he cannot recover from the defendant,\u201d and \u201cthat the affirmative of the issue of negligence on the part of the defendant and of freedom from \u25a0contributive negligence on the part of the plaintiff rests upon the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-13\">The comt of appeals has settled the law in this state. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>that in cases where contributory negligence may be claimed, the absence thereof is part of the plaintiff's case, and the-burden of satisfying the jury on that point, by a prepon-. derance of evidence, rests upon him. <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>78 N. Y., 480 ; Moak\u2019s Underhill on Torts, 311, and cases there-cited. These propositions of law are sustained by an unbroken line of decisions too numerous for citation. The rule in this state is, that a child too young to have discretion for himself, cannot recover, if his protector fails to exercise ordinary care. Schouler\u2019s Domestic Relations (3d. ed.), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">In reviewing the evidence in this case in the light of the principles of law, which I have stated, it seems to me impossible to say, that the plaintiff\u2019s parents did not in some-degree, contribute, by their own negligence, to the injury for which she seeks redress. The father testified: <em>\u201c </em>That, the child was standing by the gate ; that his friend, Mr. Rohrs, had the little girl by the hand to protect her; that, he was right near by and by his wife also ; that he did not tell his friend, not to let the little girl go near the gate;. that he saw Mr. Rohrs have the child\u2019s hand the last time-he saw it; he could not say what the child did with the other hand; he did not know whether she had it on the gate or in her pocket or anywhere ; that at the instant he heard the shriek, he thought he was looking at something else.\u201d The mother testified : <em>\u201c </em>That the child was standing by the gate, alongside of her friend who had hold of its hand, and that she stood just behind, and that she did not see wha,t it was doing with the other hand.\u201d Mr. Rohrs, the friend, who had the child by the hand, though present in. court, was not called as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The question is, does not this undisputed evidence establish most clearly that the plaintiff\u2019s parents were not free from negligence that contributed to the injury ? Does it not establish that the parents in fact contributed, by their negligence, to the injury in question ? It seems to me, it does not admit of doubt. The father knowing how the gate-was operated, that the boat was about to be fastened to the bridge\u2014-that his child was standing at the gate, himself, wife and friend immediately next to her\u2014it was clearly negligence on his part, not to look to see where the child\u2019s left hand was. It was clearly negligence, under the circumstances, to allow the child to go up to the gate, and.not to see to it, that she did not put her hand on the gate, which was about to be opened, and which, he said, he knew had t.o be opened, to let the passengers off.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Looking at this evidence, I cannot persuade myself that there was not such a large and unmistakable want of proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>care, on the part of the child\u2019s lawful and responsible protectors as should defeat a recovery in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">I am of the opinion that the evidence clearly and positively established the contributive negligence of the child\u2019s protectors, and that they failed to exercise even the ordinary care, which the law imposed upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The judgment and order appealed from should be reversed and a new trial ordered, costs to abide the event.
