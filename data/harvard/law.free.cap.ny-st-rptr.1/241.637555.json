The complaint alleged that at the time of the assignment the defendants were indebted to the plaintiff for wages actually due him as an employee; that other employees were preferred, and that by the terms of the assignment certain other parties not employees were preferred in an amount exceeding the actual assets. <em>Sell, </em>that the direction contained in section 338 of the Laws of 1884 was mandatory; that the assignment itself must contain a direction to pay all employees before any other debt; that the fact that the assignors directed the wages due certain employees to be preferred and then disposed of the balance of the estate without providing for the payment of the plaintiff, rendered the assignment void.

The plaintiff, a judgment creditor of the assigning partners, Hartwell and Woodford, brought the action to set aside a general assignment, under which the defendant Lantry is the assignee. The plaintiff was an employee of the assignors at the time of the execution of the assignment, and there was actually due him as wages some $227.52, for which he duly obtained judgment and issued execution, which was returned unsatisfied. Preferences were created by the assignment in the following order: (1) For wages of employees, other than the plaintiff, to the amount of $308.78: (2) lawyer\u2019s fees, $268; (3) Julia B. Woodford, $6,000; (4) William H. Jackson &amp; Uo., $3,417.35; (5) Louis F. Stevens, $259.63; making in all, $10.253.76. The assets amount only to $9,000. The assignee is about to pay these creditors in the order named. The plaintiff based his action upon the ground that the assignment is void under the amendment to the general assignment act, passed May 21, 1884, and obtained an injunction under section 603 of the Code. The opposition to the continuance of the injunction is based solely upon the ground that the complaint does not constitute a cause of action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-4\"><em>James B.

It cannot be directory, because a failure to comply with it \u25a0can never be supplied; because it provides for the acquiring \u25a0of a property right, and not simply for a mode of procedure; because it goes to the very essentials of the instrument, and a failure t\u00f3 comply with it affects every right created under the instrument. See opinion of Judge van Brunt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u2022special term, 1886, in <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Tobias; </em>see, also, <em>In re Lewis, </em>81 N. Y., 421, 424. The meaning of the statute \u2022 evidently was that the assignors should insert a direction to the assignee to pay all debts actually due employees at the time of the assignment. If it be true, as held by the court of appeals <em>In re Lewis, </em>before cited, that an assignment is a deed of trust, and \u201cthat the assignee is merely the representative of the debtor, and must be governed by the express terms of his trust,\u201d it cannot be held that the requirements of the statute may be admitted, or, as in the \u25a0present case, the requirements of the assignment directly overridden, and yet me purposes of the statute effectuated, for then, as we shad hereafter attempt to show, the act would be unconstitutional. The case of <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Herron </em>(39 Hun, 531), is relied upon by the defendants as controlling this motion. It is distinguished as to the facts as follows: (1.) At special term the only point considered, and the point upon which the case turned, was that the plaintiffs not being employees, could not avail themselves of the objection, and Judge Andrews there says: \u201c The failure of the assignors to give preference to the wages and salaries of employees is not an injury but a benefit to the plaintiffs in this action, and, in my opinion, is an objection to the assignment, which is available to no one but such employees themselves.\u201d 39 Hun, 350. (2) The assignment in that case created no preferences, while in the present case, by the express Arms of the assignment, the assignee is directed to pay over $10,000 of preferences, or more than the assets amount to, so that, unless the assignee expressly departs from the instrument from which he derives his authority as assignee, he cannot comply with the assignment. This case is squarely met by the unanimous decision of the general term of the second department, affirming the decision of Judge Dykeman, at special term, which is reported in 38 Hun, 634, and a copy of the opinion in full is annexed. The language of the general term is: \u201cWages of employees were not preferred, as required by the act of 1884, and that neglect made the assignment invalid.\u201d The following judges of the supreme court have held that the failure to prefer employees rendered the assignment void: Judges Dykeman, Pratt and Barnard, of the second department, and Judges Van Brunt and Daniels, in the first department. As opposed to these is the opinions of Judges Davis and Brady.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-4\"><em>Stabler &amp; Hippie, for </em>defendant Hartwell.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-5\"><em>N.

This decision was followed by the general term of the fifth department in <em>Burley </em>v. <em>Hartson </em>(23 Weekly Dig., 586), holding that the statute itself created a preference irrespective of the assignment. The contrary doctrine was held in <em>Boberts </em>v. <em>Tobias, </em>by Judge Van Brunt, at special term, April, 1886, in the following \u25a0opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Van Brunt, J.\u2014I am of the opinion that the assignment in question is void because of a failure to comply with section 29 of the Assignment Act of 1877, -as amended by chapter 828 of the Laws of 1884.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The act of 1884, Chapter 328, declares that in all assignments made in pursuance of this act (chapter 466, Laws of 1877) the wages and salaries actually owing to the employees of the assignor at the time of the execution of the assignment shall be preferred, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The words are that in all assignments the preference shall be made. Hot that the preference shall exist outside of and independent of the assignment. The right to the preference arises in the assignment and nowhere else.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">The assignee has no right to act in any way except as directed by the assignment, because \u201c the assignee derives all his power from the assignment, which is both the guide and measure of his duty. Beyond that, or outside of its terms, he is powerless and without authority.\u201d <em>In re Lewis, </em>81 N. Y., 421,424.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">In view of the above it cannot be said that the act is an enactment to govern the mode of distributing the estate, because the assignee must distribute the \u25a0 estate as the assignment directs.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Having this fact in view, the Legislature said that in the assignment provision must be first made for the payment of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">The argument that as the act does not say that the assignment shall be void if this preference is not made, and that, therefore, the assignment is good, would operate as a repeal of the act, because as the assignee derives all his authority from the assignment, and as he cannot act outside of it, then if the . assignment contained no preference of employees, the assignment would be good, although the assignee could not give the employees the preference provided by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">Such a result shows that the act is mandatory, and a failure to comply with it must avoid the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-14\">The general term of the second department affirmed the decision of Judge Dykeman, who wrote no opinion, in the case of <em>Harriot </em>v. <em>Masterson. </em>A memorandum of the decision appears at 38 Hun, 642. The opinion is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b267-15\">Pratt, J.\u2014The court, at special term, has found upon evidence sufficient <em>i </em>o that purpose, that the assignment of Masterson was made with the intent to hinder, delay and defraud his creditors. The omission from the schedules - of items of valuable property without any adequate or satisfactory explanar tion, affords ground to believe that the intention of the assignor was to secrete the property for his own benefit. Assignments by debtors of their property to trustees of their own selection are tolerated, not favored, in law, ana the requirement that all the debtor\u2019s property should be disclosed and brought within the scope of the trust is not too severe. The other grounds upon which the assignment was attacked were equally fatal. Wages of employees were not preferred as required by the act of 1884 and that neglect made the assignment invalid. 34 Hun, 457. So of the preference of the co-partnership creditors to be first paid from the individual property. A well-established prin- \u25a0 ciple of equitable administration of insolvent estates was sought to be evaded. Ho such effort can be permitted to succeed. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Cornell, </em>1 Sand. Ch. R., 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-17\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-18\">Barnard, P.
