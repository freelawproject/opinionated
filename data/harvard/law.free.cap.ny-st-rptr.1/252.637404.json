specially charged with enforcing the laws of this state and preserving the peace of the city,\u201d and the complainant alleges that the defendants, by its servants and policemen, have threatened to arrest the plaintiff and all his employees, and to interfere with plaintiff\u2019s business, and prevent him from carrying on the same at. his place of business in the city of New York, Claiming that the plaintiff violates the law, and further alleging \u201cthat plaintiff violates no law whatever, and unless the defendants are enjoined from interfering with plaintiff\u2019s business, and making the threatened arrest, the injury plaintiff will sustain will be irreparable, which cannot be estimated or ascertained in an action at law,\u201d and the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>plaint demands judgment \u201cthat the defendants, its superintendent, inspectors, captains, sergeants, roundsmen, patrolmen, etc., be enjoined and restrained from arresting or taking into custody any person engaged upon the premises of the plaintiff in the transaction of the business of the plaintiff, and from interfering with or hindering any such persons in the transaction of said business, and from in any manner proceeding against such persons by arrest, or otherwise in the conduct of said business on plaintiff\u2019s premises, and from in any manner interfering with or hindering plaintiff or such person or persons authorized in carrying on the business as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">On this complaint and the affidavit of the plaintiff, which, it is claimed, tended to show that the business carried on at the premises described in the complaint was not in violation of law, and that he and his servants were not guilty of the crime charged, an order was entered which provided \u201cthat the said defendants, and all persons acting under defendant\u2019s authority, or by its directions, desist and refrain, until the final determination of this action, from arresting or taking into custody any persons engaged upon the premises of the plaintiff in the transaction of any business with the plaintiff, and from interfering with or plundering any such person in the transaction of said business, and from in any manner proceeding against any such person by arrest or otherwise in the conduct of said business upon the plaintiff\u2019s premises, and from in any other way interfering with or hindering plaintiff or such person or persons as may be authorized by him in carrying on his business as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">By section 250 of chapter 410 of the Laws of 1882, known as the consolidation act, it is provided that the government and discipline of the police department of the city of New York shall be such as the board of police may from time to time by rules and regulations prescribe, and by section 277 of the said act, \u201cThe several members of the police force shall have power and authority to immediately arrest without warrant, and to take into custody, any persons who shall commit, or threaten to, or attempt to commit, in the presence of such member, or within his view, any breach of the peace or offense directly prohibited by the legislature or by any ordinance of the said city, and the members of the police force shall possess, in the city of New York, and in every part of this state, all the common law and statutory powers of the constables.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">By section 2010 of the said act it is provided, \u201cIt shall not be lawful to sell or furnish any wine, beer, or strong or spirituous liquors, to any person in the auditorium or lobbies of any place of exhibition or performance mentioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>in section 1998, or in apartments connected, therewith by any door, window or aperture,\u201d and by section 2012 it is provided, \u201cThat any person violating any of the provisions of section 2010 shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The selling or furnishing of any wine, beer or liquor in the auditorium or lobby of a place of exhibition or performance having been made a misdemeanor, it became the duty of the members of the police force to arrest the plaintiff if he sold or furnished wine or liquor in the place prohibited by the statute, and the ground upon which the plaintiff requested the court below to grant the injunction was that the act of the plaintiff and his servants were not in violation of the section referred to, or in other words, that they were not guilty of the misdemeanor for which the police threatened arrest. This was the only question discussed in the opinion below and in the briefs submitted by counsel for respondent on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The court below held that the plaintiff was not guilty of the crime, thus trying in a court of equity the guilt or innocence of a person accused of a crime on affidavit. There was no charge in the complaint that the police had threatened to make the arrest without a warrant or the authority required by law. The allegation is that plaintiff was accused of a crime; that the police threatened to arrest him for committing such crime; that he was innocent of the crime charged and did not want to be arrested, because it would injure his business, and whether or not a court of equity has jurisdiction to determine such a question in this action, is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">It is clear\u2014that the assumption of such jurisdiction by a court of equity would entirely subvert the method provided by law for the trial of criminal cases. If such jurisdiction should be upheld, every person accused of crime would have the right to apply to the court for an injunction restraining his arrest and the court would be bound to entertain the application and to try the question of his guilt or innocence upon affidavits. Upon no principle could the jurisdiction be restrained to a particular class of crimes and a person charged with the crime of murder would be as much entitled to the remedy as a person charged with a violation of the section of the statute referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The tendency has been to greatly extend the remedy by injunction in civil cases, but certainly such remedy should be limited to civil cases and criminal cases left to be disposed of in the criminal courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The question was presented to the court of appeals in the case of <em>Davis </em>v. <em>The American Society, etc. </em>(15 N. Y. 368), where as in this case the plaintiff claimed that his acts were not in violation of the statute under which the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>\u25a0of the defendant claimed the right to arrest, and it was there held that the action was absolutely without sanction in \u25a0precedent or principles of equity. The court say \u201cthe only \u25a0question for contestation was whether as matter of fact they were guilty or innocent of such violation and the determination of that question could not by such an action \u25a0as this be drawn to a court of equity. Whether a person accused of a crime be guilty or innocent is to be determined in a common law court by a jury and the people as well as the accused have the right to have it thus determined.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">But the order granted in this case went further than to restrain the arrest of the plaintiff and his employees. The defendants are \u201cenjoined from arresting or taking into custody any person engaged upon the premises of the plaintiff in the transaction of any business with the plaintiff, and from in any manner proceeding against any such person by arrest or otherwise in the conduct of said business upon plaintiff\u2019s premises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Such an injunction would give any person engaged upon the premises of the plaintiff in the transaction of any business, immunity from arrest for any crime and practically nulify the statute which gives to the members of the police force power and authority to arrest and take into custody any person who shall commit, or threaten, or attempt to commit in the presence of such officer any offense prohibited by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We do not decide whether or not the acts of the plaintiff were in violation of section 2010 of the consolidation act, but we are of the opinion that such questions cannot be \u25a0determined by this court in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The order appealed from should, therefore, be reversed, with ten dollars costs and disbursements; and motion for injunction denied, with ten dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
