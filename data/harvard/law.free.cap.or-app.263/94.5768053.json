The trial court imposed consecutive sentences on all but two counts, for a total sentence of 569 months. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erroneously (1) allowed the state to show the jury videotaped interviews of defendant\u2019s victims; (2) allowed the state to introduce expert opinion testimony from a lay witness; (3) denied defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial based on the state\u2019s closing and rebuttal arguments; and (4) made certain determinations at sentencing that, defendant argues, should have been submitted to the jury. We reject defendant\u2019s arguments and, accordingly, affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Defendant was charged with sexually abusing, sodomizing, and raping two of his stepdaughters, S and K, during the several years that he was married to their mother. S and K both came forward to describe the abuse several years after it was alleged to have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Of importance to this appeal are two videotaped interviews that S and K gave at the Sexual Trauma Abuse Response Center (STAR Center). In those interviews, both victims reported numerous instances of sexual abuse, some of which resulted in charges against defendant and some of which did not. S also referenced defendant smoking crystal methamphetamine and blowing the smoke into S\u2019s mouth; this conduct was not included in the state\u2019s charges against defendant. In the videotapes, S and K also answered personal background questions about topics including their schooling, hobbies, and pets. S and K both testified at the trial about the sexual abuse; much of that testimony reflected what they had described in the STAR Center interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Before trial, defendant moved to exclude the STAR Center videotaped interviews, arguing that they contained (1) inadmissible hearsay, (2) evidence that was not relevant under OEC 402, (3) evidence that was unfairly prejudicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>under OEC 403, and (4) evidence of other prior bad acts that was not admissible under OEC 404(3). During a hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, the state conceded, and the trial court ruled, that the videotaped interview of S was hearsay and that the hearsay exception in OEC 803(18a)(b) did not apply.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court then played the videotape of K\u2019s STAR Center interview for the record. At the conclusion of the video, defendant objected to several portions of the video. Specifically, defendant argued that, because the interviewer in the video had told K that, during interviews, \u201cwe always tell the truth,\u201d the STAR Center staff had effectively vouched for K\u2019s credibility. Defendant also argued that portions of the video in which K provided personal information were irrelevant and prejudicial because they had the potential to unfairly endear K to the jury. Finally, defendant argued that, to the extent K was describing crimes committed against S, the OEC 803(18a)(b) hearsay exception did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">The trial court agreed that K\u2019s descriptions of defendant committing crimes against S were inadmissible hearsay and would need to be redacted. The court ruled that the other portions of the videotape were admissible under OEC 803 (18a) (b), OEC 401, and OEC 403. The court explained its reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-5\">\u201cI don\u2019t view the description of the rules as being vouching. [The staff person] didn\u2019t say anything about whether she believed [K] or not, she simply said, \u2018These are the rules. We want you [to] tell the truth, we want you to follow these rules.\u2019 And certainly, I think it\u2019s significant and important for the jury to hear that to understand the setting for the \u2014 her later discussion. The same thing with the small talk, if you will, about who [K] is and where [K] lives and so forth. Certainly, if [the staff person] simply walked in, sat down, and says, \u2018Okay, tell me about your sexual abuse\u2019 the jury should have the right to understand that also. I think the jury has the right to understand the context in which these discussions took place. I don\u2019t see anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>prejudicial about that. They are simply, \u2018Where do you live? [What] are your favorite classes?\u2019 Those kinds of things. It simply sets the tone and lets the jury understand what the circumstances and the environment [were].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The state did not introduce either videotape during its case-in-chief. During defendant\u2019s opening statement, defendant\u2019s counsel suggested that the children\u2019s mother had convinced S and K to lie about defendant\u2019s abuse because she was angry about defendant\u2019s infidelity and the fact that he had impregnated another woman. Defendant questioned Ontario Police Detective Rodriguez and criticized the police investigation as deficient in numerous respects. In particular, Rodriguez testified that police had relied almost exclusively on the STAR Center interviews and had not done follow-up interviews with S or K, their mother, defendant, or other family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Rodriguez responded to the state\u2019s question about the STAR Center staffs ability to investigate crimes by testifying that he \u201cwas satisfied with the interview that took place.\u201d He also explained that he had not personally interviewed S or K because he believed that they would feel uncomfortable speaking to a male police officer and that, based on his past dealings with defendant and his family, he believed that it would have been counterproductive to contact them about the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Having previously authenticated the two videotaped STAR Center interviews, the state moved to admit them on the ground that, because defendant had made an issue of the adequacy of the investigation, the recordings were admissible for the nonhearsay purpose of showing that Rodriguez\u2019s investigation was adequate. The trial court admitted the recordings over defendant\u2019s objections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">\u201cI\u2019m allowing it in \u2014 [defense counsel] raised the issue as to whether or not the length of the interviews [was] sufficient given the timeframe. And I\u2019m going to allow it in so that the jurors can see what the interview consisted of so they can determine whether or not, under the circumstances, it was an appropriate investigation. That\u2019s the issue [the defense has] been raising: [W]as this an appropriate investigation? Did you talk to certain people? The interview wasn\u2019t long enough given the circumstances. Given that issue, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>content of the interview is significant as to whether it was an appropriately long interview. And so you can\u2019t criticize the length and then not allow the jury to see the content so they can determine whether or not it was an appropriately lengthy interview.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">Before playing the videotapes for the jury, the court issued the following limiting instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-5\">\u201c[The tapes are] not being offered to prove the truth of what was being said. In other words, you should not view them from the standpoint of whether or not what is being said is true or not. But the issue has been raised as to whether or not the interviews were lengthy enough and were \u2014 whether or not the interviews were adequate. And so I\u2019m going to \u2014 -I\u2019m admitting [the tapes] for the purpose of allowing you to see the content of those interviews so you can make that judgment as to whether or not the time and length of the interview was adequate. But you should not accept what is being said there as necessarily being true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">This appeal also concerns the testimony of a former Department of Human Services caseworker who had visited the family\u2019s home in 1998 to investigate a report of unsanitary living conditions. The former caseworker, Hansen, testified that she found the report to be unsubstantiated and that \u201c[e] very thing appeared fine\u201d at the house. Defendant did not ask Hansen about sexual abuse. During cross-examination, the state asked whether Hansen had been sent to investigate sexual abuse and whether anyone reported sexual abuse during her visit. Hansen answered \u201cno\u201d to both questions. The state then asked, \u201c [I] s it your experience that kids automatically just tell you if they\u2019re being sexually abused?\u201d Defendant objected, and the court excused the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Defendant argued that, to the extent that Hansen intended to testify generally about the behaviors of sexually abused children, such testimony is scientific evidence that Hansen was unqualified to offer. Defendant also argued that the state\u2019s questioning went beyond the scope of direct examination of Hansen. The state then attempted to lay a proper foundation for the introduction of scientific evidence. Hansen testified that she had worked for child protective services for a total of 13 years; that she had a bachelor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>degree in social work; and that she had received specialized training in \u201cchild sexual abuse, on neglect, on psychological damage, law enforcement issues on how to interview, those types of things.\u201d She stated that she had worked on 100 cases involving child sexual abuse and had testified as an expert witness \u201con the issue of child sexual abuse\u201d more than 20 times. She also acknowledged, however, that she was not a licensed psychologist and that she was not \u201cqualified to do psychological evaluations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">The court ruled that Hansen would be allowed to testify about her own experience with children who were victims of sexual abuse but would not be allowed to offer scientific evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hansen then testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">\u201c [THE STATE]: Now, over the course of your career, have you had an experience to interview a kid who would not disclose any form of abuse, but years later, the abuse was corroborated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">\u201c[HANSEN]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">\u201c [THE STATE]: How many times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">\u201c[HANSEN]: More so than having them report abuse at the time \u2014 the first time of interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-10\">\u201c[THE STATE]: And in your career, even when children disclosed abuse, did you ever see those same children displaying affection towards the person that abused them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-11\">\u201c[HANSEN]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-12\">\u201c[THE STATE]: How frequently did that occur?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>\u201c [HANSEN]: Most all the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-4\">\u201c [THE STATE]: So the \u2014 based on your training and experience, they didn\u2019t show tremendous fear of the abuser?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-5\">\u201c[HANSEN]: Not mostly. Children love their parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-6\">\u201c[THE STATE]: Specific kids. Not general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">\u201c[HANSEN]: Specific kids \u2014 general\u2014the kids that I have interviewed *** still love their parents when they come in and report things. So there is a part of \u2014 a small percentage of those that are absolutely fearful. But for the most part, children still love their parents \u2014 the ones that I have interviewed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">During its closing argument, the state displayed a PowerPoint slide that asserted that \u201c[a] 30-minute interview is more than enough\u201d and reminded the jury that \u201c[y]ou saw the interviews\u201d; \u201c[y]ou saw the demeanor of the girls\u201d; and \u201cDetective Rodriguez had more than enough.\u201d The prosecutor also told the jury,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">\u201cYou saw what the officers did in their investigation, you heard the defense counsel claim that 30 minutes is not enough and that somehow Detective Rodriguez did a lousy investigation. You had an opportunity to see the investigation that was done in this case. You saw \u2014 had the opportunity to look at the demeanor that Detective Rodriguez relied on in submitting this case. You saw the STAR interview. You saw these kids on the stand.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">Defendant objected and requested a mistrial, arguing, among other things, that the PowerPoint slide and the prosecutor\u2019s remarks amounted to impermissible comments on the credibility of S and K. The trial court denied the motion and declined to give a further limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">The jury found defendant guilty of three counts of first-degree sodomy (Counts 1, 2, and 3), one count of second-degree sodomy (Count 4), five counts of first-degree sexual abuse (Counts 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), and one count of second-degree rape (Count 10). At sentencing, the trial court merged Count 2 with Count 6, and Count 4 with Count 8, based on the state\u2019s concession that both crimes would necessarily be \u201cincluded with the commission of the other.\u201d The court then found that the remaining counts were \u201cseparate criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>episodes,\u201d which meant that the court could impose consecutive sentences and that the so-called \u201cshift-to-I\u201d rule, OAR 213-012-0020(2), did not apply. Defendant objected, arguing that Counts 9 and 10 and Counts 3 and 7 were also part of the same criminal episodes and that, therefore, the court was required to apply the shift-to-I rule with respect to those counts. Defendant also argued that he was entitled to have the jury make findings as to whether those counts were part of the same criminal episodes. The trial court disagreed and imposed a 569-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Defendant makes five assignments of error. The first and second assign error to the admission of the two videotaped STAR Center interviews. In the third assignment, defendant argues that trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial based on the state\u2019s closing and rebuttal arguments. The fourth assignment challenges the testimony that Hansen, the former DHS caseworker, gave on cross-examination. The fifth assignment concerns the trial court\u2019s decisions at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">A. <em>First and Second Assignments of Error: STAR Center Interviews</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Defendant\u2019s arguments on appeal differ in part from the arguments that he raised to the trial court. He now argues that it was error for the court to admit the videos because (1) the recorded interviews were outside the scope of defendant\u2019s cross-examination; (2) the STAR Center staffs comments constituted an impermissible comment on witness credibility; and (3) the admission of the videos violated defendant\u2019s rights to confront his accuser. In addition, defendant argues that the videos should have been redacted before being shown to the jury because some portions of them were irrelevant and other portions contained allegations that defendant committed other uncharged crimes and bad acts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>As an initial matter, we address the state\u2019s assertion that several of those arguments are not preserved. In order to preserve a claim of error, <em>\u201ca </em>party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d <em>State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000); ORAP 5.45(4). A pretrial evidentiary ruling typically preserves associated claims of error even if the issue is not relitigated during the trial itself. <em>State v. Cole, </em>323 Or 30, 35, 912 P2d 907 (1996) (\u201cOnce an evidentiary ruling is made pretrial, the lack of later relitigation of the same issue, even where a statute permits relitigation on a discretionary basis, does not render any claim of error associated with the ruling unpreserved.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">First, we agree with the state that defendant did not preserve his argument regarding the right to confrontation. The record reflects that, apart from a fleeting and isolated reference to \u201cdefendant\u2019s rights to confrontation and due process under Amendments VI and XIV of the United States Constitution and Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution\u201d in defendant\u2019s motion to exclude the STAR Center videos, defendant never actually made an argument as to how the introduction of the videos denied him the right to confront his accusers. We will not address an argument that the trial court did have an opportunity to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">The state also argues that defendant failed to preserve his argument that statements in the videos were an \u201cimproper comment on the credibility of the victims.\u201d The state correctly points out that defendant did not raise this argument during the trial itself. Nevertheless, we conclude that defendant sufficiently preserved the issue for appeal. During the hearing on defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to exclude the video recordings, defendant argued that the portions of K\u2019s video in which STAR Center staff \u201cdescribe!] all of the rules\u201d were not admissible. Defendant specifically cited the phrase \u201c[w]e always tell the truth in here\u201d and argued that that staff person was \u201cbasically telling the jury \u2018You\u2019re going to tell the truth in here.\u2019\u201d Defendant then argued that that comment \u201cviolated <em>[State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 218 P3d 104 (2009),] and every vouching case that\u2019s ever existed.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>The trial court rejected defendant\u2019s arguments, explaining, \u201cI don\u2019t view the description of the rules as being vouching. [The staff person] didn\u2019t say anything about whether she believed [K] or not, she simply said, \u2018These are the rules. We want you [to] tell the truth, we want you to follow these rules.\u2019\u201d The lack of later relitigation did not render defendant\u2019s argument unpreserved. <em>Cole, </em>323 Or at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">We now turn to defendant\u2019s arguments that are properly before us on appeal, beginning with the assertion that the trial court should not have admitted the STAR Center videotapes during the state\u2019s cross-examination of Rodriguez because they contained material that was beyond the scope of the direct examination. Under OEC 611(2), \u201c[c]ross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness.\u201d Questions on cross-examination \u201cshould not be limited to the exact facts stated on direct examination, but [may] extend [] to other matters which tend to limit, explain, or qualify them, or to rebut or modify any inference resulting therefrom, provided they are directly connected with the matter stated in the direct examination.\u201d <em>Ritchie v. Pittman, </em>144 Or 228, 231, 24 P2d 328 (1933). A trial court\u2019s ruling as to whether a line of questioning during cross-examination exceeds the scope of the direct examination is reviewed for errors of law. <em>State v. Wirfs, </em>250 Or App 269, 274, 281 P3d 616, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 377 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument that the videotapes contained material that went beyond the scope of direct examination. Defendant pursued a theory at trial that the girls\u2019 mother had persuaded them to falsely accuse defendant in retaliation for defendant\u2019s extramarital affair some years earlier and that police failed to uncover that because they were negligent in investigating the girls\u2019 allegations. Consistently with that theory, defense counsel\u2019s direct examination of Rodriguez placed the adequacy of the investigation \u2014 and, specifically, the sufficiency of the STAR Center interviews \u2014 squarely at issue. The trial court correctly allowed the prosecution to respond by introducing the videotaped interviews so that the jury could assess the validity of defendant\u2019s contention that the interviews were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>With respect to defendant\u2019s second argument, it is well settled that a witness may not testify that, in his or her opinion, another witness is telling the truth. <em>State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 438, 657 P2d 1215 (1983); <em>see also State v. Milbrant, </em>305 Or 621, 629, 756 P2d 620 (1988) (\u201cThe assessment of credibility is for the trier of fact * * *.\u201d). Nor may a witness offer testimony that, when viewed in the context of the trial proceedings, is \u201ctantamount to stating that another witness is truthful.\u201d <em>State v. Viranond, </em>346 Or 451, 458, 212 P3d 1252 (2009) (quotation marks omitted). Here, defendant argues that the portion of the STAR Center video in which a staff member tells K during the interview that \u201cwe always tell the truth\u201d was a comment on K\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">We disagree. At most, that comment expressed the interviewer\u2019s expectation that K answer her questions honestly; it did not imply that the interviewer actually believed that K had been honest during her interview. Indeed, the \u201cwe always tell the truth\u201d comment was made before the interview with K had even begun in earnest. Thus, the jury would have understood that the staff member was not yet in the position to form, let alone express, an opinion about K\u2019s honesty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Defendant\u2019s final argument is that certain portions of the videos should have been redacted. We conclude that, even if it was error to admit the STAR Center videotapes without redacting irrelevant material or references to defendant\u2019s other bad acts, it was harmless error. An error is harmless if there is little likelihood that it affected the verdict. <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). Here, defendant first argues that the videos \u201ccontained irrelevant personal background information about [the victims\u2019] likes and dislikes.\u201d As we understand it, that argument refers to portions of the videos in which the STAR Center staff began the interviews by briefly asking S and K about school, pets, and hobbies. At trial, defendant argued that that information was prejudicial because it would endear S and K to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>jury. We conclude that there was little likelihood that the jury\u2019s verdict was affected by S and K\u2019s brief answers to the types of basic personal background questions that were asked in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Defendant also argues that OEC 404(3) required that any references to \u201cother crimes, acts, or wrongs\u201d be redacted from the video. For the most part, the videotapes mirror the in-court testimony of S and K. It is true, however, that S briefly mentioned other bad acts committed by defendant; S said that defendant had blown crystal methamphetamine smoke into her mouth, and she briefly described an incident of sexual abuse that does not appear to have been charged. But S testified in person and without objection that defendant had touched her \u201cin a sexual way\u201d \u201c [h] undreds of times\u201d and \u201c[p]retty much on a daily basis.\u201d Given that testimony, the passing references in the video to uncharged conduct were unlikely to have a significant impact on the jury. Finally, and most critically, the jury was specifically instructed not to accept the statements made on the video as substantive evidence. We presume that the jury followed those instructions. <em>State v. Thompson, </em>328 Or 248, 271, 971 P2d 879, <em>cert den, </em>527 US 1042 (1999); <em>see also State v. Hennagir, </em>246 Or App 456, 266 P3d 128 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 33 (2012) (holding that a similar cautionary instruction rendered harmless any error in the court\u2019s failure to redact portions of a video).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">B. <em>Third Assignment of Error: Denial of Motion for a Mistrial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Defendant moved for a mistrial, arguing (as relevant on appeal) that the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal statement and Rodriguez\u2019s testimony were improper comments on the credibility of S and K. Defendant also requested that the court instruct the jury not to consider any assessment by Rodriguez of the girls\u2019 demeanor during the interviews. The trial court denied the motion for a mistrial and refused to give defendant\u2019s requested instruction. Defendant challenges both rulings in his third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">We review a trial court\u2019s ruling denying a motion for mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Arreola, </em>250 Or App 496, 500, 281 P3d 634, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 103 (2012). Denial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>a mistrial motion will be deemed error only \u201cwhen a defendant\u2019s ability to obtain a fair trial has been impaired.\u201d <em>State v. Vann, </em>158 Or App 65, 72, 973 P2d 354 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">There is no indication in the record that Rodriguez explicitly vouched for the credibility of either witness. The issue, therefore, is whether, in context, Rodriguez\u2019s statements were tantamount to testimony that those witnesses were credible. The context for Rodriguez\u2019s remarks includes the facts that the STAR Center videos were introduced in order to demonstrate that Rodriguez conducted \u201can appropriate investigation\u201d and that the prosecutor referenced the \u201cdemeanor\u201d of S and K while discussing the videos during his rebuttal argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Defendant argues that Rodriguez\u2019s testimony suggested that \u201che found the interviews so satisfactory that he concluded he could arrest defendant straight away, with no further investigation.\u201d Defendant then argues that, in light of the purpose for which the videotapes were admitted, the jury would necessarily be invited to conclude that Rodriguez believed that S and K were telling the truth. We disagree, however, with defendant\u2019s characterization of Rodriguez\u2019s remarks. Most of Rodriguez\u2019s testimony consisted of various explanations about why further interviews would not be productive. Although it is true that, at one point, Rodriguez testified that he was \u201csatisfied with the [STAR Center] interviews that took place,\u201d that answer cannot be understood as a comment on the credibility of either S or K. Rather, that response came in answer to defendant\u2019s questions about the STAR Center staffs training. In other words, Rodriguez avoided directly commenting on the credibility of either victim.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The state\u2019s reminder to the jury that it \u201chad the opportunity to look at the demeanor that Detective Rodriguez relied on in submitting this case\u201d presents a closer question. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>We conclude, however, that the trial court was not required to grant a mistrial. First, the state\u2019s rebuttal argument came in response to defendant\u2019s argument that the police investigation was inadequate. The trial court properly gave the state latitude to respond by arguing that the STAR Center interviews were sufficient. <em>State v. Guritz, </em>134 Or App 262, 270, 894 P2d 1235, <em>rev den, </em>321 Or 560 (1995) (stating that \u201c[t]he prosecutor has the right * * * to reply to argument made by opposing counsel, and, in doing so, statements may be made which otherwise would be improper\u201d). Furthermore, although the trial court did not give a curative instruction after the prosecutor made those remarks, the court had already instructed the jury not to view the videos \u201cfrom the standpoint of whether or not what is being said is true or not\u201d but rather \u201cwhether or not the time and length of the interview was adequate.\u201d Under those circumstances, defendant\u2019s ability to receive a fair trial was not impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">C. <em>Fourth Assignment of Error: Hansen\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In his fourth assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in (1) allowing testimony from Hansen that exceeded the scope of direct examination, and (2) having concluded that Hansen was not a qualified \u201cexpert witness,\u201d nonetheless allowing Hansen to testify \u201cas if she were an expert.\u201d We review the trial court\u2019s eviden-tiary rulings for errors of law. <em>State v. Sanchez-Alfonso, </em>352 Or 790, 797, 293 P3d 1011 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">First, we conclude that Hansen\u2019s testimony on cross-examination was not beyond the scope of direct examination just because the prosecution asked questions about sexual abuse. We agree with the state that the purpose and relevance of defendant\u2019s direct examination of Hansen was to support an inference that, because things appeared to be \u201cfine\u201d during her visit, it was less likely that defendant was abusing S or K at or around that time. Because the inference that defendant was asking the jury to draw was directly connected to Hansen\u2019s testimony about her observations, the prosecution was entitled to refute that inference on cross-examination, \u201ceven to the extent of inquiring into a different set of facts than those that were elicited on direct.\u201d <em>State v. Stevens, </em>328 Or 116, 133, 970 P2d 215 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>With respect to defendant\u2019s second argument, defendant incorrectly characterizes the trial court\u2019s ruling as being that \u201cHansen was not qualified to testify as an expert witness.\u201d The record indicates that Hansen had relevant training and experience in the field of child-abuse investigations and that the court properly allowed her to testify as an expert on those issues. Because Hansen did not have specialized training in the field of child psychology, the court ruled that she was not qualified to offer <em>scientific </em>evidence about the behavior of child sexual abuse victims. Although the line between those two types of expert testimony \u201cmay be fine, it is not artificial.\u201d <em>State v. Rambo, </em>250 Or App 186, 195, 279 P3d 361 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 203 (2013). The distinction is that \u201c[specialized expert opinion evidence based on a witness\u2019s training and experience draws its force from that training and experience, but not necessarily from the mantle of science.\u201d <em>Id. </em>By contrast, scientific evidence is that which \u201cdraws its convincing force from some principle of science, mathematics and the like.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 407, 687 P2d 751 (1984). Whether testimony is scientific \u201cdepends primarily on \u2018whether the trier of fact will perceive the evidence as such.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Whitmore, </em>257 Or App 664, 670, 307 P3d 552 (2013) (quoting <em>State v. Marrington, </em>335 Or 555, 561, 73 P3d 911 (2003)). \u201c[T]he key question in determining whether proffered testimony is \u2018scientific,\u2019 and thus requires a special foundation, is \u2018whether the expert\u2019s assertions possess significantly increased potential to influence the trier of fact as scientific assertions.\u2019\u201d <em>Rambo, </em>250 Or App at 193 (quoting <em>Marrington, </em>335 Or at 561-63).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">We agree with the state and the trial court that Hansen\u2019s testimony on cross-examination was not impermissible <em>scientific </em>evidence. The issue here is similar to what we confronted in <em>State v. Clemens, </em>208 Or App 632, 145 P3d 294 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 299 (2007). <em>Clemens </em>involved the testimony of the investigating officer, Robles, who \u201chad relevant training and experience in the area of child sexual abuse investigations, but not * * * any relevant or specialized education or knowledge in the field of psychology and child behavior.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638-39. During trial, Robles testified that \u201cthe victim\u2019s statement was generally consistent with the nonchronological reporting patterns of child abuse victims.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 635. We concluded that Robles\u2019s statement was not scientific evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\">\u201cThe disputed portion of his testimony * * * did not \u2018involve the vocabulary of scientific research.\u2019 Nothing in Robles\u2019s testimony suggested to the court that his opinions were \u2018grounded on conclusions that have been reached through application of a scientific method to collected data.\u2019 Further, by its comments the court made clear that it was aware of the difference between testimony based on personal experience, such as that provided by Robles, and testimony that is scientific in nature. Based on the record as a whole, then, we conclude that Robles\u2019s disputed statement retained no \u2018increased potential\u2019 to influence the trier of fact as a scientific assertion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 639 (quoting <em>Marrington, </em>335 Or at 563).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The same reasoning applies here. The trial record reflects that the prosecutor\u2019s questions and Hansen\u2019s answers were explicitly framed in terms of her own career, training, and experience. Hansen did not refer to studies, research, scholarly literature, or anything else that would cause a jury to infer that her testimony was based on more than her personal experience, as in the cases that defendant cites on appeal. <em>See, e.g., State v. Perry, </em>347 Or 110, 218 P3d 95 (2009). Hansen\u2019s testimony thus did not draw its convincing force from some principle of science. <em>See also Rambo, </em>250 Or App at 195 (holding that trial court did not err in admitting testimony that drew its force from training and experience rather than \u201cthe mantle of science\u201d). The trial court did not err by admitting her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">D. <em>Fifth Assignment of Error: Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">At sentencing, the trial court determined that all of defendant\u2019s felony convictions, except for the merged Counts 2 and 6, and Counts 4 and 8, were separate criminal episodes. Three consequences flowed from that determination. First, the court could impose consecutive sentences. <em>See </em>ORS 137.123 (allowing a court to impose consecutive sentences when a defendant is \u201csimultaneously sentenced for criminal offenses that do not arise from the same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct\u201d). Second, each time the trial court passed sentence on a count representing a separate criminal episode, the court considered that count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>to be part of defendant\u2019s criminal history for the purpose of the remaining counts. <em>See State v. Bucholz, </em>317 Or 309, 314, 855 P2d 1100 (1993) (\u201cNothing in the wording of the criminal history rule excludes consideration of the conviction for a separately occurring crime merely because the two separate crimes are sentenced on the same day and in the same session of court.\u201d). Third, the so-called \u201cshift-to-I\u201d rule did not apply.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Orchard v. Mills, </em>247 Or App 355, 358, 270 P3d 309 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 33 (2012) (\u201c[T]he \u2018shift-to-I\u2019 rule applies only when consecutive sentences are imposed for crimes that arise from a single criminal episode.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">Crimes arise from different criminal episodes when they are not part of the same \u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted conduct that *** is so joined in time, place and circumstances that such conduct is directed to the accomplishment of a single criminal objective.\u201d ORS 131.505(4). On appeal, defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s decision to impose consecutive sentences. He concedes, in other words, that the court was permitted to make the factual determination that his crimes were separate criminal episodes and then to impose consecutive sentences based on that fact. Defendant argues, however, that that same factual finding cannot be used as a basis to increase his criminal history score and to avoid the shift-to-I rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Defendant\u2019s argument is based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), and <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004). Those cases stand for the proposition that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>requires that, \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 US at 490. That rule is easily applied when, for example, a conviction entered years earlier, during a different proceeding, operates to increase the penalty for a subsequent conviction. Under such circumstances, the \u201cprior conviction\u201d exception would apply and the trial court would be permitted to determine the defendant\u2019s criminal history. <em>Apprendi, </em>however, did not address whether, in the course of determining that a prior conviction exists, a trial court is also permitted to determine certain predicate facts, such as whether multiple convictions arose out of separate criminal episodes.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">That is precisely the issue we addressed in <em>State v. Mallory, </em>213 Or App 392, 162 P3d 297 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 109 (2008). In that case, we cited with approval <em>US. v. Harris, </em>447 F3d 1300, 1304 (10th Cir 2006), in which the Tenth Circuit observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">\u201c[t]he time, place, and substance of the prior convictions can ordinarily be ascertained from court records associated with those convictions, and the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution allows sentencing courts to rely on such records to make findings about prior convictions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">We noted, however, that a \u201cseparate criminal episode\u201d determination <em>cannot </em>always be made simply by referring to the court\u2019s records. That is so because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">\u201ca factfinder in a criminal case does not necessarily have the opportunity or responsibility to determine the scope of the criminal episode or episodes involved in the case. Stated differently, a factfinder in a criminal case often makes no finding of fact that conclusively determines the temporal, locational, and circumstantial scope of the episode at issue, because the determination of those matters is not necessary to adjudicate the defendant\u2019s guilt of a particular offense. Thus, for example, a factfinder\u2019s verdict that a defendant committed theft of property belonging to a particular victim on a particular date does not necessarily conclusively determine whether a separate conviction for a different theft from the same victim on the same date arose from the same criminal episode. To make that determination, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>necessary to consider the relationship of the crimes in time, place, and circumstance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><em>Mallory, </em>213 Or App at 402. Thus, in <em>Mallory, </em>we concluded that \u201c[t]he conclusion of\u2018separateness\u2019 *** does not implicate the requirements of <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely, </em>unless it requires <em>factfinding beyond a determination of what is in the court </em>records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">After our decision in <em>Mallory, </em>the United States Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Oregon v. Ice, </em>555 US 160, 129 S Ct 711, 172 L Ed 2d 517 (2009), which held that <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply to \u201c[t]he decision to impose sentences consecutively.\u201d 555 US at 168. In that case, the Supreme Court construed <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>as applying to any finding of fact that \u201cincreases the maximum punishment authorized <em>for a particular </em>offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163 (emphasis added). The Court declined to extend the rule to the finding of \u201cany fact declared necessary to the imposition of consecutive, in lieu of concurrent, sentences.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">As noted above, defendant does not argue that <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely </em>precluded the trial court from imposing consecutive sentences on the basis of the court\u2019s finding of separate criminal episodes. Such an argument would have been foreclosed by <em>Ice. </em>Defendant argues, rather, that the finding of separate criminal episodes by the trial court could not be used to enhance the penalties for particular crimes through the court\u2019s calculation of defendant\u2019s criminal history score and the avoidance of the shift-to-I rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">We agree with defendant in part. As mentioned above, the jury convicted defendant of 10 counts; the trial court determined that the 10 counts comprised a total of eight separate criminal episodes. The jury was not asked to determine the precise dates of those episodes. The jury was, however, instructed that, in order to find defendant guilty for a particular count, it had to find that the crime occurred while the family was living at a particular address. Therefore, the jury found that three crimes (Count 1, Count 3, and Count 7) occurred when the family was living in a home on 2nd Avenue in Ontario; that three crimes (Count 5, Count 9, and Count 10) occurred when the family was living in a home on 1st Avenue in Ontario; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the remaining crimes occurred after the family moved to Nyssa (including Count 2 and Count 4).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In other words, the \u201ccourt records\u201d reflect that defendant\u2019s crimes were committed during three distinct periods of time, at three different locations. Under <em>Mallory, </em>the trial court was permitted to rely on those records to find that crimes occurring during different time periods and at different locations were part of separate criminal episodes.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">We reach a different conclusion, however, for the crimes that occurred within the same time period and at the same location. As to those crimes, the only way that the trial court could have concluded that they arose from separate criminal episodes was to conduct additional \u201cfactfinding beyond a determination of what is in the court records.\u201d <em>Mallory </em>teaches that that was error under <em>Apprendi </em>and <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We also conclude, however, that that error was harmless. A federal constitutional error does not require reversal \u201cif the reviewing court may confidently say, on the whole record, that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Cook, </em>340 Or 530, 544, 135 P3d 260 (2006). Applying that standard, we have found a similar sentencing error to be harmless where \u201cthe testimony of the victim * * * clearly established that each of the offenses was a separate incident; that is, they each occurred at different times and at different locations over a period of years.\u201d <em>State v. Bowen, </em>220 Or App 380, 383, 185 P3d 1129, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 415 (2008) (quotation marks omitted). The same is true here.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">There was no testimony that defendant abused S and K together at or near the same time. Thus, one could reasonably conclude that all of defendant\u2019s crimes against S were separate episodes from his crimes against K. That leaves only two pairs of crimes that occurred at the same location involving the same victim: Counts 3 and 7 (involving S, at the 2nd Avenue house) and Counts 9 and 10 (involving S, at the 1st Avenue house).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The uncontradicted testimony at trial establishes that Counts 3 and 7, and Counts 9 and 10, were all separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>criminal episodes. S testified that, with respect to the charges in Count 7, defendant abused her when she was \u201c[a] kindergartner.\u201d With respect to Count 3, she described an act of first-degree sodomy that occurred when she was in first grade. S testified that the conduct in Count 9 \u2014 sexual abuse that occurred while S was playing on a bunk bed ladder in her sister\u2019s room \u2014 happened \u201cright when we moved\u201d to the house on 1st Avenue when she was nine years old. By contrast, in describing the conduct constituting Count 10, S testified that defendant raped her in her \u201cmom\u2019s room\u201d after he sent her sisters outside to play. That incident occurred when she was nine or 10. None of that testimony was contradicted at trial. Accordingly, we can \u201cconfidently say * * * beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d that the conduct at issue was not \u201cjoined in time, place and circumstances\u201d and was directed towards the accomplishment of different criminal objectives. Consequently, any sentencing error based on the court\u2019s findings of separate criminal episodes was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In summary, we conclude that the trial court did not err in admitting the STAR Center videotapes. The videotapes did not contain material that was beyond the scope of defendant\u2019s direct examination or that constituted a comment on witness credibility. Furthermore, any failure to redact portions of the videos was harmless. We conclude that neither the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal statement nor Detective Rodriguez\u2019s testimony contained improper comments on the credibility of a witness. We conclude that Hansen\u2019s testimony was not beyond the scope of defendant\u2019s direct examination and that she did not offer scientific evidence during the state\u2019s cross-examination. Her testimony was based on her training and experience. Finally, we conclude that the trial court did err when it calculated defendant\u2019s criminal history score and declined to apply the shift-to-I rule based on the court\u2019s own finding of separate criminal episodes. That error, however, was harmless because the uncontro-verted testimony at trial established that the criminal episodes were separate.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-7\"> As we explained in <em>State v.
