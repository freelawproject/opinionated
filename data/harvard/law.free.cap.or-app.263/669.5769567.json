A person commits sexual abuse in the first degree when that person \u201c[s]ubjects another person to sexual contact and * * * [t]he victim is incapable of consent by reason of being *** physically helpless [.]\u201d ORS 163.427(1)(a)(C). A person is \u201cphysically helpless\u201d if that person \u201cis unconscious or for any other reason is physically unable to communicate unwillingness to an act.\u201d ORS 163.305(5). The issue in this case is whether a victim who is asleep when the sexual abuse occurs is incapable of consent by reason of being \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d We answer that question in the affirmative and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s order denying a motion for judgment of acquittal, we \u201cview the evidence in the light most favorable to the state to determine whether a rational factfinder could have found the elements of the crimes in question beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Reed, </em>339 Or 239, 243, 118 P3d 791 (2005). In this case, the relevant facts are undisputed. Defendant and the victim were roommates who, while living together, had a romantic relationship for approximately one month. Soon after the relationship ended, the victim awoke during the night and felt defendant\u2019s \u201chand in [her] pants in [her] vagina playing with it.\u201d She told defendant to \u201cget out,\u201d and he left the room. Defendant was charged with first-degree sexual abuse and attempted unlawful sexual penetration in the first degree, ORS 163.411.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">At trial, after the state presented its case-in-chief, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, asserting that the victim was not physically helpless for purposes of ORS 163.427(1)(a)(C) because, although she was asleep, she was not \u201cunconscious\u201d or otherwise \u201cphysically unable to communicate willingness [sic] to an act.\u201d The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that the state had presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>sufficient evidence that \u201cthe victim was asleep at the time that the crime was committed and that that would constitute being physically unable to communicate willingness [.]\u201d A jury found defendant guilty of sexual abuse in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">The question on appeal is whether a sleeping victim is \u201cphysically helpless\u201d for purposes of ORS 163.427(1)(a)(C). As noted, ORS 163.305(5) defines \u201cphysically helpless\u201d as \u201cunconscious or for any other reason * * * physically unable to communicate unwillingness to an act.\u201d Thus, we consider whether sleep renders a person either \u201cunconscious\u201d or \u201cfor any other reason *** physically unable to communicate unwillingness to an act.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When construing a statute, our goal is to discern the legislature\u2019s intent by examining the text and context of the statute, and the legislative history, if useful. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">We begin with the text and context of ORS 163.305(5), which was enacted in 1971. Or Laws 1971, ch 743, \u00a7 104.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Generally, words of common usage should be given their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). When \u201cinterpreting the words of a statute enacted many years ago, we may seek guidance from dictionaries that were in use at the time.\u201d <em>State v. Perry, </em>336 Or 49, 53, 77 P3d 313 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>As relevant to this case, the term \u201cunconscious\u201d can be defined as \u201cnot marked by conscious thought, sensation, or feeling\u201d or \u201chaving no consciousness for the time being.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2486 (unabridged ed 1971); <em>see State v. Oliver, </em>221 Or App 233, 237-38, 189 P3d 1240, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 318 (2008) (relevant dictionary definition is the one that \u201cseems most relevant to the use of the word in the statute\u201d). In turn, the term \u201cconscious\u201d can be defined as \u201cmentally active : fully possessed of one\u2019s mental faculties : <em>having emerged from sleep, </em>faint, or stupor : AWAKE.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 482 (emphasis added). The term \u201cconsciousness\u201d can be defined as \u201cthe state or activity that is characterized by sensation, emotion, volition, or thought : mind in the broadest possible sense,\u201d or \u201cwaking life <em>(as that to which one returns after sleep, </em>trance, fever) wherein all one\u2019s mental powers have returned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">According to defendant, a person who is unconscious is \u201cnot aware\u201d and is instead in a state defined by a lack of \u201cconscious thought, sensation, or feeling.\u201d He asserts that an unconscious person \u201cmight not be able to wake up during an act to communicate unwillingness to another person\u201d\u2014 in contrast to a sleeping person who is \u201cmerely inactive or dormant, and not necessarily in a state from which she is unable to awake and indicate unwillingness to engage in particular behavior.\u201d Defendant then concludes that \u201csomeone who is asleep is not in the same state as someone who is lacking conscious thought and feeling.\u201d Thus, defendant seems to distinguish the states of unconsciousness and sleep based on whether a person is able to wake up.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">We are not persuaded by the distinction that defendant proposes. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertions, the plain meaning of the word \u201cunconscious\u201d does not refer to whether a person is able to wake up; the definition refers to a lack of \u201cconscious thought, sensation, or feeling,\u201d and having \u201cno consciousness for the time being.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 2486. Regardless of whether a sleeping person has the <em>ability </em>to wake up, that person does not have \u201cconscious\u201d thought, sensation, or feeling until he or she in fact wakes up \u2014 that is, a sleeping person is not \u201cmentally active\u201d or \u201cfully possessed of one\u2019s mental faculties\u201d until he or she has \u201cemerged from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>sleep.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482. Likewise, a sleeping person has no \u201cconsciousness\u201d \u2014 that is, the person is not in a state \u201ccharacterized by sensation, emotion, volition, or thought\u201d \u2014 until he or she returns to \u201cwaking life * * * wherein all one\u2019s mental powers have returned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, based on the plain text of the statute, a person who is asleep is \u201cunconscious\u201d under ORS 163.305(5) and, therefore, \u201cphysically helpless\u201d for purposes of ORS 163.427(1)(a)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">That understanding of the term \u201cphysically helpless\u201d is consistent with relevant legislative history. ORS 163.305 was enacted as part of the 1971 revision of the Oregon Criminal Code. Or Laws 1971, ch 743, \u00a7 104. During the process of revising the Oregon Criminal Code, the Oregon Criminal Law Revision Commission kept careful records of the related proceedings. <em>See State v. Garcia, </em>288 Or 413, 416, 605 P2d 671 (1980) (noting that carefully kept records of the proceedings \u201cprovide a rich source for determination of the drafters\u2019 intent\u201d). Commentary regarding the section that is now codified as ORS 163.305 notes that the term</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">\u201c\u2018[plhysically helpless\u2019 is defined *** to include a person who is unconscious or for any other reason is physically unable to communicate unwillingness to an act. Examples of persons covered by the definition would be one who is in a state of sleep as a result of drugs or one who is a total paralytic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 104, 105 (July 1970). Defendant argues that by giving the example of \u201cone who is in a state of sleep as a result of drugs,\u201d the legislature did not intend to include \u201cnatural\u201d sleep \u2014 that is, sleep that is not drug-induced \u2014 in the definition of \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d However, \u201cone who is in a state of sleep as a result of drugs\u201d and \u201cone who is a total paralytic\u201d were given as <em>examples, </em>not as an exhaustive list, of persons that would qualify under the definition of \u201cphysically helpless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Moreover, section 105 of the Oregon Proposed Criminal Code lists victim characteristics, including being \u201cphysically helpless,\u201d that render a person incapable of consenting to a sexual act. Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>\u00a7 105,105 (July 1970). The commentary to section 105 explains that the characteristic of being \u201cphysically helpless\u201d has long been recognized as affecting one\u2019s capacity to consent. Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 105, 106-07 (July 1970). Regarding a person who is \u201cphysically helpless,\u201d the commentary states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\">\u201cThe rape of a woman who is mentally incapacitated or physically helpless was also recognized at common law. 75 <em>CJS, </em>Rape, \u00a7 7, at 468 states: \u2018It [rape] may be committed on a woman who is insane or idiotic, drugged, intoxicated or asleep.\u2019 Under the draft being drugged or intoxicated \u2018without his consent\u2019 renders a person \u2018mentally incapacitated,\u2019 whereas, <em>being asleep renders one \u2018physically helpless.\u2019\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Thus, the legislative history supports our conclusion that a person who is asleep is \u201cphysically helpless,\u201d as defined by ORS 163.305(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">A rational factfinder could have found that the victim in this case was asleep when defendant\u2019s conduct occurred, and therefore \u201cphysically helpless\u201d for purposes of ORS 163.427(1)(a)(C). Thus, the trial court did not err when it denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\"> Defendant was acquitted of attempted unlawful sexual penetration in the first degree; that charge is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b691-6\"> We observe that a note follows the text of ORS 163.427 indicating that the statute \u201cwas enacted into law by the Legislative Assembly but was not added to or made a part of ORS chapter \u00cd63 or any series therein!.]\u201d The meaning of this note is that the provisions in ORS chapter 163 or any series therein do not apply to ORS 163.427. However, ORS 161.035(2) provides that, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided, or unless the context requires otherwise, the provisions of chapter 743, Oregon Laws 1971, shall govern the construction of and punishment for any offense defined outside chapter 743, Oregon Laws 1971, and committed after January 1, 1972 [.]\u201d The definitions set forth in ORS 163.305 are part of Oregon Laws 1971, chapter 743. We find no express provision stating that the definitions in ORS 163.305 do not apply to ORS 163.427, or that the context of ORS 163.427 requires the application of definitions other than those set forth in ORS 163.305. Accordingly, we apply the definitions in ORS 163.305 to the provisions of ORS 163.427.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b691-7\"> When first enacted in 1971, the definition of \u201cphysically helpless\u201d was codified at ORS 163.305(6); in 1977, the definition was renumbered as ORS 163.305(5), but remained otherwise unchanged.
