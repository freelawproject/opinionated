The issues on appeal concern the permanency plan for mother\u2019s two daughters and the juvenile court\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction based on a new allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In September 2011, the juvenile court took jurisdiction over the two girls, A and C, now ages eight and three, pursuant to ORS dlOB.lOOOXc),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> based on admitted allegations that (1) \u201c[mother\u2019s] behavior is impulsive or she cannot or will not control her behavior thereby making the * * * children unsafe\u201d; and (2) mother\u2019s behavior \u201cexemplifies] her lack of parenting knowledge, skills, and motivation necessary to ensure her children\u2019s safety thereby making the * * * children unsafe.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For two years, the permanency plan for the children was reunification. However, after a hearing in September 2013, the juvenile court changed the permanency plan from reunification to adoption. On appeal mother asserts that the record does not support the juvenile court\u2019s change in the permanency plan, specifically, its determination that mother has not made sufficient progress to allow the children to safely return home. ORS 419B.476(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Before the permanency hearing, in July 2013, the Department of Human Services (DHS) filed a second dependency petition, alleging that the children are within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court under ORS 419B.100(l)(c), because \u201cmother * * * suffers from a mental illness, emotional illness, or mental impairment that interfere [s] with her ability to safely parent\u201d the children.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the hearing, the juvenile court considered evidence addressing the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>allegation and, in addition to changing the permanency plan to adoption, the court made findings and entered judgments assuming jurisdiction over the children based on the new allegation. Mother separately appeals from that jurisdictional judgment, contending that DHS did not prove the new allegation. She also asserts that, to the extent that the juvenile court based its \u201creasonable efforts\u201d and \u201csufficient progress\u201d determinations on the new allegation, the court erred. We affirm on both matters, which have been consolidated for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Mother has not requested that we exercise our discretion to take <em>de novo </em>review, ORS 19.415(3)(b), and we decline to do so. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(c) (we exercise <em>de novo </em>review \u201conly in exceptional cases\u201d). Accordingly, in reviewing the juvenile court\u2019s judgments, we \u201cview the evidence as supplemented and buttressed by permissible derivative inferences, in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s disposition and assess whether, when so viewed, the record was legally sufficient to permit that outcome.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. N. </em>P., 257 Or App 633, 639, 307 P3d 444 (2013). We are bound by the juvenile court\u2019s findings of historical fact as long as there is \u201cany evidence\u201d to support them. <em>State v. S. T. S., </em>236 Or App 646, 655, 238 P3d 53 (2010). We review the juvenile court\u2019s conclusions for legal error. <em>Id. </em>When the juvenile court does not make findings on disputed issues of fact, but the evidence supports more than one factual conclusion, we presume that the court decided those issues in a manner consistent with its ultimate conclusion. <em>Id. </em>We state the facts consistently with those standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Before moving to Oregon in 2011, the family lived in Montana. Beginning in 2009 and continuing through January 2011, mother had contact on multiple occasions with the Child and Family Services Division of the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services. Mother and father are married, but they were separated for a while in Montana and, during that time, mother had a brief relationship with Hagel, with whom she had a child in 2009 that she gave up for adoption. The Montana agency investigated allegations of abuse of mother by both Hagel and father, and allegations of sexual abuse of A by Hagel and a family friend. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>In Montana, As physician referred her for a psychological assessment, and a report in the record shows diagnoses of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder, and sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">The family moved to Oregon in February 2011, and mother initiated contact with DHS in May 2011, reporting concerns about domestic violence and substance abuse by father. Mother also reported to DHS that father smoked marijuana in A\u2019s presence and was attempting to treat A\u2019s ADHD with marijuana smoke. Shortly thereafter, father moved away, and mother did not follow up with services offered by DHS. Because the caseworker believed that mother was able to keep the children safe, DHS did not intervene at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">On June 30, 2011, mother brought A to the DHS office in Newport, seeking a voluntary placement because she was unable to manage A\u2019s behavior (the triggering event having been A spilling cereal on the floor and telling mother to \u201cgo to hell\u201d). DHS took A into custody at that time under a voluntary placement agreement. At a home visit the next day, the caseworker developed concerns about the safety of the home, as well as mother\u2019s mental health and her care of the children. The caseworker observed that C, then age nine months, seemed to be at the developmental level of a four-month-old child, was dirty and quiet, \u201crigid and withdrawn,\u201d and shook when attempting to crawl. DHS took both A and C into protective custody on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">As noted, the juvenile court first assumed jurisdiction over the children in September 2011, pursuant to admitted allegations that (1) \u201c[mother\u2019s] behavior is impulsive or she cannot or will not control her behavior thereby making the * * * children unsafe\u201d; and (2) mother\u2019s behavior \u201cexemplifies] her lack of parenting knowledge, skills, and motivation necessary to ensure her children\u2019s safety thereby making the * * * children unsafe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">After the court assumed jurisdiction, mother was evaluated by Dr. Sweet, a psychologist. In a report of October 2011, Sweet noted that mother was defensive and evasive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>For that reason, he opined, it was difficult to provide a clear and accurate diagnosis of mother, but he believed that she had a depressive disorder and a personality disorder with dependent and passive-aggressive features.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">After Sweet\u2019s evaluation in October 2011, DHS referred mother to individual mental health therapy with Coos County Mental Health, which she began in January 2012. She also attended classes in parenting, anger management, and self-improvement, and had regular visits with the children. Gradually, mother made significant improvements in her interactions with the children during visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">The children were in foster care the first time from July 1, 2011, until August 29, 2012, when DHS returned the children to mother\u2019s care for a trial home visit. But the visit, which lasted about four months, did not go well. For about a year before the children\u2019s trial home visit began, mother had been in a relationship with Hales, and he was living in the family home. At some point during the trial home visit, Hales hit A, and mother left the house with the children until Hales had moved out. Mother testified that, during the trial home visit, there was a break in the children\u2019s counseling services due to scheduling difficulties, and that illness kept A from attending school for part of the time. Also during that time, mother discontinued her own individual-counseling sessions. In addition, mother returned the children for visits with the foster parents \u201cevery other week or every week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Mother testified that issues with her apartment caused her to move out in December 2012, and to move into a house belonging to the parents of an old friend, Smith, with whom she had recently reconnected. But DHS removed the children from mother\u2019s care a week or two thereafter, citing safety concerns and concerns for mother\u2019s mental state, and the children were returned to their foster placement. The court-appointed special advocate reported that both children were affected adversely by the failed reunification. Mother later told psychologist Sweet that she \u201cgot into a comfort zone\u201d during the trial visit, \u201cthought she could get away with things,\u201d and \u201cgot lazy.\u201d She also told Sweet that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>she had focused too much on some classes she was taking \u201cand was not focusing on the house or the girls.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-3\">After DHS removed the children from mother\u2019s care the second time, mother resumed individual mental health counseling sessions and completed an on-line course for parenting children with ADHD. Mother\u2019s counselor testified that mother was still somewhat guarded and defensive in March 2013 (as she apparently had been during her 2012 counseling sessions), but was \u201cmuch more motivated for treatment.\u201d It had taken the counselor \u201ca really long time to even get her to admit that she was struggling with depression.\u201d The counselor testified at trial that mother was \u201cnow in a place where she [was] actively working on her depression issues.\u201d Mother also completed an anger management class.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">Smith and mother became romantically involved in April 2013, and began to remodel the basement of Smith\u2019s parents\u2019 home into a three-bedroom apartment, where they were living rent free at the time of the hearing with Smith\u2019s children and several pets. At the hearing, Smith and mother testified that they plan to marry after they finalize their divorces. Smith is employed and plans to support the family financially while mother cares for the children at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Sweet, who conducted a second evaluation of mother in April 2013, testified at the permanency hearing. He noted that mother was more open and cooperative in the second evaluation, and was willing to acknowledge her problems, including her depression and her parenting challenges. After this second evaluation, Sweet diagnosed mother with a \u201cmajor depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate,\u201d and a personality disorder with passive-aggressive and dependent features. He noted that mother wanted to continue working on the skills necessary to manage her depression and A\u2019s behavior. He opined, \u201cIf she does continue to make progress and can demonstrate that she can apply the skills to her life situation, including meeting the girls\u2019 needs, then you might consider reunification.\u201d But, Sweet testified, although mother was in a better position now, she was still \u201cat a very early point\u201d in dealing with her depression and parenting, and it was Sweet\u2019s opinion that it would take a year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>of counseling to reach the point where the children could return home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sweet was asked about the impact on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>children of waiting one more year, and he responded, \u201cWell it\u2019s horrible on them.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">Sweet also evaluated A in April 2013 and issued a report in which he described A as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">\u201ca child who literally never sat still for more than a brief period of time under direct instruction from me. She walked around the room, rode a tricycle, got into the drawers and cupboards. There were times that she also purposefully turned her back to me and refused to answer questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Sweet diagnosed A with ADHD, major depression (moderate), and an adjustment disorder. Sweet testified, \u201cShe\u2019s a very high needs child and is going to be for a long time. * * * It takes very committed caregiver people to put forth a lot of effort on a day to day basis.\u201d He opined that A would benefit from a combination of medication and a highly structured home and school environment. Without such structure and permanence, he testified, A was \u201cat high risk for further developmental problems.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">In Sweet\u2019s view, both of the children were adversely affected in their development by the failed return to mother. Sweet testified that reunification could be possible if mother continued to make progress but he did not think that mother had made sufficient progress at the time of the hearing for the children to be returned to her care.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>In its ruling from the bench, the juvenile court first found that DHS had satisfied its burden to prove the new mental-health allegation by a preponderance of the evidence. ORS 419B.310(3) (\u201cThe facts alleged in the petition showing the child to be within the jurisdiction of the court * * * must be established by a preponderance of competent evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">The court then addressed the permanency plan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">\u201cAnd then in terms of the permanency involving Mother *** this is what the Court is looking at is \u2014 and I did go back to the original jurisdiction allegations and jurisdictional paragraphs, specifically 2(B), Mother\u2019s behavior is impulsive or she cannot or will not control her behavior, 2(D), attitudes and behaviors exemplify her lack of parenting knowledge, skills and motivation necessary to ensure the safety of her children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The court traced the case back to its origins, noting that DHS\u2019s involvement with the family began when mother brought then five-year-old A to a DHS office, seeking a voluntary out-of-home placement for A because mother could not manage the child\u2019s behavior. The court identified a pattern in mother of seeking out and engaging services but not following through with them, which the court described as consistent with the allegations of the first petition that mother \u201ccannot or will not control her behavior\u201d and that she \u201clacks the parenting knowledge or skills or motivation necessary to ensure her children\u2019s safety.\u201d The court found it significant that, over the course of the court\u2019s two-year involvement with the family, mother had had three romantic relationships. The court was particularly concerned that during that time, mother had not yet been able to follow through with her intention to find stable employment, that she still relied on the foster parents for respite, and that she had not yet learned to function independently: \u201c[T]he goal is, and we\u2019ve talked about this several times about you functioning as an independent person and you having it together so that you could care for your girls. And I still don\u2019t see that happening.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ultimately, the court found that mother had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>not made sufficient progress to allow the children to safely return home. Because of the length of time that the children had been in foster care, <em>see </em>ORS 419B.498(l)(a) (requiring the filing of a petition to terminate parental rights and proceed to adoption if the child has been in substitute care \u201cfor 15 months of the most recent 22 months\u201d), and the evidence concerning the adverse effect of further delay on the children, the court determined that it was necessary to change the permanency plan to adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">In her first two assignments of error, mother contends that the juvenile court erred in determining that she had not made sufficient progress. In her third and fourth assignments, mother contends that the juvenile court erred in changing the permanency plan to adoption. In a combined argument, mother asserts that the record does not support the juvenile court\u2019s determination that mother has not made sufficient progress \u201ctoward ameliorating the adjudicated bases for jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">When the permanency plan at the time of the hearing is reunification, in order to change the child\u2019s plan away from reunification, DHS bears the burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) it made reasonable efforts to reunite the family; and (2) despite those efforts, the parent\u2019s progress was insufficient to make it possible for the child to return safely home. ORS 419B.476(2)(a); <em>see Dept. of Human Services v. S. T., </em>240 Or App 193, 195, 248 P3d 427 (2010) (applying preponderance-of-evidence standard in case involving change in permanency plan). The particular issues established in the jurisdictional judgment provide the framework for the court\u2019s analysis of those two questions. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. N. T., </em>247 Or App 706, 715, 271 P3d 143 (2012). Thus, a parent\u2019s progress is evaluated by reference to the facts that formed the bases for juvenile court jurisdiction. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. C. L., </em>254 Or App 203, 214, 295 P3d 72 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>Mother first asserts that the alleged bases for jurisdiction (impulsiveness; inability to control behavior; lack of parenting knowledge, skills and motivation) were too vague to allow a determination whether mother\u2019s progress was sufficient. We agree with the state that now is not the time to challenge the original, admitted bases for jurisdiction, and we reject mother\u2019s challenge on that ground without further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Mother also contends that, in determining that mother had not made sufficient progress, the juvenile court mistakenly relied on facts extrinsic to the proven bases for jurisdiction \u2014 specifically the newly pleaded jurisdictional ground of mental illness. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. A. R. S., </em>256 Or App 653, 660-65, 303 P3d 963, <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 386 (2013) (the court may not rely on an unadjudicated personality disorder as a basis for continuing jurisdiction). The court\u2019s permanency judgment includes findings that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">\u201c4) Mother self-reported being diagnosed with depression when she was 17 years old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">\u201c5) Mother\u2019s current provider said Mother is making progress for the first time, but testified it could be six months to a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-7\">\u201c6) Dr. Sweet testified these children need permanency, Mother is overwhelmed by their needs, his testimony for Mother (assuming she is recognizing her own issues) to be able to parent these children independently is a year. He testified it is unreasonable to delay permanency for these girls, especially for [A].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Mother contends that the court\u2019s findings show that the court measured mother\u2019s progress in part against her diagnosed depression and dependent personality disorder, which had not previously been a basis for jurisdiction and could not form a basis for continuing jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">We reject mother\u2019s contention. In a closing statement, mother\u2019s attorney asserted that, if the juvenile court determined that mother\u2019s mental-health problems formed an additional basis for dependency jurisdiction, that could not \u201cbe used against her in this permanency hearing because that was not a prior allegation that [had] been proven against her.\u201d Instead, the lawyer argued, mother would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>to \u201cbe offered services that would ameliorate that condition.\u201d Neither DHS\u2019s attorney nor the children\u2019s attorney challenged mother\u2019s assertion that the permanency determination had to be based on the allegations in the original petition. Nor did the juvenile court express disagreement with that proposition. To the contrary, the court\u2019s oral ruling explicitly linked the permanency determination to the allegations of the original petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">True, the juvenile court also addressed mother\u2019s mental-health issues in its findings. And mother is correct that a juvenile court cannot base a change to a permanency plan \u201con a parental condition or characteristic that is not \u2018one that fairly can be implied from the facts found in the jurisdictional judgment.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. J. R. L., </em>256 Or App 437, 447, 300 P3d 291 (2013) (quoting <em>Dept. of Human Services v. N. M. S., </em>246 Or App 284, 300, 266 P3d 107 (2011)). The key question is whether the jurisdictional judgment \u201cwould put a reasonable parent on notice that [the bases for that judgment] would be used to continue jurisdiction over the child and to change the permanency plan for the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 448. In the particular circumstances that this case presents, we conclude that mother\u2019s mental-health problems \u201cfairly can be implied\u201d from the stipulated allegations in the original jurisdictional petition and judgment, and that those documents sufficed to put mother on notice that she needed to address her underlying mental-health problems to regain custody of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">First, the original judgment\u2019s references to mother\u2019s impulsivity, the fact that she either <em>\u201ccannot </em>or will not control her behavior\u201d (emphasis added), and her lack of \u201cmotivation\u201d to safely parent her children suggested that mother had mental-health problems that would need to be addressed before her children could be returned to her. Second, evidence in the record supports the juvenile court\u2019s finding that mother\u2019s depression was \u201cnot a new issue\u201d and confirms that the original jurisdictional judgment can be read (and was in fact read) as implicating concerns about mother\u2019s mental health. The caseworker who visited the home on July 1, 2011, after mother brought A to the DHS office, cited concerns about mother\u2019s mental health as a basis for taking both children into protective custody. The record also establishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>that, except during several months while the children were in her care, mother has attended mental-health therapy since January 2012 and has been directly addressing her depression (as well as other issues) since no later than July of that year. Those events, considered in context, are consistent with our reading of the original jurisdictional judgment as \u201cfairly implying\u201d mother\u2019s mental-health issues. Thus, to the extent that the court took into account the sufficiency of mother\u2019s progress on those issues when it changed the permanency plan, that was permissible, even though the particulars of those issues were not detailed in the original judgment. We conclude that, although not more particularly identified in the original jurisdictional judgment, mother\u2019s mental health underlay the original bases for jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Further, as the juvenile court found, mother was on notice that mental-health concerns needed to be addressed and ameliorated. Thus, this case is not one in which mother has not had a reasonable opportunity to address the conditions that prevented her reunification with the children or notice that she needed to do so. <em>Cf. A. R. S., </em>256 Or App at 663-64 (reversing a permanency judgment that was based on the mother\u2019s mental-health condition when \u201cnothing in the jurisdictional judgment\u201d would have alerted the mother that she needed to address that condition). Indeed, given that mother received a psychological evaluation and mental-health services starting shortly after entry of the original jurisdictional judgment, nothing in the record suggests that mother would have been provided with any different services \u2014 or would have participated more successfully in services \u2014 had that judgment more particularly identified her mental-health problems as a basis for jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Mother also contends that the evidence is insufficient to support the juvenile court\u2019s determination that DHS established that mother has not made sufficient progress to allow the children\u2019s return home. Mother cites evidence that she has made considerable progress in her parenting skills, that she is focused on having the children, and that her behavior is not impulsive.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Although there is evidence that could support a contrary finding, under our standard of review, <em>N. P., </em>257 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>App at 639, we conclude that the evidence was legally sufficient to permit the juvenile court to find by a preponderance of the evidence that, as of the date of the permanency hearing, the conditions that provided the bases for jurisdiction in September 2011 have not been ameliorated sufficiently to make it possible for the children to safely return home. ORS 419B.476(1)(a). A, in particular, has special needs that require a structured and stable environment. There is evidence that, although mother has completed many different services and has made progress, she is not yet able to provide that kind of home environment. There is evidence that, most recently, mother has not been in compliance with her letter of expectation with DHS. Mother signed an agreement in May 2013 that mentioned that pets can make a house dirty and unsanitary, and that required her to have a household free of pets. Mother acknowledged at the hearing that she had, in the past, had an unkempt household, and admitted that she deliberately ignored the no-pet requirement (two cats and two ferrets lived with the family) because she thought the prohibition on pets was unreasonable. Mother also acknowledged that she missed <em>\u201ca </em>few\u201d appointments with her therapist in the 30 days leading up to trial (she could not recall the exact number) because of migraine headaches; she also had missed several visits with the children in June 2013. Although mother estimated that she had missed four out of eight or 10 scheduled visits with her children in the two months preceding trial, she deemed her visitation \u201cfairly consistent.\u201d That evidence supports the trial court\u2019s determination that mother\u2019s impulsivity and lack of parenting knowledge, skills, or motivation continue in a way that threatens the children\u2019s wellbeing. Sweet\u2019s reports and testimony further support the finding that mother is not yet able to care for the children, especially A, who has special needs and is at high risk of further developmental problems if she does not have a highly structured environment. We conclude that the juvenile court did not err in determining that mother has not made sufficient progress for the children to be safely returned home.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\">The remaining question, raised in mother\u2019s fifth and sixth assignments, is whether the juvenile court erred in finding jurisdiction based on the new allegation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>\u201cmother * * * suffers from a mental illness, emotional illness, or mental impairment that interfere [s] with her ability to safely parent.\u201d We conclude that the evidence is legally sufficient to support the juvenile court\u2019s finding. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. G. J. R., </em>254 Or App 436, 443-44, 295 P3d 672 (2013) (state meets its burden by presenting evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could find, by a preponderance of the evidence, either that a current risk of harm exists from the additional allegation standing alone, or that the additional allegation contributes to or enhances the risk associated with the already established bases of jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b757-7\"> ORS 419B.100(1)(c) provides, in relevant part that \u201cthe juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction in any case involving a person who is under 18 years of age\u201d and \u201c[w]hose condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the person or of others.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-8\"> The jurisdictional judgment included identical findings as to father. Mother and father are currently married, but father does not dispute the court\u2019s continued jurisdiction, does not wish to be considered as a custodial resource for the children, and supports the change in the permanency plan to adoption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b757-9\"> The second petition contained an identical allegation as to father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b762-4\"> Sweet testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-5\">\u201cQ. And what changes, if any, did you see from the evaluation in October of\u2019ll to the one in April \u201913?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The biggest change is the fact that she is now able to recognize that she\u2019s had a long problem with depression that goes back many years. And she is recognizing this year that the depression is having a very negative impact on how she functions specifically as a parent. So she\u2019s admitting it and wanting to do something about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-7\">\u201cQ. Okay. And that was particularly evident in the April evaluation, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">\u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-9\">\u201cQ. So she\u2019s made progress from October 2011 to April of 2013?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-10\">\u201cA. Well she\u2019s made progress in dealing with the depression, and she was just starting to deal with it when I saw her. But to be able to \u2014 her progress, the type of progress needed to process a person that says, yeah, I\u2019ve really been depressed since I was a teenager and now I want to do something about it, but actually getting the depression controlled, she\u2019s still at a very early point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-11\">\u201cQ. Okay. And in your April evaluation, you said that if she continued to make progress on her issues, you would support reunification?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-12\">\u201cA. I did say that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-13\">\u201cQ. And you wouldn\u2019t support reunification if her mental disorders interfered with her ability to parent, would you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-14\">\u201cA. No, I wouldn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-15\">\u201cQ. Have you seen [mother] since that evaluation in April?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-16\">\u201cA. I have not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-17\">\u201cQ. So if information\u2019s developed at the hearing that [mother] has made sufficient progress in addressing her issues, would that reinforce your opinion that reunification should be considered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-18\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-19\">On cross-examination, Sweet was asked whether, based on the information in the clinical notes by mother\u2019s therapist, he would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-20\">\u201csupport reunification at this time? Does it appear she\u2019s made that type of progress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-21\">\u201cA. No, no, no. Not yet.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-22\">Sweet was asked whether,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-23\">\u201cgiven the combination of the two, the child with these needs and the Mother with these issues, can you tell us what kind of time frame we might most optimistically be looking at to have Mom be able to adequately parent a child of this type and the second child as well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-24\">\u201cA. You could be looking at a year for Mom to get things stabilized and to keep up with the treatment and the support that she needs. It\u2019s kind of hard to tell because part of it has to do with helping [A] with her depression and making sure that [A] takes the right medication for things. But I would say it\u2019s a rough estimate.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b763-8\"> \u201cQ. And we\u2019ve had a DHS case open since 2011 with these girls in which we\u2019ve had them in foster care, returned them to Mom, and then they came back into care. They\u2019ve actually been out of home for a substantial period of time. But we\u2019re addressing both [A] and [C] here, and you\u2019re saying Mom is at a point where it may be up to a year, an additional year beyond what we\u2019ve already done here. And what about these girls waiting a year? What\u2019s the impact on them?</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">\u201cA. Well it\u2019s horrible on them. Especially [A] who has much higher needs than [C].</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">\u201cQ. Well are these kids who can wait, is [C] a child who can wait one more year for Mom to be able to be at the point where she could have the kids returned to her care?</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">\u201cA. What\u2019s happened here with the kids going home to Mom and failing again is pretty detrimental to their development.

It\u2019s two years later. Okay? You\u2019re telling me in your own words that you still can\u2019t do it on your own. That you still need the foster parents to be there.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\"> The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-8\">\u201cMy concern is that you\u2019re not working.
