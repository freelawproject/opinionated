He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s exclusion of a witness statement as hearsay, arguing that the statement falls within the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d exception to the hearsay exclusionary rule. <em>See </em>OEC 802 (rule against hearsay); OEC 803(2) (hearsay rule does not exclude \u201c[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition\u201d). The state concedes that the trial court erred in excluding the testimony, and we agree with and accept the state\u2019s concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Nonetheless, the state argues that we should affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment because the error was harmless. <em>See </em>Or Const, Art VII (Amended), \u00a7 3 (if \u201cthe judgment of the court appealed from was such as should have been rendered in the case, such judgment shall be affirmed\u201d). We conclude that the error was harmless as to two of the counts, but it was not harmless as to the other four counts. Accordingly, we reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Defendant\u2019s convictions arose from two altercations that occurred on the same day \u2014 one in which Smith was the victim, and one in which Branch was the victim. Defendant\u2019s sole defense was that he acted in self-defense. In support of his self-defense theory, defendant attempted to solicit the following testimony from his mother, Galvez, whom defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Rouse, had allegedly called during one of the altercations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">\u201c[GALVEZ]: She called me frantically screaming and crying, talking about, \u2018They\u2019re jumping [defendant], they\u2019re jumping [defendant], you guys need to hurry up and get over here.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">The state objected on hearsay grounds, after which the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-9\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It\u2019s excited utterance, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: Sustained. [To Galvez:] You can describe what happened. You can\u2019t quote anything that anyone said to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">\u201c [GALVEZ]: I\u2019m just describing what happened. I\u2019m\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: No. You can\u2019t say that, \u2018She said this to me.\u2019 You can describe how\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">\u201c [GALVEZ]: Okay. I got a phone call, and what I heard on the other end \u2014 can I say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">\u201c [GALVEZ]: I got a phone call and I answered it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">As noted, the only issue is whether the trial court\u2019s exclusion of Galvez\u2019s testimony was harmless. According to the state, in light of the lack of credibility of Rouse and Galvez, there is no likelihood that the trial court would have found the excluded evidence credible enough to affect the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant did not act in self-defense. For his part, defendant argues that the error was not harmless because the erroneously excluded evidence would have (1) bolstered defendant\u2019s version of the events\u2014 specifically, that defendant acted in self-defense; and (2) undermined the state\u2019s assertion at trial that Rouse\u2019s testimony was not believable, by showing that she gave a consistent version of the events at the time of the incident\u2014 in other words, it would have helped rehabilitate the credibility of Rouse\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Evidentiary error is harmless if there is \u201clittle likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). Our goal is to determine \u201cthe possible influence of the error on the verdict rendered, not whether this court, sitting as a factfinder, would regard the evidence of guilt as substantial and compelling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, \u201cwe do not determine, as a fact-finder, whether the defendant is guilty. That inquiry would invite this court to engage improperly in weighing the evidence and, essentially, retrying the case, while disregarding the error committed at trial [.]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">We must assess the erroneously excluded evidence in light of other evidence in the record pertaining to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>issue. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>225 Or App 545, 550, 202 P3d 225 (2009). If erroneously admitted or excluded evidence relates to a \u201ccentral factual issue\u201d in the case, it is more likely to have affected the trier of fact\u2019s determination than if it deals with a tangential issue. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Marrington, </em>335 Or 555, 566, 73 P3d 911 (2003)). By contrast, if the particular issue to which the error pertains has little relationship to the issues being determined by the trier of fact, then there is less likelihood that the error affected the verdict. <em>Id. </em>We address the circumstances of each altercation in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Defendant was convicted of two crimes arising from his altercation with Smith: unlawful use of a weapon (Count 4) and menacing (Count 6). At trial, the state presented evidence that defendant and his girlfriend, Rouse, arrived at Rouse\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house, where Rouse\u2019s brother (Smith), her sister (Anderson), and a family friend (Harris), were gathered on the porch. Rouse\u2019s siblings had recently received information that defendant had hit Rouse. Defendant arrived at the house \u201clooking for trouble.\u201d After walking inside the house briefly, defendant went back to the front porch and gave Smith a \u201cmean\u201d look. Smith asked defendant if he had a problem, they exchanged some words, and defendant told Smith to \u201ccome down to the street\u201d with him. Smith walked down to the street where defendant was and defendant pulled a box cutter from his pocket. Defendant was the only one with a blade. Smith became fearful and ran a few steps away, then returned and shook hands with defendant, ending the altercation.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">In contrast, defendant testified that Smith had been sending defendant threatening text messages in response to the allegations that he had hit Rouse. According to defendant, he had not intended to go to the house that day, and only went there because he and Rouse were asked to pick up Harris. When he arrived, he asked Smith to go down to the street with him so that they could talk, but he did not intend to fight. While talking, Smith pulled out a knife, and defendant pulled out his box cutter to protect himself. After a brief discussion, they both put the blades away.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In that context, a central issue to defendant\u2019s self-defense theory was whether defendant saw Smith with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>knife. The erroneously excluded statement, \u201cthey\u2019re jumping [defendant],\u201d was not relevant to that issue because, even if the statement were believed by the trier of fact, it would not tend to prove that Smith had a knife. Therefore, the statement would not have bolstered defendant\u2019s version of his encounter with Smith. Moreover, the excluded statement would not have rehabilitated the credibility of Rouse\u2019s trial testimony regarding defendant\u2019s encounter with Smith, because Rouse did not testify that multiple people had attacked defendant during that encounter. Thus, we conclude that, as to Counts 4 and 6, there is \u201clittle likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>336 Or at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">We now turn to the remaining counts. Shortly after the altercation between defendant and Smith ended, Anderson\u2019s boyfriend (Branch) arrived at the house and another altercation ensued. Defendant was convicted of four crimes arising from his altercation with Branch: attempted murder (Count 1), assault in the second degree (Count 2), unlawful use of a weapon (Count 3), and menacing (Count 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">At trial, the state presented the following evidence. Branch went to the house that day because he was living there at the time and was under house arrest. When Branch arrived at the house, he approached defendant and defendant put up his hands as if ready to fight. Branch punched defendant, starting a fight. Although Rouse and Anderson also fought with each other, the fight between defendant and Branch was \u201cone-on-one.\u201d Branch slammed defendant to the ground twice, and then thought the fight was over, but defendant pulled out the box cutter. Anderson said, \u201cHe\u2019s got a knife,\u201d and defendant told Branch, \u201cMan, I\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d Branch threw his hands up and tried to run away, but he tripped and fell to the ground and defendant got on top of him. Defendant cut Branch in the shoulder and leg. Smith grabbed defendant\u2019s arm, allowing Branch to get away. Branch was immediately taken to the hospital and treated for his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">In contrast, defendant claimed that he cut Branch in self-defense, presenting evidence consistent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>following. Anderson had been encouraging Smith to fight defendant, and when they did not fight, she called Branch and told him to come fight defendant. Defendant had received threatening phone calls from Branch, and Branch was known to carry weapons. When Branch arrived at the house, \u201che looked like he had a problem.\u201d After Anderson and Branch exchanged words, Branch approached defendant. Branch hit defendant in the face when defendant was not looking, and slammed him to the ground. While defendant was on the ground, Anderson hit him with her phone and fists, and kicked him. Smith was also kicking defendant. A blade \u2014 either the box cutter or a knife \u2014 fell to the ground and defendant, still on his hands and knees, grabbed it. Defendant started swinging the blade and everyone got off of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">In that context, a central issue to defendant\u2019s self-defense theory was whether Branch, Smith, and Anderson were attacking defendant when defendant injured Branch, or, as the state asserted, whether defendant had attacked Branch while Branch attempted to retreat. The erroneously excluded statement, \u201c[t]hey\u2019re jumping defendant,\u201d was relevant to that issue; if believed, it would have bolstered defendant\u2019s version of the events \u2014 specifically, that he had been attacked by multiple people at once. Because the excluded statement relates to a \u201ccentral factual issue\u201d in the case\u2014 whether defendant was being attacked by multiple people\u2014 it is more likely to have affected the court\u2019s verdict than if it had dealt with a tangential issue unrelated to defendant\u2019s self-defense argument. <em>Johnson, </em>225 Or App at 550 (citing <em>Marrington, </em>335 Or at 566).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The state argues, nonetheless, that the excluded statement would not rehabilitate the credibility of Rouse\u2019s trial testimony because she admitted that she had lied during the investigation and her credibility was \u201cbeyond repair.\u201d However, \u201cour role is not to decide among the possible conclusions that the [trier of fact] could have drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Hren, </em>237 Or App 605, 608-09, 241 P3d 1168 (2010) (in theft case, erroneous exclusion of the defendant\u2019s testimony that a store employee told her she could take the stolen item was not harmless, despite \u201cstrong <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>evidence\u201d that she did not believe she had a right to take the item); <em>see also State v. Barnes, </em>208 Or App 640, 651, 145 P3d 261 (2006) (exclusion of testimony offered in part to impeach key witness\u2019s credibility was not harmless when it \u201ccould have been helpful to the jury\u201d). Because the trier of fact could have believed Galvez\u2019s testimony and concluded that it rehabilitated the credibility of Rouse\u2019s testimony, we cannot decide that there was \u201clittle likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>336 Or at 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">As a result of the trial court\u2019s erroneous exclusion of Galvez\u2019s testimony, the trier of fact did not have the benefit of all of the available evidence relevant to the question of whether defendant\u2019s actions were justified as self-defense. <em>See State v. Beisser, </em>258 Or App 326, 339, 308 P3d 1121 (2013) (rejecting the state\u2019s argument that erroneous exclusion of eyewitness testimony was harmless and holding that the erroneous exclusion of the testimony deprived the trier of fact of \u201cthe benefit of all of the available evidence\u201d). Thus, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s error in excluding Galvez\u2019s testimony was not harmless as to Counts 1, 2, 3, and 5, and we remand for a new trial on those counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Reversed and remanded on Counts 1, 2, 3, and 5; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
