Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The relevant facts are not in dispute, and we state those facts \u201cconsistently with the board\u2019s findings and the record that supports those findings.\u201d <em>Aguilar v.

Employment Dept., </em>256 Or App 682, 683, 303 P3d 957 (2013) (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>Claimant worked as an office manager for Westwind Landscape Supply for approximately one year. During the course of her employment, claimant faced the \u201congoing problem\u201d of underpayment \u2014 that is, her employer<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201crequired her to work overtime without receiving overtime pay.\u201d Specifically, claimant was \u201cworking more than 38 hours, but [employer] was only paying [her] for 38 hours\u201d for \u201cat least an entire year[.]\u201d Claimant was not \u201cthe only one\u201d who was underpaid. Other people who worked for employer</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">\u201cwould put in their overtime and [employer would] only pay them for a certain amount of hours. And he\u2019d say, \u2018Well, I know you were sitting on the side of the road having lunch, and I know you were probably doing this.\u2019 You know, and I \u2014 T don\u2019t believe you were really * * * fully working that entire time.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Claimant was also afraid of employer. She had \u201cactually witnessed former staff that were trying to get their full pay, you know, almost \u2014 with [claimant] almost having to call 9-1-1 because there was almost a physical brawl over these things happening.\u201d Claimant was \u201cnot a confrontation person.\u201d There were times when she put \u201cthe hint out there\u201d about her unpaid wages, but she did not complain to employer because she did not want to anger him. Claimant also did not file a complaint with BOLI.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Claimant left work and sought unemployment benefits, which the Employment Department denied on the ground that claimant voluntarily left work without good cause. ORS 657.176(2)(c). After claimant appealed, an ALJ conducted a hearing and affirmed the Employment Department\u2019s decision to deny claimant benefits. Claimant then appealed to the board, and the board reversed the ALJ\u2019s order and remanded the case for additional proceedings. The ALJ conducted a second hearing and issued a final order affirming the Employment Department\u2019s decision to deny claimant benefits. In that order, the ALJ concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">\u201cTo the extent that claimant quit because she was not getting paid for all hours worked, claimant established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>that she faced a grave situation. However, claimant failed to complain to the employer about the situation or file a complaint with the Bureau of Labor and Industries]. Claimant failed to pursue reasonable alternatives, and failed to establish good cause for quitting.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">After claimant again appealed to the board, the board adopted the ALJ\u2019s final order. Claimant timely petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">ORS 657.176(2)(c) disqualifies an individual who \u201c [v] oluntarily left work without good cause\u201d from receiving unemployment benefits. Good cause for voluntarily leaving work \u201cis such that a reasonable and prudent person of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense, would leave work.\u201d OAR 471-030-0038(4). A claimant\u2019s reason for quitting \u201cmust be of such gravity that the individual has no reasonable alternative but to leave work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, good cause is \u201can objective standard that asks whether a reasonable and prudent person would consider the situation so grave that he or she had no reasonable alternative to quitting.\u201d <em>McDowell v. Employment Dept., </em>348 Or 605, 612, 236 P3d 722 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, the question is \u201cwhether a reasonable person of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense, would have considered the circumstances to be sufficiently grave that he or she had no alternative but to resign.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 614. Accordingly, we must determine whether, in light of the board\u2019s findings in this case, that standard was met as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 620.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Two cases are helpful to our analysis: <em>Westrope v. Employment Dept., </em>144 Or App 163, 925 P2d 587 (1996), and <em>J. Clancy Bedspreads &amp; Draperies v. Wheeler, </em>152 Or App 646, 954 P2d 1265 (1998). In <em>Westrope, </em>we cautioned that OAR 471-030-0038(4) \u201c\u2018does <em>not </em>require, as the Board appears to suggest, that a claimant must show in every case that she asked about or otherwise explored alternatives to leaving work. There are cases in which any such effort would be useless.\u2019\u201d 144 Or App at 170 (quoting Bremer <em>v. Employment Division, </em>52 Or App 293, 296, 628 P2d 426 (1981) (emphasis in <em>Bremer). </em>Later, in <em>J. Clancy Bedspreads &amp; Draperies, </em>we affirmed the board\u2019s \u201cconclusion that filing a wage claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>with BOLI while remaining employed was not a reasonable alternative for [the] claimant [,]\u201d based on its finding that the employer had refused to pay the claimant overtime pay. 152 Or App at 650-51. As we subsequently explained, our conclusion in <em>J. Clancy Bedspreads &amp; Draperies </em>rested on the assumption that the claimant was subjected to a past default on wages <em>\u201cplus the substantial risk of recurrence\u201d Marian Estates v. Employment Dept., </em>158 Or App 630, 637, 976 P2d 71 (1999) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">As we explain more fully below, the board incorrectly concluded that claimant voluntarily left work without good cause. The board\u2019s findings, and the evidence in the record that supports those findings, required the board to conclude that claimant established good cause to leave work.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">First, under the circumstances in this case, complaining to employer about unpaid wages was not a reasonable alternative to leaving work because it would have been useless or even dangerous for claimant to do so. The uncontested evidence demonstrates that employer was unwilling to pay overtime to workers who complained about their pay. That is, when others complained, employer would \u201csay, \u2018Well, I know you were sitting on the side of the road having lunch, and I know you were probably doing this.\u2019 You know, and I \u2014 T don\u2019t believe you were really *** fully working that entire time.\u2019\u201d Further, claimant had \u201cactually witnessed former staff that were trying to get their full pay, you know, almost \u2014 with [claimant] almost having to call 911 because there was almost a physical brawl over these things happening.\u201d As a result, claimant \u201cwas afraid of [employer].\u201d Under those circumstances, a reasonable and prudent person of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense, would not have complained to employer about the unpaid wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Second, under the circumstances in this case, filing a complaint with BOLI while remaining employed was not a reasonable alternative to leaving work because that course of action would have exposed claimant to a substantial risk of continuing underpayment. Claimant testified that underpayment was an \u201congoing problem\u201d for her. Specifically, she testified that the difference between her time sheets and her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>pay stubs was two hours per week for \u201cat least an entire year\u201d and she provided some pay stubs to support that testimony. Thus, each passing week, claimant was exposed to the substantial risk that she would never get paid for the hours that she worked. Under those circumstances, a reasonable and prudent person of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense, would not have continued to work indefinitely for employer, without proper payment, while waiting for BOLI to process a complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">In sum, we conclude that the board erred in concluding that claimant left work without good cause. Under the facts found, a reasonable and prudent person of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense, would not have complained to employer about the unpaid wages or continued to work indefinitely, incurring the substantial risk of underpayment, while waiting for BOLI to process a complaint. Rather, such a person would have considered the circumstances to be sufficiently grave that he or she had no alternative but to resign. Accordingly, under the facts of this case, leaving work was the only reasonable course of action, and the board was obligated to conclude, as a matter of law, that claimant had good cause to leave work. <em>See McDowell, </em>348 Or at 620 (concluding, as a matter of law, that the claimant, who resigned to avoid the grave consequences associated with discharge, had good cause to leave work, and that the board \u201cwas obligated to so conclude\u201d); <em>see also Aguilar, </em>258 Or App at 458 (concluding that the claimant had good cause to voluntarily resign). Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-6\"> ORS 657.176(2)(c) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">\u201cAn individual shall be disqualified from the receipt of benefits * * * if the authorized representative designated by the director finds that the individual:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">\u201c(c) Voluntarily left work without good cause!.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-10\"> OAR 471-030-0038(4) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azv\">\u201cGood cause for voluntarily leaving work under ORS 657.176(2)(c) is such that a reasonable and prudent person of normal sensitivity, exercising ordinary common sense, would leave work. *** [F]or all individuals, the reason must be of such gravity that the individual has no reasonable alternative but to leave work.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b295-12\"> Claimant also argues that she had good cause to leave work because she was required to operate heavy equipment without training, because she was subjected to sexual harassment, and because she received a definite job offer.
