Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motion to exclude evidence of his physical and sexual abuse of the victim\u2019s older sister, T. In particular, the trial court ruled, based on our decision in <em>State v. Leistiko, </em>240 Or App 338, 246 P3d 82 (2011), <em>rev\u2019d in part and aff'd in part, </em>352 Or 172, 282 P3d 857, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>352 Or 622, 292 P3d 522 (2012), that the evidence was admissible because it was \u201crelevant to rebut the [d]efendant\u2019s theory that the victim in this case consented to * * * sexual activity with the [d] efendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">On appeal, defendant asserts that the evidence was not admissible under OEC 404(3)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because it was not relevant to prove that the victim did not consent to defendant\u2019s conduct or that defendant intended to forcibly compel the victim. <em>See State v. Johns, </em>301 Or 535, 548, 725 P2d 312 (1986) (OEC 404(3) prohibits the admission of other crimes evidence if it is offered to prove the character of a person and that the person \u201cacted in conformity therewith\u201d). At oral argument, the state conceded, and we agree, that, under the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Leistiko, </em>the trial court erred in admitting the evidence to demonstrate the victim\u2019s lack of consent. Furthermore, as the state conceded at oral argument, under <em>Leistiko, </em>the evidence could not be properly admitted in this case to demonstrate defendant\u2019s intent with respect to forcible compulsion and, based on the limited way the record in this case was developed, we cannot affirm on the alternative grounds advanced in the state\u2019s brief. Again, we agree with the state\u2019s concessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>For the first time at oral argument, the state observed that, as a result of his stipulations at trial, defendant is subject to conviction for several lesser-included offenses on which the jury was instructed. We decline to address that issue, except to note that the parties will have an opportunity on remand to litigate the consequences of defendant\u2019s stipulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-6\"> Under OEC 404(3),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">\u201c[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
