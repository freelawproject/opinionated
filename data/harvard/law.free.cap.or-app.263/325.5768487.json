He raises two assignments of error on appeal. We reject defendant\u2019s first assignment without discussion, and write only to address his second assignment of error, in which he contends that the trial court erred when it ordered him to pay $510 in attorney fees. According to defendant, there was no evidence of his ability to pay the fees, which were not mentioned at sentencing. <em>See </em>ORS 151.505(3) (a court may not order a defendant to pay fees unless the defendant \u201cis or may be able\u201d to pay them); ORS 161.665(4) (same); <em>see also State v. Pendergrapht, </em>251 Or App 630, 634, 284 P3d 573 (2012) (\u201c[A] court cannot impose attorney fees based on a record that is silent regarding the defendant\u2019s ability to pay those fees.\u201d); <em>State v. Kanuch, </em>231 Or App 20, 24, 217 P3d 1082 (2009) (the state bears the burden of proving that a defendant is or may be able to pay fees). The state acknowledges that, in this case, defendant had no ability to object to the court\u2019s imposition of attorney fees and concedes that the court erred in imposing those fees in the absence of any evidence in the record of defendant\u2019s ability to pay them. We agree, and accept the state\u2019s concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Portion of judgment requiring defendant to pay attorney fees reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
