We reject defendant\u2019s second and third assignments of error without discussion. In his first assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss on statutory speedy trial grounds. As explained below, the record suggests that the trial court applied an incorrect legal standard when it denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Because application of the correct legal standard would require the trial court to make factual findings that it appears not to have already made, either explicitly or implicitly, we vacate defendant\u2019s conviction and remand with instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">On August 16, 2000, a police officer issued defendant a citation for DWS. That citation directed defendant to appear in court on August 29, 2000. Defendant did not appear in court on the scheduled date, and the court issued a warrant. The state made an unsuccessful attempt to serve the warrant in 2003 before successfully serving it in July 2011. Defendant filed a pretrial motion to dismiss under <em>former </em>ORS 135.747 (2011), <em>repealed by </em>Or Laws 2013, ch 431, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> arguing that \u201cthere has been an unreasonable delay between the charging of these offenses and trial, which the defendant did not cause and to which he did not consent.\u201d At the 2011 hearing on that motion, defendant testified that he had spoken to a court clerk the day before his scheduled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>August 2000 court appearance and believed he was not required to appear the next day because charges had not yet been filed against him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">\u201c [I]t was the afternoon before the morning where I was supposed to be and I couldn\u2019t make it that next day, so I wanted to go down there and appear. And I talked to the clerk, and she said that they had no \u2014 nothing filed, knew no knowledge about it. Because I had my copy of the citation. And she told me that several times previously in the weeks before that, that this had happened several times, and things just didn\u2019t get filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">\u201cAnd so, I was kind of under the impression at that, that it didn\u2019t make it as far as \u2014 I didn\u2019t know there was a warrant out on that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The record shows that the state filed the charges against defendant the day before his scheduled appearance \u2014 the same day on which, according to defendant, he had spoken with the court clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, both parties agreed that the citation provided defendant with notice of his obligation to appear in court on August 29, 2000. Their disagreement centered on whether a subsequent event\u2014 defendant\u2019s interaction with the court clerk \u2014 excused his failure to appear for purposes of the statutory speedy-trial analysis. Defendant argued that, under <em>State v. Coulson, </em>243 Or App 257, 258 P3d 1253 (2011), \u201cthere is no <em>per se </em>rule that a Failure to Appear equals consent\u201d; under the circumstances, he argued, his conversation with the clerk effectively negated the notice of his obligation to appear. The state argued that the conversation with the court clerk was irrelevant because defendant had received actual notice of the hearing from his citation and therefore knowingly failed to appear. According to the state, under <em>State v. Anglin, </em>227 Or App 325, 206 P3d 193, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 364 (2009), \u201cwhether he went and spoke with someone or not isn\u2019t really at issue, because at the end of the day he had a date to come in and find out if we were filing charges or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, agreeing with the state that <em>Anglin </em>controlled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: As far as the historical facts, the Court accepts the State\u2019s witnesses, the Court accepts the Defendant\u2019s statements about where he lived, and the legal analysis is as follows: *** I think it\u2019s a three-part test. Did defendant cause or consent to the delay? Was the delay reasonable \u2014 excuse me, or unreasonable? And if it was unreasonable on the surface, is \u2014 or are there sufficient reasons to permit the case to continue? And some of the cases combine the second and third thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">\u201cBut the lawyers both concur that two and three are not really controlling here, because <em>if the Defendant did not consent, the delay was unreasonable, there\u2019s no good cause advanced.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">\u201cSo, it boils down to, in this particular case, did the Defendant cause the delay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">\u201cOn the one hand, I think a clerk can say anything, and I\u2019ve said that before. On the other hand, it\u2019s a little bit suspicious, this particular recitation 11 years later. But, <em>be that as it may, the citation says, \u2018Your court appearance date and location are August 29th, 8:30 a.m. </em>***.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-8\">\u201cThe defendant did not appear August 29th at 8:30 a.m. Nor did he * * * even request a continuance on August 28th, which he could have done if he wanted to, and so he did fail to appear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-9\">\u201cAnd I have to admit, that in reading all this stuff and being re-educated \u2014 because I\u2019m a little rusty on speedy trial- \u2014 that <em>Anglin </em>appears to be controlling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-11\">\u201cSo I would deny the motion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">(Emphasis added.) After the trial court denied the motion, defendant was convicted of DWS following a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">On appeal, both parties acknowledge that the trial court did not apply the correct statutory speedy-trial analysis as the Supreme Court explained it in <em>State v. Glushko/Little, </em>351 Or 297, 266 P3d 50 (2011), which was decided eight days before the trial court\u2019s ruling. Under <em>former </em>ORS 135.747 \u2014 at issue in <em>Glushko/Little </em>\u2014 courts applied a two-step analysis in determining whether a defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>entitled to dismissal under <em>former </em>ORS 135.747 because of unreasonable pretrial delay. \u201cFirst, we determine [d] the relevant amount of delay by subtracting from the total delay any periods of delay that the defendant requested or consented to; second, we determine[d] whether that delay was reasonable.\u201d <em>State v. Mercier, 259 Or </em>App 222, 226, 313 P3d 322 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">The Supreme Court explained in <em>Glushko /Little </em>that a defendant\u2019s knowing failure to appear for a scheduled court hearing was relevant to the second part of that analysis, <em>i.e., </em>the reasonableness of the delay. 351 Or at 316. Previously, this court had held that a defendant\u2019s knowing failure to appear at a mandatory court appearance was relevant to the first part of the analysis because it amounted to delay to which the defendant had consented \u2014 and therefore was not included in the delay subject to the reasonableness analysis in the second part of the test. <em>See, e.g., Coulson, </em>243 Or App at 265 (citing cases); <em>id. </em>at 272-73 (the defendant could not have consented to delay when he did not have notice that an indictment had been issued against him); <em>State v. Bigelow, </em>197 Or App 441, 446, 106 P3d 162, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 544 (2005) (accepting state\u2019s concession that the defendant neither caused nor consented to delay where the defendant \u201chad no knowledge of the indictment or the outstanding warrant until she was arrested\u201d). Thus, both the law as explained in <em>Glushko \u00a1Little </em>and the analysis that we applied in earlier cases took into account whether any failure to appear by a defendant was \u201cknowing\u201d and, therefore, excused pretrial delay either because the delay was reasonable <em>{Glushko \u00a1Little) </em>or was delay to which the defendant was deemed to have consented (the <em>pre-Glushko\u00a1 Little </em>analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In this case, defendant does not focus on how <em>Glushko \u00a1Little </em>shifted the part of the speedy-trial analysis to which the \u201cknowing failure to appear\u201d question is relevant. Rather, defendant makes a factual assertion that is significant under <em>Glushko /Little </em>and that also would have mattered under our earlier case law: based on his own testimony at the dismissal hearing, he claims that he did not <em>knowingly </em>fail to appear for his originally scheduled court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>date of August 29, 2000, because the court clerk\u2019s statement to him on August 28 led him to believe that he did not need to appear the next day. Under <em>Glushko /Little, </em>defendant contends, the pretrial delay was unreasonable and the case should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">The state responds that defendant\u2019s reliance on his own testimony is misplaced. The state first argues that the trial court was not required to, and did not, credit defendant\u2019s \u201cself-serving testimony.\u201d We understand the state to suggest that the trial court implicitly found defendant\u2019s testimony on that point not to be credible. The state also argues that \u201cdefendant\u2019s claim fails even accepting his testimony\u201d about the court clerk\u2019s statements because, in the state\u2019s view, \u201c [defendant just erroneously and unreasonably assumed that the charge would not be filed.\u201d The state acknowledges that the trial court erroneously \u201cruled that, by failing to appear, defendant consented to the delay,\u201d but argues that we \u201ccan and should affirm under the \u2018right for the wrong reason doctrine\u2019\u201d because defendant\u2019s failure to appear made the pretrial delay reasonable. <em>See Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60, 20 P3d 180 (2001) (explaining \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Defendant responds that we cannot affirm on that alternate basis because the trial court did not implicitly find his testimony about the court clerk\u2019s statements not to be credible. In his view, \u201cthe trial court utilized an incorrect legal standard\u201d and \u201cthe record establishes that the trial court did <em>not </em>decide the fact in the manner suggested.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">Because the trial court erred by rejecting defendant\u2019s dismissal motion on the ground that he consented to the delay caused by his failure to appear in August 2000, we can affirm only if the trial court\u2019s ultimate ruling \u2014 the dismissal \u2014 was correct for a reason other than the one that the court articulated. We can affirm on that kind of \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d basis only if certain conditions are met. <em>Outdoor Media, </em>331 Or at 659-60. One of those conditions is that \u201cthe evidentiary record must be sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>support the proffered alternative basis for affirmance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\">\u201cThat requires: (1) that the facts of record be sufficient to support the alternative basis for affirmance; (2) that the trial court\u2019s ruling be consistent with the view of the evidence under the alternative basis for affirmance; and (3) that the record materially be the same one that would have been developed had the prevailing party raised the alternative basis for affirmance below. In other words, even if the record contains evidence sufficient to support an alternative basis for affirmance, if the losing party might have created a different record below had the prevailing party raised that issue, and that record could affect the disposition of the issue, then we will not consider the alternative basis for affirmance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 659-60 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Applying that analysis, we consider whether the trial court explicitly or implicitly found facts that are sufficient to support affirmance on the alternate ground that the pretrial delay was reasonable. In <em>Glushko /Little, </em>the Supreme Court found that the delays in bringing two defendants to trial were reasonable because the defendants caused the delays by knowingly failing to appear. 351 Or at 316. But the Supreme Court did not apply a mechanical test, by simply noting that the defendants \u201chad notice that they were legally obligated to appear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, the court emphasized that the determination of whether pretrial delay was \u201creasonable\u201d under ORS 135.747 required \u201can examination of \u2018all the attendant circumstances of the delay,\u201d\u2019 particularly those circumstances that <em>cause </em>the delay. <em>Id. </em>at 315-16 (quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>339 Or 69, 88, 116 P3d 879 (2005)). Accordingly, the <em>Glushko I Little </em>court also considered other associated facts, including that the defendants had been informed \u201cthat failure to appear would result in a warrant for their arrest being issued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316. Based on those facts, the court concluded that \u201cthere [was] no question but that both defendants caused the delays in bringing their cases to trial by their failures to appear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We understand the Supreme Court\u2019s focus on \u201call of the attendant circumstances\u201d to mean that a defendant\u2019s receipt of a citation that commands that the defendant appear in court on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>particular date does not always, by itself, establish conclusively that the defendant\u2019s subsequent failure to appear on that date was \u201cknowing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">We recently applied similar principles in a somewhat different context in <em>State v. Kenny, </em>262 Or App 702, 327 P3d 548 (2014), which involved a defendant\u2019s conviction on a charge of failure to appear on a criminal citation. The defendant appealed, arguing that the trial court erroneously excluded evidence that, after visiting the district attorney\u2019s office and the police department about the citation, she believed that she was not being charged and did not have to appear in court. <em>Id. </em>at 709-11. We agreed, and we reversed and remanded the case, explaining that the defendant\u2019s \u201cproffered testimony met the low threshold for relevance under OEC 401 because it tended to negate her knowledge that she was obligated to appear on [the date on the citation].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 712. We recognize that the analysis of whether a defendant committed <em>the crime </em>of failure to appear by not showing up for a scheduled court proceeding may not coincide, in all respects, with the analysis of whether a defendant\u2019s failure to appear makes subsequent pretrial delay reasonable. But <em>Kenny </em>reflects a principle common to both analyses: that a court must consider \u201call of the attendant circumstances\u201d when determining whether a defendant\u2019s failure to appear was \u201cknowing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Returning to this case, although the trial court made no explicit findings about whether defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d failed to appear, the state argues that because the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion, the court must have implicitly resolved that issue in the state\u2019s favor. Under <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 487, 443 P2d 621 (1968), we will, in some circumstances, presume that the trial court decided disputed facts consistently with its ultimate conclusion. However, such presumptions are \u201cnecessarily dependent on the trial court\u2019s application of the correct legal analysis. If the court is operating under a misunderstanding as to the applicable legal principles[,] *** we will not infer that the court decided facts consistently with that erroneous legal construct.\u201d <em>State v. Ellis, </em>252 Or App 382, 390, 287 P3d 1215 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 428 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Although we know that the trial court applied <em>pre-Glushko / Little </em>law, we would not reverse solely on that basis, if the court had made the findings necessary to the <em>Glushko/Little </em>analysis. <em>See, e.g., State v. Baranovich, </em>254 Or App 98, 103-04, 295 P3d 58 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 747 (2013) (taking that approach). For two reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not make the necessary findings. First, the trial court declined to determine explicitly whether defendant was being truthful when he said that the court clerk told him \u2014 on the day before his scheduled appearance \u2014 that no charges had been filed and that, \u201cin the weeks before that, that this had happened several times, and things just didn\u2019t get filed.\u201d Although the court commented that defendant\u2019s testimony was \u201ca little bit suspicious,\u201d it went on to say, \u201c[b]ut, be that as it may,\u201d the citation included the date and location of the court appearance, suggesting that the court believed that the notice provided by citation was <em>all </em>that mattered to the speedy-trial analysis. Thus, the court\u2019s explicit statements suggest that it did not take into account \u201call attendant circumstances,\u201d as <em>Glushko/Little </em>and <em>Kenny </em>require.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Second, we are not persuaded that the trial court <em>implicitly </em>made the findings about defendant\u2019s knowledge of his duty to appear that are necessary to the <em>Glushko/Little </em>analysis. At the hearing on defendant\u2019s dismissal motion, the state argued that, because defendant had notice of his court hearing, his purported conversation with the court clerk was irrelevant and his failure to appear \u201cequalled] consent.\u201d In making that argument, the state relied heavily on our decision in <em>Anglin. </em>The trial court also relied on <em>Anglin, </em>agreeing with the state that <em>\u201cAnglin </em>appears to be controlling.\u201d The difficulty with the court\u2019s reliance on <em>Anglin </em>is that the defendant\u2019s state of mind was not at issue in that case in the same way that it is here; that is, the <em>Anglin </em>defendant does not appear to have contended that events following his citation reasonably led him to believe that he did not have to appear on his scheduled court date. Indeed, perhaps because <em>Anglin </em>did not involve a dispute over the defendant\u2019s mental state, our opinion repeatedly uses the shorthand phrase \u201cfailure to appear\u201d in discussing the speedy-trial analysis, 227 Or App at 333, without describing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the additional requirement that the failure be \u201cknowing\u201d to constitute (under then-existing case law) consent to pretrial delay. Thus, <em>Anglin </em>could be read to incorrectly suggest that <em>any </em>failure to appear by a defendant \u2014 even one that was not \u201cknowing\u201d \u2014 constituted the defendant\u2019s consent to subsequent delay. Accordingly, we will not infer that, in applying <em>Anglin, </em>the trial court implicitly made findings that defendant\u2019s failure to appear was \u201cknowing\u201d in a way that was not (to use defendant\u2019s word) \u201cnegated\u201d by other \u201cattendant circumstances.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">In short, we decline to affirm the trial court\u2019s decision under the \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d doctrine because the record does not support a determination that the trial court explicitly or implicitly made the findings that would be necessary to support affirmance under <em>Glushko/Little. </em>We therefore vacate the judgment of conviction and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">That result raises the question of what law the trial court should apply on remand. As noted, we have applied the provisions of <em>former </em>ORS 135.747 in resolving defendant\u2019s appeal. <em>See </em>263 Or App at 264 n 1. On remand, however, the analysis of what law applies may be different. Defendant asserts that, in case of a remand, <em>former </em>ORS 135.747 should continue to apply \u201cbecause the trial court would merely be adjudicating a dismissal motion filed before the repeal took effect.\u201d The state does not explicitly take a position on what speedy-trial provisions would apply in case of a remand, but simply asserts that, if we remand, \u201cthe parties can litigate, and the trial court can determine, which statute would govern at that point.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Although the question of what statute will apply on remand in this case ultimately will present an issue of law, it would be premature for us to address the issue now. As explained above, we are remanding the case because the trial court did not make factual findings regarding whether defendant <em>knowingly </em>failed to appear for his hearing on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>August 29, 2000. It is possible that, on remand, the parties will agree on which version of the speedy-trial legislation should apply to petitioner\u2019s case. Even if that point is disputed, the trial court may make factual findings regarding defendant\u2019s mental state at the time he failed to appear\u2014 or about other attendant circumstances \u2014 that obviate any need for the court to determine <em>which </em>version of the speedy-trial statute applies to defendant\u2019s case. That is, the trial court could make findings sufficient to establish either that (1) defendant would be entitled to dismissal on speedy-trial grounds under <em>both </em>versions of the law, or (2) defendant is not entitled to dismissal under <em>either </em>version of the law. Because this case ultimately may be resolved in a way that does not require a judicial determination of which speedy-trial statute applies in the somewhat unusual procedural circumstances involved in this case, we decline to address that question now.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-6\"> <em>Former </em>ORS 135.747 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">\u201cIf a defendant charged with a crime, whose trial has not been postponed upon the application of the defendant or by the consent of the defendant, is not brought to trial within a reasonable period of time, the court shall order the accusatory instrument to be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">In 2013, the legislature passed a law that provides, in part, \u201cORS 135.747 is repealed on April 1, 2014.\u201d Or Laws 2013, ch 431, \u00a7 1.
