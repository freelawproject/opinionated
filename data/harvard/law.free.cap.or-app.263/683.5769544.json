On appeal, defendant assigns error to the denial of his motions to suppress evidence obtained after police searched his vehicle. Defendant argues that the vehicle was illegally seized when police, acting without a warrant, towed the vehicle to an impound lot; defendant argues further that the warrant that police later relied upon to search the vehicle was issued without probable cause. Defendant also assigns error to the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the burglary charges, arguing that the state failed to establish that he entered a \u201cbuilding\u201d within the meaning of ORS 164.215.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">For the reasons that follow, we agree with defendant that the warrantless tow of his vehicle was unlawful because the state failed to show that the \u201cadministrative seizure\u201d exception to the warrant requirement applied in this case. The trial court therefore erred in denying the motion to suppress on that basis. We remand, however, in order for the trial court to determine whether, as the state argues, the evidence that defendant sought to suppress would have been discovered regardless of the illegal seizure. Separately, we reject defendant\u2019s arguments that the search warrant was based on \u201cstale\u201d information and that he did not enter a \u201cbuilding\u201d for purposes of the burglary statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">The Portland Water Bureau (PWB) owns a facility on Northeast Airport Way in Portland. The property is enclosed by a chain-link fence and contains, among other things, several permanent buildings, a shipping container, and a groundwater pumping station that provides backup water supply for the City of Portland. The site is adjacent to a piece of publicly accessible property that includes a nature path, a boat launch, and a parking area.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">At all relevant times, PWB was leasing part of the Airport Way facility to a private company, Carollo Engineers (Carollo), for the purpose of conducting tests on water treatment systems. Carollo did not use any of the permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>buildings at the site; rather, its employees worked in large tents, which were described at trial as the type of \u201cparty tents\u201d that \u201cyou might see out at a waterfront event.\u201d The tents had roofs and waterproof canvas walls around all four sides. Workers entered and exited though flaps on the walls. The tents were temporary structures that were erected for periods ranging from six weeks to nine months.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">When in use, the tents would function as a temporary testing facility, housing various pieces of equipment used to monitor water quality and power usage. The tents protected piping through which employees could access and test the water. Engineers also placed a work bench inside the tents. At the end of the work day, smaller, portable items would be locked in the shipping container outside the tents; larger items were left in the tents, including the water treatment equipment and control systems being tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In August 2011, there was a break-in at the PWB property. Carollo employees arrived at work to discover that the lock on the shipping container had been broken and several items had been removed from the container. A toolbox had been opened and its contents scattered about one of the tents. A chlorine kit and a pH pen<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were missing from the toolbox. Employees then observed that a hole large enough to drive a car through had been cut into a section of the perimeter fence. Investigating the scene later that morning, Portland police discovered a \u201c4x4\u201d decal, which appeared to have become detached from a vehicle, lying on the ground near the hole in the fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">A second break-in occurred at the PWB facility on the night of October 14, 2011. That time, PWB security observed a vehicle parked just outside the PWB site, on the adjacent public property, near the perimeter fence. They also observed an unknown person moving inside one of the tents. Portland police responded to the scene. The vehicle, a Jeep Grand Cherokee, appeared to have been driven through the parking lot for the boat launch and onto a grassy area so that it was concealed behind a row of trees. Police also found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>that the lock on the PWB facility gate had been cut. Police observed defendant walk into one of the tents and eventually approach the fence. Defendant was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Defendant was carrying a bag containing a pipe wrench, a flashlight, and bolt cutters. He did not have any property on his person that belonged to PWB or Carollo. Defendant told police that the Jeep was his, but he refused to consent to a search of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">After defendant was taken from the scene, police observed that the Jeep\u2019s rear seats were folded down and covered by a blanket. Officer Parry then called a towing company to remove the vehicle. During a pretrial hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the state questioned Parry about the decision to tow the vehicle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-6\">\u201c[THE STATE:] Did you believe that that car contained or could contain any criminal evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-7\">\u201c[PARRY:] Yes, I did believe that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-8\">\u201c[THE STATE:] All right. And in \u2014 so this car\u2019s parked sort of offset from a parking lot. As an officer, what are your options for getting that vehicle out of there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">\u201c [PARRY:] I didn\u2019t try \u2014 I mean, I didn\u2019t have a key for the vehicle so I couldn\u2019t drive it out and that\u2019s not an option.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">I don\u2019t drive other people\u2019s vehicles. So the option that we have as law enforcement is to tow the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-11\">\u201c[THE STATE:] Were you aware of any other reasonable disposition for that vehicle available to you at that time besides towing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-12\">\u201c[PARRY:] No, I was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-13\">\u201c [THE STATE:] All right. And where that car was parked, to the best of your recollection, was it blocking anything or interfering with the use of that parking lot or was it just sort of off to the side?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-14\">\u201c[PARRY:] No, it was off to the side, up against the fence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-15\">\u201c [THE STATE:] All right. And was the car, in fact, towed? \u201c[PARRY:] Yes, it was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-16\">The Jeep was taken to the police impound lot, a secure facility where police send cars \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d Parry also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>put a \u201chold\u201d on the vehicle, which served the purpose of notifying the police bureau\u2019s burglary task force so that they would \u201ceventually look at the vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The same night that defendant was taken into custody, he was interviewed by Officer Lobaugh, a member of the burglary task force, at the Southeast precinct. Defendant admitted to cutting the lock on the perimeter fence and breaking into the PWB property that night. Defendant explained, \u201cI had some bad luck at the poker machine and I needed some money, so I thought I\u2019d get some scrap metal and turn it in and get some money.\u201d He said he had been at the site for only about five minutes before police arrived. Defendant denied any involvement in the August break-in. Lobaugh asked about the 4x4 decal that police had found at the scene of the August break-in; defendant replied that it could not have come from his Jeep because it did not have those types of decals.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Four days after the interview, Lobaugh took the 4x4 decal to the vehicle impound lot. Upon examining the exterior of defendant\u2019s Jeep, Lobaugh discovered that it appeared to be missing a decal, and that the decal from the scene of the August break-in \u201cfit [the Jeep] like a puzzle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Lobaugh applied for a warrant to search defendant\u2019s Jeep. In his supporting affidavit, Lobaugh stated that police at the scene of the August break-in had discovered a hole in the fence \u201clarge enough to allow a vehicle to drive through\u201d; that forensic specialists identified \u201cindistinct tire tracks visible on the ground, leading from a perimeter path through the hole in the fence\u201d; and that police found \u201ca plastic 4x4 vehicle decal that had possibly been scraped off the side of a vehicle.\u201d Describing the October break-in, Lobaugh stated that defendant had been driving a \u201cJeep Cherokee\u201d and had \u201cmade entry into the property by cutting though the fence\u201d; that police observed blankets in the rear of defendant\u2019s vehicle that were \u201cclearly\u201d concealing something from view; and that when Lobaugh compared the 4x4 decal that had been recovered in August with the spot on defendant\u2019s vehicle that appeared to be missing a decal, \u201c[t]he glue to where the decal had been was still obvious and the decal seemed to fit exactly to that spot.\u201d Lobaugh requested a warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>to search and seize items \u201cto include, but not limited to the items reported stolen in the theft in [the A]ugust case.\u201d The affidavit then listed a number of stolen items, including water and electrical testing equipment, two laptops, \u201cMiscellaneous tools,\u201d and a \u201c[p]H pen (red in color, hand-held).\u201d The warrant was issued; police discovered a red pH pen in defendant\u2019s vehicle that was identical to the type of pen stolen in the August break-in.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Before trial, defendant filed a motion \u201cfor an Order suppressing evidence arising out of the search, pursuant to a search warrant, of [defendant\u2019s] 1992 green Jeep Cherokee ***.\u201d Defendant argued, as pertinent on appeal, that the information in Lobaugh\u2019s affidavit was too \u201cstale\u201d to establish the probable cause necessary to support issuance of the warrant. Subsequently, defendant filed a second motion to suppress \u201call evidence discovered pursuant to the warrant-less and unlawful \u2018seizure\u2019\u201d of his vehicle. At a hearing, defendant argued that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">\u201cbecause of the fact that they were applying for a warrant, they had the owner in custody and it wasn\u2019t impeding or blocking any traffic, and we have no evidence that it was illegally parked, therefore, the seizure and towing of this vehicle prior to getting the warrant was illegal. And therefore, the subsequent execution of the warrant and the search must be suppressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The trial court denied both motions. As to the seizure of the Jeep, the trial court determined that police had authority to tow the vehicle under Portland City Code (PCC) 16.30.220:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">\u201c[T]he court *** finds that the City of Portland Code did provide the officer with a legal basis to tow the vehicle without prior notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">\u201cAnd there\u2019s really two bases in that, the Code, under subparagraph G and H here, based on the facts in the record here. So the court finds that it\u2019s appropriate to deny the motion to suppress here.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>In further colloquy with the court, defendant questioned how the seizure could be justified when the state had not produced any \u201cevidence that shows that [the Jeep] was obstructing traffic or a danger or anything like that.\u201d Defendant argued that under those circumstances a warrant was required. The following exchange then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * * [PCC 16.30.220(H) applies when] the vehicle\u2019s in possession of a person taken into custody and there\u2019s no other reasonable disposition of the vehicle is available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-5\">\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is it\u2019s more reasonable to just leave the vehicle out there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-6\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: By itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: And then you\u2019d have some claim by the person, well, you hauled me away and my vehicle was left out there and then someone came along and busted out all the windows and vandalized it and it\u2019s all your fault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-10\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: I mean, that\u2019s a different issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, but that goes into is that a reasonable disposition of the vehicle for law enforcement to \u2014 to arrest the person, haul them away, and leave the person\u2019s vehicle out there in, you know, a place\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-12\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Then get the search warrant right away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-14\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: I mean, really, if it\u2019s \u2014 if it\u2019s that pressing, they can call in a search warrant immediately. They can be granted by phone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-15\">The court stood by its original ruling denying the motion to suppress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>At the conclusion of the evidence, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the two burglary charges. Defendant argued, among other things, that the state had failed to prove the necessary element that defendant \u201center [ed] or remain [ed] unlawfully in a building.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 164.215. The tents at the PWB facility, defendant argued, did not constitute \u201cbuildings\u201d within the meaning of the statute. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the denial of his motion to suppress all evidence discovered pursuant to the warrantless seizure of his Jeep, the denial of his motion to suppress the evidence discovered during the warranted search of his Jeep, and the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the two burglary charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">A. <em>Motion to Suppress: Warrantless Seizure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Regarding his motion to suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to the warrantless seizure, defendant argues: (1) that the tow of his Jeep from the scene was an illegal warrantless seizure; (2) that that illegal seizure resulted in Lobaugh\u2019s inspection of the Jeep and the connection to the 4x4 decal found at the August break-in; and (3) that, without that connection, Lobaugh\u2019s affidavit would not have established probable cause to support issuance of the search warrant. Accordingly, defendant argues, both the pH pen and the \u201cevidence of the \u2018match\u2019 between the \u20184x4\u2019 logo and defendant\u2019s Jeep\u201d must be suppressed. As explained below, we agree with defendant that the warrantless seizure of the vehicle was illegal because the state failed to show that the \u201cadministrative seizure\u201d exception applies. That does not necessarily mean, however, that the evidence resulting from the <em>warranted search </em>of the Jeep must be suppressed. That issue requires further findings on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">It is undisputed that police \u201cseized\u201d defendant\u2019s Jeep when they ordered it towed and that the seizure occurred without a warrant. Therefore, we begin our analysis with the basic proposition that, under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution, warrantless seizures are per <em>se </em>unreasonable unless they fall within \u201cone of the few \u2018specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>established and well-delineated exceptions\u2019 to the warrant requirement.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>State v. Davis, </em>295 Or 227, 237, 666 P2d 802 (1983); <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 US 347, 357, 88 S Ct 507, 19 L Ed 2d 576 (1967)). The state has the burden of showing that circumstances existing at the time of the warrantless seizure allow the state to \u201cinvoke one of these exceptions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">At the outset, we note that the state\u2019s arguments on appeal are confined to PCC 16.30.220(H). Accordingly, we limit our analysis to subsection (H).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">By defending the tow under subsection (H), which provides that an officer may \u201cwithout prior notice, order a vehicle towed, when: * * * [t]he vehicle was in possession of a person taken into custody by a law enforcement officer and no other reasonable disposition of the vehicle is available,\u201d the state relies upon the \u201cadministrative seizure\u201d exception to the warrant requirement. That exception recognizes that police have occasions to take custody of personal property for reasons that are unrelated to any criminal investigation. In such cases, police \u201chave an administrative or civil duty, authority or responsibility to take custody of personal property.\u201d <em>State v. Atkinson, </em>298 Or 1, 8, 688 P2d 832 (1984) (discussing a statute authorizing police to take custody of \u201cabandoned\u201d vehicles).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">An \u201cadministrative seizure\u201d is often followed by an \u201cinventory search,\u201d a term that has emerged in our case law to describe a police department practice of examining and cataloguing property that is taken into administrative custody. The concepts of an administrative seizure and an inventory search are thus related, but distinct. In order to comply with the constitution, an inventory search must satisfy three requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">\u201c(1) the state must lawfully possess the property that is inventoried, (2) the inventory 'must be conducted pursuant to a properly authorized administrative program, designed and systematically administered so that the inventory involves no exercise of discretion by the law enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>person directing or taking the inventory/ and (3) the person directing or taking the inventory must not deviate from the established policy or procedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><em>State v. Stinstrom, </em>261 Or App 186, 190, 322 P3d 1076 (2014) (quoting <em>Atkinson, </em>298 Or at 8-10).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">An administrative seizure, too, must be \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d by law. <em>State v. Anderson, </em>101 Or App 594, 597, 792 P2d 451 (1990). Unlike with inventory searches, police are allowed to use discretion when deciding whether to carry out an administrative seizure. <em>State v. Gaunce, </em>114 Or App 190, 195, 834 P2d 512, <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 271 (1992). In exercising that discretion, however, an officer\u2019s suspicion of criminal activity \u201ccan play no part\u201d in the decision. <em>Id. </em>That is so because, \u201c [i] f suspicion of criminal activity affects the decision to impound a car, and an inventory follows, then the decision to impound the car effectively singles out the car for special searching attention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Atkinson, </em>298 Or at 10 n 5) (brackets and quotation marks omitted). In other words, without that rule, the state could easily circumvent the \u201cno exercise of discretion\u201d requirement for inventory searches. Accordingly, if an officer who conducts a warrantless \u201cadministrative\u201d seizure also subjectively believes that the seized property may contain evidence of a crime, the state must prove that the property would have been seized regardless of the officer\u2019s suspicion of criminal activity. <em>Gaunce, </em>114 Or App at 194-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Our decision in <em>State v. Penney, </em>252 Or App 677, 288 P3d 989 (2012), is instructive regarding the state\u2019s burden in administrative seizure cases. In <em>Penney, </em>the defendant filed a motion to suppress evidence discovered after police impounded and performed an inventory search on his car. <em>Id. </em>at 681. Although the trial court concluded (erroneously<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) that the city ordinance authorizing the car to be towed was constitutionally defective because it allowed for too much discretion on the part of the police, the court further ruled that suppression was not required because \u201cthe car was parked in a manner that impeded traffic <em>and, therefore, </em>the officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>would have ordered a tow and the inventory would have occurred regardless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court erred because, among other reasons, the officer\u2019s decision to order the defendant\u2019s vehicle towed \u201cwas motivated by a desire to search the vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">In addressing that argument, we reached several conclusions that are relevant here. First, relying on <em>Gaunce </em>and <em>Atkinson, </em>we explained that the fact that an officer \u201csuspects criminal activity * * * when deciding whether to impound a car\u201d is not dispositive. <em>Penney, </em>252 Or App at 685. Rather, the relevant inquiry is whether \u201can officer\u2019s decision to impound a vehicle was <em>influenced </em>by a desire to search\u201d it for evidence of a crime. <em>Id. </em>at 686 (emphasis added). Second, we concluded that answering that question requires \u201ca factual determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will defer to a trial court\u2019s factual findings unless the evidence supporting those findings is \u201cinsufficient to meet constitutional standards of due process.\u201d <em>Ball v. Gladden, </em>250 Or 485, 487-88, 443 P2d 621 (1968). Finally, we concluded in that case that the trial court \u201cimplicitly found that the officers did not impound defendant\u2019s car because of a desire to search it.\u201d <em>Penney, 252 </em>Or App at 686. That conclusion was based on our observation that, in the course of deciding that suppression was not required, the trial court found as fact that \u201cthe manner in which the vehicle was parked (or more accurately, stopped) left it in a location where it was an impediment to traffic.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is, \u201cgiven the hazard that the car created, the [trial] court found that the officers would have ordered it towed regardless\u201d of their suspicions. <em>Id. </em>That finding was \u201csupported by the testimony of the officers who stated that they made the decision to tow defendant\u2019s car because of \u2018no insurance\u2019 and because \u2018it presented a hazard in the roadway.\u2019\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">In <em>Gaunce, </em>in contrast, the trial court made a finding that <em>\u201cthe main reason </em>[that police] decided to have the car towed was that it was creating a potential traffic hazard.\u201d 114 Or App at 195 (emphasis in original). On appeal, the state argued that the trial court had thus \u201cimplicitly found * * * that the car would have been towed [independent of] any suspicions\u201d of criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>omitted; brackets and ellipses in original). We disagreed, reasoning that the trial court\u2019s finding left open the \u201cdisposi-tive factual issue,\u201d which was whether the officer in question \u201cwould have had [the] defendant\u2019s car impounded, regardless of his suspicions\u201d about criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>at 196. We concluded that the correct disposition was to \u201cvacate defendant\u2019s conviction and remand with instructions to make a finding on the existing record\u201d and, if the court made that finding in defendant\u2019s favor, to \u201callow defendant\u2019s motion to suppress and * * * order a new trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">In the case before us, the state argues that the impoundment of defendant\u2019s Jeep was a lawful administrative seizure because \u201call the elements\u201d of PCC 16.30.220(H) were met, <em>viz., </em>the Jeep was \u201cin possession\u201d of a person, defendant, who was \u201ctaken into custody by a law enforcement officer,\u201d and \u201cno other reasonable disposition of the vehicle\u201d was available. Defendant counters that the state\u2019s administrative seizure rationale is inapplicable because \u201cthe sole reason for towing and impounding defendant\u2019s Jeep was to search it for criminal evidence and because no other concurrent administrative purpose justified the tow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">We conclude that the state failed to carry its burden of showing that the circumstances allowed police to invoke the administrative seizure exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Contrary to the state\u2019s argument on appeal, the warrantless seizure of defendant\u2019s vehicle cannot be justified by reference to the Portland ordinance alone. If police impound a vehicle without a warrant because they believe that it contains evidence of a crime, that raises a constitutional problem that cannot be cured by referring to a city code or by characterizing the seizure as \u201cadministrative.\u201d The administrative seizure exception applies when the seizure is \u201cspecifically authorized by law,\u201d <em>Stinstrom, </em>261 Or App at 190, <em>and </em>suspicions of criminal activity \u201cplay no part\u201d in the officer\u2019s decision to seize the property. <em>Gaunce, </em>114 Or App at 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">The state contends that the tow was authorized by law because subsection H allows a tow where no other \u201creasonable disposition\u201d is available, and Parry testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>was not aware of any \u201creasonable disposition\u201d other than towing. But the record does not support a conclusion that any \u201cdisposition\u201d by the police was even necessary in this case. Unlike in <em>Penney, </em>there is no indication that defendant\u2019s Jeep was obstructing traffic or otherwise creating a hazard. Rather, the Jeep was parked on a piece of accessible public property near a nature trail and a boat launch. It apparently was outside the designated parking area, but there is nothing in the record <em>{e.g., </em>evidence of a posted sign restricting parking to designated areas or certain hours) from which a finder of fact could infer, from that fact alone, that a tow would have resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The state also relies on the colloquy between the trial court and defense counsel, during which the trial court opined that if police had left the Jeep where it was, they might have risked being liable for any damage that came to it. But there was no testimony on that score; Parry never testified that the decision to impound defendant\u2019s vehicle was based, for example, on concerns about break-ins or vandalism. <em>Compare State v. Oneill, </em>251 Or App 424, 428, 285 P3d 1127, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 665 (2012) (holding that the war-rantless removal of a vehicle was reasonable in light of \u201cevidence that the car, although not presenting an impediment or hazard to other vehicles, was parked in a high-crime area known for vehicle break-ins\u201d and that \u201c[t]he car contained a number of pieces of property, some of them valuable\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In short, Parry testified that he ordered the Jeep towed because he believed that it contained evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>would later be subject to a warranted search. Parry\u2019s subjective motivation did not render the warrantless seizure illegal if the Jeep would have been towed for another reason unrelated to a criminal investigation. <em>Gaunce, </em>114 Or App at 195. But the record includes no evidence to support such a finding. This case thus differs from <em>Penney, </em>where the trial court made an implicit finding, supported by evidence in the record, that the vehicle would have been towed regardless of police suspicions about criminal activity because the vehicle \u201cpresented a hazard in the roadway.\u201d 252 Or App at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the state failed to carry its burden of showing that Parry\u2019s suspicions of criminal activity \u201cplay[ed] no part\u201d in the decision to tow defendant\u2019s Jeep, as required for a lawful administrative seizure. <em>Gaunce, </em>114 Or App at 195. Defendant\u2019s Jeep was, therefore, illegally seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The state\u2019s next argument, however, is that, even if the Jeep were seized illegally, the evidence that defendant sought to suppress was not obtained from that seizure; rather, it was obtained from the later <em>search </em>of the Jeep pursuant to the warrant. The state is correct that an illegal seizure does not necessarily require the suppression of evidence. <em>See State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 25, 115 P3d 908 (2005) (\u201c[A]fter a defendant establishes the existence of a minimal factual nexus *** between the evidence sought to be suppressed and prior unlawful police conduct, the state nevertheless may establish that the disputed evidence is admissible under Article I, section 9, by proving that the evidence did not derive from the preceding illegality.\u201d). One way that the state may seek to have evidence admitted despite an illegal seizure is by demonstrating that \u201cthe police obtained the disputed evidence independently of the violation of the defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The state analogizes this case to <em>State v. Smith, </em>327 Or 366, 368-69, 963 P2d 642 (1998), where police, acting on information that the defendant had a marijuana grow operation, arrested the defendant and placed a padlock on a storage unit belonging to him, which they suspected contained evidence of the operation. Several hours later, having obtained a warrant, police searched the unit and found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>incriminating evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 369. The issue on appeal was whether the defendant was entitled to the suppression of that evidence on the ground that police had unlawfully seized the storage unit when they padlocked it without first obtaining a warrant. The Supreme Court agreed that the seizure was illegal but nonetheless ruled against defendant. The court explained that under Oregon\u2019s exclusionary rule, suppression is required only if evidence \u201cis <em>actually obtained </em>out of an illegal search or seizure [,]\u201d and that \u201cpolice may gain some degree of control over the contents of private property when they \u2018secure\u2019 that property, but they do not obtain <em>evidence </em>out of such a seizure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 379 (emphasis in original). The court further noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-4\">\u201cin some circumstances, the act of securing certain property may permit the police to obtain evidence that otherwise would not be available to them. However, in the present case, it clearly did not. No one attempted to gain access to the unit to remove the evidence before the search warrant was executed. As such, the padlock, although unlawful, was irrelevant. The evidence would have been obtained even in the absence of the unlawful police conduct. The mere fact that evidence was discovered after that unlawful conduct does not require suppression.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 379-80 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Here, the state contends that even if the tow of defendant\u2019s Jeep was an illegal seizure, the evidence from the August burglary was nonetheless allowed under <em>Smith </em>because that evidence was \u201cactually obtained\u201d from the warranted search, not from the seizure. Defendant counters that the seizure of defendant\u2019s Jeep was causally connected to the discovery of the 4x4 decal match and the eventual discovery of the pH pen. In defendant\u2019s view, when police towed defendant\u2019s Jeep to the impound lot, that led directly to Lobaugh\u2019s inspection of the Jeep and, consequently, to Lobaugh\u2019s connection of the Jeep to the 4x4 decal found at the scene of the August break-in. Moreover, the decal match led directly to the issuance of the search warrant and the resulting discovery of the pH pen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>This case is distinguishable from <em>Smith. </em>In <em>Smith, </em>the Supreme Court reasoned that the unlawful padlocking of the storage unit merely secured whatever was inside it; that action itself did not contribute to the discovery of evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 379-80. Here, by contrast, the seizure of defendant\u2019s Jeep at least facilitated the discovery of evidence by making it possible for Officer Lobaugh to inspect the Jeep at the impound facility. In any event, because the trial court ruled that the seizure of the Jeep was <em>not unlawful, </em>the trial court had no reason to consider whether the pH pen and the evidence of the match of the 4x4 decal, like the evidence in <em>Smith, </em>\u201cwould have been obtained even in the absence of the unlawful police conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">We decline to resolve that question because the record before us does not compel a conclusion either way. Although the seizure of the Jeep allowed Lobaugh to inspect the vehicle at the impound lot, it does not necessarily follow that the police could not have obtained the evidence another way. That is an issue that the trial court should resolve on remand, based on the existing record. <em>See State v. Johnson, </em>335 Or 511, 526, 73 P3d 282 (2003) (holding that appellate courts must defer to a trial court\u2019s ruling regarding whether suppression is required unless \u201cthe evidence [is] of such a character or of such weight that the trial court was required\u201d to rule only one way).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">We have concluded that the trial court erred in ruling that the seizure of the Jeep was legal and, therefore, in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on that basis (although, as just explained, it is possible that an alternative basis for denial exists, depending on the trial court\u2019s findings on remand). We also must consider whether the trial court\u2019s error prejudiced defendant. Evidentiary error is not presumed to be prejudicial. OEC 103(1). The question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>whether there is more than \u201clittle likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003). Defendant\u2019s challenge to the denial of his motion to suppress involves three counts (Count 2, Count 3, and Count 4). Counts 2 and 3 arise out of defendant\u2019s conduct during the August break-in. Because the 4x4 decal and the pH pen were the key pieces of evidence connecting defendant to that incident, we easily conclude that their admission into evidence was likely to affect the verdict.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Count 4, however, is the burglary charge arising out of the October incident, during which no items belonging to Carollo were taken. Nevertheless, defendant argues that the admission of the pH pen likely affected the verdict on that count because \u201c[t]he jury could have found that the pH pen was evidence that defendant had entered a tent on the property before, in the August burglary, and thus found more credible the observations of the officer and the security personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">We do not agree that the pH pen was likely to influence the jury\u2019s deliberations on Count 4. At trial, the state offered testimony by the security manager for the PWB, who testified that security personnel observed defendant inside one of the tents during the October break-in. In addition, one of the responding police officers testified that defendant entered one of the tents shortly before being arrested. For his part, defendant testified that he simply could not remember whether he went into one of the tents.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In light of the ample evidence that defendant entered the tent in October <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>and defendant\u2019s own failure to refute that evidence at trial, we conclude that the pH pen was unlikely to have played a significant role in the jury\u2019s deliberations on Count 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">B. <em>Motion to Suppress: Search of Defendant\u2019s Vehicle</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">We turn now to defendant\u2019s second assignment of error. In that assignment, defendant argues that the evidence discovered in his vehicle must be suppressed because Lobaugh\u2019s affidavit in support of the search warrant was insufficient to establish probable cause. Defendant contends that the facts described in the affidavit regarding the August 2011 break-in failed to support an inference that the Jeep was likely to still contain evidence in October 2011. We must address this assignment of error because, if we were to resolve it in defendant\u2019s favor, he could be entitled to suppression of the evidence regardless of how the issues surrounding the seizure of the Jeep are resolved. As explained below, however, we disagree with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">\u201cWe review the sufficiency of a search warrant to determine whether, on the basis of the information in the affidavit, a neutral and detached magistrate could have concluded that there was probable cause to believe that the specified objects would be at the location sought to be searched.\u201d <em>State v. Clapper, </em>216 Or App 413, 415, 173 P3d 1235 (2007); ORS 133.555(2). To meet that standard of proof, the state must be able to show that its allegations are more likely true than not true. <em>State v. Chambless, </em>111 Or App 76, 80, 824 P2d 1183, <em>rev den, </em>313 Or 210 (1992). \u201cTo determine probable cause, the judge may rely on facts asserted in the affidavit as well as reasonable inferences to be drawn from them.\u201d <em>State v. Daniels, </em>234 Or App 533, 538, 228 P3d 695, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 171 (2010) (citing <em>State v. Anspach, </em>298 Or 375, 381, 692 P2d 602 (1984)). Moreover, in light of the policy to \u201cencourage searches pursuant to warrants,\u201d we \u201cresolve marginal cases in favor of holding the warrant valid.\u201d <em>State v. Ingram, </em>251 Or 324, 329, 445 P2d 503 (1968); <em>see also State v. Tacker, </em>241 Or 597, 601-02, 407 P2d 851 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Here, defendant argues that certain facts alleged in the affidavit are too \u201cstale\u201d to support probable cause. The concept of staleness refers to \u201cthe analysis about whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>or not the evidence sought will be there after the length of time since the event described in the affidavit occurred.\u201d <em>State v. Young, </em>108 Or App 196, 204, 816 P2d 612 (1991), <em>rev den, </em>314 Or 392 (1992). The purpose of that analysis is \u201cto determine whether, given the time between the event described and issuance of the warrant, there is a reasonable inference that the evidence will be where the affidavit suggests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhether the passage of times makes a fact \u2018stale\u2019 depends on the character of the crime and the thing to be seized.\u201d <em>State v. Corpus-Ruiz, </em>127 Or App 666, 670, 874 P2d 90 (1994). Moreover, \u201cinformation that might otherwise be stale can be \u2018refreshed with more recent information that provide [s] a basis for concluding that criminal activity continued at the stated location.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Chase, </em>219 Or App 387, 393-94, 182 P3d 274 (2008) (quoting <em>State v. Castro, </em>194 Or App 109, 118, 93 P3d 815 (2004)) (brackets in <em>Chase).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Defendant\u2019s argument is based on the nature of the items taken during the August break-in and the passage of time between that incident and the search of the Jeep in October. Defendant points out that most of the items taken, with the exception of the two laptop computers, were specialized water-testing equipment. Defendant reasons that such items are more likely to be sold than to be held for personal use and that there was ample time to sell them between the August and October break-ins. Although defendant may be correct that a thief is more likely to try to sell specialized testing equipment than to keep it, that same logic also suggests that it might be more difficult to find a buyer for specialized equipment than for items that are more widely used by the general public. The issuing judge could reasonably have concluded, therefore, that the equipment, because it is not consumable or easily marketed, was more likely than not to still be in the vehicle. In addition, officers at the scene of the October break-in observed that the back seats of the Jeep were folded down and that \u201cblankets were covering something in the rear of the vehicle.\u201d Given the totality of that information, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the Lobaugh affidavit was stale as a matter of law. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>C. <em>Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">In defendant\u2019s final assignments of error, he challenges the court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the two burglary counts (Counts 2 and 4). Defendant argues that the state failed to establish the required element that defendant entered a \u201cbuilding\u201d because the tents at the PWB property fall outside the definition of that term under ORS 164.215.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Whether a tent is a \u201cbuilding\u201d for purposes of the burglary statute appears to be a matter of first impression. The legislature has defined \u201cbuilding\u201d for the purposes of ORS 164.215 as either the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of that term or \u201cany booth, vehicle, boat, aircraft or other structure adapted for overnight accommodation of persons or for carrying on business therein.\u201d ORS 164.205(1). The state concedes that the tents at the PWB property fall outside the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of the term \u201cbuilding.\u201d Instead, the state argues that the tents were buildings because they were \u201cadapted\u201d for use as Carollo\u2019s \u201cplaces of business.\u201d As we explained in <em>State v. Nollen, </em>196 Or App 141, 144, 100 P3d 788 (2004),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">\u201c[t]he ordinary meaning of\u2018adapt\u2019 is \u2018to make suitable (for a new or different use or situation) by means of changes or modifications.\u2019 <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>23 (unabridged ed 1993). And the term \u2018business\u2019 ordinarily refers to \u2018a commercial or industrial enterprise\u2019 and to \u2018transactions, dealings, or intercourse of any nature.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 302.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">In the state\u2019s view, the tents here were adapted for business use because \u201cCarollo brought reactor equipment, control systems, workers, and tools into the tents and used them for extended periods of time as locations from which to conduct its testing operations.\u201d Defendant argues that that merely establishes that the tents were \u201cused\u201d for business, not that they were \u201cadapted\u201d for such use. According to defendant, the relevant inquiry is whether the tents were converted \u201cfrom one, original purpose, to the purpose of carrying on the water-testing business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Our cases instruct that the nature of the business being conducted is relevant to our inquiry. In <em>Nollen, </em>196 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Or App at 144, the alleged \u201cbuilding\u201d was a trailer that was being used as a donation center. In that case, the adaptations to the trailer included \u201cdetaching the trailer from the tractor that towed it, * * * leaving the trailer at the transfer station for some period of time, * * * placing stairs next to it, and * * * placing permanent signs near the trailer advertising it as a donation collection station.\u201d Based on those factors, we concluded that the trailer was a building under ORS 164.205(1). <em>Id. </em>at 144-45. We reasoned that the owner had \u201c\u2018adapted\u2019 the trailer from its ordinary use as a transportation vehicle * * * for the purpose of carrying on [the] business of collecting donated goods and redistributing them to needy persons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">More recently, in <em>State v. Webb, </em>262 Or App 1, 6, 324 P3d 522 (2014), we reiterated that \u201c[w]hether a vehicle or other structure has been adapted for carrying on a business will depend on the circumstances, including the nature of the business and the adaptations.\u201d In that case, the defendant argued that the tractor-trailer that he entered was not a \u201cbuilding\u201d under the statute because \u201ca vehicle or other structure is \u2018adapted for * * * carrying on business therein\u2019 if it is designed specifically for containing \u2018human beings for extended periods of time[.]\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 4-5 (ellipses in original). The defendant argued that <em>Nollen </em>supported his position because the adaptations to the trailer in <em>Nollen </em>\u201cincluded modifications that invited the public to its interior [,]\u201d whereas the tractor-trailer that Webb entered had not been so modified. <em>Webb, </em>262 Or App at 6. We rejected that argument, holding that it \u201cplace [d] undue emphasis on a single fact\u201d and that \u201c[t]he point\u201d in <em>Nollen </em>was that \u201cadaptations had been made to the trailer to transform it from a container used to transport items to a donation station.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Webb, </em>by contrast, the tractor-trailer was being \u201cused for storage of inventory and business records,\u201d a purpose that did not require modifications to facilitate public access. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>In this case, it is true that few, if any, physical modifications were made to the tents. That is not decisive, however. As we explained in <em>Nollen, </em>the ordinary meaning of \u201cadapt\u201d is \u201cto make suitable (for a new or different use or situation) by means of changes or modifications.\u201d 196 Or App at 144 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). One can effect \u201cchanges\u201d to make a structure suitable for a new use without making physical modifications. Here, in order to make the tents suitable for use as a testing facility, Carollo employees brought in large equipment that was too heavy to easily move about the PWB property. They also set up a work bench. Smaller tools and equipment would typically be brought into the tents while employees were conducting tests. On those facts, we conclude that the tents were sufficiently adapted from any number of other possible uses for the specific purpose of allowing Carollo to carry on its water-testing business. As in <em>Webb, </em>the absence of physical modifications to the tents indicates only that such changes were not needed in order for Carollo\u2019s business to be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">In short, because the tents could be considered \u201cbuildings\u201d under the burglary statute, the court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the two burglary charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the two charges of second-degree burglary. The trial court erred, however, in ruling that the tow of defendant\u2019s Jeep was a lawful seizure and in denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on that basis. We also conclude, however, that the court did not determine whether the evidence that defendant sought to suppress would have been discovered even in the absence of the unlawful seizure. Accordingly, we vacate defendant\u2019s convictions on Counts 2 and 3, and remand with instructions to make that determination on the existing record.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">Convictions on Counts 2 and 3 vacated and remanded for further proceedings; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-7\"> At trial, a Carollo engineer explained that a pH pen is \u201ca little hand-held device\u201d that allows a person to \u201cquickly and relatively cheaply measure the pH of the water.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b709-9\"> PCC 16.30.220 provides, in part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\">\u201cAny authorized officer may, without prior notice, order a vehicle towed, when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>\u201cG.

Oneill, </em>251 Or App 424, 427, 285 P3d 1127 (2012) (quoting <em>Miranda v. City of Cornelius, </em>429 F3d 858, 864 (9th Cir 2005)). Whether the community caretaking doctrine applies in such situations \u201cdepends on the location of the vehicle and the police officers\u2019 duty to prevent it from creating a hazard to other drivers or being a target for vandalism or theft.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>429 F3d at 864. Therefore, whether the community caretaking exception applies depends upon whether there was an adequate noninvestigatory justification for police actions. The same issue is raised here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\"> The state argues that defendant failed to preserve his argument that the illegal seizure of his vehicle requires the suppression of both the 4x4 decal match and the discovery of the pH pen. We disagree. Defendant\u2019s second motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>to suppress asked the trial court to suppress \u201call evidence discovered pursuant to the warrantless and unlawful \u2018seizure\u2019\u201d of his vehicle. That \u201cevidence\u201d encompassed the 4x4 decal match and the pH pen, which were discovered after police towed the vehicle and examined it for evidence connected to the August break-in. It is true that defendant did not expressly argue to the trial court that this evidence actually derived from the seizure, but it was not defendant\u2019s burden to do so. See <em>Hall, </em>339 Or at 35 (it is the state\u2019s burden to prove that evidence was obtained \u201cindependent of, or only tenuously related to, the unlawful police conduct\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b720-5\"> As discussed above, the pH pen was taken during the August break-in and then later discovered in defendant\u2019s Jeep after the October break-in.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b720-6\"> At trial defendant testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-7\">\u201c[THE STATE:] Okay.
