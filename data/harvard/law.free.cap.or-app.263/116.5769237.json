J.</author>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">This case involves a dispute between the City of Eugene and Comcast of Oregon II, Inc. (Comcast) over whether the city can impose certain fees on revenue that Comcast earned by providing broadband Internet service in Eugene. According to the city, Comcast\u2019s broadband Internet service is a \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d under the city\u2019s telecommunications ordinance, and the city is therefore entitled to collect a two-percent registration fee and seven-percent license fee that the ordinance imposes on gross revenues derived from telecommunications services within the city. Comcast, for its part, claims that the definition of \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d in the ordinance was never intended to include Internet access services and, further, that the city has discriminated against Comcast by treating it differently from all other Internet access service providers in Eugene. The trial court agreed with Comcast for the most part, ruling that its broadband Internet services were not \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d under the ordinance and, alternatively, that the city\u2019s enforcement of the ordinance against Comcast would violate the federal Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) and state and federal constitutional protections. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment with respect to the registration fee, collection of which is barred by the ITFA, but we reverse and remand with respect to collection of the license fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">We will reserve some discussion of the facts for a more focused treatment of particular assignments of error, but we provide the following general background to frame the issues on appeal. We take the facts from the trial court\u2019s findings, which the parties do not challenge on appeal, and we supplement them with the undisputed regulatory backdrop and procedural history of the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the sequence of events is relevant, we set out the facts in roughly chronological order.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>A. <em>Regulatory Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">1. <em>Comcast is granted a cable franchise in Eugene.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In 1991, the City of Eugene granted Comcast a nonexclusive franchise to develop, install, and operate a cable communications system in the city\u2019s rights-of-way.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The franchise called for Comcast to pay the city a fee in the amount of five percent of Comcast\u2019s revenue from services within the franchise area. Pursuant to the franchise, Comcast provided cable television services in Eugene and paid the city the five-percent franchise fee on revenue derived from those television services.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">2. <em>Congress passes the Telecommunications Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">In 1996, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act, which amended the Communications Act of 1934 (collectively, \u201cthe Act\u201d). The Act imposes common-carrier duties on providers of \u201ctelecommunications service,\u201d 47 USC \u00a7 153(51),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but not on providers of \u201cinformation service.\u201d The Act defines \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d as \u201cthe offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public, or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public, regardless of the facilities used.\u201d 47 USC \u00a7 153(53). It then defines the term \u201ctelecommunications\u201d as \u201cthe transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user\u2019s choosing, without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received.\u201d 47 USC \u00a7 153(50). \u201cInformation service,\u201d by contrast, is defined as \u201cthe offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications.\u201d 47 USC \u00a7 153(24).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>3. <em>Eugene adopts its telecommunications ordinance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">That same year, 1996, the Eugene City Council adopted its Telecommunications Vision and Policies. As described in that document, the city envisioned a \u201ccoordinated regional information infrastructure that provides accessible and affordable high-speed connectivity for citizens, public institutions, and businesses and is constructed in a manner that best serves the public interest.\u201d The city identified, as one of its policies, that \u201c[p]ublic inconvenience and disruption stemming from the installation, maintenance, and operation of telecommunications facilities shall be minimized and fully compensated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The following year, in April 1997, the city council adopted the ordinance at issue in this case, Ordinance No. 20083 (\u201cthe ordinance\u201d or \u201ctelecommunications ordinance\u201d). The ordinance imposes two fees that are relevant here. First, the ordinance requires <em>\u201coperators\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., those \u201cwho provide [] telecommunications services\u201d \u2014 to register with the city and pay an annual registration fee of two percent of revenues for those telecommunications services. Eugene City Code (ECC) 3.005; ECC 3.405; ECC 3.415(1). Second, the ordinance requires operators to obtain a license before locating any facility in the city right-of-way to \u201c [construct a telecommunications facility or provide telecommunications service.\u201d ECC 3.410. Operators who are required to obtain a license must pay an annual license fee \u201cin the amount of <em>7% </em>of the licensee\u2019s gross revenues derived from telecommunications activities within the city, to compensate the City for the use of the rights-of-way.\u201d ECC 3.415(2). The license fee is separate from, and in addition to, the registration fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">As described above, both the license fee and registration fee apply to providers of \u201ctelecommunications services.\u201d The ordinance includes the following definition of that term:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">\u201cTelecommunications services. The transmission for hire, of information in electromagnetic frequency, electronic or optical form, including, but not limited to, voice, video, or data, whether or not the transmission medium is owned by the provider itself, and whether or not the transmission medium is wireline or wireless. Telecommunications service includes all forms of telephone services and voice, data <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>and video transport, but does not include: (1) cable [television] service; (2) OVS service; (3) private communications system services; (4) over-the-air radio or television broadcasting to the public-at-large from facilities licensed by the Federal Communications Commission or any successor thereto; and (5) direct-to-home satellite service within the meaning of Section 602 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">ECC 3.005.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Both before and after the ordinance was adopted, there were questions as to whether it was intended to reach Internet service providers (ISPs), which, at that point in time, were predominantly \u201cdial-up\u201d ISPs that depended on local telephone companies to transmit signals. During a public hearing on whether the city council should adopt the ordinance, the general manager of one of those dial-up ISPs, Eugene FreeNet, asked city council members to address whether the proposed amendments would apply to Internet service providers. Randy Kolb, who was the staff lead to the council committee that developed the ordinance, responded at the hearing by stating that Internet service providers would not be affected by the proposed fees. One of the council members then requested that the language of the ordinance be amended to make it clear that Internet service providers would not be affected by the ordinance, but no such amendments were made.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">After the ordinance was adopted, a city employee prepared a \u201cwhite paper\u201d to guide the city\u2019s application of the ordinance. The white paper, which was reviewed by the city\u2019s legal counsel, stated in its first paragraph that \u201cInternet and radio/television broadcasting are <em>not </em>applicable.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">4. <em>Congress enacts the Internet Tax Freedom Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Around the same time that the City of Eugene was adopting its telecommunications ordinance, Congress was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>addressing the specific question of taxation of the Internet. In 1998, one year after the city adopted its telecommunications ordinance, Congress enacted the ITFA, codified in a note following 47 USC \u00a7 151. The ITFA, in oversimplified terms, does two things. First, it prevents state and local governments from imposing \u201ctaxes on Internet access, unless such tax was generally imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, 1998.\u201d ITFA \u00a7 1101(a)(1). Second, the ITFA prohibits state and local governments from imposing \u201cmultiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 1101(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">In February 1999, the city\u2019s employees, including Kolb and Pam Berrian, who was the city\u2019s telecommunications and cable program manager, submitted a report to the Eugene City Council that addressed the status of the telecommunications ordinance and, in particular, mentioned the newly enacted ITFA. The report states that the subject of \u201cInternet taxation\u201d had been capturing attention on several fronts, but that \u201c[t]hat issue will not be discussed here since Ordinance 20083 (the telecommunications ordinance.) is not inclusive of Internet activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">5. <em>Comcast begins offering broadband Internet service in Eugene.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">On October 26, 1999, Comcast began providing cable modem service, a broadband Internet access service, to customers in Eugene. The technical aspects of that service will be discussed later in more detail, but Comcast essentially provides its subscribers with Internet access by delivering Internet Protocol (IP) packets to and from the Internet and by providing an associated set of services, such as assigning IP addresses. Unlike the dial-up ISPs that preceded it, which depended on transmission facilities owned by other providers (such as telephone companies) to deliver IP packets, Comcast owns its own transmission <em>facilities </em>\u2014 i.e., the cable lines that it used to provide cable television under its franchise agreement with the city. Beginning in 1999, when it began providing broadband Internet services, Comcast paid a five-percent fee on those services pursuant to the franchise agreement. That changed in 2002, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>as the result of a ruling by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">6. <em>The FCC rules that cable modem services are not telecommunications services.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Although Comcast did not begin providing cable modem services in Eugene until 1999, questions had arisen elsewhere over whether cable modem services were \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d or \u201cinformation services\u201d for purposes of the 1996 Federal Telecommunications Act. In 2002, the FCC issued a declaratory ruling in which it concluded that cable modem services are <em>not </em>\u201ctelecommunications services\u201d under the Act. <em>In re Inquiry Concerning High-Speed Access to the Internet Over Cable and Other Facilities, </em>17 FCC Red 4798 (2002). (As we will later discuss, the United States Supreme Court eventually held that the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the Telecommunications Act was a reasonable one and was therefore entitled to deference. <em>Nat\u2019l Cable &amp; Telecomm. v. Brand X, </em>545 US 967, 125 S Ct 2688, 162 L Ed 2d 820 (2005).) In the wake of the FCC\u2019s 2002 declaratory ruling, Comcast stopped paying any franchise fees to the City of Eugene for cable modem services and, from that point forward, rebuffed the city\u2019s assertions that franchise fees were owed on those services.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">B. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">1. <em>The city attempts to enforce its ordinance against Comcast.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Comcast and the city entered into a new franchise agreement, effective November 2007. A few months later, the city filed its complaint in this action to collect fees based on Comcast\u2019s cable modem services. However, this time, the city was not seeking to collect under the franchise agreement, but, rather, based on the city\u2019s telecommunications ordinance. That is, the city alleged, among other things, that Comcast owed the two-percent registration fees and the seven-percent license fees under the ordinance dating back to 1999, when Comcast began providing cable modem services in Eugene.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>2. <em>The trial court rules that cable modem services are \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d under the city\u2019s ordinance and rejects Comcast\u2019s arguments that the registration and license fees are barred as a matter of law by the TTFA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment with respect to various issues raised by the city\u2019s complaint, including whether cable modem services are within the definition of \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d in the ordinance. That question, in turn, reduced to whether Comcast engaged in \u201ctransmission for hire\u201d \u2014 part of the definition of \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d \u2014 when providing cable modem services. The trial court ruled in the city\u2019s favor on that question, applying dictionary definitions of \u201ctransmission\u201d and \u201cfor hire\u201d to conclude that, by sending and receiving signals for remuneration, Comcast had engaged in \u201ctransmission for hire\u201d and, consequently, had provided telecommunications services subject to the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Alternatively, Comcast argued that, even if the ordinance were to apply to its cable modem services, then the registration and license fees are barred by the ITFA\u2019s tax moratorium and ban on discriminatory taxes; the license fees are franchise fees and therefore preempted by a provision of the federal Cable Act, 42 USC \u00a7 542(b); the franchise agreement excuses Comcast from obtaining a right-of-way and paying the license fees; and the city\u2019s selective enforcement of the ordinance violates constitutional protections against discriminatory treatment. The trial court ruled as a matter of law against Comcast on the bulk of those issues, leaving two questions for trial: (1) whether the annual registration fees had been generally collected before October 1, 1998, thereby excepting them from the moratorium on Internet taxes; and (2) whether the city, in enforcing the ordinance against Comcast but not other ISPs, had discriminated against Comcast in violation of state and federal constitutional protections.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">3. <em>Comcast offers expert testimony at trial regarding Internet access services.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The parties then proceeded to trial before the court on those two remaining questions. The city offered testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>by Kolb and Berrian to explain why the city had attempted to collect registration and license fees from Comcast but not other ISPs. Kolb explained that the city was not interested in \u201cthings like modems, which merely translate analog to digital,\u201d but rather was \u201calways after the physical lines that existed in the city of Eugene and in the radio communications that were located in the city of Eugene that carried this traffic. * * * We were interested in the highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">Among its witnesses, Comcast called Dale Hatfield, an expert in the field of telecommunications. Hatfield explained that Internet access service is provided by using \u201ctransmission service,\u201d but that Internet access service is not <em>itself </em>transmission service. He used the analogy of train transportation. The \u201ctransmission facility,\u201d he testified, \u201cwould be the rail bed.\u201d The transmission service \u201cmight be the engine and flatbed cars,\u201d and the \u201cInternet packets would be those shipping containers that go onto the flatbed.\u201d According to Hatfield, Kolb\u2019s description, by way of related analogy, of what the city intended to tax \u2014 the highway\u2014 was separate and apart from the Internet access service that rides on top of the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">4. <em>The trial court reconsiders its ruling and changes course.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">After the parties put on their respective cases, Comcast asked the court to reconsider its summary judgment rulings in light of the development of the record at trial. Primarily, Comcast asked the court to reconsider its earlier ruling that cable modem services involved \u201ctransmission for hire\u201d under the ordinance. Comcast argued that the court had erred in relying on the ordinary meanings of \u201ctransmission\u201d and \u201cfor hire,\u201d because \u201ctransmission for hire\u201d is a term of art in the telecommunications industry, as demonstrated by Hatfield\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The trial court agreed with Comcast and, over the city\u2019s objection, reconsidered its earlier interpretation of the ordinance. This time, rather than look to the ordinary meanings of the terms \u201ctransmission\u201d and \u201cfor hire,\u201d the court looked to Hatfield\u2019s testimony and the meaning of \u201ctelecommunications\u201d under state and federal laws. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>ultimately \u201cadopt [ed] Mr. Hatfield\u2019s testimony and conclud[ed] that Internet access is not a transmission for hire in the telecommunications industry, and thus cable modem access is not subject to the Ordinance.\u201d The court further reasoned that \u201ctelecommunications\u201d should mean the same thing under the ordinance as it does under state and federal laws, notwithstanding the fact that those laws use language different from the ordinance. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-4\">\u201cThis Court is persuaded that telecommunications services in Eugene should be defined in the same way as the Oregon Legislature and Congress define telecommunications services. Although, Eugene\u2019s Ordinance defined telecommunications very broadly, this Court does not understand telecommunications to be different in Eugene than it is in the rest of the country. Thus, in Eugene, Comcast is not offering a \u2018transmission for hire\u2019 when it offers Internet access, but is offering the end product of data manipulation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Although the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding application of the ordinance was dispositive, the court nonetheless proceeded to address other issues to avoid the necessity of a remand after appeal. The court declined to reconsider its ruling that the license fee was not a tax under the ITFA, but did reconsider the legality of the registration fee under that statute, concluding that it was discriminatory and therefore barred by the ITFA. As for the two issues that had been set for trial, the court ruled that the registration fee had not been generally collected from Internet access providers before October 1, 1998, and was therefore barred by the ITFA for that reason as well. Additionally, the court concluded that, for purposes of the state and federal constitutions, \u201cComcast has demonstrated an intentional and systematic pattern of discrimination by the City because the City has not collected the registration or license fees on Internet access revenues of other providers that are subject to the Ordinance under the City\u2019s interpretation.\u201d The court then entered a judgment in Comcast\u2019s favor that incorporated the court\u2019s letter opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">5. <em>The city appeals; Comcast cross-assigns error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The city now appeals, advancing five assignments of error. Those assignments raise three general issues: whether the court erred in ruling that (1) the ordinance did not apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>to Comcast\u2019s cable modem services; (2) the registration fee is barred by the ITFA; and (3) the imposition of the registration and license fee violated Comcast\u2019s rights under Article I, section 32, of the Oregon Constitution or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Comcast defends the court\u2019s rulings and asserts cross-assignments of error in which it argues that the license fee is unenforceable for three additional reasons that the trial court rejected: (1) the license fee is barred by the ITFA; (2) the license fee is preempted by 47 USC \u00a7 542; and (3) the license fee is barred by ECC 3.410(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">A. <em>Are Cable Modem Services \u201cTelecommunications Services\u201d under the Ordinance ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">In its first assignment of error, the city challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling that cable modem services are not \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d within the meaning of the ordinance. In the city\u2019s view, the trial court was swayed by two sources \u2014 Hatfield\u2019s testimony and the definitions of \u201ctelecommunications\u201d under state and federal statutes\u2014 that have little to no bearing on the meaning of the city\u2019s ordinance. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Our aim in construing a local ordinance is the same as when construing a statute: to discern the intent of the body that promulgated the law. Thus, we follow the same method that we ordinarily employ to determine the meaning of a statute, examining the text, context, and helpful legislative history of the provision in dispute, and, if necessary, turning to maxims of construction. <em>See State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009) (setting out the method for statutory interpretation); <em>Lincoln Loan Co. v. City of Portland, </em>317 Or 192, 199, 855 P2d 151 (1993) (applying statutory construction template to a municipal ordinance); <em>Comcast of Oregon II, Inc. v. City of Eugene, </em>211 Or App 573, 584, 155 P3d 99 (2007), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>346 Or 238, 209 P3d 800 (2009) (examining the text of the Eugene City Code by the same method prescribed for statutory interpretation).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The starting point, then, is the text of the disputed provision, ECC 3.005, which sets forth the definition of \u201ctelecommunications services.\u201d That definition, once again, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">\u201cTelecommunications services. The transmission for hire, of information in electromagnetic frequency, electronic or optical form, including, but not limited to, voice, video, or data, whether or not the transmission medium is owned by the provider itself, and whether or not the transmission medium is wireline or wireless. Telecommunications service includes all forms of telephone services and voice, data and video transport, but does not include: (1) cable [television] service; (2) OVS service; (3) private communications system services; (4) over-the-air radio or television broadcasting to the public-at-large from facilities licensed by the Federal Communications Commission or any successor thereto; and (5) direct-to-home satellite service within the meaning of Section 602 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">The parties agree that we should focus on the first four words of the definition \u2014 \u201cthe transmission for hire\u201d\u2014 but from there, their approaches diverge. Whereas the city urges us to look at the plain meaning of those words, Comcast argues that the trial court correctly understood \u201ctransmission for hire\u201d as a term of art in the telecommunications industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Generally, when an enacting body like a city council has not defined a term used in its law, we assume that the body used words consistently with their ordinary meanings. <em>See Zimmerman v. Allstate Property and Casualty Ins., </em>354 Or 271, 279-80, 311 P3d 497 (2013) (describing that rule in the context of statutory interpretation). However, if \u201cthe term has acquired a specialized meaning in a particular industry or profession,\u201d we assume that the enacting body \u201cused the term consistently with that specialized meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280. Thus, the first question before us is whether \u201ctransmission for hire\u201d is a term that has acquired a specialized meaning in the telecommunications industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In support of its position that \u201ctransmission for hire\u201d is a term of art, Comcast points to the testimony of its expert, Hatfield. The trial court relied heavily on that testimony as well, stating that \u201cHatfield, an expert in the field <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>of telecommunications, <em>has testified to the industry definitions of \u2018transmission for </em>hire\u2019 <em>and telecommunications does not include cable modem service.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) But, as the city correctly observes, Comcast and the trial court read Hatfield\u2019s testimony for more than it is worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">Because it is central to the parties\u2019 argument, we quote much of Hatfield\u2019s testimony at length. Hatfield, who had decades of experience in the telecommunications industry, was initially called upon to testify concerning \u201chow providers of Internet access service utilize telecommunications facilities within the city of Eugene.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hatfield proceeded to explain that various ISPs \u2014 dial-up, cable modem, DSL, dedicated digital line, and wireless \u2014 use different types of transmission facilities, but each performs the same basic function: delivering information packets to and from the Internet. Hatfield prepared various diagrams, including Exhibit D42, which charted the delivery of those packets by different types of ISPs. For each type of access, the exhibit showed, from left to right, the computer and modem; the local transmission facility; the physical location of the Internet access provider\u2019s facilities (\u201cPoint of Presence\u201d); the dedicated high capacity transmission facility; and the Internet.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hatfield explained that Internet access can be broken into different \u201clayers\u201d or tiers. He used the analogy, to which we alluded above, of rail transportation: The transmission facility is like the rail bed and tracks; the transmission service is like an engine and flatbed cars; and the Internet packets are like shipping containers that ride on flatbed cars. Thus, he testified, \u201cthe Internet is a network that rides on top and takes advantage of these transmission facilities, and so there\u2019s high-capacity transmission facilities that you can get from any number of carriers,\u201d emphasizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>that \u201cthe Internet is something that rides on top of, that can use all types of different capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">After Hatfield testified, Kolb testified for the city. Kolb had prepared his own version of Exhibit D42, which highlighted the local transmission facilities and dedicated high-capacity transmission facilities that were depicted on that exhibit. Kolb testified that he highlighted \u201cthe telecommunications lines, be they physical lines like fiber or copper or coaxial or radio communications, that are located within the city of Eugene.\u201d When asked why he had excluded the \u201cso-called point-of-presence,\u201d he explained that the city was not interested \u201cin things like modems [located at the point-of-presence], which merely translate analog to digital,\u201d but that the city was \u201calways after the physical lines that existed in the city of Eugene and in the radio communications that were located in the city of Eugene that carried this traffic. * * * We were interested in the highway.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Comcast later re-called Hatfield to the stand, and he was asked about Kolb\u2019s diagram. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\u201cQ. [COMCAST\u2019S COUNSEL]: Now, sticking with Mr. Kolb\u2019s diagram, the services that Mr. Kolb indicates the City did intend to tax are the transmission services that are highlighted. <em>Now, in common industry parlance, are those what </em>\u2014 are <em>those transmission services traditionally known as telecommunications </em>services?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">\u201cA. [HATFIELD]: <em>Yes, they would be telecommunications services. </em>As I tried to explain yesterday, the Internet then rides upon \u2014 using that layered model, they ride upon those transmission facilities or services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">\u201cQ. <em>And once again, in common industry parlance, are those transmission services that are highlighted there on Mr. Kolb\u2019s diagram considered Internet access </em>service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">\u201cA. <em>No. </em>As I tried to-\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Stop, stop. You said transmission services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">\u201c[COMCAST\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: The diagram says transmission facilities. Is there any distinction to be made there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\">\u201c[HATFIELD]: As an engineer, I would make the distinction. The transmission facility is the actual physical electrical equipment that\u2019s used. But that can be used for lots of different services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Hatfield then offered further testimony on \u201ccommon industry parlance\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">\u201cQ. [COMCAST\u2019S COUNSEL]: So now, <em>in common industry parlance, </em>are those transmission services that you just discussed with the Judge and that are highlighted on Mr. Kolb\u2019s diagram there considered Internet access service?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">\u201cA. <em>No. As I was trying to say, the Internet access is just but one service that could use that transmission service </em>* * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Hatfield explained that Comcast does not offer separate, stand-alone transmission service between the customer\u2019s premises and Comcast\u2019s point-of-presence. Rather, as a result of the FCC\u2019s 2002 declaratory ruling described above, cable modem companies can \u201ccombine the telecommunications portion, if you will, with the Internet access portion <em>into a single offering\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) He later returned to the subject of Kolb\u2019s diagram, explaining that it did not actually highlight Internet access revenues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">\u201cQ. So you were here and you heard what Mr. Kolb testified to yesterday, that they only wanted to get \u2014 they only wanted to tax the transmission services that are highlighted there. But also implicit in his testimony is that they wanted to capture Internet access revenues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">\u201cNow, given what he\u2019s done there [with highlighting], does that make any sense? Are you taxing Internet service revenues there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">\u201cA. <em>No. When I heard *** the testimony, that was my reaction. It captures the telecom part but does not capture the </em>\u2014 does <em>not capture the Internet access part.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-14\">\u201cQ. Now, why is that? Can you explain why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u201cA. Well, for the reason \u2014 the reason that I just described. Without this link in here (indicating), you couldn\u2019t have packets moving back and forth across that network, going back to the layer sort of description and the analogies that I\u2019ve given here this afternoon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Based on the foregoing testimony, we conclude that, despite being asked about certain \u201cindustry parlance,\u201d Hatfield did not actually offer a technical or industry meaning of the terms used in the ordinance \u2014 \u201ctransmission for hire.\u201d Hatfield testified to the technical distinction in the telecommunications industry between transmission services and Internet access services and the effect of the FCC\u2019s ruling. The question for purposes of the ordinance, though, is not whether Internet access services are transmission services, or whether Comcast offers stand-alone transmission services. Rather, the question is whether Comcast\u2019s <em>cable modem services </em>are \u201ctransmission for hire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Hatfield did not testify that \u201ctransmission for hire\u201d or, for that matter, \u201ctransmission,\u201d is a term of art in the telecommunications industry. While \u201ctransmission services\u201d might be understood to be distinct from Internet access services, Hatfield also testified that transmission of data is a necessary component of Internet access, and that cable modem services are a combined offering that transmits data over telecommunications facilities. That is, unlike some other types of ISPs, when Comcast provides cable modem services, it provides Internet access services by <em>transmitting data, over its own cable lines, to and from the Internet. </em>Hatfield\u2019s testimony, which conveys the industry\u2019s understanding of the technical layers involved in providing Internet access, says nothing about whether the city, by using the phrase \u201ctransmission for hire,\u201d intended to capture revenue from a provider whose combined offering, like Comcast\u2019s cable modem services, necessarily includes the transmission of data to and from the Internet over its own transmission facilities.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the court erred in treating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>\u201ctransmission for hire\u201d as a term of art based on Hatfield\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">The trial court, however, offered an alternative reason for looking beyond the ordinary meaning of \u201ctransmission for hire.\u201d The court, on reconsideration, was \u201cpersuaded to consider federal legal definitions and interpretations\u201d of the Federal Telecommunications Act, which had excluded cable modem services from the definition of \u201ctelecommunications services.\u201d The court observed that the city\u2019s ordinance was adopted with knowledge, and in consideration, of the Act, and ruled that there was \u201cno reason to define cable modem access as a transmission in Eugene, when federal law has determined that cable modem access is not a separate transmission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">There are, as the city identifies, two fundamental problems with that approach. First, as noted before, timing matters. The classification of cable modem services under the Act would provide relevant context for interpreting the city\u2019s ordinance only if the city could have known about it at the time the ordinance was adopted. <em>See Holcomb v. Sunderland, </em>321 Or 99, 105, 894 P2d 457 (1995) (proper inquiry in interpreting a law focuses on what the legislature intended at the time of enactment). Although the Act itself predated the city\u2019s ordinance, it was the FCC\u2019s interpretation of that Act \u2014 and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brand X, </em>affirming the FCC\u2019s ruling \u2014 that the trial court ultimately found persuasive regarding the meaning of the city\u2019s ordinance. The FCC\u2019s interpretation of the Act <em>vis-a-vis </em>cable modem services, which it expressed in the declaratory ruling, was not issued until 2002, five years after the city adopted its ordinance. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brand X </em>did not issue until three years after that. Thus, the city council could not have been aware of either interpretation when crafting its own ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Second, and most important, the Act defines \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d with language that is materially different from the definition in the city\u2019s ordinance. The Act defines \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d as \u201cthe offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public, or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public, regardless of the facilities used.\u201d 47 USC \u00a7 153(53). It then defines \u201ctelecommunications\u201d as \u201cthe transmission, between or among points specified by the user, of information of the user\u2019s choosing, <em>without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received.\u201d </em>47 USC \u00a7 153(50) (emphasis added). The ordinance, by contrast, makes no reference to whether there is change in the form or content of the information that is sent. Rather, as set out more fully above, 263 Or App at 128, the ordinance defines \u201ctelecommunications\u201d broadly as \u201c[t]he transmission for hire, of information in electromagnetic frequency, electronic or optical form, including, but not limited to, voice, video, or data, whether or not the transmission medium is owned by the provider itself, and whether or not the transmission medium is wireline or wireless.\u201d If anything, the fact that Eugene\u2019s city council was aware of (and referred to) the Telecommunications Act but employed its own definition of \u201ctelecommunications services,\u201d suggests that the city council intended a different meaning for its ordinance. <em>E.g., Schmitt v. State Tax Com., </em>234 Or 455, 464, 383 P2d 97 (1963) (inferring that differences between state and federal statutes represented a purposeful departure from federal law where \u201c[t] he most reasonable interpretation is that the drafters of the [state] act were familiar with the use of the phrase in the federal act * * * [and] were also familiar with the importance the federal government had placed on that phrase\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Indeed, it was language that appears in the Telecommunications Act \u2014 and not in the city\u2019s ordinance\u2014 that ultimately drove the FCC\u2019s conclusion that cable modem services are not \u201ctelecommunications services.\u201d As relevant here, the Act creates two categories of regulated entities: telecommunications carriers and information-service providers. Telecommunications carriers are regulated as common carriers, which requires them to charge just and reasonable, nondiscriminatory rates, 47 USC \u00a7\u00a7 201-209, design <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>their systems so that other carriers can interconnect with their networks, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 251(a)(1), and contribute to the federal \u201cuniversal service\u201d fund, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 254(d). Information-service providers, on the other hand, are not subject to those common-carrier regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">In April 1998, the FCC issued a report to Congress regarding implementation of the Act. In that report (the \u201cUniversal Service Report\u201d), the FCC addressed the definitions of \u201ctelecommunications service,\u201d \u201ctelecommunications,\u201d and \u201cinformation service\u201d as they relate to Internet access. <em>In the Matter of Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, </em>13 FCC Red 11501 (1998). At that time, Internet access services were typically provided through a \u201cdial up\u201d connection that involved transmission of information over local telephone lines. In the Universal Service Report, the FCC assumed that ISPs generally are separate from the telecommunications companies that are transmitting the data across telephone lines, but suggested that a different model might require a different approach. The report states, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">\u201c[W]e clarify that the provision of transmission capacity to Internet access providers and Internet backbone providers is appropriately viewed as \u2018telecommunications service\u2019 or \u2018telecommunications\u2019 rather than \u2018information service,\u2019 and that the provision of such transmission should also generate contribution to universal service support mechanisms. Thus, we find, in general, that continued growth in the information services industry will buttress, not hinder, universal service. <em>In those cases where an Internet service provider owns transmission facilities, and engages in data transport over those facilities in order to provide an information service, we do not currently require it to contribute to universal service mechanisms. We believe it is appropriate to reexamine that result, as one could argue that in such a case that the Internet service provider is furnishing raw transmission capacity to itself. </em>We recognize, however, that there are significant operational difficulties associated with determining the amount of such an Internet service provider\u2019s revenues to be assessed for universal service purposes and with enforcing such requirements. We intend to consider these issues in an upcoming proceeding. <em>Finally, we find that Internet service providers generally do not provide </em>telecommunications.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>13 FCC Red at 11508-59 (emphasis added). With regard to the distinction between telecommunications and information services, the report further states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-4\">\u201cThe provision of Internet access service involves data transport elements: an Internet access provider must enable the movement of information between customers\u2019 own computers and the distant computers with which those customers seek to interact. But the provision of Internet access service crucially involves information-processing elements as well; it offers end users information-service capabilities inextricably intertwined with data transport. As such, we conclude that it is appropriately classed as an \u2018information service.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 11539-40. Thus, shortly after the city\u2019s adoption of its telecommunications ordinance in 1997, the FCC in 1998 had indicated that ISPs generally provide information services rather than telecommunications, but also identified the need to reexamine that approach in \u201ca case that the Internet service provider is furnishing raw transmission capacity to itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11508.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Two years later, in <em>AT&amp;T Corp. v. City of Portland, </em>216 F3d 871 (9th Cir 2000), the Ninth Circuit confronted the question raised but not definitively answered in the Universal Service Report: how to deal with Internet service providers who own their own transmission facilities. The court ruled that AT&amp;T\u2019s cable modem service, unlike a \u201cdial up\u201d service, was providing \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">\u201cLike other ISPs, @Home [AT&amp;T\u2019s service] consists of two elements: a \u2018pipeline\u2019 (cable broadband instead of telephone lines), and the Internet service transmitted through that pipeline. However, unlike other ISPs, @Home controls all of the transmission facilities between its subscribers and the Internet. To the extent @Home is a conventional ISP, its activities are that of an information service. <em>However, to the extent that @Home provides its subscribers Internet transmission over its cable broadband facility, it is providing a telecommunications service as defined in the Communications Act.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">216 F3d at 878 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>In the wake of the decision in <em>AT&amp;T Corp. </em>(and conflicting decisions in other jurisdictions<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>), the FCC initiated a rulemaking proceeding to address whether broadband Internet services provided by cable companies should be classified as \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d or as \u201cinformation services\u201d under the Act. In 2002, the FCC issued its declaratory ruling stating that cable modem services are <em>not </em>\u201ctelecommunications services\u201d under the Act. 17 FCC Red 4798.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Various parties petitioned for judicial review of the declaratory ruling, and the Ninth Circuit was selected as the venue for the challenge. Relying on the principle of <em>stare decisis, </em>the court held that its earlier conclusion in <em>AT&amp;T Corp. </em>was controlling with regard to whether cable modem services were part \u201ctelecommunications service,\u201d and it vacated the FCC\u2019s ruling and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari </em>and, in <em>Brand X, </em>reversed the Ninth Circuit. Although the Supreme Court affirmed the FCC\u2019s ruling that cable modem services are not \u201ctelecommunications services,\u201d the reasoning in <em>Brand X </em>actually underscores the differences between the Act and the city\u2019s ordinance. The Court ultimately upheld the FCC\u2019s ruling not based on the well understood meaning of the terms \u201ctelecommunications\u201d or \u201ctelecommunications services,\u201d but on the basis of <em>Chevron </em>deference \u2014 that is, the principle that federal courts must accept an implementing agency\u2019s plausible construction of a statute, \u201ceven if the agency\u2019s reading differs from what the court believes is the best statutory interpretation.\u201d 545 US at 980. In explaining why the FCC\u2019s construction of \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d was a reasonable one, the Court focused not on whether cable modem services were telecommunications; indeed, the FCC \u201cconceded that, like all information-service providers, cable companies use \u2018telecommunications\u2019 to provide consumers with Internet service; cable companies provide such service via the high-speed wire that transmits signals to and from an end user\u2019s computer.\u201d 545 US at 988. Rather, the case turned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>on whether cable modem services providers are \u201coffering\u201d those underlying telecommunications within the meaning of the Act. <em>See </em>47 USC \u00a7 153(53) (defining \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d as the \u201coffering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public, or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public, regardless of the facilities used\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The Court held that, consistent with the FCC\u2019s conclusion, \u201c\u2018offering\u2019 can reasonably be read to mean a \u2018standalone\u2019 offering of telecommunications, <em>i.e., </em>an offered service that, from the user\u2019s perspective, transmits messages unadulterated by computer processing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 989. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-5\">\u201cThe question, then, is whether the transmission component of cable modem service is sufficiently integrated with the finished service <em>to make it reasonable to describe the two as a single, integrated offering. See ibid. </em>We think that they are sufficiently integrated, because \u2018[a] consumer uses the high-speed wire always in connection with the information-processing capabilities provided by Internet access, and because the transmission is a necessary component of Internet access.\u2019 <em>Supra, </em>at 988. In the telecommunications context, <em>it is at least reasonable to describe companies as not \u2018offering\u2019 to consumers each discrete input that is necessary to providing, and is always used in connection with, a finished service. </em>* * * What cable companies providing cable modem service and telephone companies providing telephone service \u2018offer\u2019 is Internet service and telephone service respectively \u2014 the finished services, though they do so using (or \u2018via\u2019) the discrete components composing the end product, including data transmission. Such functionally integrated components need not be described as distinct \u2018offerings.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 990-91 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">What that regulatory history demonstrates is that <em>Brand X </em>and the FCC\u2019s declaratory ruling not only postdated the adoption of the city\u2019s ordinance, but they turned on ambiguous language in the Act that appears nowhere in the city\u2019s ordinance. For that reason, we conclude that the trial court erred when, on reconsideration, it relied on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Act, the FCC\u2019s declaratory ruling, and <em>Brand X </em>to interpret the city\u2019s ordinance.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">In our view, the trial court\u2019s original interpretation of the ordinance at the summary judgment stage was the correct one. There was no basis to depart from the ordinary meaning of the terms used in the ordinance. The word \u201ctransmission,\u201d as used in this context, means \u201can act, process, or instance of transmitting.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2429 (unabridged ed 2002). \u201cTransmit,\u201d in turn, means to \u201csend out a signal either by radio waves or over a wire line.\u201d <em>Id. </em>There is no dispute that Comcast transmits data when it provides cable modem services.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Furthermore, Comcast transmits data \u201cfor hire\u201d as part of its cable modem services, under the common meaning of those words. We have observed that, \u201c[i]n common usage, \u2018for hire\u2019 means \u2018available or offered for rent.\u2019 <em>Webster\u2019s </em>* * * at 892; <em>see also id. </em>at 1072 (defining \u2018hire\u2019 and describing the phrase \u2018for hire\u2019 to mean \u2018available for use or service in return for payment\u2019).\u201d <em>Beaver Creek Coop. Telephone Co. v. PUC (A109890), </em>182 Or App 559, 571, 50 P3d 1231 (2002). In <em>Beaver Creek Coop. Telephone Co., </em>we explained that, \u201cas a matter of common usage, a cooperative is providing telecommunication service on a \u2018for-hire basis\u2019 if it provides those services in exchange for payment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Comcast provides its cable modem services, necessarily including transmission of electronic information, in exchange for subscriber fees. Thus, common usage suggests that Comcast\u2019s cable modem services are \u201ctransmission for hire\u201d of electronic data within the ordinary meaning of those words.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The surrounding text provides additional support for a broader, plain-meaning approach to the term \u201ctransmission for hire.\u201d The term \u201ctransmission for hire\u201d appears in the first sentence of the definition of \u201c[t]elecommunications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>services\u201d; the second sentence of the definition provides that \u201c [t] elecommunications service includes <em>all forms </em>of telephone services and voice, data and video transport\u201d and then enumerates specific exceptions to that definition. (Emphasis added.) Thus, the structure of the definition of \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d suggests that \u201ctransmission for hire\u201d includes all forms of data transport \u2014 including transport as part of a combined offering \u2014 unless specifically excluded from the definition.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">The broader context of the ordinance likewise suggests that the city intended the ordinance to apply to any transmission of data for which the owner of the transmission facility is being paid. Section 6 of the ordinance adopts attached findings \u201cin support of this Ordinance.\u201d Those findings include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">\u201c9. The City and its citizens are entitled to a fair return on their investment in the public right-of-way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201c10. The compensation required by this ordinance for use of the rights-of-way is authorized by state statute and allowed by federal statute. It compensates the City and its citizens for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">\u201c\"'accelerated deterioration of streets;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">\u201c\"'the use of a publicly-funded asset by private commercial enterprises;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">\u201c\"'increased complexity of the City\u2019s public works projects resulting from the presence of telecommunications facilities in the right-of-way;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">\u201c\"'inconvenience to the public from occupation of the streets by construction crews and equipment; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">\u201c\"'aesthetic damage to the rights-of-way.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-12\">In light of the purpose of the ordinance to compensate the public for private commercial use of the city\u2019s rights-of-way, we see no basis for treating \u201ctransmission for hire\u201d more narrowly simply because the operator is providing combined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>services; the operator is still using the public right-of-way for its private benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Text and context notwithstanding, Comcast urges us to consider a recurring feature of the adoption history of the amendment \u2014 namely, assurances from the city that the ordinance was not intended to cover ISPs. Although Kolb and others repeatedly stated that the ordinance did not affect ISPs, the statements must be considered in historical context. Cable modem services did not exist in Eugene at that time, and Internet access was generally provided by traditional \u201cdial-ups,\u201d whereby the transmission facilities were not owned by the ISP. Viewed in light of the prevalent technology in Eugene when the city drafted its ordinance, contemporaneous statements about ISPs provide little evidence that the city council intended to narrow the ordinary meaning of \u201ctransmission for hire\u201d in a way that would exclude combined offerings of data transport and Internet access services.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Thus, we conclude that the best evidence of the city\u2019s intent is the text of the ordinance itself. In its summary judgment ruling, the trial court correctly interpreted the ordinance to apply, based on the plain meaning of the words, to Comcast\u2019s cable modem services. It was error for the trial court, on reconsideration, to rule otherwise based on Hatfield\u2019s testimony and the FCC\u2019s interpretation of the Telecommunications Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">B. <em>Does the ITFA Bar the Application of the Ordinance ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Throughout the litigation, Comcast has argued that, even if its cable modem services are \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d under the city\u2019s ordinance, the ITFA precludes the city from imposing the license and registration fees on Internet services revenue. The trial court agreed in part with Comcast, concluding that the registration fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>were precluded but that the license fees were not a tax for purposes of the ITFA. We address each of those rulings in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">1. <em>Application of the ITFA to the license fee</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The ITFA, which is summarized above, imposes a moratorium on certain state and local taxes related to the Internet. Section 1101(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">\u201cMoratorium. \u2014 No State or political subdivision thereof shall impose any of the following taxes during the period beginning on October 1, 1998, and ending 3 years after the date of the enactment of this Act\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">\u201c(1) taxes on Internet access, unless such tax was generally imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, 1998; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">\u201c(2) multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The term \u201ctax\u201d is defined in the ITFA to include \u201cany charge imposed by any governmental entity for the purpose of generating revenues for governmental purposes, and is <em>not a fee imposed for a specific privilege, service, or benefit </em>conferred.\u201d ITFA \u00a7 1104(8)(i) (emphasis added). The trial court reasoned that the license fee \u2014 that is, the seven-percent fee that must be paid \u201cas compensation for use of right-of-way,\u201d ECC 3.415(2) \u2014 is a fee imposed for a specific benefit and therefore not a \u201ctax\u201d for purposes of the ITFA. We agree with the trial court\u2019s reasoning and reject Comcast\u2019s cross-assignment of error on that issue without further discussion. The ITFA does not bar the city\u2019s license fee, which is a fee imposed in exchange for using the city\u2019s right-of-way to provide a telecommunications service.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">2. <em>Application of the ITFA to the registration fee</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">The two-percent registration fee, however, is a tax under the ITFA. (Indeed, throughout its brief, the city refers to the registration fee as the \u201cbusiness tax.\u201d) The trial court ruled that the tax is barred by the ITFA because it (1) is \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d and (2) even if not discriminatory, is a tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>on Internet access that had not been generally imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, 1998. We agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling in that latter respect and therefore do not address whether the tax is also discriminatory under the ITFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">The ITFA expressly defines when a tax on Internet access has been \u201cgenerally imposed and actually enforced.\u201d Section 1101(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">\u201c* * * For purposes of this section, a tax has been generally imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, 1998, if, before that date, the tax was authorized by statute and either\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">\u201c(1) a provider of Internet access services had a reasonable opportunity to know by virtue of a rule or other public proclamation made by the appropriate administrative agency of the State or political subdivision thereof, that such agency has interpreted and applied such tax to Internet access services; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-7\">\u201c(2) a State or political subdivision thereof generally collected such tax on charges for Internet access.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">In ruling on the parties\u2019 summary judgment motions, the trial court concluded that the city had \u201cno rule interpreting and applying the Ordinance to apply to Internet access services,\u201d and that paragraph (1) of the statute was therefore inapplicable. The court concluded that questions of fact precluded summary judgment with regard to paragraph (2), so the parties proceeded to trial on whether the city had \u201cgenerally collected\u201d taxes for Internet access. Following trial, the court ruled that the city had failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that it generally collected taxes for Internet access.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">On appeal, the city confines its argument to paragraph (1) of the statute, arguing that Comcast had a \u201creasonable opportunity to know\u201d of the taxes on its cable modem services by virtue of the ordinance itself, as well as the rules promulgated under the ordinance. According to the city,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\">\u201c [n] ot only did the Ordinance clearly proclaim that it covers all \u2018transmission for hire, of information * * * including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>*** voice, video or data *** wireline or wireless,\u2019 and \u2018all forms of * * * voice, data and video transport,\u2019 but the City promulgated rules under the Ordinance that reiterated its definitions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The city understates the \u201cpublic proclamation\u201d that the ITFA requires. It is not enough that the language of its ordinance, or even its rules, might be broad enough to encompass Internet access services. Rather, under the ITFA, a \u201crule or public proclamation\u201d must give the provider of Internet access a reasonable opportunity to know that the \u201cagency <em>has interpreted and applied such tax to Internet access services\u201d </em>ITFA \u00a7 1101(d)(1) (emphasis added). The city cannot point to any public proclamation that, as of October 1, 1998, provided notice that the city \u201cinterpreted and applied\u201d its tax to Internet access services.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">In fact, as we explained earlier when discussing the legislative history of the ordinance, the city repeatedly said the opposite: that the ordinance did not apply to Internet access services. At a public hearing on the ordinance, Kolb stated that Internet service providers would not be affected by the proposed fees. The city\u2019s \u201cwhite paper,\u201d which it generated shortly after the ordinance was enacted, stated in its first paragraph that \u201cInternet and radio/television broadcasting are <em>not </em>applicable.\u201d Although we did not find those statements to be helpful indicators of the city\u2019s legislative intent with respect to Comcast\u2019s cable modem services, a type of Internet access services that did not exist in Eugene when the ordinance was enacted, <em>see </em>263 Or App at 141, the city\u2019s actions and pronouncements surrounding the adoption of the ordinance are flatly inconsistent with its suggestion that it had \u201cinterpreted and applied\u201d its registration fee to Internet access services, let alone publicly communicated that to Internet access services providers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>For that reason, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s alternative ruling regarding the registration fee was correct. The fee is a tax on Internet access that was not generally imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, 1998. Accordingly, the tax is barred by the ITFA.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">C. <em>Does the City\u2019s Attempt to Collect the License Fee Discriminate against Comcast in Violation of Article I, Section 32, of the Oregon Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Having concluded that the registration fee is barred, we turn to the question whether the city has selectively enforced the license fee in violation of state and federal constitutional protections. Under Article I, section 32, \u201call taxation shall be uniform on the same class of subjects within the territorial limits of the authority levying the tax.\u201d Thus, \u201c[t]he taxing authorities may not single out one taxpayer for discriminatory, or selective, enforcement of a tax law that should apply equally to all similarly situated taxpayers.\u201d <em>Penn Phillips Lands v. Tax Com., </em>247 Or 380, 385-86, 430 P2d 349 (1967). The Equal Protection Clause provides similar protection, making it unconstitutional for a state to \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Oregon courts have employed the same analysis under Article I, section 32, and the Equal Protection Clause. <em>See Kane v. Tri-Co. Metro. Transp. Dist., 65 </em>Or App 55, 59, 670 P2d 178 (1983), <em>rev den, </em>296 Or 411 (1984) (citing, among other cases, <em>Jarvill v. City of Eugene, </em>289 Or 157, 182-84, 613 P2d 1 (1980)).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">To prove a violation of Article I, section 32, a taxpayer must \u201cdemonstrate an intentional and systematic pattern of discrimination.\u201d <em>Pacificorp Power Marketing v. Dept. of Rev., </em>340 Or 204, 219, 131 P3d 725 (2006). Proof of an error in judgment on the part of the taxing authority is not sufficient to show intentional discrimination; rather, \u201c[t]he required element has been characterized as \u2018something that amounts to an intention, or the equivalent of fraudulent purpose, to disregard the fundamental principle of uniformity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Freightliner Corp. v. Dept. of Rev., </em>275 Or 13, 20, 549 P2d 662 (1976) (quoting <em>Rowley v. Chicago &amp; N.W. Ry., </em>293 US 102, 111, 55 S Ct 55, 79 L Ed 222 (1934)).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The trial court concluded that, although the license fee was not a tax for purposes of the ITFA, it is a tax for purposes of state and federal constitutional protections. The court then concluded that the city\u2019s enforcement of the tax violated Article I, section 32, and the Equal Protection Clause because \u201cit attempts to exact a fee only from Comcast and not from similarly-situated providers of Internet access service within its class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">On appeal, the city argues that the trial court looked to the wrong class of providers when evaluating the city\u2019s enforcement of the license fee. According to the city, it did not enforce the license fee against dial-up ISPs because those providers do not \u201cown or control, much less locate, facilities in the City\u2019s rights-of-way.\u201d When compared to the appropriate class \u2014 the registered providers who were transmitting data with telecommunications facilities in the city\u2019s rights-of-way \u2014 Comcast proved shortcomings in the city\u2019s collection of the license fee as to only two providers, Qwest Corporation and ELI, which the city contends is insufficient to establish an intentional and systematic pattern of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Comcast responds that the city did not collect taxes from at least 34 Internet access service providers who were also subject to the license fee, because even those who do not locate facilities in the city\u2019s right-of-way are subject to the license fee as \u201cresellers\u201d of telecommunications services. ECC 3.410(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\u201cSo long as it registers with the city as required by section 3.405 <em>and pays the registration and license fees required by section 3.415, </em>a reseller may use another person\u2019s facilities to engage in telecommunications activities in the right-of-way without obtaining a license, providing the reseller does not, either itself or through an affiliate, own or lease, control or manage any facilities in the right-of-way and is not involved in construction or repair of facilities in the right-of-way. For purposes of calculating the registration and license fees to be paid by a reseller, the amount of compensation paid by the reseller to the owner or manager of facilities in the right-of-way for the services it resells shall be deducted from the reseller\u2019s gross revenues before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>applying the percentage rates described in section 3.415(1) and (2).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">(Emphasis added.) The ordinance defines a \u201creseller\u201d as \u201c[a]ny person that provides telecommunications services using a telecommunications facility <em>for which service a separate charge is made, </em>where that person does not own, lease, control or manage the telecommunications facility used to provide the service.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Comcast reasons that \u201cthere is undisputed evidence that dial-up ISPs do pay \u2018separate charges\u2019 for telecommunications facilities\u201d and, therefore, \u201call of the [Internet access service] providers the City calls \u2018non-facilities-based\u2019 qualify as resellers and owe license fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The city replies that Comcast misunderstands the meaning of \u201creseller,\u201d and that the \u201cseparate charge\u201d for services refers to a separate charge <em>made by the reseller, </em>not a separate charge <em>imposed on the reseller. </em>We agree with the city. As a matter of text and context, the phrase \u201cfor which service a separate charge is made\u201d refers to a separate charge by the reseller. Textually, \u201cfor which service\u201d plainly refers back to the telecommunications services provided by the reseller. Indeed, it is not the original purchase but rather the separate charge to a customer \u2014 the second sale \u2014 that makes a person a reseller. As a matter of context, ECC 3.410(4) refers to payments made by a reseller as \u201cthe amount of compensation paid by the reseller to the owner or manager of facilities\u201d rather than a \u201ccharge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">We further agree with the city that Comcast, who has the burden of demonstrating intentional discrimination, <em>Freightliner Corp., </em>275 Or at 19, failed to prove that dial-up ISPs separately charged their customers for transmission services over the city\u2019s right-of-way and therefore owed the license fee as \u201cresellers.\u201d As we understand Comcast\u2019s argument, that leaves only two providers \u2014 ELI and Qwest Corporation \u2014 who provided Internet access services through their own facilities within the city\u2019s right-of-way and from whom the city did not seek the license fee. The parties did not extensively brief the constitutional issue as it applies to this small class of relevant taxpayers. The city asserts that Comcast failed to establish anything beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>short-term clerical error, subsequently corrected. Comcast, for its part, argues that \u201c [t]here is no evidence to support\u201d the city\u2019s claim of mere mistake and that, in any event, \u201cComcast was not required to prove that the city acted in bad faith or with animus toward Comcast.\u201d Comcast, then, appears to misperceive both who has the burden to produce evidence, and what that evidence must demonstrate. As noted, to prove a violation of Article I, section 32, or the Equal Protection Clause, Comcast has the burden, and that burden requires it to prove \u201can intentional and systematic pattern of discrimination,\u201d <em>Pacificorp Power Marketing, </em>304 Or at 219, demonstrating \u201csomething that amounts to an intention, or the equivalent of fraudulent purpose, to disregard the fundamental principle of uniformity,\u201d as opposed to a mere error in judgment, <em>Freightliner Corp., </em>275 Or at 20 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Thus, the fact that there is no evidence to support the city\u2019s claim of accident is irrelevant; the city had no obligation to produce such evidence. The relevant question is whether Comcast produced any evidence that the city\u2019s taxing decision amounted to an intentional and systematic pattern of discrimination or something akin to fraudulent purpose. Comcast\u2019s brief does not cite any evidence to that effect. Thus, we hold that the trial court erred in concluding that the city\u2019s efforts to enforce the license fee violate Article I, section 32, and the Equal Protection Clause.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">In summary, we hold that the trial court erred when, on reconsideration, it interpreted the term \u201ctransmission for hire\u201d in the city\u2019s ordinance as a term of art in the telecommunications industry; under the plain meaning of the words used in the ordinance, Comcast\u2019s cable modem service is the transmission for hire of data, thereby subjecting Comcast to the registration fee and license fee. However, the trial court correctly ruled that the ITFA bars enforcement of the registration fee because that fee is a tax on Internet access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>that was not generally imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, 1998. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment as to the registration fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">The trial court correctly ruled that the license fee is not a tax under the ITFA, but erred in concluding that the city\u2019s enforcement of the license fee was unconstitutional under Article I, section 32, and the Equal Protection Clause. Comcast\u2019s proof was not, on this record, enough to demonstrate the \u201cintentional and systematic pattern of discrimination\u201d that is necessary under those constitutional provisions. Accordingly, we reverse and remand the judgment in regard to the city\u2019s efforts to collect the license fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Reversed in part and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b138-7\"> In addition to making explicit factual findings, the trial court also adopted a set of stipulated findings that the parties submitted jointly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\"> The franchise was granted to Comcast\u2019s predecessor in interest, TCI Cablevision of Oregon, Inc. (TCI). TCI merged with AT&amp;T in 1998, creating AT&amp;T Broadband, and TCI\u2019s rights under the franchise were assigned to AT&amp;T Broadband, which later assigned its rights under the franchise to Comcast. To avoid unnecessary confusion, we generally do not distinguish in this case between Comcast and its predecessors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b139-9\"> As a result of amendments over the years, many provisions in the Act have been renumbered. Por ease of reference, we use the numbering in the current version of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b141-9\"> Kolb reviewed proposed language and determined that no amendments were necessary. At trial, he testified that, to the best of his recollection, he concluded that no clarification was necessary because the ISPs did not operate telecommunications facilities in the city.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b149-5\"> First, Comcast\u2019s counsel asked Hatfield to testify about \u201cany specific expert opinions regarding the issues in this ease[.]\u201d After an objection from the city, Comcast\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cYour honor, these are not opinions on the law. These are opinions on facts <em>on how Internet access is provided in the city of Eugene? </em>(Emphasis added.) After the court questioned whether that would be of any assistance to it, Comcast\u2019s counsel assured the court that Hatfield would be describing \u201chow providers of Internet access service utilize telecommunications facilities within the city of Eugene.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\"> In the case of the dedicated digital line, there are high capacity transmission facilities on both sides of the point-of-presence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b150-12\"> In addition to his railroad analogy, Hatfield had likened the \u201ctransport layer\u201d of communications to a highway.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b152-7\"> To the extent that Comcast suggests that \u201ctelecommunications services,\u201d as opposed to \u201ctransmission for hire,\u201d is a term of art, we reject the contention. We will not give words their industry (or common) meaning when those words are specifically defined in the law itself, as is the case with \u201ctelecommunications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>services.\u201d Moreover, as we later discuss, the definitions of \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d in other contexts provide little help in interpreting the language of the ordinance, which differs significantly from those other definitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\"> Because we agree with the city that Hatfield did not actually testify that \u201ctransmission for hire\u201d is a term of art, we need not resolve the parties\u2019 dispute as to whether expert testimony is a permissible way to establish the meaning of a term of art.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b157-6\"> <em>See In re Inquiry Concerning High-Speed Access to the Internet Over Cable and Other Facilities, </em>15 FCC Red 19287, 19292-93 (2000) (describing inconsistent judicial decisions).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b159-7\"> The trial court also looked to public policy, as demonstrated by the ITFA, and to Oregon\u2019s telecommunications laws, which use the same definitions for \u201ctelecommunications\u201d and \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d as the federal Telecommunications Act. <em>See </em>ORS 759.005(8) (defining \u201ctelecommunications services\u201d identically to the Telecommunications Act); ORS 759.005(7) (defining \u201ctelecommunications\u201d identically to the Telecommunications Act). Neither the ITFA nor Oregon\u2019s telecommunications laws had been enacted at the time that the city adopted its ordinance, nor do they use language similar to the city\u2019s ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b160-13\"> At oral argument, Comcast urged us to consider the \u201creseller\u201d provisions of the ordinance as context that supports its interpretation of \u201ctransmission for hire.\u201d We are not persuaded by that argument and, as we will discuss later in this opinion, 263 Or App at 147, we disagree with Comcast\u2019s understanding of the term \u201creseller\u201d as defined in the ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\"> The trial court discounted the differences between dial-up Internet access and cable modem service, reasoning that \u201cjust because the Internet has evolved, it does not mean that the City can suddenly interpret the Ordinance to include a new type of service. Clearly the intent behind the Ordinance was not to tax Internet access.\u201d The question, in our view, is not whether the Internet has evolved, but <em>how </em>it has evolved. In this case, the technology has evolved such that Comcast is providing Internet access services by transmitting data over its own telecommunications facilities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b162-12\"> The moratorium was initially set to expire in 2001, but the act has been amended and the moratorium extended \u2014 most recently, until November 2014.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b164-6\"> The city also argues that Comcast\u2019s predecessor, TCI, had actual notice that the tax would apply to cable modem services, as demonstrated by a comment that TCI made in response to the rules promulgated by the city manager. Suffice it to say that the comment, which mentions the potential for dual-use technologies, \u201cincluding voice, internet, and data transfer,\u201d does not demonstrate actual notice that the city intended to apply the registration fee to cable modem services, which were not being offered in Eugene at that time and are not referenced anywhere in the city\u2019s response to the comment or the rules themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\"> In cross-assignments of error, Comcast advances two additional alternative bases for upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding the license fees, one based on a federal statute, 47 USC section 542(b), and the other based on a provision of the ordinance, ECC 3.410(6). We reject those arguments without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
