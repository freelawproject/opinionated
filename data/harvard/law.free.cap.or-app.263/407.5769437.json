J.</author>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Defendant appeals from a judgment of conviction for robbery in the first degree, ORS 164.415, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court erred by imposing a departure sentence because defendant did not execute a written waiver of his right to have the alleged enhancement factors tried to a jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ORS 136.770; ORS 136.773; Or Const, Art I, \u00a7 11. As amplified below, (1) although the trial court\u2019s noncompliance with ORS 136.770 and ORS 136.773 constituted \u201cplain error,\u201d we decline to exercise our discretion to remedy that statutory error; and (2) the trial court\u2019s purported noncompliance with Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution was not plain error in that the applicability of that provision in these circumstances is \u201creasonably in dispute.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The material facts are procedural and undisputed. Defendant was charged with robbery in the first degree, ORS 164.415. Defendant subsequently waived counsel and, in the ensuing jury trial, represented himself, with a court-appointed attorney acting as his legal advisor. The state alleged that the following aggravating facts supported a departure sentence: (1) defendant was on supervision at the time of the robbery, (2) prior sanctions had failed to deter defendant from criminal activity, (3) defendant had demonstrated disregard for the laws and rules, and (4) incarceration is necessary for public safety. <em>See </em>OAR 213-008-0002 (providing a \u201cnonexclusive list of mitigating and aggravating factors [that] may be considered in determining whether substantial and compelling reasons for a departure exist\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">On the first day of trial, defendant addressed the court regarding the enhancement factors as follows: \u201cYour Honor, as far as the <em>Blakely </em>factors, you can find the evidence for that. I don\u2019t need the jury to do it.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>responded that it would await the jury\u2019s verdict before reaching sentencing issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">After the case was submitted to the jury, and during deliberation, defendant\u2019s legal advisor informed the trial court that, \u201c[defendant], if he\u2019s found guilty, would waive the jury trying the <em>Blakely </em>factors, and have [the court] reach the decision.\u201d The court then asked defendant whether that was, in fact, what he wanted, and defendant responded, \u201cI\u2019m fine with that.\u201d The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. You understand you have a right to have a jury make a determination about\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Yeah, I understand my right, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. You can do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: You\u2019re going to give that up? Okay. I mean, I think all they\u2019ve alleged is that you were on some form of supervision at the time of the crime, that prior sanctions have failed to deter your criminal activity, [that you have] demonstrated disregard for the laws and rules, and [that] incarceration is necessary for the safety of the public. Those are the only things that I would deal with. And you have a right for a jury to make a determination beyond a reasonable doubt on any one or all of those.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-8\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: I\u2019m okay with you doing it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: You [are] going to give those up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-10\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Yep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: <em>Okay. Do we feel that has to he executed in </em>writing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-12\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: <em>I would </em>\u2014 I <em>don\u2019t think so. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: *** Okay. And [defendant,] you\u2019ve talked to [your legal advisor] about this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: I mean, I know we had the prior case that you were on probation for at the time [of the crime], so\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: I was on parole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: And on parole, too, I guess. Yeah, I mean, I revoked your probation on the other matter, because he had 60 days using stuff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: I think that was an open case, Your Honor. He was on \u2014 the supervision, I believe, was just parole, wasn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: It was post-prison, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: The PCS was the open case * * * and he was on release status * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">(Emphases added.) After that exchange, the trial court accepted defendant\u2019s oral waiver. The jury subsequently returned a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">At sentencing, the court addressed defendant regarding aggravating factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. The state has the information to put forward that you were on parole at the time the offense was committed. Do you acknowledge that? Do you want to dispute that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-16\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: (unintelligible).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. That could be used as an aggravating factor to seek an additional departure on the sentence. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-18\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Ido.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: And I think that\u2019s what the state is going to be asking today. Have you done \u2014 you were on parole before, so you\u2019ve been in the corrections division; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-20\">[DEFENDANT]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: How much time have you actually done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: Twelve years, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The state then offered certified judgments of defendant\u2019s prior convictions for second-degree robbery, third-degree theft, first-degree forgery (two counts), second-degree forgery, identity theft (five counts), fraudulent use of a credit card, possession of a controlled substance, assaulting a public safety officer, and attempted escape. Defendant did not dispute any of those convictions. The state suggested the following sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">\u201cDefendant is a 9B on the guidelines, which would be a presumptive 61 to 65 months in prison [, OAR 213-004-0007] or, as the court mentioned, this is a Ballot Measure 11 offense, which is a 90 month determinate sentence[, ORS 137.700(2)(a)(Q)].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">\u201cAnd, based on the <em>Blakely </em>factors submitted, I would request that the court depart from the 65 months to 114 months in prison, which is 24 months longer than the presumptive Ballot Measure 11 sentence, but less than the maximum of 130 that he could get for this based on his prior history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">\u201cI think that would be appropriate. I think, based on his prior history, and having already done 70 months on another robbery, and then doing, in addition to many, many other crimes, and the time he has done on those, his willingness to go ahead and inflict the harm that he did on the victim in this case * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-9\">\u201cHe attempted, as you heard, to draw other people into his criminal activities; has shown no rehabilitation or deterrent effect from the prior sentences. So I think it would be appropriate to give him more than the presumptive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">The trial court adopted the state\u2019s suggested sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">\u201cWhat is frustrating from the public standpoint is that, once you were clean, it would have been nice for you to stay that way. You fell back into the same old patterns, because either you were comfortable with it, or you just didn\u2019t care about taking things from other people that didn\u2019t belong to you. I mean, that\u2019s \u2014 with all the thefts, and everything else that\u2019s associated in there, you have very little regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>for the property of another. You\u2019ve compromised yourself in your liberties. *** [Y]ou\u2019ve made the community unsafe * * *. It\u2019s relatively brazen, you know, to commit a robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\">\u201cI have no choice other than the 90-month mandatory minimum. And then, <em>based on your history, </em>an additional two years would be appropriate under the circumstances. So, I\u2019m going to adopt the recommendation of the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The court imposed a sentence of 114 months\u2019 imprisonment. Defendant appeals, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s failure to obtain a written waiver of his right to a jury trial on sentence enhancement facts. In particular, defendant contends that the court\u2019s error in that regard was both statutory and constitutional. Defendant\u2019s claim of statutory error is predicated principally on ORS 136.773(1), which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-8\">\u201cWhen an enhancement fact relates to the defendant, the court shall submit the enhancement fact to the jury during the sentencing phase of the criminal proceeding if the defendant is found guilty of an offense to which the enhancement fact applies <em>unless the defendant makes a written waiver of the right to a jury trial on the enhancement fact </em>and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-9\">\u201c(a) Admits to the enhancement fact; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">\u201c(b) Elects to have the enhancement fact tried to the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s claim of constitutional error is based on Article I, section 11, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-12\">\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right to public trial by an impartial jury * * * provided, however, that any accused person, in other than capital cases, and with the consent of the trial judge, may elect to waive trial by jury and consent to be tried by the judge of the court alone, <em>such election to be in writingi.]\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Defendant acknowledges that his present contentions of statutory and constitutional error are unpreserved. Nevertheless, invoking <em>State v. Barber, </em>343 Or 525, 173 P3d 827 (2007), defendant contends that the asserted errors constitute \u201cerror [s] of law apparent on the record.\u201d ORAP 5.45(1).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant further urges that, because \u201c[t]he state has no legitimate interest in defendant serving an unlawful sentence,\u201d we should exercise our discretion to correct the asserted error by reversing and remanding for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">An unpreserved error is reviewable as \u201cplain error\u201d if (1) the error is one of law; (2) the legal point is obvious\u2014 that is, \u201cnot reasonably in dispute\u201d; and (3) to reach the error, \u201c[w]e need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355. If we conclude that an asserted error is plain, we must then decide whether to exercise our discretion to correct the error. <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 381-82, 823 P2d 956 (1991). In making that determination, we consider, among other things,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 382 n 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">For the reasons explained immediately below, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s noncompliance with ORS 136.770(1) and ORS 136.773(1) constituted \u201cplain error\u201d; nevertheless, we decline to exercise our discretion to remedy that statutory error. We further conclude that the purported constitutional error is not plain, because the applicability of Article I, section 11, in these circumstances is \u201creasonably in dispute\u201d and not \u201cobvious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">We begin with <em>Barber. </em>There, the defendant, who was convicted of burglary and theft after a stipulated facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>trial, appealed, contending that the absence of a written waiver to a jury trial violated his rights under Article I, section ll.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 343 Or at 527. We agreed that the trial court plainly erred, but exercised our discretion not to correct the error, in part, because the \u201cdefendant\u2019s counsel proposed the stipulated facts trial and [the] defendant knowingly participated in that process,\u201d and \u201cthe failure to procure a written jury waiver of [the] defendant could easily have been remedied, had the matter been brought to the attention of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Barber, </em>209 Or App 262, 267, 147 P3d 915 (2006), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>343 Or 525, 173 P3d 827 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The Supreme Court reversed, holding that an appellate court does not have discretion to not reach unpreserved error that involves a violation of the written waiver requirement of Article I, section 11. <em>Barber, </em>343 Or at 529-30. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">\u201cThe special peculiarity of Article I, section 11, does not lie in the fact that it describes a personal right. That is a characteristic that it shares with other constitutional provisions, such as Article I, section 8 (right of free expression), section 9 (right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures), and section 12 (protection against double jeopardy), to name but a few. The distinction instead lies in the fact that Article I, section 11, not only recognizes a right but also specifies the only way in which that right may be lost, <em>viz., </em>by a written waiver executed before trial commences, together with trial court consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">\u201cIndeed, when one focuses on the right to a jury trial granted by Article I, section 11, its unique nature and the consequences that flow from that nature become apparent. The provision undoubtedly is worded as an individual right (\u2018the accused person shall have the right to public trial by an impartial jury\u2019). But the emphasized part of the phrase, \u2018any accused person * * * may elect to waive trial by jury and consent to be tried by the judge of the court alone, <em>such election to be in </em>writing,\u2019 demonstrates what it is that makes Article I, section 11, different: The provision itself prescribes the only way in which an accused person may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>waive his or her right to a jury trial, and adherence to that method by the trial judge is itself a substantive constitutional right to which the accused is entitled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-4\">\u201cWe think that the unique wording of the part of Article I, section 11, that we emphasize today and the unique kind of rights that that wording represents places errors committed with respect to it in a unique posture also: There is no waiver of a jury trial unless that waiver is in writing and, without a waiver, defendant should have been tried by a jury. The judge\u2019s error thus lay in going to trial <em>at all. </em>And, with respect to that kind of error under Article I, section 11, we cannot identify any way in which an appellate court may elect under ORAP 5.45(1) either to refuse to recognize the error or, having recognized it, refuse to correct it. Put <em>in Ailes/Fults </em>terms: There unquestionably is a \u2018strong polic[y] requiring preservation and raising of error.\u2019 <em>[State v.] Fults, </em>343 Or [515, 522, 173 P3d 822 (2007)] <em>(citing Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382). But that policy and the factors underlying it are court-created and general. Here, those factors have to be weighed against a constitutional provision specifying the only way that the right that the provision separately grants may be waived. So understood, there is no contest. The Court of Appeals\u2019 contrary conclusion that it had the discretion to ignore the absence of a written waiver was incorrect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphases in original; boldface added).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Thus \u2014 and of critical importance to our analysis that <em>follows </em>\u2014 Barber\u2019s holding, which categorically precluded a \u201cnegative\u201d exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was explicitly and exclusively predicated on the constitutional character of the waiver provision of Article I, section 11. That holding, grounded in constitutional text and principle, does not purport to apply to the proper exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion with respect to the statutory written-waiver requirement of ORS 136.773(1) and ORS 136.770(1). <em>See also State v. Engerseth, </em>255 Or App 765, 770 n 6, 299 P3d 567, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 868 (2013) (rejecting the defendant\u2019s contention that <em>Barber </em>applied to ORS 136.773).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>With that understanding, we turn first to the asserted statutory plain error. We agree with defendant that the asserted noncompliance with statutory requisites was plain error. As noted, ORS 136.773(1) explicitly requires the court to submit to the jury enhancement facts relating to the defendant \u201cunless the defendant makes a <em>written </em>waiver of the right to a jury trial.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Here, it is undisputed that defendant made an <em>oral waiver </em>of the right to a jury trial on the alleged enhancement facts and never executed a written waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Nevertheless, we decline to exercise our <em>Ailes </em>discretion to correct that statutory error for at least two compelling reasons. First, defendant repeatedly told the court that he wanted the court \u2014 and not the jury \u2014 to try the enhancement factors. 263 Or App at 409-16. Then, when the court asked whether defendant\u2019s oral waiver of the jury right needed to be memorialized in writing and the state responded that no written waiver was required, defendant and his legal advisor remained silent. Given those circumstances, a positive exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion would very substantially subvert \u201cthe policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error.\u201d <em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6; <em>cf. State v. Kammeyer, </em>226 Or App 210, 214, 203 P3d 274, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 590 (2009) (holding that the defendant was precluded from seeking reversal on a specific error because, although the defendant did not \u201curge or advise\u201d the trial court to commit the asserted error, he nevertheless was \u201cactively instrumental\u201d in causing that error because he did not oppose the erroneous action and, instead, indicated his willingness to accept the outcome of that action).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Second, given the evidence substantiating the alleged enhancement facts, <em>see </em>263 Or App at 411 (the state provided certified copies of multiple prior convictions for robbery, theft, and forgery, and defendant admitted to the court that he had served 12 years for prior convictions and was on supervision at the time of the crime in this case), it is overwhelmingly likely that, in any resentencing process, the jury would find the facts alleged by the state, and the trial court, consequently, would impose the same sentence. Accordingly, any correction of the asserted statutory error would not materially promote the \u201cends of justice.\u201d <em>Ailes, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>312 Or at 382 n 6; <em>accord Fults, </em>343 Or at 523 (identifying factors weighing against an exercise of <em>Ailes </em>discretion to correct sentencing error, including \u201cthe interest of the judicial system in avoiding unnecessary repetitive sentencing proceedings\u201d); <em>State v. Ramirez, </em>343 Or 505, 513-14, 173 P3d 817 (2007), <em>modified on recons, </em>344 Or 195, 179 P3d 673 (2008) (reasoning that, because the evidence on a sentencing factor was \u201coverwhelming, it would not advance the ends of justice to remand for an unnecessary hearing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">We proceed to the asserted constitutional error. Defendant does not contend that Article I, section 11, entitled him to a jury trial on the alleged enhancement facts in this case; instead, defendant relies solely on the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to assert a right to a jury trial on sentence enhancement facts, as prescribed in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 301, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 490, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000). However, defendant does not contend that the Sixth Amendment itself requires a written waiver. Rather, defendant reasons that: (1) the written-waiver requirement of Article I, section 11, applies to the determination of sentence enhancement facts under the Sixth Amendment; (2) under <em>Barber, </em>it was plain error to proceed without an executed jury waiver; and (3) under <em>Barber\u2019s </em>categorical approach, the only legally permissible disposition is a remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The state remonstrates, in part, that the requisites of plain error are not satisfied because, at the least, the asserted constitutional error is not \u201capparent\u201d in that it is \u201creasonably in dispute.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355. Specifically, the state focuses on the first of defendant\u2019s premises and posits that Article I, section 11, is inapposite to these circumstances \u2014 or, at least, that its applicability, if any, is far from \u201cobvious.\u201d We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The state contends that the right to a jury trial under Article I, section 11, attaches to a smaller category of sentence-enhancement factors than does the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial \u2014 and that the Article I, section 11, written-waiver requirement applies only to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>enhancement facts for which a defendant is entitled to a jury trial under Article I, section 11. In support of that contention, the state cites two Oregon Supreme Court cases from the early 1980s (predating <em>Apprendi and Blakely), </em>where, in <em>dictum, </em>the Supreme Court announced a \u201csimple principle that the facts which constitute the crime are for the jury and those which characterize the defendant are for the sentencing court.\u201d <em>State v.

Inherent in that approach is the idea that <em>some </em>facts that may lead to enhanced punishment\u2014 for example, those that pertain to the defendant\u2019s character or status \u2014 are traditionally and properly for the sentencing court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\"><em>State v.

Further, defendant, the proponent of purported constitutional plain error, has offered no reasoned argument as to why, in this case, Article I, section 11, applies concurrently with the Sixth Amendment with respect to the determination of the predicate sentence enhancement facts. Given those circumstances, the applicability of Article I, section ll\u2019s written-waiver requirement \u2014 and the consequent asserted error \u2014 is not \u201capparent on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b428-7\"> We reject defendant\u2019s other assignment of error, and other arguments related to the imposition of a departure sentence, without further published discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b428-8\"> In <em>State v.

In <em>State v.
