Accordingly, in reviewing the juvenile court\u2019s judgment, we \u201cview the evidence, as supplemented and buttressed by permissible derivative inferences, in the light most favorable to the [juvenile] court\u2019s disposition and assess whether, when so viewed, the record was legally sufficient to permit that outcome.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. N. P., </em>257 Or App 633, 639, 307 P3d 444 (2013). We conclude, based on this record, that there is legally sufficient evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s determination that DHS\u2019s efforts were reasonable and that father has not made sufficient progress to allow the child to safely return home. ORS 419B.476(2)(a). We therefore affirm the juvenile court\u2019s determination that the plan for the child should be changed to APPLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The child lived with her mother until 2009, when her mother died and she came into father\u2019s custody. In March 2010, father and stepmother married, and father and the child moved in with stepmother and her four children. There was tension between father and the stepchildren.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Father has a history of alcohol abuse and domestic violence when intoxicated. DHS first became involved with the family after an incident of domestic violence in May 2010, when father hurt the child, the child\u2019s stepmother, and two of the child\u2019s stepsiblings. As a result of that conduct, father was convicted of felony and misdemeanor assault and was ordered to complete a 54-week domestic violence treatment program as a condition of probation. Father was within one week of completion of the program when he was suspended from it in June 2011, after committing another act of domestic violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">DHS took the children into protective custody in July 2011, and the juvenile court took jurisdiction over the child in September 2011.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The child and three of the stepsiblings were placed into foster care with stepmother\u2019s mother. The child did not want to see father, and his visits with her did not begin until April 2012. In June 2012, after three months of individual counseling, father began the domestic violence treatment program again. Also in 2012, father and stepmother engaged in and successfully completed in-home parent training. At the completion of parent training in August 2012, the parent educator reported that parents showed \u201cmarked improvement\u201d with empathy, and recommended reunification, conditioned on the parents\u2019 participation in mental health services to address their own childhood traumas. The parent educator also stated that \u201c[fjamily counseling will be vital if this reunification is to be successful [.]\u201d In a permanency order of September 2012, the juvenile court ordered that, by March 2013, father participate in and make progress in \u201cintensive family counseling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">All of the family members were participating in various forms of counseling. By December 2012, Douglas County had begun the process of implementing family counseling through counseling sessions with the parents and the children separately, but meetings with the parents and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>children together did not begin immediately. The child had a family counseling session with a therapist, Sprague, and parents in April 2013, which Sprague reported went well. Sprague and parents also had family counseling sessions with each of the other children separately, but after a session with parents and Ke, in which father gave a dismissive response to Ke\u2019s request for an apology, Sprague discontinued family therapy, out of concern that it might be doing more harm than good.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">In April 2013, father had a medication evaluation and received a prescription for symptoms of ADHD, to treat impulsivity and help him focus. Father took the medication for one month but could not afford to continue it.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">At the time of the permanency hearing on August 30, 2013, the permanency plan in effect for the child was reunification. The state took the position that the child could not yet be safely returned home and sought to change the permanency plan to APPLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">When, at the time of a permanency hearing, the case plan is to reunify the family, ORS 419B.476(2)(a) provides that the juvenile court must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">\u201cdetermine whether the Department of Human Services has made <em>reasonable efforts </em>* * * to make it possible for the ward to safely return home and whether the parent has made <em>sufficient progress </em>to make it possible for the ward to safely return home. In making its determination, the court shall consider the ward\u2019s health and safety the paramount concerns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, before the juvenile court may change a child\u2019s permanency plan to something other than reunification, the state must the show that DHS\u2019s reunification efforts were reasonable and that, despite those efforts, the parent\u2019s progress was insufficient to allow the child to safely return home. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. A. D., </em>255 Or App 567, 574, 300 P3d 185 (2013); <em>Dept. of Human Services v. N. T., </em>247 Or App 706, 715, 271 P3d 143 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Among the permanency plans that a court may order, ORS 419B.476(5)(b)(D) authorizes the court to place the ward in \u201canother planned permanent living arrangement\u201d (APPLA). When the court determines that the permanency plan for a child is APPLA, in addition to the findings required by ORS 419B.476(2)(a), ORS 419B.476(5)(f) requires that the court\u2019s order must include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">\u201cthe court\u2019s determination of a compelling reason, that must be documented by the department, why it would not be in the best interests of the ward to be returned home, placed for adoption, placed with a legal guardian or placed with a fit and willing relative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">An additional consideration was present in this case: At the time of the permanency hearing, the child had been a ward of the court for 26 months. Ordinarily, that circumstance would require DHS to file a petition for termination of parental rights. ORS 419B.498.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> DHS asserted, however, that there were compelling reasons why the filing of a petition for termination would not be in the child\u2019s best interests. ORS 419B.498(2)(b)(B). DHS believed that the current foster placement was a good one and that, although the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>could not be returned home immediately, it might be possible for her to return home in the future. For those reasons, DHS recommended that the juvenile court not move to termination, but because DHS believed that the child required a more permanent situation, DHS recommended a change in the permanency plan from reunification to APPLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">At the permanency hearing, the court took testimony from Slater, a DHS caseworker, who presented a summary of the services that had been provided to the family and explained why DHS did not recommend that the child return home. Slater had concerns that, despite long-term therapy, father did not appreciate the impact of his behavior toward the children, and she had doubts about whether he would be able to change his behaviors or have empathy for the children. Slater\u2019s report refers to an assessment by father\u2019s therapist that father \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to fully understand the ongoing need for children to process emotions associated with domestic violence for some time afterwards,\u201d and that \u201che slips back into the victim role very easily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The children had reported that during visits, stepmother is often on the computer or distracted by other activities, and that the children are left to play on their own. Slater expressed concerns about whether stepmother could make the children a priority and could intervene and protect the child if father became abusive. Slater explained that, although there had been no recent reports of domestic violence between the parents, and no indications that father poses a risk of physical harm to the child, the child does not trust father and does not feel safe being returned to his care. Slater testified that she would like to see if father\u2019s attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and impulsivity could be controlled with consistent use of medication. Slater testified that DHS would continue to work with the parents toward the goal of reunification. But, ultimately, Slater was of the view that it would not be emotionally safe for the child to return to father at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">The state called the child\u2019s therapist, Sprague, as a witness. Sprague testified that the child, who has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), has not yet been able to work through the trauma that she has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>experienced in her life. She testified that the child reported that visits with father do not go well, that father uses the visits to intimidate her, and that he has told her that if the family is not reunited, it would be the children\u2019s fault and that he and stepmother would be homeless. The child reported to Sprague that, based on a generalized fear for her safety, she does not want to return to father and would run away if required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">Sprague described the short-lived family therapy sessions. She testified that she had had family therapy sessions with the parents and each of the children, but discontinued them after a session between the parents and Ke, in which father expressed no empathy for and invalidated Ke\u2019s feelings about the abuse. Sprague expressed the opinion that father is not yet able to take responsibility for his abusive behaviors and is unable to tune in to the children\u2019s needs. Sprague asked father to write Ke a letter of apology but he did not do so. She said that she discontinued family therapy because she thought it would be harmful to the children. Father\u2019s own therapist concurred in the recommendation that father not participate in family therapy. Sprague testified, however, that the plan is to continue therapy with the children separately and gradually bring the parents back in.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The children\u2019s court-appointed special advocate (CASA) testified that parents clearly love the children. The CASA gave the parents credit for having well-adjusted children, but testified that \u201cit is a safety issue at this time and it\u2019s most of all trust. So basically that\u2019s it and I just agree that they should stay in their current foster placement right now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Father, for his part, did not assert that the child could safely return home immediately or that the wardship should be terminated. He contended, however, that the child\u2019s fear about future abuse could be ameliorated through additional family counseling and greater visitation. Father pointed out that family counseling had been required by the juvenile court in September 2012 and has been among the recommendations of the many experts who have worked with the family. Father blamed DHS for failing to continue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>family therapy and for failing to include funding for father\u2019s ADHD medication in his service agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">The juvenile court\u2019s judgment includes a determination that DHS\u2019s efforts have been reasonable and that father\u2019s progress toward ameliorating the adjudicated bases for jurisdiction are insufficient. As previously noted, because of the duration of the wardship, a determination that the child could not be returned home would ordinarily require a change to a permanency plan of adoption and require the filing of a termination petition. ORS 419B.498(2). However, in this case, the court agreed with DHS that there are compelling reasons not to move to adoption and termination. Specifically, the court found that the child\u2019s age, her attachment to her stepsiblings and parents, and the chance that father could eventually make sufficient progress for the child to safely return home militated against a plan of adoption. The court therefore changed the permanency plan for the child from reunification to APPLA. Father appeals, contending that the court erred in its determinations of \u201creasonable efforts\u201d and \u201csufficient progress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The juvenile court\u2019s determinations whether DHS\u2019s efforts were reasonable and the parent\u2019s progress was sufficient are legal conclusions that we review for errors of law. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. J. F. D., </em>255 Or App 742, 744, 298 P3d 653 (2013) (stating standard of review of \u201creasonable efforts\u201d determination); A. <em>D., </em>255 Or App at 579 (applying standard of review to \u201csufficient progress\u201d determination). We are bound by the court\u2019s findings of historical fact if there is any evidence in the record to support them. <em>Id. </em>As we have stated, \u201cWhen the juvenile court does not make findings on disputed issues of fact, but the evidence supports more than one factual conclusion, we presume that the court decided those issues in a manner consistent with its ultimate conclusion.\u201d De<em>pt. of Human Services v. J. R. L., </em>256 Or App 437, 439, 300 P3d 291 (2013). As previously noted, we view the evidence, including any permissible inferences, in the light most favorable to the juvenile court\u2019s disposition, and assess whether, when so viewed, the record was legally sufficient to permit the juvenile court\u2019s disposition. <em>N. P., </em>257 Or App at 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Father asserts on appeal that the record is insufficient to support the juvenile court\u2019s determination that DHS made reasonable efforts to achieve reunification. Specifically, father contends that DHS: (1) unreasonably delayed offering to pay for father\u2019s ADHD medication until the children had been in state custody for 22 months; (2) unreasonably did not start family counseling with the child until 22 months into the case; (3) unreasonably discontinued family counseling between father and the child after only one session, based on one negative session between father and one of the stepchildren; and (4) unreasonably limited father\u2019s visits with the child to only one hour per week, thereby failing to facilitate the child\u2019s successful return to the family. The state responds that the record, viewed in the light most favorable to the juvenile court\u2019s disposition, <em>N. P., </em>257 Or App at 639, supports the juvenile court\u2019s determination that DHS made reasonable efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">The juvenile court did not make specific findings as to DHS\u2019s efforts with respect to each of the services mentioned by father. Thus, we assume that the juvenile court made findings consistent with its overall conclusion that DHS made reasonable efforts. <em>J. R. L., </em>256 Or App at 439 (when court does not make explicit findings, we assume that the court made findings consistent with its legal conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The types of efforts required by DHS depend on the particular circumstances of each case. <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Williams, </em>204 Or App 496, 506, 130 P3d 801 (2006). In a permanency judgment of September 2012, the court continued the permanency plan of reunification and ordered father to participate in intensive family counseling. In a report of December 2012 prepared for a review hearing on December 11, 2012, <em>see </em>ORS 419B.449 (\u201c [T]he court may hold a hearing to review the child or ward\u2019s condition and circumstances and to determine if the court should continue jurisdiction and wardship or order modifications in the care, placement and supervision of the child or ward.\u201d), a DHS caseworker reported that the family was \u201cparticipating\u201d in family counseling and that it was going well. In fact, although counseling was occurring with each of the children and parents separately, Sprague did not begin to counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the parents and the child together until April 2013. And, as noted, that counseling terminated after only one session with the child and the parents. We have already described what the record shows about the reasons for the suspension of those services, and we conclude that the record is legally sufficient to support the juvenile court\u2019s determination that, under the circumstances, DHS\u2019s efforts in involving all of the members of the family in individual and family therapy were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">We reach the same conclusion with respect to DHS\u2019s funding of father\u2019s ADHD medication. The record supports a finding that, when DHS learned that father had discontinued his ADHD medication because of its cost, it made reasonable efforts to help him pay for the medication. We also conclude that, under the circumstances, which included the child\u2019s disclosure that her visits with father were not going well, DHS\u2019s decision concerning the length and number of father\u2019s visitations with the child was reasonable. Thus, we reject father\u2019s arguments that DHS\u2019s efforts were insufficient in each of the respects argued, and we conclude that the record is legally sufficient to support the juvenile court\u2019s determination that DHS made reasonable efforts to achieve reunification.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Father argues that the juvenile court erred in determining that he had not made sufficient progress toward reunification, contending that he has ameliorated the safety threats that led to jurisdiction in the first instance, and that DHS\u2019s evidence of a lack of progress was insufficient. The caseworker testified at the hearing that DHS had concerns about whether the parents \u201chad internalized what they had learned and being able to move forward.\u201d Citing <em>Dept. of Human Services v. J. M., </em>260 Or App 261, 269, 317 P3d 402 (2013), father asserts that the juvenile court could not properly base its determination on the caseworker\u2019s testimony about whether father had \u201cinternalized\u201d information. In <em>J. M., </em>we were critical of the state\u2019s reliance on psychological reports expressing concern that, despite successful completion of parenting classes, the parent had not \u201cinternalized\u201d the social norms against inappropriate corporal punishment. 260 Or App at 268-69. We said that, whether or not a parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>has made \u201csufficient progress\u201d depends not on what the parent \u201cbelieves, but what he \u2014 at the time of the hearing \u2014 is likely to <em>do\u201d Id. </em>at 268 (emphasis in original). Additionally, father contends that the juvenile court mistakenly based its change in the permanency plan on the child\u2019s preferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Once again, the juvenile court did not make explicit findings concerning its determination that father had not made sufficient progress, and we assume that the court made findings consistent with its legal conclusion. <em>J. R. L., </em>256 Or App at 439. There is no indication on this record that the court made its determination based on the evidence that father asserts the court should not have considered. In any event, the record here shows more than a failure to \u201cinternalize\u201d therapy and training. Father\u2019s counselor stated that father easily falls back into the \u201cvictim\u201d role and that he does not express empathy for the children. There is evidence that, despite having completed long-term therapy for domestic violence, father continues to be emotionally abusive of the child during visits and to blame her and her step-siblings for the family\u2019s involvement with DHS. Even if a parent has completed all services that have been required, evidence that a parent continues to engage in behavior that is harmful to a child supports a determination that the parent has not made sufficient progress to make it possible for the child to return home. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. N. S., </em>246 Or App 341, 351, 265 P3d 792 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 586 (2012). We conclude that evidence of father\u2019s lack of empathy and his use of visits to intimidate the child and to blame her for the family\u2019s separation is legally sufficient to support the juvenile court\u2019s determination that father has not made sufficient progress to allow the child to return home safely. ORS 419B.476(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Father does not otherwise challenge the change to APPLA. Because we conclude that the juvenile court\u2019s \u201creasonable efforts\u201d and \u201csufficient progress\u201d determinations are supported by legally sufficient evidence, we conclude that the juvenile court did not err in changing the permanency plan to APPLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\"> We affirmed without opinion father\u2019s appeal of the juvenile court judgment assuming jurisdiction over I. <em>Dept. of Human Services v.
