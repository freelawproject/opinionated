We conclude that the state\u2019s notice was sufficient under OEC 803 (18a) (b) and that, therefore, the trial court did not err in admitting the victim\u2019s hearsay statements. Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s decision not to instruct the jury that it must agree, under <em>State v. Boots, </em>308 Or 371, 780 P2d 725 (1989), <em>cert den, </em>510 US 1013 (1993), on which factual occurrence was the basis for each of the charges against him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court\u2019s rejection of defendant\u2019s requested <em>Boots </em>instruction was not error. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The undisputed facts relevant to our decision are as follows. In 2003, defendant married and began to live <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>with the victim\u2019s mother along with the victim, the victim\u2019s brother, and his own son. In 2009, the victim\u2019s mother reported to the Marion County Sheriff\u2019s Office that defendant had been \u201cmentally, sexually, and physically abus [ing] \u201d the victim repeatedly for the preceding four years. In February 2010, the victim, then 15 years old, told Detective Hingston that defendant had sexual intercourse with her in the bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, and living room of the family home. She also told Hingston that defendant had vaginally penetrated her eight times with a toy rocket and that she had performed oral sex on him approximately three times. Hingston recorded those statements in an investigative report submitted on February 18, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Shortly thereafter, defendant was indicted on one count each of rape in the first degree, sodomy in the first degree, and unlawful sexual penetration in the second degree.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Those counts in the indictment alleged that, on or between January 1, 2007 to March 23, 2010, the occasions of unlawful sexual contact occurred in Marion County when the victim was under the age of 16 for Counts 1 and 2, and under the age of 14 for Count 3. Count 3 specifically identified defendant\u2019s finger as the \u201cobject other than [his] penis or mouth\u201d that unlawfully penetrated the victim (\u201cto wit: his finger\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The state provided notice to defendant of its intent to rely at trial on statements made by the victim to a forensic interviewer and to Hingston. The notice provided, in part, that the state intended to rely at trial on hearsay statements made by the victim</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">\u201c[t]o Detective Hingston from the Marion County Sheriff\u2019s Office on February 9, 2010. The statement is set forth in Detective Kingston\u2019s report submitted February 18, 2010 and is contained beginning on page 3 of the report and ending on page 5. The report was made previously available in discovery.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>At trial, defendant objected to Hingston\u2019s testimony about several statements the victim made to him about defendant\u2019s sexual conduct with her, arguing that the statements were hearsay and that they were not allowable under the child abuse exception to the hearsay rule, OEC 803(18a)(b), because the notice provided to him by the state did not \u201cset out the particulars,\u201d as required by <em>State v. Chase, </em>240 Or App 541, 248 P3d 432 (2011). The judge allowed Hingston to testify about what the victim had told him about defendant\u2019s actions toward her.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">At trial, the victim testified about defendant\u2019s sexual conduct toward her in their home. The victim testified that defendant touched her in a sexual way \u201cmore than once\u201d with his penis and fingers, and that those acts occurred \u201c[s]ometimes on the couch[,]\u201d \u201c[s]ometimes on a tablet,]\u201d and \u201c[s]ometimes in Mom and [defendant]\u2019s \u2014 Mom\u2019s room.\u201d In response to questioning, the victim provided some detail about those locations \u2014 for example, that her autistic brother would be in his room engrossed in video games and that her mom would be at work when defendant would have sex with her on the kitchen table, during which defendant would pull off her clothes, and that she was too afraid to scream or yell for help. She also answered affirmatively to the state\u2019s question, \u201cWhen [defendant] would put his penis in your vagina, did he ever use a lubricant?\u201d The victim testified that when she was 11 or 12 years old, defendant would use his fingers to penetrate her \u201csometimes on the couch.\u201d She also testified that defendant would remain silent \u201cwhen\u201d he vaginally penetrated her with a red toy rocket. The victim also testified that defendant engaged in sodomy with her, saying that defendant \u201cused to grab my hair and put my face on him, on his [penis]\u201d and that he would have her put her face against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>his penis \u201cmost of the time.\u201d The victim did not identify any of those occurrences of sexual abuse by a specific date or time. Defendant, for his part, denied that any of the incidents of sexual contact took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Hingston testified that the victim had told him that defendant had sexual intercourse with her in the bedroom and bathroom, and on the kitchen table and the couch. According to Hingston, the victim had also told him that defendant had vaginally penetrated her eight times with a toy rocket and that she had performed oral sex on defendant about three times. He also testified that the victim had described defendant using baby oil as a lubricant before having sexual intercourse with her. Regarding the victim\u2019s statements, Hingston commented that \u201cit was hard to get details from [the victim] and specifics\u201d and that \u201cit was real difficult for her to kind of capture what I was looking for and explain it.\u201d He noted, however, that \u201cvictims of continued abuse [when] it happens over a prolonged period of time, that a lot of times, you know, details get mixed up and\u2014 and \u2014 and everything kind of gets mooshed together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The state sought to corroborate the victim\u2019s and Kingston\u2019s testimony about defendant\u2019s sexual abuse with evidence that, during the period of time that the charged offenses took place, defendant was \u201ccontrolling\u201d of the victim and her mother and that defendant acted in a sexually inappropriate manner around the victim. Defendant placed security cameras throughout the home, including cameras with a view of the victim\u2019s bedroom and the bedroom he shared with the victim\u2019s mother. Those cameras provided a continuous feed to a monitor in defendant\u2019s bedroom. The windows were sealed shut and the front door was dead-bolted; the victim testified that she did not feel that she had freedom in her house. Additionally, there was a passcoded key lock on the door to the bedroom that defendant shared with the victim\u2019s mother, which would chime upon opening. Defendant kept the victim by his side constantly, often keeping her home from school, and the victim\u2019s mother testified that it was difficult to talk to her daughter because of defendant\u2019s interference. The victim\u2019s mother also testified that defendant had declared more than once that he intended to marry the victim. Defendant had also taken and uploaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>photos of the victim that included images of her breast and her pubic hair, as well as a photo of the victim eating a corn dog; the victim testified that defendant had taken the latter photo after urging her to \u201cpretend like it\u2019s [defendant\u2019s penis] in your mouth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">At the close of defendant\u2019s trial, he requested that the trial court instruct the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">\u201cIn order to reach a lawful guilty verdict as to any count, 10 jurors must agree on what factual occurrence constituted the crime. Thus, in this case, in order to reach a guilty verdict on any count, 10 jurors must agree on which factual occurrence constituted the offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The trial court declined that request, instead instructing the jury that, in order to establish the crimes charged, 10 of the 12 of them must agree that the state established beyond a reasonable doubt the elements indicated in the charges of the indictment. For Count 3, the instructions did not mention specifically defendant\u2019s finger as the object used for the unlawful penetration, as indicated in the indictment. Defendant took exception to those instructions, arguing that the jury was not asked \u201cto necessarily agree on a specific act that constitutes the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">We begin with defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay statements and review the trial court\u2019s determination that the state met OEC 803(18a)(b)\u2019s notice requirements for legal error. <em>Chase, </em>240 Or App at 546. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted and is generally inadmissible unless it is excluded from the definition of hearsay or falls under a hearsay exception. OEC 801; OEC 802. OEC 803(18a)(b) provides one of those exceptions for matters involving child abuse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">\u201cA statement made by a person concerning an act of abuse as defined in *** ORS 419B.005 [governing child abuse reporting] * * * is not excluded by [the rule against hearsay] if the declarant * * * testifies at the proceeding and is subject to cross-examination].] *** No statement maybe admitted under this paragraph unless the proponent of the statement makes known to the adverse party the proponent\u2019s intention to offer the statement and the <em>particulars </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number><em>of the statement </em>no later than 15 days before trial, except for good cause shown.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">(Emphasis added.) The rule\u2019s purpose is to apprise an opposing party of the other party\u2019s proposed hearsay evidence so that it can have a reasonable opportunity to prepare for trial by developing other evidence, preparing for cross-examination if the declarant will testify at trial, filing a preliminary motion to limit use of the evidence, or modifying intended <em>voir dire. State v. Iverson, </em>185 Or App 9, 14, 57 P3d 953 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 655 (2003). A trial court must exclude the offered hearsay statements if OEC 803(18a)(b)\u2019s notice requirements are not met. <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Under OEC 803(18a)(b), the notice must provide details of the evidence that the party seeks to admit and list the particular statement sought to be admitted. <em>State v. Olsen, </em>220 Or App 85, 89, 185 P3d 467 (2008). Although verbatim statements need not be included in the notice, \u201csimply providing discovery and notice of an intention to offer at trial hearsay statements contained in discovery is not sufficient.\u201d <em>Chase, </em>240 Or App at 546. The notice in <em>Chase, </em>which specified that \u201cthe foregoing and subsequent reports contain particulars of statements made by [the victim] that the State intends to offer [,]\u201d did not sufficiently identify the specific hearsay statements that the state would offer at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 544, 546-47. We explained that the definition of a \u201c\u2018particular\u2019\u201d \u2014 \u201c\u2018an individual fact, point, circumstance, or detail *** specific item of information\u2019\u201d \u2014 could not be reconciled with the state\u2019s intention to potentially offer any of the statements included in the referenced discovery\u2019s 53 pages. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>1647 (unabridged ed 2002)). Instead, what is required for the \u201cparticulars of the statement\u201d is that the proponent of the hearsay evidence identify in its notice (1) the proposed hearsay statement\u2019s substance and (2) the witness or means by which the hearsay statement would be introduced. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We clarified those two particularity requirements in <em>State v. Riley, </em>258 Or App 246, 256, 308 P3d 1080 (2013), where we concluded that a notice that referenced specific page numbers of discovery was sufficiently particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>because \u201cthe substance of the statements was readily identifiable.\u201d The state had identified in an affidavit attached to the notice \u201c(1) the date on which the statements were made, (2) the place at which the statements were made, and (3) the specific discovery pages on which the statements themselves could be found.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the referenced pages of discovery included the identity of the particular witnesses to the statements, who we deemed could be available to testify at the trial about the statements\u2019 substance. <em>Id. </em>at 256 n 4 <em>{\u201cChase </em>does not stand for the proposition that a party is obliged to identify in its notice a <em>single </em>means of introducing a statement at trial. Rather, a party must identify the recipient^) of the statement or other means by which it may be introduced at trial.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Defendant relies primarily on <em>Chase </em>for his argument that the state failed to meet the requirements of OEC 803(18a)(b) because the notice\u2019s reference to Kingston\u2019s report did not provide \u201cany \u2018particulars of any statement\u2019 or \u2018the substance of the victim\u2019s hearsay statements or how they would be offered\u2019 at trial.\u201d The state responds that the notice met the particularity requirement because it was not required to provide verbatim recital of the hearsay statements and that the notice included the date on which the statement was made, reference to a particular report, including the page numbers directing defendant to where in the report the statements could be found, and, by naming the detective in the report, an identification of the witness who would testify to the hearsay statements \u2014 all information, it contends, that was more specific than the notices we found lacking in <em>Chase </em>and <em>Olsen.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We agree with the state that the notice satisfied the particularity requirements of OEC 803(18a)(b). The notice provided the following particulars about the hearsay statements sought to be offered by the state and: (1) they were made by the victim, to Hingston, on February 9, 2010; (2) they were included in Kingston\u2019s report submitted on February 18, 2010, in pages three to five; and (3) the report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>was made available to defendant in discovery. That degree of detail contrasts significantly with the notice in <em>Chase, </em>which referenced \u201cforegoing and subsequent reports\u201d included in 53 pages of discovery without details about the statements sought to be offered or who would offer them. Here, the notice provided the date of the statements, and included to whom and by whom they were made, with specific enough detail regarding the statements\u2019 location in the report to allow defendant to discern their substance. Furthermore, the notice identified Hingston as the recipient of the statements, indicating that Hingston could be available to testify at trial, as he did for the grand jury. Accordingly, we reject defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in admitting the evidence at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">We turn next to defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred when it rejected his requested jury instruction that \u201c10 jurors must agree on which factual occurrence constituted\u201d each offense. On appeal, defendant argues that, \u201c[w]ithout instructing the jury that it had to agree on \u2018what factual occurence constituted the crime,\u2019 the court allowed individual jurors to pick-and-choose alleged incidents, without ever [e]nsuring that 10 jurors agreed that defendant\u2019s actions on a particular occurrence constituted each offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s failure to give a requested instruction for legal error. <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). \u201cLegal error occurs when the court refuses to give an instruction that correctly states the law * * * and is supported by evidence in the record viewed in the light most favorable to establishment of the facts necessary to require the instruction.\u201d <em>State v. Branch, </em>208 Or App 286, 288, 144 P3d 1010 (2006) (citations omitted). As discussed below, defendant\u2019s proposed instruction does not follow from <em>Boots </em>and its progeny, and the trial court did not err in rejecting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">We begin with a discussion of <em>Boots </em>to provide a context for our discussion of the offered instruction. In <em>Boots, </em>the defendant was charged with aggravated murder, which is a murder accompanied by one of 17 different factual circumstances. 308 Or at 373. The indictment in that case charged two \u201ctheories\u201d for the aggravated murder charge \u2014 first, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the defendant committed the murder during a first-degree robbery, and, second, that the defendant murdered the victim in order to conceal the identity of the perpetrators of the robbery. <em>Id. </em>at 374. The trial court instructed the jury that it did not have to agree unanimously on which of the two theories supported the aggravated murder charge. <em>Id. </em>at 374-75. Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution requires that a unanimous jury must render a guilty verdict for the crime of first-degree murder and that 10 members of the jury must concur in rendering a guilty verdict for all other crimes. The question presented to the Supreme Court was whether, in light of Oregon\u2019s constitutional requirement of a unanimous verdict for first-degree murder, the jury could agree that an aggravating circumstance occurred without agreeing on which of the two factual theories offered by the state actually occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">In concluding that the trial court\u2019s instruction was erroneous, the court reasoned that the two aggravating circumstances \u2014 robbery and concealing the perpetrator\u2019s identity \u2014 were not interchangeable; the circumstances of each element could be proved by different factual scenarios. <em>Id. </em>at 375. Moreover, the court noted that it is obvious that, if the charge of killing in furtherance of a robbery, or the charge of killing to conceal the identity of the perpetrators of a robbery, stood alone, the jury would have to agree unanimously on the factual circumstances that constituted each of those crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 377. The need for unanimity \u201cshould be no less obvious,\u201d the court stated, \u201cwhen the state charges a defendant [under both of the aggravating circumstance subsections of ORS 163.095].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court, in line with its analysis that the different aggravating circumstances in each subsection of the statute implicated different factual theories, distinguished between facts that are mere \u201cfactual details\u201d and facts that legally are \u201cessential to a crime\u201d; the former do not require juror unanimity or concurrence, and the latter do. <em>Id. </em>at 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">In addition to its statutory analysis of the aggravated murder statute, the court looked to <em>United States v. Gipson, </em>553 F2d 453 (5th Cir 1977), to support its holding. <em>Id. </em>at 380. In that case \u2014 also relied upon by defendant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>this case \u2014 the defendant was charged \u201cas a person who \u2018receives, conceals, stores, barters, sells or disposes of a stolen vehicle in interstate commerce [,]\u201d and the trial court instructed the jury that it did not have to agree on which one of those acts the defendant had committed. <em>Id. </em>The Fifth Circuit remanded the case for a new trial, holding that the \u201c[jury] unanimity rule thus requires jurors to be in substantial agreement as to just what a defendant did as a step preliminary to determining whether the defendant is guilty of the crime charged.\u201d <em>Gipson, </em>553 F2d at 457-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Recently, the Oregon Supreme Court, in <em>State v. Pipkin, </em>354 Or 513, 520, 316 P3d 255 (2013),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> discussed the importance of <em>Gipson </em>as a basis for the requirement of a jury concurrence instruction as set forth in <em>Boots. </em>First, the court noted that the <em>Boots </em>holding requiring jury unanimity for each of the aggravating circumstances of ORS 163.095 was derived as a matter of legislative intent. <em>Id. </em>at 520. Second, the court pointed out that the <em>Boots </em>court considered <em>Gipson </em>\u201conly to the extent that the court interpreted the aggravated murder statute to avoid \u2018constitutional doubts.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Pipkin </em>court identified those \u201cconstitutional doubts\u201d as relating to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, not to Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution, and stated that the difference mattered \u201cbecause a majority of the United States Supreme Court later disagreed with the rationale in <em>Gipson.\u201d Id. </em>(citing <em>Schad v. Arizona, </em>501 US 624, 634-37, 111 S Ct 2491, 115 L Ed 2d 555 (1991) (plurality)). The court added that, in its view, <em>\u201cGipson </em>provides a poor basis from which to derive an independent analysis of the Oregon Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">In looking back on its case law since <em>Boots, </em>the Supreme Court in <em>Pipkin </em>identified two categories of cases in which a jury concurrence requirement has been addressed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The first, which is represented by <em>Boots </em>itself, is the situation where a criminal statute specifies alternative means of committing a crime.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 354 Or at 516. The second category of cases involves situations where \u201cthe record discloses multiple separate occurrences of the charged crime.\u201d <em>Pipkin, </em>354 Or at 525 (citing <em>State v. Lotches, </em>331 Or 455, 17 P3d 1045 (2000), <em>cert den, </em>534 US 833 (2001), and <em>State v. Hale, </em>335 Or 612, 75 P3d 448 (2003), <em>cert den, </em>541 US 942 (2004)); <em>see also State v. Sparks, </em>336 Or 298, 83 P3d 304 (2004). Because this case falls into that second category of cases, we review how the jury concurrence requirement has been addressed in those cases in order to evaluate the appropriateness of defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">In <em>Lotches, </em>the defendant was charged with, among other crimes, multiple counts of aggravated murder involving different victims. On plain error review, the court addressed whether <em>Boots </em>applied when the instructions did not specify which of multiple factual occurrences adduced at trial supported the underlying felonies for the aggravated murder charges. 331 Or at 467-69. The jury concurrence problem arose because, for each count, the evidence permitted the jury to find multiple occurrences of each predicate crime, such as attempts to steal both a car and a pick-up truck from different victims. <em>Id. </em>at 470-71. More than one occurrence could have supported the underlying aggravated murder felony offense of attempted first-degree robbery, yet the trial court did not instruct the jury that they had to agree on which specific occurrence constituted attempted robbery. <em>Id. </em>at 467-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The court relied on <em>Boots </em>and <em>Gipson </em>as support for its holding that a jury concurrence instruction was required. <em>Id. </em>at 467-69. The court stated that, \u201cbecause the aggravated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>murder instructions that were given did not either limit the jury\u2019s consideration to a specified underlying felony or require jury unanimity concerning a choice among alternative felonies, each instruction carried the same danger that this court had condemned in <em>Boots!\u2019 Id. </em>at 469. Additionally, <em>Lotches </em>called attention to the <em>Boots </em>court\u2019s approval of <em>Gipson </em>as a basis for requiring a jury concurrence instruction, also quoting that decision: <em>\u2018\u201cThe unanimity rule thus requires jurors to be in substantial agreement as to just what a defendant did as a step preliminary to determining whether the defendant is guilty of the crime charged.\u2019\u201d Id. </em>at 468 (quoting <em>Gipson, </em>553 F2d at 455-56) (emphasis <em>in Lotches).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In <em>Hale, </em>also a plain error case, the defendant was charged with aggravated murder with the underlying circumstances of third-degree sexual abuse and murder. There were, however, multiple possible perpetrators and victims for the underlying crimes. 335 Or at 627. The court, applying the reasoning of <em>Botches, </em>held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">\u201cbecause the instructions that the jury was given with respect to each of the aggravated murder counts based on the crimes of third-degree sexual abuse and murder did not either limit the jury\u2019s consideration to a specific instance of third-degree sexual abuse or murder, committed by a particular perpetrator against a particular victim, or require jury unanimity concerning a choice among alternative scenarios, each instruction carried an impermissible danger of jury confusion as to the crime underlying each count.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-6\"><em>Id. </em>The court concluded that the trial court\u2019s failure to require jury unanimity when there were different possible victims and perpetrators of the underlying counts was plain error. <em>Id. </em>As it had in <em>Boots </em>and <em>Botches, </em>the court in <em>Hale </em>again referred to <em>Gipson </em>for support, stating that the unanimous jury rule \u201crequires that the jury agree as to <em>just what the defendant did </em>to bring himself within the purview of the particular [offense] under which he was charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). However, given that the court in <em>Pipkin </em>has now clarified that <em>Gipson </em>is no longer a valid basis for the category of jury concurrence instruction cases represented by <em>Boots </em>and <em>King, </em>it is doubtful that <em>Gipson </em>still can serve as a basis for the second category of cases represented by <em>Botches, Hale, </em>and this case. What survives is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the Supreme Court\u2019s concern, based on Article I, section 11, regarding the need for jury concurrence as to essential facts and regarding an impermissible danger of jury confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">Finally, in <em>Sparks, </em>the court concluded that the trial court\u2019s failure to provide a <em>Boots </em>instruction was not plain error because the facts did not implicate the same concerns identified in <em>Lotches.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>336 Or at 316-17. There, the defendant, who had been convicted of aggravated murder, argued that the evidence that the underlying crimes could have taken place in the defendant\u2019s bedroom or at the location where the victim\u2019s body was found (a railway embankment) likely confused the jury because it could have found him guilty based on either of those factual circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 313. The court distinguished the facts of the case from <em>Lotches </em>and <em>Hale:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">\u201cIn <em>Lotches, </em>there were multiple possible victims for each of the underlying crimes. Similarly, in <em>Hale, </em>there were multiple possible victims and two possible perpetrators of each of the underlying crimes. In both of those cases, the jury was presented with multiple factual theories for each of the underlying crimes. It is not reasonably in dispute that a jury\u2019s failure to agree unanimously on either <em>the victim </em>or <em>the perpetrator </em>of the crime would violate the jury unanimity rule, because both those facts are material elements of the underlying crimes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 316 (emphases in original). The defendant did not provide an explanation of why the location was \u201cessential to the crime\u201d and not a \u201cfactual detail,\u201d and the court, therefore, held that it was not \u201cobvious\u201d that \u201cthe precise location of the underlying crimes constitutes a material element of those crimes on which the jury must agree unanimously. <em>Id. </em>at 317. In fact, the location of those crimes more logically constitutes a Tactual detail\u2019 that does not require jury unanimity. <em>Boots, </em>308 Or at 379.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Two of our cases also bear on the analysis of whether a jury concurrence instruction is necessary in circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>such as these. <em>State v. Garcia, </em>211 Or App 290, 295, 154 P3d 730, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 160 (2007), involved a defendant who was charged with multiple sex offenses involving a child victim. In that case, as here, the victim testified in very general terms about the approximate number of times the abuse took place in various rooms of the house over the course of several years. <em>Id. </em>at 293-94. We held that the failure to give a jury concurrence instruction was not plain error under those circumstances, because we were unable to discern any plausible reason why a jury might have credited the victim\u2019s generalized testimony with regard to one incident versus another. <em>Id. </em>at 297. Likewise, in <em>State v. Pervish, </em>202 Or App 442, 123 P3d 285 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 308 (2006), which involved a defendant charged with multiple counts of promoting prostitution, we rejected the argument that the need for a concurrence instruction was apparent on the face of the record, explaining that \u201c[t]he very generality of the evidence pertaining to [the charge of promoting prostitution] ameliorated any risk that members of the jury could have picked different factual incidents in convicting defendant of that charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">We return to the issue presented in this case: whether it was error for the trial court to decline to instruct the jury that it had to agree on which factual occurrence constituted each of the crimes charged, where, for each, \u201cthe evidence permitted] the jury to find multiple, separate occurrences of that crime.\u201d <em>See Pipkin, </em>354 Or at 517. <em>Lotches, Hale, </em>and <em>Sparks </em>teach that, when the record supports the possibility of more than one occurrence of the crime charged, the court must give a jury concurrence instruction if (1) the occurrences differ as to some factual element \u2014 such as the identities of the victim or the perpetrator \u2014 that is material or, as described in <em>Boots, </em>\u201cessential to the crime,\u201d and (2) the instruction is necessary to avoid causing an \u201cimpermissible danger of jury confusion.\u201d <em>Hale, </em>335 Or at 627; <em>see Lotches, </em>331 Or at 467-71. Neither concern is implicated where the evidence suggests that the crime was committed on multiple occasions but does not provide the jurors with enough specifics to distinguish one occasion from another in a way that would allow them to draw conflicting conclusions regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the crime committed. That is particularly true where factual distinctions between different instances are not contested.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Here, defendant has not explained why the evidence of multiple instances of sexual abuse by defendant involves factual differences that are \u201cessential to the crime\u201d or cause an \u201cimpermissible danger of jury confusion.\u201d As to Count 1, first-degree rape, the victim testified that she was raped \u201c [s] ometimes on the couch. Sometimes on a table. Sometimes in [her mother\u2019s] room.\u201d Defendant fails to make any argument that the location of the rape for which he was convicted is an essential fact, nor was the evidence sufficiently distinct to allow the jurors to distinguish various instances from each other. For Count 2, the victim described incidents of sodomy in general terms, and Hingston testified that the victim told him that the defendant had the victim engage in oral sex \u201capproximately three times\u201d or \u201cused to grab [her] hair and put [her] face on him, on his [penis].\u201d Defendant does not point to any differences among those incidents that are essential to the crime or could cause juror confusion. Finally, for Count 3, second-degree unlawful penetration, the victim and Hingston testified that the finger penetration with which defendant was charged occurred \u201csometimes.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Again, there are no distinguishing details among the penetration incidents that require an instruction to avoid an impermissible danger of juror confusion. As to all counts, defendant denied that any of the described incidents occurred at all. As in <em>Sparks </em>and <em>Garcia, </em>a jury concurrence instruction is not required as to the precise location or circumstances of defendant\u2019s various acts of abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>To summarize, when the evidence supports multiple, separate occurrences for a single offense but does not provide the jurors with enough specifics to distinguish one occasion from another in a way that would allow them to draw conflicting conclusions regarding the crime committed, a jury instruction requiring concurrence as to which factual occurrence constituted the crime charged is not required. The factual details suggesting separate incidents of the crimes in this case were not of the type \u2014 such as the identity of the victim or the perpetrator \u2014 that have been held to be material facts requiring jury concurrence, and those details did not create an impermissible risk that the jury would be confused in distinguishing one occasion from another or would draw conflicting conclusions regarding the crime committed. Therefore, the trial court did not err by refusing to give defendant\u2019s instruction because the instruction did not correctly state the law as applied to the evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-6\"> ORS 163.375(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">\u201cA person who has sexual intercourse with another person commits the crime of rape in the first degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">\u201c(c) The victim is under 16 years of age and is the person\u2019s sibling, of the whole or half blood, the person\u2019s child or the person\u2019s spouse\u2019s child [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b229-9\"> ORS 163.405(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">\u201cA person who engages in deviate sexual intercourse with another person or causes another to engage in deviate sexual intercourse commits the crime of sodomy in the first degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">\u201c(c) The victim is under 16 years of age and is the actor\u2019s brother or sister, of the whole or half blood, the son or daughter of the actor or the son or daughter of the actor\u2019s spouse [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">In turn, ORS 163.305(1) defines \u201cdeviate sexual intercourse\u201d as \u201csexual conduct between persons consisting of contact between the sex organs of one person and the mouth or anus of another.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b229-13\"> ORS 163.408 provides, in part, that \u201ca person commits the crime of unlawful sexual penetration in the second degree if the person penetrates the vagina, anus or penis of another with any object other than the penis or mouth of the actor and the victim is under 14 years of age.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b229-14\"> We reject without discussion defendant\u2019s two remaining assignments of error, one, a challenge to the trial court\u2019s discretion to exclude evidence under OEC 403, and, the other, his assertion that the trial court failed to provide a less satisfactory evidence jury instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\"> Defendant was also charged with unlawful use of a firearm, but that charge did not result in a conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b230-8\"> The report also stated that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">\u201cnotice should be sufficient to give [defendant] proper notice of specifically which statements of the child victim [the state] intend [s] to offer as hearsay evidence at trial.

King, </em>316 Or 437, 852 P2d 190 (1993). There, the court held that a jury concurrence instruction was not required where the defendant was charged with driving under the influence of intoxicants, which under the then-extant version of ORS 813.010(1) was committed when, as pertinent to that case, a person drove a vehicle while the person \u201c(a) [had] .08 percent or more hy weight of alcohol in the blood;\u201d or \u201c(b) [was] under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance [.]\u201d The court concluded that paragraphs (a) and (b) were not essential elements of separate offenses, as was in the case in Roofs, but were alternative methods of proving a single offense. <em>Id. </em>at 446.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b241-8\"> \u201cThe elements of plain error are: the error must be one of law; (2) the legal point must be obvious, that is, not reasonably in dispute; and (3) to reach the error, \u2018 [w] e need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it[.]\u201d\u2019 <em>Sparks, </em>336 Or at 315 <em>(quoting Brown, </em>310 Or at 355).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b243-5\"> Defendant does not assert that the trial court\u2019s failure to identify in the instructions that defendant\u2019s finger was the object used for the unlawful penetration was erroneous where both the indictment and the prosecutor\u2019s arguments identified defendant\u2019s finger as the penetration object. Under <em>State v. Pauley, </em>211 Or App 674, 686, 156 P3d 128 (2007), we held that, even though the trial court\u2019s instructions did not identify the victim\u2019s vagina as the area of sexual contact for the crime of attempted first-degree sexual abuse, the trial court, whose duty it is to instruct the jury on the law, properly provided the jury with the necessary elements of the offense. Likewise here, the indictment and the prosecutor\u2019s statements made clear that the object of penetration for Count 3 was defendant\u2019s finger. Because the trial court correctly provided in its jury instruction the elements to prove unlawful penetration, the prosecutor\u2019s statements were sufficient to make the jury aware that the penetration object was defendant\u2019s finger and not the toy rocket.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
