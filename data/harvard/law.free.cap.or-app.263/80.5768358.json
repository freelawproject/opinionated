We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">I. FACTUAL AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">A. <em>The City\u2019s Plan Provisions and Ordinance Governing Development and Land Use in Floodplains</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">As required of all cities by ORS 197.175(2), the city has adopted a comprehensive plan to facilitate its compliance with statewide planning goals, including Goal 7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To meet Goal 7, the plan sets forth \u201cpolicies,\u201d \u201cimplementation strategies,\u201d and \u201cland use designations and standards\u201d regarding land use and development in floodplains, that is, areas subject to flooding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pertinent to this case, one of the policies relating to flood hazards \u2014 Policy 2 \u2014 provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>that \u201c[t]he City will continue participation in the Housing and Urban Development National Insurance Program.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Another policy \u2014 Policy 4 \u2014 identifies the steps that the city will take where 100-year floodplains<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> have yet to be adequately mapped:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-4\">\u201cIn cases where detailed mapping of 100-year floodplains is not complete, the 100-year floodplain will be determined by at least one of the following methods:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">\u201ca.

Implementation Strategies 3 and 4 state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">\u201c3. Lands subject to flooding shall be identified on the zoning map and designated \u2018FP\u2019 (Floodplain) to implement the policies of this Plan. \u2018FP\u2019 is an overlay combining zone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\u201c4. No permanent structure shall be erected within a flood hazard area unless the structure or the area meets the criteria set forth in the \u2018FP\u2019 overlay zone.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-3\">Finally, the land use designation and standard \u201cFLOODPLAIN, \u2018FP\u2019 COMBINING ZONE\u201d sets forth specific criteria designed \u201cto protect the public health, safety, and general welfare [in] flood susceptible areas.\u201d It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">\u201cThe purpose of the \u2018FP\u2019 combining zone is to protect the public health, safety, and general welfare by demarcating flood-susceptible areas.

Before approval will be considered, proponents of the development will be required to submit a report that addresses, at a minimum, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-6\">\u201ca. A description of the proposed use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-7\">\u201cb. The impact on the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-8\">\u201cc. A diagram of the proposed structure and the relation to the floodplain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b105-9\">\u201cd. Proposed mitigating measures.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">The comprehensive plan is not the city\u2019s only law addressing flood hazard areas. In compliance with Goal 7, Policy 2, the city has adopted an ordinance \u2014 Hood River Municipal Code (HRMC) chapter 15.44 \u2014 in order to comply with federal prerequisites for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> HRMC chapter 15.44 serves to ensure the continued availability of flood insurance to the citizens of Hood River. Like the standards and strategies in the comprehensive plan, the ordinance addresses flood hazards and contains a number of restrictions on development within \u201carea[s] of special flood hazard,\u201d which are defined by the ordinance to be areas within the 100-year floodplain. According to the city\u2019s order in this case, the lands currently within the \u201cFP\u201d Zone also qualify as \u201carea[s] of special flood hazard\u201d under HRMC chapter 15.44, and are subject to both the requirements of the \u201cFP\u201d Zone and of HRMC chapter 15.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>B. <em>NBW\u2019s Proposal to Develop a Site within the 100-year Floodplain, the City\u2019s Approvals of NBW\u2019s Proposal, and LUBA\u2019s Rejection of those Approvals</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\">NBW proposes to construct a hotel, office building, and parking lot on the waterfront of Nichols Boat Basin in the City of Hood River. Nichols Boat Basin is located near the confluence of the Hood River and the Columbia River. It is fed by the Columbia River and is separated from the Hood River by a breakwater. The office building would be constructed partly on land immediately adjacent to the Nichols Boat Basin and partly on piers that would be submerged at times of ordinary high water. The floodplains on the site have not been mapped in detail, but the site is subject to flooding, the majority of the site falls within the 100-year floodplain, and the proposed office building will be constructed within the 100-year floodplain.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">NBW applied to the city for a conditional use permit and a site plan approval for the project. The city granted the approvals, and respondents appealed the decision to LUBA. LUBA remanded to the city to determine, among other things, whether Goal 7, Policy 4, Implementation Strategy 4, and the \u201cFP\u201d Zone criteria were mandatory approval criteria applicable to NBW\u2019s application and, if so, to apply those criteria.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">On remand, the city concluded that Policy 4, Implementation Strategy 4, and the \u201cFP\u201d Zone criteria were not mandatory approval criteria applicable to NBW\u2019s application. Specifically, the city determined that Policy 4 contained no mandatory approval criteria at all and therefore did not apply to NBW\u2019s proposal for that reason, although the city also concluded that the provision provided \u201cguidance\u201d for identifying the 100-year floodplain on the proposed project site. The city found that Implementation Strategy 4 and the \u201cFP\u201d Zone criteria were mandatory approval criteria for sites within the \u201cFP\u201d Zone, but did not apply to sites outside of the \u201cFP\u201d Zone, even if those sites were within the floodplain. The city reasoned that to apply the \u201cFP\u201d Zone criteria to sites outside the \u201cFP\u201d Zone \u2014 even if those sites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>were, in fact, flood hazard areas \u2014 \u201cwould effectively read the \u2018FP\u2019 Zone off the zoning map and give it no effect.\u201d Because NBW\u2019s site was not contained within the \u201cFP\u201d Zone, the city reasoned that the \u201cFP\u201d Zone criteria did not apply to NBW\u2019s proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">Respondents again appealed the city\u2019s decision to LUBA, and LUBA again remanded to the city. Although LUBA rejected most of respondents\u2019 assignments of error, LUBA sustained in part respondents\u2019 assignment of error challenging the city\u2019s application of Policy 4 and sustained respondents\u2019 assignments of error challenging the city\u2019s interpretation and application of Implementation Strategy 4 and the \u201cFP\u201d Zone criteria. LUBA agreed with the city that Policy 4 was not written as a mandatory approval criterion for a conditional use approval. LUBA nonetheless concluded that Policy 4 did create \u201can applicable mandatory requirement to identify the location of the 100-year floodplain on the property, because detailed mapping of the 100-year floodplain on the property is not available.\u201d Based on that conclusion, LUBA concluded that, \u201c[o]n remand, the city will need to have the applicant prepare that map\u201d of the 100-year floodplain on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u2022 With respect to Implementation Strategy 4 and the \u201cFP\u201d Zone criteria, LUBA concluded that Implementation Strategy 4 made the \u201cFP\u201d Zone criteria applicable to NBW\u2019s application and that the city\u2019s contrary conclusion was not plausible. LUBA stated that it \u201cd[id] not understand\u201d the city\u2019s conclusion that applying Implementation Strategy 4 to flood hazard areas that were not contained in the \u201cFP\u201d Zone would render the \u201cFP\u201d Zone meaningless. LUBA further reasoned that to construe Implementation Strategy 4 to apply only to flood hazard areas that had been mapped and added to the \u201cFP\u201d Zone would render Implementation Strategy 4 a nullity, would add a limitation to the provision that the city itself had not added, and would undermine the plan\u2019s evident objective of ensuring that development on floodplains meet the standards for construction in flood hazard areas. Based on that conclusion, LUBA remanded to the city to \u201censure that the proposal complies with Implementation Strategy 4, which requires that \u2018No permanent structure shall be erected within a flood hazard area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>unless the structure or the area meets the criteria set forth in the \u201cFP\u201d overlay zone.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\">Petitioners thereafter sought review in this court; respondents cross-petitioned for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">This court reviews whether LUBA\u2019s order is \u201cunlawful in substance or procedure.\u201d ORS 197.850(9)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The issue on review is whether LUBA\u2019s rejection of the city\u2019s interpretation of its comprehensive plan provision relating to floodplains, and its related determinations (a) that Implementation Strategy 4 requires the city to apply the \u201cFP\u201d Zone criteria to NBW\u2019s proposal and (b) that Policy 4 requires NBW to provide a map of the 100-year floodplain on the project site, are \u201cunlawful in substance.\u201d ORS 197.850(9)(a). LUBA\u2019s rejection of the city\u2019s interpretation of its own comprehensive plan is \u201cunlawful in substance\u201d unless the city\u2019s interpretation</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">\u201c(a) Is inconsistent with the express language of the comprehensive plan or land use regulation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-9\">\u201c(b) Is inconsistent with the purpose for the comprehensive plan or land use regulation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-10\">\u201c(c) Is inconsistent with the underlying policy that provides the basis for the comprehensive plan or land use regulation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">\u201c(d) Is contrary to a state statute, land use goal or rule that the comprehensive plan or land use regulation implements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-12\">ORS 197.829(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">Whether the city\u2019s interpretation of its comprehensive plan is inconsistent with the plan, or the purposes or policies underlying that plan, \u201cdepends on whether the interpretation is plausible, given the interpretive principles that ordinarily apply to the construction of ordinances under the rules of <em>PGE </em>[v. <em>Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993),] as modified by <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).\u201d <em>Setniker v. Polk </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number><em>County, </em>244 Or App 618, 633-34, 260 P3d 800, <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 216 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original); <em>see also Mark Latham Excavation, Inc. v. Deschutes County, </em>250 Or App 543, 552-53, 281 P3d 644 (2012) (same). Put simply, our task on review in this case is to determine whether the city\u2019s interpretation of the floodplain provisions of its comprehensive plan \u201cplausibly accounts for the text and context\u201d of those provisions. <em>Siporen v. City of Medford, </em>349 Or 247, 262, 243 P3d 776 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">A. <em>LUBA Correctly Rejected the City\u2019s Interpretation of Implementation Strategy 4.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The primary dispute among the parties concerns LUBA\u2019s rejection of the city\u2019s interpretation of Implementation Strategy 4. The city and NBW both contend that LUBA did not afford the city\u2019s interpretation the deference mandated by ORS 197.829, as construed in <em>Siporen. </em>We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">As noted above, Implementation Strategy 4 states, \u201cNo permanent structure shall be erected within a flood hazard area unless the structure or the area meets the criteria set forth in the \u2018FP\u2019 overlay zone.\u201d Understood in a common-sense way, that implementation strategy requires that NBW\u2019s proposed development meet the requirements of the \u201cFP\u201d overlay zone. NBW proposes to build a permanent building on the waterfront in an area that is in the 100-year floodplain and undisputedly subject to flooding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In other words, NBW proposes to place a permanent structure in what is, as a factual matter, a flood hazard area.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Notwithstanding the fact that, if the plain terms of Implementation Strategy 4 are given their ordinary meaning, they would apply to NBW\u2019s proposal, the city interpreted Implementation Strategy 4 not to apply to NBW\u2019s proposal. The city did so by concluding that the phrase \u201cflood hazard area\u201d in Implementation Strategy 4 means an \u201carea within the \u2018FP\u2019 Zone.\u201d As LUBA correctly recognized, that reading of Implementation Strategy 4 suffers from many conspicuous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>deficits and, in the end, cannot plausibly be squared with the text and context of the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\">To start, the city\u2019s interpretation rejects the most natural, ordinary reading of Implementation Strategy 4, which is that any permanent structure in an area that is, in fact, a flood hazard area will need to meet the requirements of the \u201cFP\u201d Zone. <em>Columbia Riverkeeper v. Clatsop County, </em>238 Or App 439, 445, 243 P3d 82 (2010) (in evaluating a local government\u2019s interpretation of a comprehensive plan provision, the reviewing court \u201cgivfes] words of common usage their plain, natural and ordinary meaning\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Moreover, the city\u2019s interpretation rewrites Implementation Strategy 4, adding words to it that the city did not include at the time it adopted the provision. In effect, as interpreted by the city, Implementation Strategy 4 provides, \u201cNo permanent structure shall be erected within a flood hazard area <em>[within the \u2018FP\u2019 overlay </em>zone] unless the structure or the area meets the criteria set forth in the \u2018FP\u2019 overlay zone.\u201d That conflicts with the principle that a comprehensive plan or ordinance ordinarily should not be interpreted \u201cto insert what has been omitted.\u201d ORS 174.010; <em>Western Land &amp; Cattle, Inc. v. Umatilla County, </em>230 Or App 202, 210, 210 n 2, 214 P3d 68 (2009) (applying ORS 174.010 in the context of interpreting a county land use ordinance).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Another problem with the city\u2019s interpretation is that it renders Implementation Strategy 4 a superfluity. By its plain terms, the plan\u2019s land use designation and standard \u201cFloodplain, \u2018FP\u2019 Combining Zone\u201d requires that areas within the \u201cFP\u201d Zone comply with the requirements of the zone. In other words, all flood hazard areas that are already in the \u201cFP\u201d Zone are necessarily required to meet the criteria of the zone simply by virtue of the fact that they have been included in the zone. Consequently, Implementation Strategy 4 serves no independent purpose, if it is interpreted as the city interprets it. <em>See State v. Cloutier, </em>351 Or 68, 98, 261 P3d 1234 (2011) (\u201c[A]n interpretation that renders a statutory provision meaningless should give us pause.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Finally, the city\u2019s interpretation of Implementation Strategy 4 is inconsistent with the context of the provision. Goal 7, Implementation Strategy 3, contemplates that, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>some point, <em>all </em>lands subject to flooding will be added to the \u201cFP\u201d Zone: \u201cLands subject to flooding shall be identified on the zoning map and designated \u2018FP\u2019 (Floodplain) to implement the policies of this Plan. \u2018FP\u2019 is an overlay combining zone.\u201d Policy 4 recognizes that the process of identifying and mapping flood hazard areas cannot occur instantaneously and sets forth a methodology for identifying the 100-year floodplains \u201c[i]n cases where detailed mapping of the 100-year floodplains is not complete[.]\u201d That context indicates that the ultimate objective of the comprehensive plan provisions relating to flood hazards is to protect people and property from flood hazards by identifying <em>all </em>lands subject to flooding within the city and ensuring that development on those lands comports with the standards established for the \u201cFP\u201d Zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The city\u2019s interpretation would thwart that objective. Under it, areas that are, in fact, subject to flooding\u2014 and thus required to be added to the \u201cFP\u201d Zone at some point \u2014 would be exempt from compliance with the \u201cFP\u201d Zone requirements simply because the city had not yet completed its obligation under the plan to identify and map all areas subject to flooding. By contrast, interpreting Implementation Strategy 4 to apply to all flood hazard areas in the city would ensure that people and property are not deprived of the protections afforded by the \u201cFP\u201d Zone standards simply because the city has not completed its task under Implementation Strategy 3.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Notwithstanding those difficulties with the city\u2019s interpretation, the city and NBW assert that we must defer to the city\u2019s interpretation \u2014 and that LUBA erred by not doing so \u2014 because, in their view, to interpret the provision otherwise would render the \u201cFP\u201d Zone meaningless. We fail to see how. The \u201cFP\u201d Zone is meaningful because it catalogs those areas subject to flooding that have been mapped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>and identified and makes clear that those areas must comply with the requirements of the \u201cFP\u201d Zone. The fact that there continue to be flood hazard areas that are not yet in the \u201cFP\u201d Zone \u2014 such as the area affected by NBW\u2019s proposal \u2014 does not render the \u201cFP\u201d Zone meaningless; it simply means that the city has not yet completed its charge under Implementation Strategy 3 to identify and add all such areas to the \u201cFP\u201d Zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\">The city further contends that LUBA was required to accept the city\u2019s interpretation of Implementation Strategy <em>4, </em>because, in the city\u2019s view, the interpretation represents a \u201c\u2018considered determination\u2019 that plausibly harmonized the conflict between the FP Overlay regulations in the [comprehensive plan] and the Flood Hazard regulations in HRMC Ch 15.44.\u201d However, contrary to the implication of that argument, in its order, the city did not conclude that there was any conflict between the requirements of the \u201cFP\u201d Zone and HRMC chapter 15.44. In fact, the city expressly acknowledged in its order that the areas in the \u201cFP\u201d Zone are also regulated by HRMC chapter 15.44, finding that floodplains in the \u201cFP\u201d Zone are a \u201csubset\u201d of the floodplains covered by HRMC chapter 15.44. That acknowledgment that both sets of regulations can \u2014 and do \u2014 apply simultaneously refutes the city\u2019s assertion on review that the city\u2019s interpretation of Implementation Strategy 4 is entitled to deference because the city was acting to resolve a conflict between the plan and the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">The city and NBW raise a number of other arguments as to why Implementation Strategy 4 should be construed to apply only to flood hazard areas that have been added to the \u201cFP\u201d Zone. None of those arguments overcomes the identified textual and contextual problems with reading that limitation into Implementation Strategy 4, and we reject them for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">In sum, the city\u2019s interpretation of Implementation Strategy 4 conflicts with that provision\u2019s text and context. LUBA properly rejected that interpretation under ORS 197.829 and remanded to the city to apply Implementation Strategy 4 to NBW\u2019s proposal, as dictated by the plain terms of that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>B. <em>LUBA Erroneously Determined that Goal 7, Policy 4, Required the City to Require NBW to Map the 100-year Floodplain on Remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">NBW and the city also assign error to LUBA\u2019s determination that the city is required by Policy 4 to have NBW map the 100-year floodplain on the site affected by its proposal. We agree that LUBA erred to the extent that it construed that provision to require NBW to map the 100-year floodplain. Although we agree with LUBA that the provision represents a mandatory requirement to identify the 100-year floodplains in connection with a project on a site where the floodplains have not yet been identified, nothing in the text or context of that provision expressly requires that identification to take the form of a map prepared by the applicant. Accordingly, the city\u2019s implicit interpretation of Policy 4 to not require NBW to produce a map of the 100-year floodplain is a plausible reading of Policy 4, and LUBA erred when it ruled that, \u201c[o]n remand, the city will need to have the applicant prepare that map [of the 100-year floodplain].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">For the foregoing reasons, LUBA\u2019s order is reversed to the extent that it ordered the city to require NBW to prepare a map of the 100-year floodplain on remand. LUBA\u2019s order is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">On petitions, reversed in part. On cross-petition, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\"> Respondents Friends of the Hood River Waterfront (Friends), Corie Lahr, and Richard Derek Bell filed a cross-petition for review. We reject without discussion the assignment of error raised in the cross-petition and, for ease of reference, refer to NBW and the city as \u201cpetitioners\u201d and to Friends, Lahr, and Bell as \u201crespondents\u201d throughout this opinion. Although respondents contend that the city\u2019s petition is, in reality, a cross-petition that was not timely filed within the filing period for cross-petitions specified in ORAP 4.68(1), we reject respondents\u2019 characterization of the city\u2019s petition, as well as their assertion that the petition is not properly before us. Because the city\u2019s petition was timely filed within 21 days of the LUBA decision on review, it is properly before us, regardless of the timelines established by ORAP 4.68(1) for cross-petitions. <em>State ex rel Dodd v.

According to the city\u2019s brief, the city stopped the process of updating its \u201cFP\u201d Zone map around 1981, apparently under the view that the Goal 7 provisions of the plan are \u201cout-dated\u201d in the light of HRMC chapter 15.44. Leaving aside the fact that HRMC chapter 15.44 originally was adopted before the plan provisions at issue, the appropriate process for dealing with an antiquated law is to amend or repeal it, not to ignore it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
