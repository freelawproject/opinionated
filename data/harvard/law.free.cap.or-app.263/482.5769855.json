That statute provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-5\">\u201c(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, any person who carries concealed upon the person any knife having a blade that projects or swings into position by force of a spring or by centrifugal force, any dirk, dagger, ice pick, slungshot, metal knuckles, or any similar instrument by the use of which injury could be inflicted upon the person or property of any other person, commits a Class B misdemeanor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The sole question in this appeal is whether the state introduced sufficient evidence about the knife to sustain defendant\u2019s conviction on the theory that the knife was a \u201csimilar instrument\u201d within the meaning of that statute. We conclude that it did not and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The facts are not in dispute. Police discovered a concealed knife hanging from a chain around defendant\u2019s neck. The knife\u2019s blade was between three-and-a-half and three- and-three-quarter inches long; with the handle included, the knife measured eight inches. At defendant\u2019s bench trial, the state introduced the knife into evidence along with a photograph of it next to a ruler. The state did not elicit any testimony about the characteristics of the knife. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge examined the knife and made findings that the blade was \u201csharp\u201d and that the tip of the blade was \u201cvery sharp.\u201d Defendant argued to the court that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support a conviction under ORS 166.240. The court found defendant guilty based on its finding that the knife was a \u201csimilar instrument\u201d under ORS 166.240(1). This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence on a particular element of a crime, our task \u201cis to determine whether a trier of fact could find the required element has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Forrester, </em>203 Or App 151, 155-56, 125 P3d 47 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>341 Or 141 (2006) (and noting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>\u201c[a]lthough certainly the best way to [preserve a claim of error concerning the legal sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence at a bench trial] is to move for a judgment of acquittal, such a motion is not necessary as long as a defendant clearly raises the issue in closing argument\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Defendant points to <em>State v. Tucker, </em>28 Or App 29, 33, 558 P2d 1244, <em>rev den, </em>277 Or 491 (1977), in which we interpreted a prior version of ORS 166.240 and concluded that the so-called \u201ccatchall\u201d provision of that statute was intended to encompass only those items that \u201care designed and intended primarily as weapons to inflict bodily injury or death.\u201d He urges that the state failed to present sufficient evidence to show that the knife was designed and intended primarily as a weapon. The state argues that the \u201cdesign\u201d interpretation arrived at in <em>Tucker </em>no longer reflects the proper test in light of the legislature\u2019s 1985 amendment of ORS 166.240. Or Laws 1985, ch 543, \u00a7 2. It advocates that the catchall provision instead encompasses items that share similar characteristics with an enumerated item and that are capable of inflicting a similar injury. In any event, argues the state, the evidence was sufficient to conclude that defendant\u2019s knife was a \u201csimilar instrument\u201d under the catchall provision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In <em>Tucker, </em>the defendant was accused of carrying concealed \u201cnunchaku sticks.\u201d 28 Or App at 31. He demurred to the indictment, arguing, in part, that ORS 166.240 (1977) was unconstitutionally vague. The then-operative version of the statute provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">\u201cany person who carries concealed about his person in any manner, any revolver, pistol, or other firearm, any knife, other than an ordinary pocketknife, or any dirk, dagger, slung shot, metal knuckles, or any instrument by the use of which injury could be inflicted upon the person or property of any other person [is guilty of the offense].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">ORS 166.240(1) (1977). We noted the rule that a statute will be struck down for vagueness \u201conly if it cannot be saved wholly or in part by judicial application of the rules of statutory construction.\u201d <em>Tucker, </em>28 Or App at 32 (internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>quotation marks omitted). We also noted that \u201crattail combs, letter openers, screwdrivers, ballpoint pens and like items which could be used to inflict injury\u201d might constitute \u201cany instrument\u201d that could inflict injury on another person. <em>Id. </em>at 33. To avoid that sweeping interpretation \u2014 which we did not perceive as consistent with the legislative intent behind the statute \u2014 we arrived at the following interpretation of the catchall provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\">\u201cWe construe this phrase to embrace those items which are similar in nature to the enumerated objects, and are designed and intended primarily as weapons to inflict bodily injury or death. Accordingly we hold this statute applies to items not enumerated which are designed and intended primarily to inflict injury on the person or property of another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We concluded that \u201cnunchaku sticks\u201d met that definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The legislature amended ORS 166.240(1) in 1985.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Or Laws 1985, ch 543, \u00a7 2. The legislature removed the prohibitions on carrying \u201cany\u201d concealed \u201crevolver, pistol, or other firearm\u201d and on carrying \u201cany knife, other than an ordinary pocket knife.\u201d The legislature also specified two new criminal acts: carrying \u201cany\u201d concealed \u201cknife having a blade that projects or swings into position by force of a spring or by centrifugal force and commonly known as a switchblade knife\u201d and carrying any concealed \u201cice pick.\u201d With regard to the catchall provision of ORS 166.240, the legislature added the narrowing term \u201csimilar\u201d to prohibit the concealed carrying of \u201cany similar instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The Oregon Supreme Court confronted the amended version of the statute in <em>City of Portland v. Lodi, </em>308 Or 468, 782 P2d 415 (1989). There, a City of Portland ordinance prohibited carrying a knife with a blade longer than a specified limit. The question on appeal was whether ORS 166.240 preempted the city\u2019s ordinance. In concluding that the city\u2019s ordinance was preempted by the statute, the court noted the following legislative history behind the 1985 amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">\u201cWith respect to ORS 166.240(1), the section stating what may not be carried concealed regardless of intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>use, the bill as introduced listed \u2018any knife other than a pocketknife\u2019 along with any switchblade knife, dirk and dagger among cutting or stabbing instruments, ending with a catchall reference to any other injurious instrument. The subcommittee amended the bill by removing all reference to knives other than dirks and daggers and those that it defined as switchblade knives. This was done after the director of [the Oregon District Attorneys Association] proposed additional changes, which would have had the section specify knives \u2018having a fixed blade longer than three and a half inches\u2019 as well as switchblade knives. The implication is that the committee made a decision not to outlaw the concealed carrying of any knife that was not a switchblade, dirk, or dagger. We do not believe that after this decision to omit other knives, the committee nevertheless meant to prohibit carrying an ordinary knife by the final catchall phrase.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In <em>State v. McJunkins, </em>171 Or App 575, 15 P3d 1010 (2000), the state had charged that the defendant had violated the statute by carrying a concealed \u201cdirk or dagger.\u201d A police officer testified that the knife was \u201c\u2018more or less like a skinning knife, a hunting knife.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577. The only other facts were that the knife was approximately eight-inches long, and had a curved, fixed blade; the convex edge of the blade was smooth and sharpened, the concave edge was serrated. The defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, contending that there was insufficient evidence that the knife was a \u201cdirk\u201d or \u201cdagger.\u201d In reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of that motion, we examined the definitions of those two terms, noting that \u201ca dagger is generally slender, straight, and coming to a point. Its function is to stab, historically to pierce armor. * * * A dirk is one variety, being one that is long and straight, with a blade of approximately 18 inches.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 579. After citing the legislative history discussed in <em>Lodi, </em>we concluded that \u201cthere [was] a complete absence of evidence that the knife that defendant possessed was either a dirk or a dagger. Specifically, there is no evidence that it was designed for stabbing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also rejected the state\u2019s argument that the jury could infer that the knife was a dirk or a dagger because the knife <em>could be </em>used for stabbing, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\u201cThe problem with [that] argument * * * is that virtually anything with a point <em>could be </em>used for stabbing. Under the state\u2019s reasoning, a jury reasonably could conclude that the concealed possession of virtually any ordinary knife would be unlawful, a result that plainly would be contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lodi.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 579-80 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Finally, in <em>State v. Ruff, </em>229 Or App 98, 211 P3d 277, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 43 (2009), the issue was whether an arresting officer had reasonable suspicion to believe that the defendant had violated ORS 166.240. The police had received a report that a man had been swinging a \u201csamurai type sword around\u201d in a park and was also carrying it under his coat. An officer observed the sword and estimated that it was between three-and-a-half and four feet in length. The defendant argued that a sword did not fall within the items described by ORS 166.240 and that the officer could not therefore have had a reasonable suspicion that the defendant had committed a crime. We first concluded that a sword did not meet the definitions of a \u201cdirk\u201d or \u201cdagger\u201d that we had adopted in <em>McJunkins, </em>stating, \u201cWhile a three-and-one-half foot long samurai sword is not a dirk or a dagger, it could qualify as an \u2018other similar instrument\u2019 for purposes of ORS 166.240(1) if it also is designed for stabbing.\u201d <em>Ruff, </em>229 Or App at 104. We then examined the definition of a sword and concluded that the officer could reasonably suspect that \u201cthe sword in defendant\u2019s possession * * * was designed primarily to inflict injury on the person or property of another by stabbing, similar to the function of a dirk or dagger, and that the sword had been concealed on defendant\u2019s person.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 105. We also cited the legislative history behind the 1985 amendment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u201cBecause <em>Tucker </em>was decided in 1977, the 1985 legislature would have been aware of our conclusion that the statute applied to any object not enumerated in the statute that is designed and intended primarily to inflict injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>on the person or property of another. In light of the 1985 amendments to the statute, as well as the language of the present version of ORS 166.240(1), we conclude that the legislature <em>intended that the statute be construed comprehensively to apply to \u2018any\u2019 object designed and intended primarily to inflict injury on a person or property </em>that is capable of being concealed upon the body of a person without regard to whether the object is relatively small or large.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><em>Ruff </em>229 Or App at 107 (footnote omitted; emphasis added).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">With that overview, we return to the parties\u2019 arguments in the present case. Defendant urges that this case involves a relatively straightforward application of the principle announced in Tucker; he relies primarily on <em>McJunkins </em>for the proposition that the state failed to introduce sufficient evidence that the knife in this case was primarily designed and intended to inflict injury. The state counters that the <em>Tucker </em>test is no longer valid in light of the 1985 amendment of ORS 166.240. It argues that, by adding ice picks to the list of prohibited items, the legislature demonstrated its intention to reject <em>Tucker\u2019s </em>interpretation of the catchall provision. Because one of the enumerated items is not designed and intended to inflict bodily injury, reasons the state, the legislature must have had some other \u201csimilarity]\u201d in mind than design as a weapon when it enacted the 1985 amendment. The state proposes that the catchall provision, as properly understood, encompasses any item that \u201chas similar characteristics to a listed weapon and that is therefore capable of causing similar injury as a listed weapon.\u201d The state is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The 1985 legislature did not intend to criminalize concealing and carrying all knives, but instead only dirks, daggers, switchblades (as defined), and other \u201csimilar instruments.\u201d <em>Lodi, </em>308 Or at 475 (\u201cWe do not believe that after this decision to omit other knives, the committee nevertheless meant to prohibit carrying an ordinary knife by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>final catchall phrase.\u201d); <em>McJunkins, </em>171 Or App at 578 (\u201cThe catchall phrase \u2018or any similar instrument\u2019 does not refer to ordinary knives.\u201d). As we noted in <em>Ruff, </em>the 1985 legislature was aware of our interpretation in <em>Tucker. </em>The 1985 legislature also necessarily contemplated that certain knives would be sufficiently \u201csimilar\u201d to the enumerated items, that others would not, and that a principle to distinguish knives fitting one category or the other would be necessary. On that point, it is noteworthy that <em>Tucker </em>had already announced such a distinguishing principle, but nowhere in the text of the statute or in the legislative history presented by the state did the legislature expressly state an intention to adopt a different principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">That observation, of course, is not dispositive, for it is still conceivable that the 1985 legislature may have intended to adopt a different test when assessing whether a knife is a \u201csimilar instrument\u201d under the catchall provision. Under the state\u2019s proposed interpretation, the 1985 legislature intended for the similarity inquiry to focus on the characteristics of the knife in question: Does the knife have \u201csimilar\u201d characteristics to the expressly prohibited items and is it capable of producing an effect (injury) \u201csimilar\u201d to those items?</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In rejecting the state\u2019s interpretation, we need look no further than the intention that it ascribes to the 1985 legislature.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If a knife was a \u201csimilar instrument\u201d to an enumerated object merely because it had \u201csimilar\u201d characteristics and was capable of producing a \u201csimilar\u201d injury to a dirk, dagger, or ice pick \u2014 a stab wound \u2014 nearly every knife in existence would fall under ORS 166.240(1). In other words, the state\u2019s theory is that the legislature intended the catchall provision of ORS 166.240(1) to encompass \u201cordinary\u201d knives, a result that the Supreme Court has explicitly stated was <em>not </em>intended by the 1985 legislature. <em>Lodi, </em>308 Or at 475; <em>McJunkins, </em>171 Or App at 578 (\u201cThe catchall phrase \u2018or any similar instrument\u2019 does not refer to ordinary knives.\u201d). As we explained in <em>McJunkins </em>in terms that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>are equally applicable here, \u201cThe problem with the [state\u2019s] argument * * * is that virtually anything with a point <em>could be </em>used for stabbing. Under the state\u2019s reasoning, a jury could conclude that the concealed possession of virtually any ordinary knife would be unlawful, a result that plainly would be contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lodi.\u201d </em>171 Or App at 579-80 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">What is more, the state\u2019s argument ascribes to the 1985 legislature the intention to enlarge the universe of prohibited concealed knives by requiring that a knife that is not a dirk, dagger, or switchblade be examined for similarities with an \u201cice pick.\u201d That is, the state suggests, the legislature intended for a concealed knife\u2019s \u201csimilarity]\u201d to be determined by reference to certain common denominators of a dirk, dagger, and ice <em>pick </em>\u2014 viz., something with a point, capable of inflicting a stab wound. However, in light of the fact that ORS 166.240(1) enumerates two types of fixed-blade instruments (dirks and daggers), it does not stand to reason that the legislature meant to drastically expand the universe of prohibited knives by requiring an examination of the similarities between a knife and the shared features of a dirk, dagger, <em>and </em>ice pick. Instead, and as we have suggested in the past, it is eminently more sensible to conclude that the legislature intended for the \u201csimilarity\u201d of a knife with a fixed blade to be assessed with reference to the types of fixed-blade knives that are identified in the statute. <em>See Ruff, </em>229 Or App at 104 (\u201cWhile a three-and-one-half foot long samurai sword is not a dirk or a dagger, it could qualify as an \u2018other similar instrument\u2019 for purposes of ORS 166.240(1) if it also is designed for stabbing.\u201d); <em>McJunkins, </em>171 Or App at 579 (stating that a dirk is a type of dagger and that a dagger\u2019s \u201cfunction is to stab\u201d). In short, if the legislature intended the analysis and result the state suggests, it would have cut to the chase.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>For those reasons, we reaffirm that, when the state attempts to prove that a knife is a \u201csimilar instrument\u201d under the catchall provision of ORS 166.240, the state must introduce sufficient evidence for a reasonable factfinder to find that the knife was \u201cdesigned and intended\u201d primarily as a weapon. In this case, there was no evidence from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the knife was designed and intended primarily as a weapon. <em>Accord McJunkins, </em>171 Or App at 579 (a physical description of a knife and the knife itself do not constitute sufficient evidence to prove that a knife is designed for stabbing).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\"> The state does not argue that the knife was a \u201cdirk\u201d or \u201cdagger\u201d or any of the other enumerated items of ORS 166.240(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b505-9\"> It did so again in 1989 and 1999.
