ORS 813.010. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence discovered as a result of what he contends was an unlawful seizure under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution and the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In particular, defendant argues that he was unlawfully stopped when an officer knocked on the door of his residence, asked him to come outside and talk, accompanied him to a place outside to conduct field sobriety tests, read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and then asked for his consent to a patdown search. The state responds that, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would have understood that he or she was free to leave and, therefore, defendant was not stopped under either the state or federal constitution. We agree with defendant that the circumstances in this case amounted to a stop under Article I, section 9. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We review a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress for legal error and are bound by the court\u2019s findings of historical fact if there is evidence to support them. <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or 7, 10, 115 P3d 908 (2005). To the extent that the court did not make express findings on disputed factual issues, we state the facts consistently with the court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>Id. </em>We state the facts of this case in light of those standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Just before 8:00 p.m. on April 10, 2010, Groom, a deputy with the Jackson County Sheriffs Department, received a call about a vehicle stuck in a ditch in front of a residence on Butte Falls Highway. Approximately 15 minutes later, Groom pulled into defendant\u2019s driveway in a marked patrol car and saw a pickup truck with its front end stuck in a large ditch on the side of the road, near the driveway. The truck was registered to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">It appeared to Groom that the driver of the truck had taken too wide a turn when attempting to enter the driveway. Groom believed that the circumstances indicated that the person who had been driving the truck may have been impaired and, with that in mind, he \u201cwent to look for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>an impaired driver at the residence.\u201d Groom, who was in uniform, knocked on the door of the residence, and it was answered by defendant\u2019s wife. She told Groom that she had been driving the truck and had gotten stuck in the ditch when she swerved to avoid hitting a dog, but Groom did not believe that she was being truthful. A second deputy, Avery, who had arrived at the residence near the same time as Groom, was also present while Groom spoke with defendant\u2019s wife. Groom then asked Avery to go across the street and speak to the witness who had called in the report about the truck, and Avery did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">While he was talking with defendant\u2019s wife, Groom saw defendant, who appeared to be very intoxicated, \u201cstaggering around in the house.\u201d Defendant then sat down on the couch in the view of Groom. Groom asked defendant, who is hard of hearing, to come out and speak with him and, in response, defendant went out on the porch or front landing of the residence. Immediately after defendant went outside, he walked with Groom \u201cinto a flat area where [Groom intended] to have [defendant] perform field sobriety tests.\u201d Groom then read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights because he was conducting an investigation of a possible DUII or \u201csome kind of crime.\u201d Defendant acknowledged that he understood those rights. Groom then asked defendant for permission to pat him down for weapons \u2014 Groom\u2019s \u201ccommon practice\u201d after giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings \u2014 and defendant agreed. While conducting the patdown, Groom located the keys to the truck in defendant\u2019s pocket. Thereafter, defendant made incriminating statements and was subsequently arrested for DUII.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Before trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress, asserting that he had been unlawfully seized before the pat-down search and that evidence obtained as a result must be suppressed under Article I, section 9, and the Fourth Amendment. After holding a hearing, the court denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress, arguing that, under the state and federal constitutions, Groom\u2019s actions in coming to his residence, asking him to come out and talk, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>reading him <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and asking for consent to pat him down amounted to a stop. Further, he asserts that the stop was not justified by reasonable suspicion. <em>See State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 80, 854 P2d 421 (1993) (\u201c[I]f a police officer is able to point to specific and articulable facts that give rise to a reasonable inference that a person has committed a crime, the officer has \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019 and hence may stop the person for investigation.\u201d). The state, for its part, does not contend that there was reasonable suspicion to support a stop or that, if the encounter amounted to a stop, suppression of the evidence is not required. Rather, the state argues only that, \u201c[b]ecause asking defendant to come outside, reading him his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and asking for consent to pat him down did not effect a stop, the trial court correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Thus, the question we must resolve in this case is whether the encounter amounted to a stop. Under Article I, section 9, individuals are guaranteed the right to be \u201csecure in their persons *** against unreasonable search, or seizure.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because \u201c[n]ot all governmental intrusions trigger the protections guaranteed\u201d by Article I, section 9, \u201cwe must first decide whether the action is either a \u2018search\u2019 or a \u2018seizure\u2019 within the meaning of that section.\u201d <em>State v. Juarez-Godinez, </em>326 Or 1, 5, 942 P2d 772 (1997).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">\u201c\u2018Analytically, police-citizen encounters typically fall into one of three categories that correlate the degree of intrusiveness on a citizen\u2019s liberty with the degree of justification required for the intrusion. At one end of the continuum are mere encounters for which no justification is required. At the other end are arrests, which involve protracted custodial restraint and require probable cause. In between are temporary detentions for investigatory purposes, often termed \u201cstops,\u201d which generally require reasonable suspicion. Both stops and arrests are seizures for constitutional purposes, while less restrictive encounters are not.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-7\"><em>State v. Backstrand, </em>354 Or 392, 399, 313 P3d 1084 (2013) (quoting <em>State v. Fair, </em>353 Or 588, 593-94, 302 P3d 417 (2013)). \u201cThe thing that distinguishes \u2018seizures\u2019 *** from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>encounters that are \u2018mere conversation\u2019 is the imposition, either by physical force or through some \u2018show of authority,\u2019 of some restraint on an individual\u2019s liberty.\u201d <em>State v. Ashbaugh, </em>349 Or 297, 309, 244 P3d 360 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or 610, 621-22, 227 P3d 695 (2010)). The test to determine whether a seizure has occurred under Article I, section 9, \u201cis an objective one: Would a reasonable person believe that a law enforcement officer intentionally and significantly restricted, interfered with, or otherwise deprived the individual of his or her liberty or freedom of movement.\u201d <em>Backstrand, </em>354 Or at 399 (citing <em>Ashbaugh, </em>349 Or at 316). The \u201cinquiry is necessarily fact-specific and requires an examination of the totality of the circumstances involved.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">As the court in <em>Backstrand </em>observed, \u201cthe constitutional concern is with police-imposed restraints on citizen liberty, not with limiting contacts between police and citizens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 400. Therefore, police may \u201c\u2018approach persons on the street or in public places, seek their cooperation or assistance, request or impart information, or question them.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Holmes, </em>311 Or 400, 410, 813 P2d 28 (1991)). A seizure occurs only where the officer\u2019s conduct \u201cwould cause the citizen to reasonably believe that the officer is intentionally restraining the citizen\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement in a significant way \u2014 that is, in a way that exceeds the bounds of ordinary social encounters between private citizens.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Thus, the concept of a \u201cshow of authority,\u201d in this context, refers to \u201ca reasonable perception that an officer is exercising his or her official authority to restrain,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 401; that is, \u201c[e]xplicitly or implicitly, an officer must convey to the person with whom he is dealing, either by word, action, or both, that the person is not free to terminate the encounter or otherwise go about his or her ordinary affairs,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 400-01. A constitutionally significant \u201cshow of authority\u201d can be inferred from \u201cthe content of the questions [asked by a police officer], the manner of asking them, or other actions that police take (along with the circumstances in which they take them).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412. Under those principles, for example, a \u201cmere request for identification made by an officer in the course of an otherwise lawful police-citizen encounter does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>not, in and of itself, result in a seizure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410; <em>cf. State v. Rodriguez-Perez, </em>262 Or App 206, 212, 325 P3d 39 (2014) (where officers approached the defendant and his brother, told them that they suspected that the men were violating the law, asked for identification, and returned to their patrol car to verify the validity of the identification, \u201c[u]nder the principles articulated in <em>Backstrand, </em>[the] circumstances were sufficiently coercive to result in a seizure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">In this case, were we to look at each piece of the encounter between defendant and the officer independently, we would not necessarily conclude that any one piece, standing alone, amounted to a stop. For example, an officer may, generally, approach a citizen\u2019s front door and knock on it without effecting a seizure. <em>See State v. Portrey, </em>134 Or App 460, 464, 896 P2d 7 (1995) (\u201c[A]bsent evidence of an intent to exclude, an occupant impliedly consents to people walking to the front door and knocking on it, because of social and legal norms of behavior.\u201d). Likewise, we could not conclude that an officer\u2019s request that a person come out of a residence to talk to the officer, on its own, constitutes a stop. <em>See State v. Shaw, </em>230 Or App 257, 262-63, 215 P3d 105, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 365 (2009) (an officer\u2019s request that the defendant come over and speak with him was not a stop); <em>cf. State v. Dahl, </em>323 Or 199, 207-08, 915 P2d 979 (1996) (police order that the defendant come out of the house with his hands up was an unlawful seizure under Article I, section 9, because it effectively \u201cdeprived [the] defendant of any choice in the matter\u201d). For the same reason, an officer\u2019s suggestion that a person walk together with the officer may not evidence a stop. <em>See State v. Crandall, </em>197 Or App 591, 595, 108 P3d 16 (2005), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>340 Or 645, 136 P3d 30 (2006) (a person is stopped \u201cif the individual is forced to alter his course of conduct or is summoned away from a task\u201d). Nor would an officer\u2019s request for consent to conduct a patdown search alone amount to a stop. <em>See State v. Kinkade, </em>247 Or App 595, 599-601, 270 P3d 371 (2012) (the defendant was not stopped when an officer walked up to him on the street, asked if he could talk with him, and then inquired if he could pat him down). However, the inquiry is not whether each of the officer\u2019s actions here, examined separately, would convey to a reasonable person that the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>was not \u201cfree to terminate the encounter or otherwise go about his or her ordinary affairs.\u201d <em>Backstrand, </em>354 Or at 401-02. Rather, the question is whether all of the officer\u2019s actions combine to form a whole greater than the sum of its parts; that is, whether, based on the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would believe that the officer had intentionally and significantly deprived defendant of his freedom of movement.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">We note that the state appears to be of the view that the officer\u2019s giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings should not be a consideration in whether defendant was stopped. It cites the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Ayles, </em>348 Or 622, 237 P3d 805 (2010), as support for its contention that \u201cgiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings should not be taken as effecting a restraint on a person\u2019s liberty.\u201d In <em>Ayles, </em>the court did not address the question of whether the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is a factor to be considered in evaluating whether a person was stopped for purposes of Article I, section 9. Instead, in that case, the court considered whether the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings attenuated a prior illegality and, in that context, evaluated whether \u201cthe giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings itself has a coercive effect that negates the vol-untariness of subsequent statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635. The court observed that the \u201cgiving of the warnings, which is intended to assure voluntariness, cannot be used * * * to prove a contrary theory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">That, of course, is not the issue in this case. Rather, here, we must evaluate the totality of the circumstances before the patdown to determine whether a reasonable person, in those circumstances, would have believed that the officer had significantly deprived him or her of his or her liberty or freedom of movement. In our view, the officer\u2019s giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is a factor to be considered in determining whether the officer\u2019s actions conveyed a restraint on defendant\u2019s liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">In <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 US 436, 444, 86 S Ct 1602, 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966), the Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution required that particular warnings be given when \u201ca person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>freedom in any significant way.\u201d The Oregon Supreme Court requires the same warnings in those circumstances under Article I, section 12, of the Oregon Constitution. <em>See State v. Shaff, </em>343 Or 639, 645, 175 P3d 454 (2007) <em>CMiranda </em>warnings are required only where a person is in full custody or \u201cin circumstances that create a setting which judges would and officers should recognize to be compelling\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Those warnings are that a person \u201chas a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 444. Analogously, a person is not entitled to the presence of an attorney during a police interview unless the person \u201cis in custody, <em>i.e., </em>not free to leave\u201d (under Article I, section 12) or \u201chis or her freedom has been \u2018significantly restrained\u2019\u201d (under the Fifth Amendment). <em>State v. Terry, </em>333 Or 163, 172, 37 P3d 157 (2001). Thus, when an officer informs a person that he is entitled to the presence of an attorney during the course of further conversation with the officer, it would generally be reasonable to conclude that that entitlement is because the person \u201cis in custody, <em>i.e., </em>not free to leave.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the popular understanding of <em>Miranda </em>warnings is that they are given when an individual is placed under arrest. <em>See Commonwealth v. Donaldson, </em>786 A2d 279, 285 (2001) (\u201cIt is our belief that the average layperson would equate being <em>Mirandized </em>with being placed in police custody.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The reasoning of the Florida Supreme Court in <em>Caldwell v. State, </em>41 So 3d 188, 201-02 (2010), is instructive. There, discussing the reading of <em>Miranda </em>warnings in determining whether a defendant was stopped under the Fourth Amendment, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\"><em>\u201cMiranda </em>warnings are a formality of arrest and are required <em>only </em>at the time of an arrest or prior to custodial interrogation. Further, the warnings are associated in the public mind with the spectacle of an individual being placed under arrest. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to conclude that an individual who is given <em>Miranda </em>warnings during what begins as a consensual encounter may interpret those warnings as a restraint on his or her freedom. For this reason, courts that have considered the application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>Miranda </em>in the context of an on-the-street police encounter have generally found it to be at least a factor in determining whether an individual has been subjected to an illegal investigatory stop under the Fourth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., [United States </em>v.] <em>Poitier, </em>818 F2d [679, 683 (8th Cir 1987)]; <em>United States v. Lara, </em>638 F2d 892, 898 n 10 (5th Cir 1981) (\u2018Giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings in a police-citizen encounter which is otherwise a nondetention interrogation may very well elevate such an encounter to a seizure * * * in light of the public\u2019s association of <em>Miranda </em>warnings with an arrest.\u2019); <em>see also United States v. Montgomery, </em>377 F2d 582, 587 (6th Cir 2004) (noting that the district court listed the reading of <em>Miranda </em>rights as one factor indicating that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would not have felt free to leave).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\">\u201cThis conclusion on the part of a reasonable person would be further supported by the fact that outside the context of an arrest or custodial interrogation, not all of the stated rights apply. In particular, <em>Miranda </em>requires that suspects be advised that they have the right to an attorney and that if they cannot afford an attorney one will be provided for them. * * * While this advisory warning is true during a custodial interrogation, it is not true during a consensual encounter or investigatory stop.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">(Footnote omitted; emphasis in original.) We have implied much of the same in <em>State v. Cordray, </em>91 Or App 436, 442, 755 P2d 735 (1988) (\u201cWe conclude that a stop did not occur until the officers approached defendant and began reciting his rights to him.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In this case, we are not called upon to determine whether the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings in the course of a police interview, by itself, constitutes a sufficient \u201cshow of authority\u201d to create a constitutional seizure. <em>See Caldwell, </em>41 So 3d at 203 (concluding that there was no stop when officers gave the defendant <em>Miranda </em>warnings and informed him that he was not under arrest but that the officer merely wanted to make sure that the defendant was aware of his rights). Rather, it is the totality of the circumstances here that would have conveyed to a reasonable person that he or she was not free to end the encounter and depart. The officer, accompanied initially by a second officer, approached defendant\u2019s residence in the evening and spoke with defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>wife to ask about criminal conduct. At least part of that conversation was in defendant\u2019s presence. Although defendant\u2019s wife gave an explanation for the location of the truck, the officer did not accept that explanation and asked defendant, who was seated inside the house, to come outside and talk. At that point, a reasonable person in defendant\u2019s shoes would have concluded that he or she was the subject of a criminal investigation. Once defendant was outside on the porch, the officer then walked defendant to a flat area so that he could conduct field sobriety tests. By then, defendant\u2019s course of conduct had been altered twice by the police actions in beckoning him to the porch and then leading him into a flat area for field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The officer also read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>warnings and asked for consent to conduct a patdown search. Given that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are required only in circumstances where a person is <em>not </em>free to leave (where a person is arrested or in compelling circumstances), a person given those warnings in circumstances like those here would interpret them as communicating some restraint on his or her freedom. Finally, in context, the request for a patdown search implied that a search was constitutionally appropriate, that it was necessary either because defendant would remain in the officer\u2019s presence for some time and therefore present a risk to the officer\u2019s safety or because defendant was being searched incident to being taken into custody. Either implication contributes to the reasonable conclusion in this context that defendant was detained. <em>Compare Ashbaugh, </em>349 Or at 317-18 (\u201cAlthough it is possible to restrict a person\u2019s liberty and freedom of movement by purely verbal means,\u201d a request to search purse did not amount to a seizure under Article I, section 9, because the preceding conversation between the police officer and the defendant was \u201crelaxed and nonconfrontational\u201d and the \u201ccontent\u201d of the questions could not be perceived as a \u201cshow of authority\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In short, under all of the circumstances presented here, we conclude that the officer\u2019s actions constituted a show of authority such that a reasonable person would have believed that the officer had intentionally and significantly restricted, interfered with, or otherwise deprived the individual of his or her liberty or freedom of movement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Accordingly, the encounter in the case was a stop, and the trial court erred in denying the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-8\"> We begin by considering defendant\u2019s contentions under state law. <em>See State v.

The majority focuses on two aspects of the encounter: the giving of <em>Miranda </em>warnings and what it characterizes as two alterations in \u201cdefendant\u2019s course of conduct *** by the police actions in beckoning him to the porch and then leading him into a flat area for field sobriety tests.\u201d 263 Or App at 588. With respect, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">As the Supreme Court recently explained in <em>State v. Backstrand, </em>354 Or 392, 402 n 11, 313 P3d 1084 (2013), in determining whether an encounter between a police officer and another person amounted to a \u201cstop\u201d of that person, a court\u2019s analysis should focus on \u201cthe officer\u2019s words and actions and what <em>they </em>would convey to a reasonable person.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Thus, the question this case presents is whether a reasonable person would believe that the deputy had \u201cintentionally and significantly restricted, interfered with, or otherwise deprived [defendant] of his or her liberty or freedom of movement,\u201d when the deputy asked defendant if he could speak with him, walked with defendant to the \u201cflat area,\u201d read him <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and requested consent to pat him down. <em>Id. </em>at 399; <em>see also id. </em>at 402 (\u201cAgain, what is required is a show of authority by which, through words or action, the officer\u2019s conduct reasonably conveys that the officer is exercising his or her authority to significantly restrain the citizen\u2019s liberty or freedom of movement.\u201d). I would hold that the deputy\u2019s questions and actions did not have that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">First, the deputy\u2019s requests of defendant \u2014 that he come outside to speak with the deputy and that he allow the deputy to perform a patdown search (as well, perhaps, as an implicit request that defendant walk with the deputy to the \u201cflat area\u201d) \u2014 would not, standing alone, constitute a stop. In that regard, it is worth emphasizing that the deputy did not, at any point in the encounter, order defendant to move in a particular direction or otherwise change his physical location. The deputy repeatedly denied having ordered defendant out of his house, and the trial court found that the deputy merely asked defendant to come outside. Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that the deputy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>directed </em>defendant to follow him to the \u201cflat area\u201d where he intended to administer field sobriety tests. Accordingly, I do not find the same significance that the majority does in defendant\u2019s movement from inside the house to the flat area outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">Because the deputy\u2019s requests were just that\u2014 requests \u2014 they did not, alone, constitute a stop. \u201cRather, something more than just asking a question, requesting information, or seeking an individual\u2019s cooperation is required\u201d before an officer can be said to have made \u201ca \u2018threatening or coercive\u2019 show of authority requiring compliance with the officer\u2019s request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403 (quoting <em>State v. Ashbaugh, </em>349 Or 297, 317, 244 P3d 360 (2010)). Here, the majority finds that \u201csomething more\u201d in the deputy\u2019s reading of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, which the majority describes as communicating that defendant had been arrested or otherwise was in compelling circumstances that had restrained his freedom. 263 Or App at 588. I agree that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings\u2014 at least, the recitation that defendant had a right to legal counsel \u2014 could reasonably suggest that defendant was the subject of a criminal investigation, perhaps even that the deputy believed that he had <em>reason </em>to detain defendant. However, that does not resolve the question of whether defendant was stopped. Rather, the question remains whether a reasonable person would conclude that the officer\u2019s words or actions <em>in fact </em>amounted to a significant restraint on defendant\u2019s liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The majority\u2019s conclusion that the circumstances described above amounted to a stop is implicitly based on the notion that a law enforcement officer seizes a person if the officer\u2019s words or actions convey to the person that he or she is the subject of a criminal investigation. That conclusion is consistent with much of our <em>pre-Backstrand </em>case law. See, <em>e.g., State v. Dierks, </em>257 Or App 88, 95, 306 P3d 653 (2013), <em>decision vac\u2019d by order, </em>354 Or 837 (2014) (concluding that the defendant had been stopped because \u201ca reasonable person in defendant\u2019s circumstances * * * would have believed that *** she was being subjected to a criminal investigation and was, therefore, not free to leave\u201d). In my view, however, it conflicts with <em>Backstrand </em>and other recent Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Court decisions. In <em>Backstrand </em>itself, Justice Walters wrote a concurring opinion in which she explained her view that a police officer\u2019s interaction with the defendant amounted to a stop \u201cbecause the officer\u2019s communication and conduct would cause a reasonable person in [the] defendant\u2019s position to believe that he was the subject of a criminal investigation and therefore that he must stop, respond, and remain until the immediate investigation was complete.\u201d 354 Or at 418 (Walters, J., concurring in the judgment).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The majority, however, \u201cdecline [d] to debate whether a person in [the] defendant\u2019s position would have believed he was the subject of a \u2018criminal investigation\u2019\u201d because, it held, \u201cthe fact that an officer asks a citizen for cooperation <em>in the course of conducting a criminal investigation </em>is not a talisman in the [stop] analysis, as it is for Justice Walters.\u201d 354 Or at 396 n 4 (emphasis added). Thus, under <em>Backstrand, </em>a person may reasonably believe, based on an officer\u2019s words or conduct, that he or she is the subject of a criminal investigation, yet not have been <em>stopped </em>by the officer\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The Supreme Court emphasized that point in other cases that it decided on the same day as <em>Backstrand. </em>In <em>State v. Anderson, </em>354 Or 440, 313 P3d 1113 (2013), the court addressed the constitutionality of an interaction between police officers and two individuals who arrived at an apartment complex where the officers were executing a search warrant. The individuals, including the defendant, approached the apartment that was the focus of the warrant, but they briskly returned to their car after they saw officers searching the living room. <em>Id. </em>at 443. Three of the officers followed the individuals back to their car, explained that they were executing a search warrant, and said they were contacting the defendant and his companion to find out who they were, \u201cwhat interest they might have had\u201d with what the officers were doing at the apartment, or whether they knew the person who lived there. <em>Id. </em>The officers also asked the defendant and his companion for identification. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>denied that he had identification with him and gave a name that one of the officers knew was incorrect. That officer said to the defendant \u201cyou\u2019re not him, I recognize you,\u201d and asked the defendant to step out of the car. <em>Id. </em>at 444. The officer again asked the defendant whether he had identification, the defendant produced identification, and the officer \u201cran a warrant check on defendant\u201d and discovered that he was wanted on an outstanding arrest warrant. <em>Id. </em>The defendant unsuccessfully moved to suppress evidence that the officers subsequently discovered. <em>Id. </em>at 445-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\">On review, the Supreme Court addressed whether the officers seized the defendant before they asked him to get out of the car. The court held that no seizure occurred before that point, even though the officers\u2019 explanation of what they were doing at the apartment complex \u201cobjectively conveyed possible suspicion that [the defendant and his companion] could be involved in criminal activity related to the apartment\u201d and \u201cequally conveyed that the officers were interested in whatever information the two might be able to provide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453. \u201cIn all events,\u201d the court explained, \u201cby those brief verbal exchanges and inquiries alone, the officers did not communicate an exercise of authority of the kind required for a <em>seizure </em>\u2014 i.e., authority to restrain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court found significant that the uniformed officers \u201ctook no physical action other than to approach the parked car\u201d and \u201crequested no physical action from defendant and the driver at that point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453-54. Even though there was one more officer present than there were people in the car, the circumstances \u201cwould not cause a reasonable person seated in the car to believe that the officers were significantly restricting his or her liberty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 454. The court went on to conclude that the defendant <em>was </em>seized later in the encounter, after an officer \u201cexpressed disbelief in defendant\u2019s identification of himself\u2019 and made \u201crequests\u201d that the defendant and his companion exit their car in a way that, under the circumstances, a reasonable person would have understood as \u201cdirectives\u201d that significantly restrained the defendant\u2019s liberty. <em>Id. </em>That later seizure, however, was justified, because once the defendant gave a false name to the officers, they had reasonable suspicion to detain him. <em>Id. </em>at 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Dissenting justices disagreed with the <em>Anderson </em>majority\u2019s analysis of when a seizure of the defendant occurred, focusing on whether the defendant would have believed that he was the subject of a criminal investigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-4\">\u201cWhen considered in combination, the facts that the officers were in the process of conducting a drug investigation, that the officers indicated that they considered defendant a potential suspect in that investigation, and that the officers asserted physical authority over defendant by surrounding the car in which he was seated, add up to a show of authority that would have conveyed to a reasonable person that he was the subject of a criminal investigation and therefore was not free to leave or go about his ordinary business until the immediate investigation was completed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 457 (Walters, J., dissenting). Again, the majority of the court rejected that focus on whether the defendant would have believed the officers were investigating him for possible criminal activity, focusing instead on whether a reasonable person would understand that the officers had engaged \u201cin a \u2018show of authority\u2019 that, explicitly or implicitly, reasonably conveys to the person a significant restriction on the person\u2019s freedom to terminate the encounter or otherwise go about his or her ordinary affairs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Highley, </em>354 Or 459, 313 P3d 1068 (2013), the Supreme Court held that a patrol officer did not stop the defendant when the officer \u2014 who previously had been interacting with defendant\u2019s companion \u2014 spoke with the defendant (who was, along with his companions, \u201cmilling around\u201d in the parking lot of an apartment complex), asked the defendant whether he was \u201cstill on probation,\u201d requested the defendant\u2019s identification, used the information that he obtained from the defendant\u2019s license to check defendant\u2019s probationary status (as the defendant had asserted, he was no longer on probation), asked the defendant for consent to search, and then \u2014 after the defendant said that he would empty his pockets for the officer and, in doing so, attempted to hide items in his hand \u2014 repeatedly asked the defendant about the items he was removing from his pockets and what he was doing with his hands. <em>Id. </em>at 462-64.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> None of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>events resulted in a seizure, because the officer\u2019s actions did not \u201cconvey a restraint on [the] defendant\u2019s liberty,\u201d but instead, the officer made \u201cverbal inquiries only\u201d that \u201cwere not seizures.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">As in <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Backstrand, </em>a <em>separate </em>opinion in <em>Highley </em>focused on whether a police officer\u2019s inquiries would lead \u201ca reasonable person [to] believe that he or she is being subjected to a criminal investigation and therefore must stop, respond, and remain until the immediate investigation is complete.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486 (Walters, J., dissenting). In such circumstances, the <em>Highley </em>dissent would have held, \u201cthe officer effects a seizure under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Walters, J., dissenting). But that was the dissenting view.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Considering the majority, dissenting, and concurring opinions in <em>Backstrand, Anderson, </em>and <em>Highley, </em>I derive the general principle that a police officer does not stop a person merely by making inquiries or by seeking information from the person in a way that reasonably could suggest that the person is the subject of a criminal investigation. Rather, the officer must say or do \u201csomething more\u201d that \u201cwould reasonably be construed as a \u2018threatening or coercive\u2019 show of authority requiring compliance with the officer\u2019s request.\u201d <em>Backstrand, </em>354 Or at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Applying that principle here, I would hold that, although standard <em>Miranda </em>warnings may have suggested to defendant that he was the subject of a criminal investigation, that suggestion did not (either alone or in combination with the interactions between the deputy sheriff and defendant that preceded it) constitute a stop. The remaining question is whether, in some other respect, the <em>Miranda </em>warnings constituted the kind of \u201csomething more\u201d that can transform an encounter into a stop. I would hold that they did not. The \u201csomething more\u201d must be a police officer\u2019s words or actions that communicate that a person is required to comply with whatever subsequent requests the officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>may make. <em>Backstrand, </em>354 Or at 403; <em>see Anderson, </em>354 Or at 454 (The defendant was stopped when, in the totality of the circumstances, the defendant would have understood \u201cofficers\u2019 \u2018requests\u2019 to exit the car to be directives and would believe that his or her liberty was significantly restrained.\u201d). Here, the <em>Miranda </em>warnings would not have had that effect. By their very nature, the warnings explicitly communicate that a person is <em>not </em>required to speak with the police officer, thus at least implicitly communicating that the person is not required to comply with, for example, any subsequent request for consent to search. <em>See State v. Ayles, </em>348 Or 622, 635-36, 237 P3d 805 (2010) (\u201cThe giving of <em>[Miranda] </em>warnings * * * is intended to assure voluntariness\u201d and, therefore, \u201ccannot be used * * * to prove a contrary theory\u201d; rejecting the Court of Appeals\u2019 suggestion that the warnings could perpetuate a \u201cperson\u2019s perception that his or her liberty continued to be restrained as the officer pursued a criminal investigation by seeking consent to a search.\u201d). Because the deputy\u2019s recitation of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings did not communicate that defendant was required to comply with the deputy\u2019s subsequent requests, that recitation did not effect a seizure under Article I, section 9, either considered standing alone or in combination with the events that preceded it.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">For similar reasons, I would conclude that defendant was not seized for purposes of the analysis under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. \u201cA person is seized by the police and thus entitled to challenge the government\u2019s action under the Fourth Amendment when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, terminates or restrains his freedom of movement.\u201d <em>Brendlin v. California, </em>551 US 249, 254, 127 S Ct 2400, 168 L Ed 2d 132 (2007) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). As under Article I, section 9, a \u201cfeel-free-to-leave formulation does \u2018not state the entire [federal] test for a \u201cseizure\u201d of a person by a non-forcible \u201cshow of authority.\u2019\u201d\u201d <em>Backstrand, </em>354 Or at 402 n 11 (quoting <em>State v. Holmes, </em>311 Or 400, 413, 813 P2d 28 (1991)). Rather, \u201cthe requirement that a reasonable person would not have felt free to leave is a <em>\u2018necessary </em>\u2019 condition for a \u2018seizure\u2019 of a person but not a <em>\u2018sufficient\u2019 </em>one where no force is used.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>311 Or at 413 (quoting <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 US 621, 628, 111 S Ct 1547, 113 L Ed 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>690 (1991) (emphasis in <em>Hodari D.). </em>The Oregon Supreme Court recently has explained that, \u201c[u]nder that more complete articulation of the federal test [found in <em>Hodari </em>D.], the analysis of what constitutes a seizure under Article I, section 9, and under the Fourth Amendment is not meaningfully different.\u201d <em>Backstrand, </em>354 Or at 402 n 11. Accordingly, having determined that defendant was not seized for purposes of Article I, section 9,1 also would hold that he was not seized for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">In short, defendant had not been stopped at the time he consented to the patdown search, and the trial court therefore correctly denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence discovered as a result of that search. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\"> The deputy first testified that he \u201cask[ed] \u201d defendant if he could speak with him, and responded affirmatively when questioned whether he had \u201cask[ed] the defendant out of the house.\u201d In addition, the deputy specifically denied having ordered defendant to leave the house. However, when the deputy was cross-examined about the sequence of events, he responded, \u201cYeah,\u201d when asked whether he had told defendant to come out of the house. But the deputy subsequently clarified that he had <em>not </em>ordered defendant to come to the door, and reiterated that he had only asked defendant to do so. The trial court found that the deputy \u201casked [defendant] to step outside.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b609-9\"> The deputy did not explain exactly what he said when he read defendant his <em>\u201cMiranda </em>rights.\u201d Accordingly, I, like the majority, presume that the deputy read defendant the standard advice of rights under <em>Miranda, </em>including the right to counsel. <em>See State v. Acremant, </em>338 Or 302, 318 n 13, 108 P3d 1139 (2005) (describing <em>Miranda </em>warnings).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b612-5\"> Despite her disagreement with the <em>Backstrand </em>court\u2019s determination that no stop had occurred, Justice Walters concurred in the Supreme Court\u2019s ultimate decision that the officer had not <em>unlawfully </em>stopped the defendant because, she concluded, the stop \u201cwas constitutionally justified.\u201d 354 Or at 419 (Walters, J., concurring in the judgment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b614-7\"> Toward the end of that \u201cgame of \u2018cat and mouse,\u2019\u201d another officer saw a small baggie in the defendant\u2019s fist, and subsequent events led to the discovery of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>baggies that contained methamphetamine. <em>Id. </em>at 465, 470.
