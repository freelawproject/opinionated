In their amended complaint, plaintiffs seek, in addition to other relief, a declaration that defendants \u201chave violated their duties to uphold the public trust and protect the State\u2019s atmosphere as well as the water, land, fishery, and wildlife resources from the impacts of climate change.\u201d Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on the ground that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The trial court granted that motion. On plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On appeal from dismissal of a Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act complaint for a purported lack of subject matter jurisdiction, our task is to determine whether the complaint states a justiciable claim for relief under that Act, that is, one that the trial court had jurisdiction to adjudicate. <em>See Hale v. State of Oregon, </em>259 Or App 379, 383, 314 P3d 345 (2013), <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 840 (2014) (\u201cCourts cannot exercise jurisdiction over nonjusticiable controversies because a court cannot render advisory opinions.\u201d); <em>Beck v. City of Portland, </em>202 Or App 360, 367-68, 122 P3d 131 (2005) (\u201c[w]here a defendant brings a motion to dismiss a claim for declaratory relief* * * on the ground that the claim is not justiciable, the defendant is, in fact, asserting that the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction[.]\u201d). In doing so, \u201cwe assume the truth of all well-pleaded facts alleged in the complaint,\u201d and review the trial court\u2019s ruling on the jurisdictional question for errors of law. <em>Hale, </em>259 Or App at 382.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Accordingly, we begin by reviewing the allegations in plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint. Those allegations are based on plaintiffs\u2019 conception of \u201cthe public trust doctrine,\u201d which, they assert, obligates defendants \u201cto hold vital natural resources in trust for the benefit of their citizens.\u201d Plaintiffs allege that the public trust doctrine \u201cstems from the common law and Constitutional and statutory provisions\u201d and finds its origin in \u201cthe law of nature\u201d that \u201cthese things are common to mankind \u2014 the air, running water, the sea, and the shores of the sea.\u201d They identify specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>natural resources as assets of that trust, including certain \u201cwater resources,\u201d \u201cState owned lands,\u201d and \u201cthe air or atmosphere.\u201d Plaintiffs claim that defendants have a \u201cfiduciary duty under the public trust doctrine * * * to protect common uses\u201d of the resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Following that broad description of the public trust doctrine as they conceive it, plaintiffs allege that the state has failed to meet its fiduciary obligations to protect the natural resources that plaintiffs identify as assets of the public trust. Plaintiffs assert that increases in greenhouse gas emissions are causing climate changes with potentially \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d to the state\u2019s natural resources and the health of its citizens. Nonetheless, plaintiffs contend, \u201c[t]here is still time to curb and reduce carbon dioxide emissions to avoid irrevocable changes to the atmosphere,\u201d and they specifically allege that, \u201cto protect Oregon\u2019s public trust assets, the best available science concludes that concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide cannot exceed 350 parts per million.\u201d To reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations to that level by the end of the century, plaintiffs claim, emissions \u201cmust begin to decline at a global average of at least 6 percent each year, beginning in 2013, through 2050,\u201d and should decline at five percent per year after that.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Plaintiffs acknowledge in the amended complaint that Oregon officials have taken steps meant to combat climate change, including through the 2004 establishment of the Governor\u2019s Advisory Group on Global Warming, which has developed a plan to reduce Oregon\u2019s greenhouse-gas emissions, the subsequent passage of HB 3543 (2007), which set goals for decreasing greenhouse-gas emissions and levels in Oregon through 2050, and establishment of the Oregon Climate Change Research Institute (OCCRI) in 2007. Plaintiffs allege, however, that those steps \u201care inadequate to meet the State\u2019s greenhouse gas reductions that will be required in order to protect Oregon\u2019s trust assets and attain carbon dioxide concentrations of 350 ppm\u201d and that Oregon already is failing to meet its goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint includes a single claim for relief, in which plaintiffs reiterate their allegation that defendants have a fiduciary obligation \u201cto hold vital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>natural resources in trust for the benefit of their citizens,\u201d including the atmosphere. Plaintiffs contend that defendants\u2019 alleged \u201cfailure to regulate and reduce carbon dioxide emissions\u201d and their alleged \u201cfailure to preserve and protect carbon sinks such as forests, soils and agricultural land\u201d amount to a breach of that fiduciary duty. Plaintiffs request the following relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">\u201c[1.] A declaration that the atmosphere is a trust resource, and that the State of Oregon, as a trustee, has a fiduciary obligation to protect the atmosphere as a commonly shared public trust resource from the impacts of climate change for Plaintiffs and for present and future generations of Oregonians.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">\u201c[2.] A declaration that water resources, navigable waters, submerged and submersible lands, islands, shore-lands, coastal areas, wildlife, and fish are trust resources, and that the State of Oregon, as a trustee, has a fiduciary obligation to protect these assets as commonly shared public trust resources from the impacts of climate change for Plaintiffs and for present and future generations of Oregonians.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">\u201c[3.] A declaration that Defendants have failed to uphold their fiduciary obligations to protect these trust assets for the benefits of Plaintiffs as well as current and future generations of Oregonians by failing adequately to regulate and reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the State of Oregon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-7\">\u201c[4.] An order requiring Defendants to prepare, or cause to be prepared, a full and accurate accounting of Oregon\u2019s current carbon dioxide emissions and to do so annually thereafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-8\">\u201c[5.] An order requiring Defendants to develop and implement a carbon reduction plan that will protect trust assets by abiding by the best available science.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">\u201c[6.] A declaration that the best available science requires carbon dioxide emissions to peak in 2012 and to be reduced by a least six per cent each year until at least 2050.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Defendants did not file an answer to the amended complaint. Instead, they moved to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>court lacked authority to grant the declaratory and injunc-tive relief that plaintiffs sought. In doing so, defendants emphasized that their dismissal motion was <em>not </em>directed to the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding the scope of the public trust doctrine or defendants\u2019 obligations under it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-4\">\u201c[B]y agreement between counsel, this [motion and] memorandum does not address the existence of the public trust, the question of whether the state has met its duties under any such trust, or whether plaintiffs have effectively stated a claim that requires the [court] to decide those issues at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">(Footnote omitted.) Thus, defendants did <em>not </em>argue that plaintiffs were not entitled to the declarations they sought because those requested declarations misstated the law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, defendants argued solely that the trial court should dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 claim for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Broadly speaking, defendants\u2019 dismissal motion had two components, the first generally directed at the three requests for declarations regarding the public trust doctrine (numbered 1 through 3 in the list quoted above) and the obligations that plaintiffs assert it creates, and the second generally directed at the three requests for injunctive relief (numbered 4 through 6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With respect to the requests for declarations, defendants argued that the claim was not cognizable under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act because it impermissibly asked the trial court \u201cto create * * * legal obligations in the first instance\u201d rather than asking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the court \u201cto determine rights and legal relations under existing laws.\u201d According to defendants, plaintiffs were essentially asking the court \u201cto conjure up an atmospheric trust obligation wholly of its own design\u201d by \u201cengaging] in a free-ranging exploration of what the law may be, and then imposing] its newly-found laws upon the other branches of government.\u201d Defendants argued to the trial court that the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act \u201cdoes not grant [the court] such powers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">With respect to the requests for orders requiring defendants to take specific steps to combat climate change, defendants argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because \u201cthe relief that plaintiffs request would cause the court to run afoul of the separation of powers principle.\u201d In that regard, defendants argued that, if the court granted plaintiffs\u2019 requested injunctive relief, it would unduly burden the other branches of government by \u201ccompelling [those branches] to address the impacts of climate change in one way, and one way only \u2014 namely, by reducing carbon dioxide emissions in a specified amount over an established time-frame.\u201d For similar reasons, defendants argued, granting plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief would impermissibly \u201ccause the court to perform the \u2018functions\u2019 of the other branches, especially those of the legislature.\u201d Third, and relatedly, defendants asserted that the court lacks jurisdiction to award the requested declaratory or equitable relief under \u201cthe political question doctrine.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">In response to defendants\u2019 motion, plaintiffs argued that defendants had inappropriately focused on a small portion of the requested relief, <em>i.e., </em>plaintiffs\u2019 request for an order requiring defendants to take specified steps to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Plaintiffs emphasized their request for declarations \u201cregarding the governor\u2019s authority to protect public trust assets\u201d and argued that it was within the trial court\u2019s power to declare what resources the public trust doctrine protects. That kind of declaration, plaintiffs argued, \u201cfalls squarely within the judiciary\u2019s role to declare the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>The trial court agreed with each of defendants\u2019 arguments. The court initially focused on the fact that plaintiffs had not alleged that defendants had violated a specific constitutional or statutory provision but had alleged only that a broader-based public trust doctrine imposed obligations on defendants to protect certain natural resources:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\">\u201cPlaintiffs ask the Court to create and impose an affirmative duty on Defendants. Then, Plaintiffs argue that the Court should find that Defendants failed to meet this obligation. Plaintiffs argue that they are not asking the Court to <em>create </em>a new duty but merely to recognize a duty well supported by \u2018state sovereignty, the common law of Oregon, as well as in its statutes and the state Constitution.\u2019 However, the many statutes, cases, and constitutional provisions Plaintiffs cite to do not support their argument. * * * Thus, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief asks this Court to extend the law by creating a new duty rather than interpret a pre-existing law. Therefore, the Court concludes that the relief Plaintiffs seek exceeds the Court\u2019s authority under Oregon\u2019s Declaratory Judgment Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">(Citations omitted; emphasis in original.) The court also ruled that it could not grant plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief without violating separation-of-powers principles because the injunctive relief that plaintiffs sought \u2014 orders regarding specific carbon-dioxide reduction measures \u2014 asked the court both to \u201ceffectively \u2018strike down\u2019 \u201d existing legislation, displacing already established legislative goals and to engage in lawmaking functions that are constitutionally reserved to the legislature. Finally, the court concluded that plaintiffs essentially were asking the court to decide \u201cpolitical questions, which necessarily are decided by the political branches of government, not the judiciary.\u201d For all of those reasons, the trial court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to award declaratory or injunctive relief against defendants, and it granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">On appeal, plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to, at least, declarations that (1) defendants \u201chave an obligation to protect Oregon\u2019s water supply and other public trust resources from substantial impairment due to greenhouse gas emissions\u201d and (2) \u201cthat the atmosphere is a trust resource.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that the trial court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>statutory authority to declare the law in those respects and that doing so would not violate separation-of-powers or political-question principles because declarations in their favor would require defendants, not the court, \u201cto identify and implement measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d Thus, even if their requests for injunctive relief requiring defendants to take specific steps to combat climate change \u201cwere over-stepping,\u201d plaintiffs contend, the trial court should have ruled in defendants\u2019 favor only with respect to those requests, instead of dismissing the entire case. Plaintiffs also argue that even their requests for specific injunctive relief could be granted without violating separation-of-powers or political-question principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">In response, defendants largely reiterate the arguments they presented to the trial court, except that they no longer argue that plaintiffs\u2019 requests for declaratory relief are not cognizable under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. Defendants assert that this court need not resolve that question \u201cbecause regardless whether plaintiffs\u2019 claim falls within the scope of the [Act], defendants\u2019 justi-ciability arguments are dispositive.\u201d Defendants\u2019 argument on appeal has two parts. First, they contend that plaintiffs\u2019 request for \u201ca bare declaration that a public trust exists in the atmosphere\u201d is not justiciable because no \u201cmeaningful and practical relief * * * could spring from such a declaration.\u201d Second, focusing on plaintiffs\u2019 requests for orders requiring defendants to take specific steps to combat climate change, defendants argue that the court could not grant such relief without violating separation-of-powers and political-question principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">We reject defendants\u2019 suggestion that we need not decide whether plaintiffs\u2019 claims are cognizable under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. In our view, this case turns entirely on a proper understanding of the scope of judicial authority under that Act, and we begin our analysis there.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act starts by broadly describing the judicial power to declare the law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">\u201cCourts of record within their respective jurisdictions shall have power to declare rights, status, and other legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>relations, whether or not further relief is or could be claimed. No action or proceedings shall be open to objection on the ground that a declaratory judgment is prayed for. The declaration may be either affirmative or negative in form and effect, and such declarations shall have the force and effect of a judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">ORS 28.010.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The next provision in the Act refers to declarations of rights under certain laws and writings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201cAny person *** whose rights, status or other legal relations are affected by a constitution, statute, municipal charter, ordinance, contract or franchise may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under any such * * * constitution, statute, municipal charter, ordinance, contract or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status or other legal relations thereunder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">ORS 28.020. Other provisions are even more specific, being directed to contracts, ORS 28.030, and matters related to trusts and estates, ORS 28.040.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">But the Act states explicitly that the \u201cenumeration in ORS 28.010 to 28.040\u201d \u2014 -that is, the identification of particular circumstances in which courts may issue declaratory judgments \u2014 \u201cdoes not limit or restrict the exercise of the general powers conferred in ORS 28.010, in any proceedings where declaratory relief is sought, in which a judgment will terminate the controversy or remove an uncertainty.\u201d ORS 28.050. In other words, a court has broad authority \u201cto declare rights, status, and other legal relations\u201d between parties whether those claimed \u201clegal relations\u201d are based on a written provision found in a constitution or statute or, instead, derive from some other source of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">That is what plaintiffs asked the trial court to do in this case. Again, plaintiffs focus their appeal on the following declarations they requested about the scope of the public trust doctrine and defendants\u2019 obligations under it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">\u201cA declaration that the atmosphere is a trust resource, and that the State of Oregon, as a trustee, has a fiduciary obligation to protect the atmosphere as a commonly shared public trust resource from the impacts of climate change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>for Plaintiffs and for present and future generations of Oregonians.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">\u201cA declaration that water resources, navigable waters, submerged and submersible lands, islands, shorelands, coastal areas, wildlife, and fish are trust resources, and that the State of Oregon, as a trustee, has a fiduciary-obligation to protect these assets as commonly shared public trust resources from the impacts of climate change for Plaintiffs and for present and future generations of Oregonians.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Those are requests for a declaration of the \u201crights, status, and other legal relations\u201d between the parties, which\u2014 assuming the action is otherwise justiciable (and more on that later) \u2014 is all that is necessary to give a court authority under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act to issue an appropriate declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">In ruling otherwise, the trial court focused on the fact that plaintiffs had not alleged that defendants had violated \u201ca specific constitutional provision or statute.\u201d To the extent that the court believed that a request for a declaration must be based on those kinds of <em>written </em>sources of law, as opposed to other doctrines, it misunderstood the scope of its statutory authority. Under ORS 28.010 and ORS 28.050, a court has power to declare the rights, status, and other legal relations between the parties to a declaratory judgment action no matter what source of law gives rise to those rights and obligations. Indeed, the Supreme Court has rejected the argument that the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act \u201cconfine [s] the courts to the interpretation and construction of written instruments and laws.\u201d <em>In re Estate of Ida Dahl, </em>196 Or 249, 253, 248 P2d 700 (1952).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To the contrary, ORS 28.050 \u201ccompletely devastate [s] \u201d that position, <em>id., </em>which the court has explained is contrary to the Act\u2019s declared purpose: \u201cto settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status and other legal relations.\u201d ORS 28.120.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The trial court\u2019s ruling also could be read as a rejection of plaintiffs\u2019 theory that a public trust doctrine exists and imposes affirmative obligations on defendants to protect the state\u2019s natural resources from adverse effects of climate change. The court\u2019s assertion that plaintiffs were asking the court \u201cto extend the law by creating a new duty rather than interpret a pre-existing law\u201d suggests as much. But to the extent that the court ruled that no source of law imposes the duties on defendants that plaintiffs describe, that was a ruling on the <em>merits </em>of plaintiffs\u2019 theory \u2014 a ruling that went beyond what defendants claimed to request in their dismissal motion, which they insisted was <em>not </em>directed at the substance of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Not only would such a ruling be at odds with the parties\u2019 agreement not to litigate the merits at this early stage in the case, it also would not form a basis for dismissal of the complaint. Instead, the proper disposition \u2014 after the parties have addressed the substance of plaintiffs\u2019 requests for declaratory relief \u2014 would be the issuance of declarations stating what the law <em>is, </em>whether or not it is as plaintiffs contend. <em>See Beldt, </em>185 Or App at 576 (\u201cIf there is a justiciable controversy, the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration of its rights, even if that declaration is directly contrary to what it believes its rights to be.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">In short, the trial court erred when it ruled that plaintiffs\u2019 first two requests for declaratory relief were not cognizable under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. As noted, defendants no longer defend that aspect of the trial court\u2019s ruling. Instead, they argue only that plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cbare\u201d requests for declaratory relief are nonjusticiable because the issuance of those declarations <em>itself </em>\u201cwould have no practical effect on plaintiffs\u2019 rights\u201d (because the declarations would not explicitly require defendants to do anything) and the court could not order further injunctive relief without violating the separation-of-powers and political-question doctrines.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree with defendants\u2019 fundamental premise, <em>viz., </em>that plaintiffs\u2019 request for bare declarations, absent injunctive relief, does not create a justiciable controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Defendants\u2019 argument is grounded in the constitutional requirement that courts decide only those disputes that are \u201cjusticiable,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>those that are based on present facts, <em>TVKO v. Howland, </em>335 Or 527, 534, 73 P3d 905 (2003), and that involve \u201can actual and substantial controversy between parties having adverse legal interests.\u201d <em>Brown v. Oregon State Bar, </em>293 Or 446, 449, 648 P2d 1289 (1982). As we recently have observed, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act has \u201can uneasy relationship with the constitutional concept of justiciability.\u201d <em>Hale, </em>259 Or App at 383.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-4\">\u201cThe statutes announce that their purpose \u2018is to settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status and other legal relations, and [they are] to be liberally construed and administered.\u2019 ORS 28.120. *** The statutory authority to issue declaratory judgments, however, is constrained by constitutional jus-ticiability requirements. The Supreme Court has held that the [Act] does not give courts authority to issue declaratory rulings \u2018in a vacuum; they must resolve an actual or justi-ciable controversy.\u2019 Courts cannot exercise jurisdiction over nonjusticiable controversies because a court cannot render advisory opinions. Thus, if a claim for a declaratory judgment does not involve a justiciable controversy, a court does not have jurisdiction to consider it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In reconciling the tension between the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act and constitutional justiciability requirements, this court has identified \u201ctwo irreducible requirements for justiciability: The dispute must involve present facts, and it must be a dispute in which a prevailing plaintiff can receive meaningful relief from a losing defendant.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 384. Here, defendants do not dispute that plaintiffs\u2019 requests for declaratory relief are based on present facts. Rather, they contend only that the declarations that plaintiffs seek do not amount to the sort of \u201cmeaningful relief\u2019 that makes a claim justiciable.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Defendants\u2019 argument cannot withstand the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Pendleton School Dist. v. State of Oregon, </em>345 Or 596, 200 P3d 133 (2009) <em>(Pendleton School Dist. I). </em>That case involved the state\u2019s obligations under Article VIII, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>section 8, of the Oregon Constitution, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\">\u201c(1) The Legislative Assembly shall appropriate in each biennium a sum of money sufficient to ensure that the state\u2019s system of public education meets quality goals established by law, and publish a report that either demonstrates the appropriation is sufficient, or identifies the reasons for the insufficiency, its extent, and its impact on the ability of the state\u2019s system of public education to meet those goals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The plaintiff school districts sought a declaration that Article VIII, section 8, \u201crequires that the legislature fund the Oregon public school system at a level sufficient to meet certain quality educational goals established by law and a mandatory injunction directing the legislature to appropriate the necessary funds.\u201d <em>Pendleton School Dist. I, </em>345 Or at 599. That is, like the plaintiffs in this case, the <em>Pendleton School Dist. I </em>plaintiffs sought both a declaration about the state\u2019s legal obligations and injunctive relief requiring the state to take specific action to meet those alleged obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The Supreme Court agreed that Article VIII, section 8, \u201cdirects the legislature to fund public primary and secondary education at certain levels.\u201d <em>Pendleton School Dist. v. State of Oregon, </em>347 Or 28, 32, 217 P3d 175, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>347 Or 344 (2009) <em>(Pendleton School Dist. II) </em>(discussing earlier holding in course of deciding attorney-fee petition). Based on the latter half of that constitutional provision, however, the court held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to the <em>injunctive </em>relief they requested, <em>i.e., </em>an order directing the state to appropriate additional funds for education. It explained: \u201cThe reporting provision of Article VIII, section 8 contemplates the possibility that the legislature will not fund the public school system at the legislatively specified level in a particular biennium and provides that, in that instance, the legislature will report its failure to the public.\u201d <em>Pendleton School Dist. I, </em>345 Or at 611. Accordingly, the court concluded, the plaintiffs were not entitled to an injunction requiring the state to take action that the constitutional provision did not itself require. For the same reason, the plaintiffs were not entitled to a declaration that the constitution required the state to <em>actually </em>provide a specific level of funding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>However \u2014 and most pertinent to our analysis in this case \u2014 the Supreme Court held that the <em>Pendleton School Dist. I </em>plaintiffs <em>were </em>entitled to a different declaration: \u201cthat the legislature failed to fully fund the public school system, if that is the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610. The plaintiffs could be entitled to that declaratory relief, if the legislature had failed to meet its funding obligation, the court explained, because that relief \u201cwould be consistent with the first provision of Article VIII, section 8, which requires the legislature itself to admit any underfunding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the state in fact admitted that it had not funded schools at the constitutionally required levels, the plaintiffs were entitled to a declaration \u201cthat the legislature failed to act in accordance with the constitutional mandate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Thus, the <em>Pendleton School Dist. I </em>court held that the plaintiffs were entitled to a declaratory judgment that encompassed a declaration of what the state\u2019s legal obligation was (\u201cto fully fund the public school system\u201d) and that it had failed to do so. And the plaintiffs were entitled to that declaration despite the fact that they were <em>not </em>entitled to any related injunctive relief against the state. The court explained that the request established a justiciable controversy under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, notwithstanding the state\u2019s contention that no \u201cbinding decree\u201d would issue, <em>id. </em>at 605, because the resulting declaration would establish what constitutional obligation the legislature might have to adequately fund education:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">\u201cThe issue whether Article VIII, section 8, imposes a duty on the legislature to fund the public school system at a specified level every biennium presents a set of present facts regarding the interpretation of a constitutional provision; it is not simply an abstract inquiry about a possible future event.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">That aspect of the <em>Pendleton School Dist. I </em>holding is consistent with a principle that the Oregon courts have articulated in other cases: that courts and the public are entitled to assume that the state will act in accordance with its duties as those duties are announced by the courts. The Supreme Court discussed that principle in <em>Swett </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>v. Bradbury, </em>335 Or 378, 389, 67 P3d 391 (2003), in which it awarded attorney fees to plaintiffs who had successfully challenged the constitutionality of a ballot measure, even though the plaintiffs had obtained only declaratory, not injunctive relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">\u201c[T]his case on the merits involved a declaratory judgment proceeding and, in such proceedings, a court has the power to grant equitable remedies where appropriate. Although it is true that plaintiffs in the case on the merits confined their prayer to a request for a declaration of their rights, they could have sought an injunction as well. They did not do so because it would have been pointless. As the state itself acknowledges, <em>equitable relief </em>\u2014 such <em>as an injunction against enforcement of [the ballot measure] </em>\u2014 was <em>not necessary, because this court and the lower courts would assume that the responsible state officials would honor the court\u2019s declaration without the necessity of an accompanying </em>injunction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">(Citations omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Here, too, it must be assumed that the state will act in accordance with a judicially issued declaration regarding the scope of any duties that the state may have under the public trust doctrine. Plaintiffs\u2019 requests for \u201cbare\u201d declarations regarding the scope of the state\u2019s present obligations, if any, under that doctrine are, therefore, justiciable. It follows that the trial court erred by not entering declarations regarding <em>whether, </em>as plaintiffs allege, under the public trust doctrine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">\u2022 \u201cthe atmosphere is a trust resource, and * * * the State of Oregon, as a trustee, has a fiduciary obligation to protect the atmosphere as a commonly shared public trust resource from the impacts of climate change for Plaintiffs and for present and future generations of Oregonians\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\u2022 \u201cwater resources, navigable waters, submerged and submersible lands, islands, shorelands, coastal areas, wildlife, and fish are trust resources, and * * * the State of Oregon, as a trustee, has a fiduciary obligation to protect these assets as commonly shared public trust resources from the impacts of climate change for Plaintiffs and for present and future generations of Oregonians.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>We next consider the appropriate disposition of this appeal in light of that error. In some cases in which \u201cthe dismissal of a declaratory judgment action was clearly based on a determination of the merits of the claim,\u201d we have \u201creview [ed] that determination as a matter of law and then remand [ed] for the issuance of a judgment that declares the rights of the parties in accordance with our review of the merits.\u201d <em>Doe v. Medford School Dist. 549C, </em>232 Or App 38, 46, 221 P3d 787 (2009). For two related reasons, we decline to do so here. First, it is not entirely clear that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the declaratory judgment action was based on its rejection of plaintiffs\u2019 arguments on the merits; as discussed above, that dismissal may have been based on a misapprehension of the scope of declaratory relief that the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act authorizes a court to grant. Second, and more fundamentally, the parties to this case have not yet litigated the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 requests for declaratory relief. Indeed, defendants explicitly stated in association with their dismissal motion that the motion was not based on any assertions about \u201cthe existence of the public trust\u201d or \u201cwhether the state has met its duties under any such trust.\u201d We will not address those questions without the benefit of fully developed arguments from the parties on those points.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Finally, we also decline to address whether plaintiffs\u2019 remaining requests for declaratory and injunctive relief are nonjusticiable because a court would violate separation-of-powers or political-question principles if it granted the requests. That question cannot be answered until a court declares the scope of the public trust doctrine and defendants\u2019 obligations, if any, under it. That is, if the doctrine itself imposes specific affirmative obligations on defendants (like requiring defendants to take the particular actions that plaintiffs request), a judgment declaring that defendants have breached those obligations or ordering defendants to take the requested actions might not unduly burden the other branches of government or result in the judiciary impermissibly performing duties or making policy determinations that are reserved to those other branches. Again, it would be inappropriate for us to express a view on whether the public trust doctrine imposes such particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>obligations on defendants before the parties have litigated that question. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">In short, plaintiffs are entitled to a judicial declaration of whether, as they allege, the atmosphere \u201cis a trust resource\u201d that \u201cthe State of Oregon, as a trustee, has a fiduciary obligation to protect * * * from the impacts of climate change,\u201d and whether the other natural resources identified in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint also \u201care trust resources\u201d that the state has a fiduciary obligation to protect. The answers to those questions necessarily will inform the court\u2019s determination whether plaintiffs are entitled to any of the other relief they request. We emphasize that we express no opinion, here, on the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 allegations. The trial court must evaluate those allegations, in the first instance, after defendants have answered or otherwise responded on the merits to plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-7\"> In all events, as we discuss at more length below, a dispositive motion directed at the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claim for declaratory relief ordinarily would result in the trial court issuing one or more declarations that state the pertinent law correctly, not in dismissal of the complaint. <em>See Beldt v. Leise, </em>185 Or App 572, 576, 60 P3d 1119 (2003) (\u201cIf there is a justiciable controversy, the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration of its rights, even if that declaration is directly contrary to what it believes its rights to be.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\"> We view the sixth request as one for injunctive relief, even though it is worded in terms of seeking a declaration, because it does not request a declaration regarding <em>legal relations </em>between the parties, as the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act contemplates, but seeks a declaration as to what the \u201cbest available science\u201d says about reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Any dispute about the \u201cbest available science\u201d is tightly linked to the request for injunctive relief that immediately precedes it, that is, plaintiffs\u2019 request for an \u201corder requiring Defendants to develop and implement a carbon reduction plan that will protect trust assets by abiding by the best available science.\u201d Accordingly, we view it as a component of that requested injunctive relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\"> Defendants also argued to the trial court that they were protected against plaintiffs\u2019 claim by principles of sovereign immunity. Defendants do not pursue that argument on appeal, and we do not address it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b494-7\"> When the Supreme Court issued the opinion in <em>In re Estate of Ida Dahl, </em>the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act was codified at \u00a7\u00a7 6-601 to 6-616 of the Oregon Compiled Laws Annotated (1940). The quoted provisions of the Act have not changed materially since then.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b495-5\"> Defendants also contend that plaintiffs did not preserve their request for \u201cbare\u201d declarations independent of the requested injunctive relief. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(4)(a) (setting out principle that questions must generally have been <em>preserved </em>\u2014 i.e., raised in the trial court \u2014 before being considered on appeal). We reject that argument without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
