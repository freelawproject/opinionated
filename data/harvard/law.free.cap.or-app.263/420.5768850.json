J.</author>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Plaintiffs challenge on appeal separate grants of summary judgment for defendant Chicago Title Insurance Company of Oregon (Chicago Title) and defendant Anthony Furniss, in his capacity as personal representative of the Estate of John Ronald Cooper (Cooper). At its heart, the issue in this case is whether the legal description in a warranty deed from Cooper to plaintiffs was an accurate description of the property conveyed. We agree with the trial court that it was and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">On review of grants of summary judgment, we review the record in the light most favorable to the nonmov-ing party and draw all reasonable factual inferences in that party\u2019s favor. <em>Jones v. General Motors Corp., </em>325 Or 404, 408, 939 P2d 608 (1997). The background facts are undisputed and set out below. When necessary to our disposition, we discuss elsewhere in this opinion in more detail the evidence produced on summary judgment with respect to each summary-judgment motion because those motions were decided at different times and on different records.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Plaintiffs purchased a historic home on a large lot in Portland from Cooper, who at the time of the transaction was still living. Cooper was represented in the transaction by his son John, a real estate agent with Realty Trust. The handout for the historic home stated, as one of the home\u2019s \u201c[fjeatures,\u201d that \u201c[the pjroperty sits on 6 Lots,\u201d and the RMLS listing included as part of the \u201cprivate\u201d information that \u201c[tjhe property offers 6 city lots.\u201d Plaintiffs and Cooper entered into a purchase agreement for the property that provided,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">\u201cNeither Seller nor any Licensee(s) warrant the square footage of any structure or the size of any land being purchased. If square footage or land size is a material consideration, all structures and land should be measured by Buyer prior to signing or should be made an express contingency in this Agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The agreement also provided that \u201cSeller and Buyer agree that[,] if it is not provided herein, a complete legal description as provided by the title insurance company * * * shall, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>where necessary, be used for purposes of legal identification and conveyance of title.\u201d A complete legal description was not included with the sales contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Plaintiffs purchased title insurance for the property from Chicago Title. Chicago Title issued a title report that failed to pick up a 1924 deed from a prior owner of the property to the City of Portland that conveyed a 10-foot strip bordering NE U.S. Grant Place. As a result, the deed was not a stated exception in the final title policy. As relevant here, the title policy issued by Chicago Title, subject to the stated exclusions, exceptions, and conditions and stipulations, insured against loss or damage incurred \u201cby reason of *** [t]itle to the estate or interest described in Schedule A being vested other than as stated therein; [or] * <em>* </em>* [a]ny defect in or lien or encumbrance on the title [.]\u201d The title that the policy insured was title to the property described in the legal description prepared by Chicago Title. In Schedule B, the title policy expressly excepted from coverage any loss or damage \u201cwhich arise by reason of*** [discrepancies, conflicts in boundary lines, shortage in area, encroachments or other facts which a correct survey would disclose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Cooper transferred the property to plaintiffs by warranty deed, using the legal description provided by Chicago Title. That legal description provides in full, with the portion that is at the heart of this dispute emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">\u201cBeginning at a point on the East line of NE 28th Avenue, 225 feet South of the South line of NE Thompson Street; thence South along the East line of NE 28th Avenue, 151.88 feet, more or less, to the North line of NE U.S. Grant Place, as now laid out and established; thence Easterly along the North line of NE U.S. Grant Place, 195.04 feet, more or less, to the East line of Tract 4, BOWERING TRACT, as shown on the plat of a portion of the William C. Bowering Donation Land Claim recorded in Book 1, Page 19, Plat Records; thence North along the East line of said Tract 4, a distance of 151.67 feet, more or less, to a point 225 feet South of the South line of NE Thompson Street, said point being on the Southerly line of a tract of land conveyed to Mary F. Kennard by Deed recorded August 29, 1922 in Book 890, Page 302, Deed Records; thence Westerly along the Southerly line of said Kennard Tract, 195.22 feet, more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>or less, to the place of beginning, the same being a portion of Tract 4, BOWERING TRACT.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">(Boldface added.) It is undisputed that 151.88 feet from the starting point south along the east line of NE 28th Avenue ends at a point approximately 10 feet into the right-of-way of NE U.S. Grant Place, which logically corresponds to the 10-foot strip conveyed to the City of Portland in 1924. After completing the purchase, plaintiffs learned the property\u2019s true dimensions, using the streets and tract line as boundaries, when they had the property surveyed to determine how many lots they could subdivide from the property. They also learned that the city would not allow six subdivided lots; they could subdivide the property into only four, possibly five, lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Plaintiffs brought this action against Chicago Title, Cooper, and Realty Trust<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for various claims, all of which were decided on summary judgment against plaintiffs. On Chicago Title\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court concluded that the legal description provided by Chicago Title accurately described the property conveyed to plaintiffs, that is, the description did not include the 10-foot strip previously conveyed to the City of Portland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">\u201cIn my opinion, the description does not include that [10-foot] strip, because it says that the property line runs south \u2018to the north line of NE U.S. Grant Place, as now laid out and established,\u2019 and \u2018thence, Easterly, along the north line of NE U.S. Grant Place.\u2019 Clearly, the property, thus described, lies to the north of U.S. Grant Place, as \u2018now laid out and established,\u2019 meaning at the time of the conveyance from Cooper to plaintiffs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The trial court further explained that the dimension given of \u201c151.88 feet, more or less,\u201d was approximate and not inconsistent with NE U.S. Grant Place providing the southern border of the property, and, even if it were inconsistent, ORS 93.310 (set out below, 263 Or App at 426) required the court to resolve that inconsistency in favor of using the established street as the property boundary. Because the parties agreed that the accuracy of the legal description was the only issue presented as to Chicago Title, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>granted summary judgment to Chicago Title on plaintiffs\u2019 claims for breach of the title policy and negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Later, on Cooper\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court adhered to the earlier ruling and concluded that, because Chicago Title\u2019s legal description did not include the 10-foot strip conveyed to the City of Portland \u2014 the same description used in the warranty deed \u2014 Cooper was entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs\u2019 claims for breach of contract and breach of the covenants in the warranty deed. On appeal, plaintiffs contend that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Chicago Title and Cooper on those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">We begin with the trial court\u2019s construction of the legal description, because it informs in large part our disposition of this appeal. The dispute on appeal, as it was below, is whether the legal description inaccurately described the property conveyed to plaintiffs by including the 10-foot strip that had been previously conveyed to the City of Portland. Plaintiffs\u2019 only argument in this respect is that the call of 151.88 feet cannot be ignored, that is, it is too specific to be rendered merely \u201capproximate\u201d by the words \u201cmore or less,\u201d particularly when the dimension is a full 10 feet off. We conclude, however, as did the trial court, that the legal description unambiguously conveyed only to the north line of NE U.S. Grant Place.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The disputed portion of the deed provides, \u201cthence South along the East line of NE 28th Avenue, 151.88 feet, more or less, to the North line of NE U.S. Grant Place, as now laid out and established.\u201d The north line of NE U.S. Grant Place \u201cas now laid out and established\u201d clearly means the line of the street as \u201claid out and established\u201d at the time of the transfer from Cooper to plaintiffs. Plaintiffs do not contend otherwise. The measurement of 151.88 feet, more or less, in the call does not create an ambiguity in an otherwise very clear property line. The use of the term \u201cmore or less\u201d indicates that the measurement may be approximate or inaccurate. <em>See Weniger v. Ripley, </em>134 Or 265, 277, 293 P 425 (1930) (observing that \u201cthe qualifying words \u2018more or less,\u2019 * * * mean \u2018approximately,\u2019 as distinguished from definite, precise, amounts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>While we appreciate plaintiffs\u2019 argument that a person would not assume that a measurement to the hundredths of a foot would be off by 10 feet, we cannot agree with plaintiffs that that necessarily causes the legal description here to become ambiguous or inaccurate. What plaintiffs\u2019 argument fails to recognize is that, in construing any written instrument, our <em>duty </em>is to effectuate the intention of the parties to the transaction. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Gorman v. Baker et ux, </em>219 Or 170, 189, 347 P2d 85 (1959) (\u201cIn construing a deed, it is the duty of the court to give effect to the intention of the parties.\u201d). Here, the intent of the parties is clear from the written instrument itself \u2014 Cooper intended to convey and plaintiffs intended to purchase (and to insure title to) a piece of property that ended at the north line of NE U.S. Grant Place. Moreover, even if the legal description were ambiguous, plaintiffs nowhere assert that they intended to purchase (or insure title to) part of the road, nor could they plausibly do so. That plaintiffs believed that the property\u2019s dimensions contained within the intended and described boundaries were greater than they actually were \u2014 based on the \u201cmore or less\u201d calls \u2014 does not change the fact that the property\u2019s boundaries were accurately set out in the legal description.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The purpose of the legal description here was to describe the property\u2019s <em>boundaries, </em>which it did, not to recite a quantity of property. <em>See Weniger, </em>134 Or at 277 (\u201cWhen a deed indicates an intention that quantity shall prevail over courses and measurements that intention will be given effect; but generally the recital of quantity is subordinated to boundaries, measurements, courses, etc.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Thus, we agree with the trial court\u2019s construction of the legal description in the title policy and the deed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>However, that is not the end of our inquiry. We next address whether that construction necessarily forecloses plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Chicago Title and Cooper, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Briefly, with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Cooper for breach of contract and breach of the covenants in the warranty deed, plaintiffs offer no argument that would permit those claims to survive if the legal description does not contain the 10-foot strip conveyed to the city. First, the parties\u2019 purchase and sale agreement contained no terms that the property was of any particular dimensions or size (such as six city lots), and, second, based on our construction of the legal description, the warranty deed purported to convey title to exactly what plaintiffs obtained. The trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to Cooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">With respect to their claims for breach of contract and negligence brought against Chicago Title, however, plaintiffs argue that the legal description is not the whole story. Essentially, plaintiffs argue that, even if the words \u201cmore or less\u201d somehow negate the distance calls in the legal description, Chicago Title breached the title policy, and was negligent, when it failed to discover and disclose the 1924 deed to the City of Portland, which was in the public record and would have been discovered with a reasonable title search. In connection with that argument, plaintiffs assert that, based on the title policy issued by Chicago Title, they reasonably believed that the dimensions of the property they purchased were 10 feet larger and that they were damaged by that false information.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">With respect to their claim for breach of the title policy, plaintiffs\u2019 argument fails based on the plain terms of the title policy. The policy insured title only to the property described in the legal description (it insured against loss or damage incurred \u201cby reason of *** [t]itle to the estate or interest described in Schedule A being vested other than as stated therein\u201d), and also expressly excepted from coverage any loss or damage \u201cwhich arise by reason of *** [discrepancies, conflicts in boundary lines, shortage in area, encroachments or other facts which a correct survey would disclose.\u201d Because we conclude, as did the trial court, that the legal description did not include the 10-foot strip <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>previously conveyed to the City of Portland, Chicago Title did not breach the title policy, and it was entitled to summary judgment on that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">With respect to their negligence claim, plaintiffs\u2019 argument on appeal may have some merit. However, they failed to make that argument below, and there is no evidence in the summary judgment record to support it. In opposition to Chicago Title\u2019s motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs solely argued that the legal description unambiguously included the 10-foot strip previously conveyed, and, alternatively, that the description is ambiguous and requires extrinsic evidence to resolve (although plaintiffs did not offer any such extrinsic evidence).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs offered no evidence or argument regarding Chicago Title\u2019s standard of care, what plaintiffs\u2019 reasonable beliefs were regarding the property dimensions, or how they were damaged. It was plaintiffs\u2019 burden to meet Chicago Title\u2019s motion with evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact on their negligence claim. ORCP 47 C (\u201cThe adverse party has the burden of producing evidence on any issue raised in the motion as to which the adverse party would have the burden of persuasion at trial.\u201d). Plaintiffs did not do that. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to Chicago Title.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-8\"> Realty Trust is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b446-5\"> Because we conclude that the legal description is not ambiguous, we do not need to resort to extrinsic evidence or rules of construction to resolve any ambiguities. However, we note that ORS 93.310, which provides rules of construction for property legal descriptions, also supports our reading of the property description. That statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">\u201c(1) Where there are certain definite and ascertained particulars in the description, the addition of others, which are indefinite, unknown or false, does not frustrate the conveyance, but it is to be construed by such particulars, if they constitute a sufficient description to ascertain its application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">\u201c(2) When permanent and visible or ascertained boundaries or monuments are inconsistent with the measurement, either of lines, angles or surfaces, the boundaries or monuments are paramount.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\"> The record on summary judgment included the following evidence: the 1924 City of Portland ordinance accepting the 10-foot strip, the 1924 deed, the warranty deed from Cooper to plaintiffs, the title insurance policy, the preliminary title report, and the plat of plaintiffs\u2019 later partition of the property. Plaintiff Kraft also offered an affidavit that attested only that Chicago Title had failed to bring to his attention the existence of any conveyance not listed in the title report, did not alert him to the existence of the city ordinance, and that a physical inspection of the property did not reveal the 1924 conveyance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
