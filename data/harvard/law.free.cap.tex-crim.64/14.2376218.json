The State\u2019s evidence is, that while deceased and some companions were at work in a field planting cotton, the shooting took place. Doc Williams testified: \u201cMe and Will Turner were opening and Ed Brooks and Will Taylor were planting. What called my attention, Will Taylor looked up and seen appellant and hollered to him not' to shoot in the crowd, and hollered to Will Turner to look out. Sanders Ford was at the lower end of the bushes next to the fence. I don\u2019t know how far he was from Will Turner when he killed him, but he wasn\u2019t no piece. He was over inside the woods and we drove up to the fence, and got\u2019 right at the fence and was ready to turn around at the time he shot. When Will seen him, he dodged behind me, and Sanders Ford shot him, and Will whirled to run and fell, and after he fell he shot him again, and after he fell he got up and began to run across the field. Will Turner ran about forty-three or forty-five steps, I reckon, before he fell and died. Sanders Ford was on the outside of the fence, right over in the pasture, in the woods. We had gotten nearly out to the end of the rows and were nearly ready to turn around, and Will Taylor, who was planting cotton, saw Sanders and hollered to him not to shoot. I was facing Sanders at the time, and when Will Taylor hollered, Will Turner jumped behind me \u2019 and-Sanders shot then. We both whirled to run and then he fell. I guess Sanders hit him when he was down on the ground. He was shot from here on up (indicating). After he quit shooting, we both jumped up and ran. I did not get hit. Will Turner did not have any gun or anything of the kind in his hand when he was shot. I didn\u2019t see no gun. I could have seen it if he had one. He did not' have any. He did not attempt to draw a gun or pistol or anything. He did not say anything to Sanders Ford. Sanders Ford and Will Turner had had a fight the Friday evening before that, in the same field, up at the other side. That was in the field where Will Turner worked. When he got through fighting, Sanders got up and went' off and told Will Turner that that was all right, that he would see him again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b42-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Will Taylor testified: \u201cSanders Ford killed deceased. We were all planting cotton that morning, and were going on out to the end of the row, and before we got to the end of the row\u2014I was behind t'he planters, and we were all plowing on, going to the end of the row, and I was behind, and my mule looked up, and I looked ahead of the mule, and I seen this Sanders Ford on the outside of the fence, in the bushes. He \"had a gun in his hand. I said, \u2018Look out, Willie; look out, Sanders, don\u2019t shoot in this crowd.\u2019 Then Will went to dodging, and he dodged behind Dock Williams. Sanders said, \u2018Oh, yes,\u2019 and shot. Will was running and dodging behind Dock Williams. After Sanders shot the first shot Will kept' on running and dodging behind Dock, and they fell, and Will fell across him. I don\u2019t know what Sanders was doing at that time, but he made the second shot. Will Turner did not make any effort to get a gun, and he did not' have any gun in his hand or about his hand. He didn\u2019t have any gun on his person after he was killed and he ain\u2019t had no gun yet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">Deceased was shot in the hip, in the side and other parts of the body, one shot striking him in the forehead. Defendant testified in his own behalf: \u201cOn Friday evening I went over there to the Scott place, which Henry Slaton had in charge, and I went there about four o\u2019clock, and when I left there, he told me to go and attend to my mule, and I told him I had to come through the Hutcheson farm to go home, and as I was coming through there, I seen these four men sitting on their plows about three or four hundred yards before I got to them, and I stops trotting, and I says I will walk along, and by the-time I get there they will be gone, and I walked along and rode up two or three steps from them, and I says, \u2018Good evening,\u2019 and they said, \u2018Good evening,\u2019 and Will Turner came walking towards me, and says, \u2018Wait a minute,\u2019 and I says, T ain\u2019t got time,\u2019 and he says, \u2018Wait, I want to see about this mule,\u2019 and I says, \u2018You know this mule ain\u2019t none of mine,\u2019 and he says, \u2018Do you want to trade?\u2019 and I said, \u2018No,\u2019 and about that time, he slapped the mule side the head with his hand, and the mule went round and round, and threw me off, and I fell off, and got up, and says, \u2018Look out,\u2019 and-he slapped me, and when he slapped me, he hit me a time or two, and I says, \u2018Let me alone,\u2019 and Dock Williams says, \u201cWill; I believe you are a coward,\u2019 and about that time, he hit me again, and I thought he never would stop beating me, and I left there a crying, and with one hand over my eye, to keep the dirt from running in my eye, I went home and put up the team, and by that time the sun was down, and I didn\u2019t go nowhere, but come on in the house. I did not say anything to Will Turner, but just left there a crying, asking him all the time to let me alone, and he said he would when he got ready. I never told him that I would see him again, or anything of that kind. I never breathed it. I stayed at Henry\u2019s that night. Henry told me that evening what to do the next morning, and I got up as usual and got my gun and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>went on down in the pasture, and-when I got outside of'the farm, I was in the pasture, and I kept right on. That was a lane and the trail was in it. It was in the Scott field, and I went on down there, and kept on around and was in the old road, coming right down the side of the wire fence, and had never stopped walking, and this here Will Taylor was coming driving up, and all of them, and he says, \u2018Look out Will, there is Joker, shoot, shoot!\u2019 and Will Turner, he turned and when he turned, he made the first fire, and then I shot. He fired at me with a pistol, a thirty-eight, and then I fired. After the fight was over, I wheeled and come on back to the house. I saw Frank Bates just as I walked up from down there, and run up from over there up to the house. When I saw Mr. Bates, I did not know whether the man was dead or not. I told Mr. Bates who shot first, and I told Mr. Bates what I shot him for. I didn\u2019t have no intention of killing Will Turner, or nothing of that kind. I was just aiming to shoot him in the leg somewhere. I had bird shot in my gun, and didn\u2019t aim to kill him, and was not thinking about meeting him down there at all at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">This testimony presents the theory of the State and defendant. Defendant is corroborated by no witness in the statement that deceased was armed. However, a witness, John Shannon, testified that on Sunday, before the killing on Saturday, deceased had told him he was going to whip defendant, and remarked, \u201cIf I start at him, I will whip or kill him,\u201d and that he had informed defendant of this threat. F. T. Bates testified that he saw defendant shortly after the killing, and the defendant first told him that he shot deceased because deceased had beaten him up the evening before. The witness says that after he had told defendant he was not going to let him leave, defendant then claimed that deceased had shot at him at first with a pistol. This witness says, however, he heard the shots and there were but two shots, and they were both shotgun shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Appellant requested but one special charge, presenting the issue of negligent homicide. This was given by the court, and in it the jury was instructed: \u201cAnd in this case you are instructed, that if you shall find from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, 'that the defendant did unlawfully attempt\u2019 to commit and was committing an assault upon Will Turner, with a gun, without -any intention to kill him, the said Will Turner, did cause the death of the said Will Turner, by then and there shooting the said Will Turner with a gun, whereby he was killed; there being no apparent danger then and there of causing the death of said Will Turner thereby but with no intent to <em>murder </em>him, the said Will Turner, as murder has been hereinbefore defined in this charge, you will find the defendant guilty of negligent homicide of the second degree, and assess his punishment therefor as aforesaid; but if you shall not so find, bearing in mind that the burden of proof is upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>the State to prove this issue beyond a reasonable doubt as in every other issue, you will find the defendant not guilty of this offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">This sufficiently presents the issue of whether or not the defendant had the intent to kill, and the jury finds against defendant in this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The court presented the issue of self-defense in a fair manner, and defendant does not complain of this feature, except in a general way, such as that the court erred in paragraph - of the charge. This we can not consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">There is some criticism of the charge on murder in the second degree, but when we take the entire charge, it is not subject to the criticism, but is a fair presentation of the law applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">After submitting murder in the first and second degree, and manslaughter, the court instructed the jury: \u201cIn this case, you will take into consideration the means used by the defendant in the commission of the offense with which he is charged, if you believe from the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he committed same, and if they be not such as would be reasonably calculated to accomplish the death of the deceased by the mode and manner in which they were used, then no intent to kill should be presumed from their use.\u201d The objection being that same was upon the weight to be given the testimony. We do not think the charge subject to this criticism, and when we consider the testimony elicited by defendant, that he had used small shot and had no intention to kill, and that he offered a charge on negligent homicide that was given, we think it was proper for the court to thus charge the jury\u2014at least defendant ought not and can not complain that this issue was submitted. Certainly, giving the jury an opportunity to find that although he sho-t deceased twice with a shot gun, yet they could find, if they felt justified in so doing, that as he used only small shot, he had no intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-12\">The charge also fully presents the issue of manslaughter, and submits the case properly on whether or not the acts and conduct of deceased, taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances in evidence, rendered defendant\u2019s mind incapable of cool reflection, and produced in his mind sudden anger, rage, sudden resentment or terror. Every theory of defendant\u2019s defense was fully presented in the charge,' and while the jury might have found, under the evidence of defendant and his witnesses, that he had no intent to kill, yet they did not do so, and as this issue was fully and fairly presented, the charge presents no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">Appellant\u2019s counsel, in an able argument, contends that the evidence does not show a specific intent to kill, but that on the contrary, would show that, if defendant did not shoot in self-defense, he intended to shoot deceased in a part of the body with small shot that could not result in death. Unfortunately, appellant did not strike deceased where he says he intended to shoot him, but struck him in such a vital spot that death resulted in a few moments. When q person uses an instru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>meat that any reasonable person knows that death may result from its use, and death does result, the law presumes that death was intended. While the defendant\u2019s evidence raises the issue, and he had a right to have it submitted to the jury, and which was done in this case, yet the evidence for the State, as herein copied, would indicate that defendant went to a fence row, and, surrounded by bushes, waited until deceased approached near him, and then fired on him\u2014the last time while he was down or running from him. And this, too, according to the State witnesses^ when there was no occasion to shoot, except his anger because of the whipping he had received the day before, and if this be true, such evidence amply supports a verdict of murder in the second degree.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b45-8\">[Rehearing denied January 10, 1912.\u2014Reporter.]</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">There are no exceptions to the evidence, and the charge of the court, in connection with the special charge given at defendant\u2019s request, presents every issue fairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
