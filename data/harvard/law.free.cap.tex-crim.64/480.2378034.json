F. Boatman one slicker of the value of $3.50, the same being the corporeal personal property of and belonging to said Boatman, without his consent, and with the intent to deprive him of the value thereof, and to \u201capprpriate\u201d the said property to his own use and benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">The only question presented on appeal is that the information and complaint instead of using the word <em>appropriate </em>used in lieu thereof \u201capprpriate,\u201d the letter \u201co\u201d being omitted in spelling the word.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">In the ease of Jones v. State, 25 Texas Crim. App., 621, this court held that in an indictment for theft where the word \u201cappriate\u201d was used instead of appropriate, that the indictment should have been quashed. In that case the letters \u201cpro\u201d or entire syllable was omitted instead of merely the letter \u201co\u201d as in this information. We have carefully studied the many decisions of this court on the subject of sufficiency of indictments. In the case of Earp v. State, 41 Texas, 487, where the letter \u201cu\u201d is omitted in spelling the word \u201cfraudulently,\u201d the indictment is held valid, and in a number of cases it has been held that bad spelling will not render invalid an otherwise good indictment if the sense is not affected and the meaning can not be mistaken. Earp v. State, 41 Texas, 487; Frances v. State, 44 Texas Crim. Rep., 246; Thomas v. State, 2 Texas Crim. App., 293; Keller v. State, 25 Texas Crim. App., 325; Stinson v. State, 5 Texas Crim. App., 31; Somerville v. State, 6 Texas Crim. App., 433, and in the case of Farmer v. State, 27 S. W. Rep., 197, almost the identical question here presented was passed on and the indictment held valid. In that case, it being a case of theft, the word \u201cappropriate\u201d was spelled \u201cappropiate,\u201d the \u201cr\u201d being omitted. In this case the letter \u201co\u201d is omitted, but there can be no question of the word intended. There seems to be no established rule in this court, except that if only a letter is omitted, and with this omission no other word is spelled, and no other meaning conveyed, the court will consider it a case of bad spelling and refuse to quash the indict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ment. If an entire syllable is omitted, or with a letter missing a different word is spelled with a different meaning, the indictment will be quashed. In this case only a letter being omitted in spelling a word under the decisions of this court we hold the court did not err in overruling the motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\">There being no statement of facts or bills of exception in the record, the judgment \u25a0 is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
