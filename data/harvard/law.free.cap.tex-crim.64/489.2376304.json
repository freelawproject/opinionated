Bills of exceptions must be authenticated by the signature of the trial judge, and a recitation in the motion for a new trial, in the absence of bills of exceptions, will not be reviewed. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>special charges were asked, and no exceptions taken to the charge of the court as givenconsequently we can not review the charge. If we did so, it. submits the offense' contained in the indictment in a proper manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\">The evidence amply supports the verdict. F. A. Clay and Albert W. Clay testify positively that appellant is the person to whom the house was rented, and who paid the rent, and the testimony of Officers Peyton, Reed and Graham, and Annie McClerkin make a case. Judgment is affirmed.'</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
