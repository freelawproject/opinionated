The defendant had laid predicates to impeach the witness by Will Toliber, and introduced Toliber to prove that the witness Richards had said in his (Toliber\u2019s) presence that he did not know whether or not he had his watch when he left Galveston, and did not know whether he went to sleep before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>he left the island or not. Having thus sought to impeach the witness, the State would be permitted to support its witness by showing that he had made the same statement he had testified to on this trial, .to Mr. Sisk or any other person prior to that time and shortly after the transaction. Goode v. The State, 32 Texas Crim. Rep., 505, and authorities cited under sec. 874 of Branch\u2019s Texas Criminal Law. This is a case of circumstantial evidence, and the court charged fully upon that theory of the case. Appellant admitted having the watch in his possession and delivering it to Mr. Parker. His explanation was that it had been given him by a colored woman in Galveston. The court submits this issue to the jury, telling them that \u201cif you believe from the evidence that the watch described in the indictment was given to defendant by a woman in Galveston you will acquit the defendant, and if upon this state of facts you have a reasonable doubt, you will acquit the defendant.\u201d The evidence amply supports the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
