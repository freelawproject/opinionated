State, this day decided by Presiding Judge Davidson and by Judge Prendergast. For the reasons assigned in those cases, we hold the court did not err in overruling the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-13\">The ground in the \u00bfnotion for a new trial complaining that the court erred in admitting the testimony of the witness, Hammond, can not be considered by us, as no bill of exception was reserved to the action of the court in admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">The only other ground in the motion is that the testimony is insufficient to sustain the conviction. If the witnesses for the State are to be believed, they bought from appellant a bottle of \u201cPaul Jones whisky,\u201d and paid him one dollar and fifty cents for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-15\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
