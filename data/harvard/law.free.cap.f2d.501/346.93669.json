CARTER, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b402-26\">Richard D. Hongisto, the Sheriff of San Francisco, appeals from the order of the district court granting a writ of habeas corpus to the petitioner Edward Bell. Bell, an attorney, had been summarily convicted of direct contempt of the San Francisco Superior Court and was sentenced to five days in jail and a $500 fine. After exhausting his state remedies he brought this petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-27\">We are faced with three issues, each of constitutional dimensions: (1) Does \u00a7 1222 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which denied Bell the <em>right to appeal </em>his contempt conviction, thereby violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution? (2) Does \u00a7 1222, Code Civ.P., which denied Bell <em>the right to bail </em>pending review of his conviction by petition for certiorari or habeas corpus, thereby violate the equal protection clause? (3) Does \u00a7 1211 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, which permits a <em>summary punishment </em>of those persons who commit contempt in the immediate presence of the court, violate the due process clause of the United States Constitution under the circumstances of this case ?</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>The district court answered the first two of these questions affirmatively, and ordered Bell\u2019s release without reaching the question of due process. We reverse. While we express no opinion on the wisdom of \u00a7 1222, Code Civ.P., we cannot hold it in violation of the equal protection clause. We are thus confronted with the due process question which the district court avoided; and the record developed below is sufficient to satisfy us that \u00a7 1211, Code Civ.P., as applied to the facts in this case, has no constitutional infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">On January 27, 1972, at 11:30 a. m., attorney Edward Bell appeared on behalf of three criminal defendants before the Master Criminal Calendar Judge of the San Francisco Superior Court. The Master Criminal Calendar Judge proceeded to assign the case to a trial judge. Bell was told to appear before that trial judge in two hours, that is, at 1:30 p. m. of the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">During the noon recess, Bell went to his office and telephoned two other attorneys for advice regarding the assigned trial judge. They informed Bell that the assigned judge was prejudiced in crucial ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">During the remainder of the noon recess, Bell prepared a motion and affidavit to disqualify the trial judge peremptorily under \u00a7 170.6, Code Civ.P.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At 12:55 p. m. Bell presented the motion to the Master Criminal Calendar Judge, who denied it on the ground of untimeliness, stating that according to his reading of \u00a7 170.6 Code Civ.P., a disqualification motion must be filed at the time a trial judge is assigned. Bell\u2019s motion was therefore one hour and twenty minutes too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">At 1:30 p. m. of that day, Bell appeared as scheduled and renewed the disqualification motion before the trial judge himself, who also denied the motion as untimely, telling Bell to proceed to trial. Bell declined on the ground that, by going to trial, he might be waiving his right to appeal the denial of the disqualification motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">The trial judge then announced, \u201c . . . Mr. Bell, I order you to proceed with the trial of this case forthwith. And, what is your reply to that?\u201d Bell replied, \u201cI refuse to go to trial, your Honor.\u201d<footnotemark>1a</footnotemark> Thereupon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>trial judge found Bell in direct contempt of court and sentenced him to five days in jail and a $500 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Under California law, Bell had no right <em>to appeal </em>this judgment of contempt, but he did have the right <em>to petition </em>the higher state courts for a writ of habeas corpus or a writ of certiorari. In order to allow Bell time to file such petitions, the trial judge stayed execution of the sentence until 9:30 a. m. of the following day (the 28th of January) and later extended the stay for four additional days (until February 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Bell quickly filed two petitions for review, one with the California Court of Appeals and, later, one with the California Supreme Court. Both petitions were denied. Bell went to jail on February 1, 1972. Subsequently, an additional petition in the California Supreme Court was denied on February 2, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-23\">On February 3, Bell filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal district court. The district court ordered his release from custody on grounds that \u00a7 1222, Code Civ.P., violated the equal protection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-24\">\n<em>The California Statutory Scheme</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-25\">Sections 1237 <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and 1466 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the California Penal Code provide that the defendants in \u201ccriminal\u201d cases have the right to appeal from a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-26\">Section 1272 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the Penal Code provides that convicted defendants may be released on bail pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-27\">Section 166<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the penal Code provides that every person guilty of eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>specified types of contempt, which are labelled \u201ccriminal contempt,\u201d is guilty of a \u201cmisdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Section 1209 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Code Civ. P. Lists eleven types of \u201ccontempts of the authority of the court.\u201d Contempt proceedings brought under this section, as distinguished from \u00a7 166, Penal Code, are not \u201ccriminal\u201d proceedings, <em>as a matter of terminology, </em>although they are criminal in character. Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Superior Court for Los Angeles County, 265 Cal.App.2d 370, 72 Cal.Rptr. 177 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-22\">Section 1211<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the Code Civ.P. provides that a contempt committed in the immediate view and presence of the court may be punished summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Section 1222<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the Code Civ. P. provides that the judgment of the court in contempt cases is final and conclusive. This section, despite its broad language, does not apply to contemnors labelled \u201ccriminal\u201d under the Penal Code, \u00a7 166. In re Buckley, 10 Cal.3d 237, 110 Cal.Rptr. 121, 514 P.2d 1201 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">But it is clear that Bell does not belong to that class of contemnors la-belled \u201ccriminal\u201d under the Penal Code.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Hence \u00a7 1222, Code Civ.P., <em>does apply </em>to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Section 1222, Code Civ.P., as noted above, has been construed by California courts to bar <em>appeals </em>but to allow petitions for writs of habeas corpus and certiorari. <em>E. g., </em>Heller v. Heller, 230 Cal.App.2d 679, 41 Cal.Rptr. 177 (1964). These remedies limit the inquiry of the reviewing court solely to questions of the inferior court\u2019s jurisdiction. In re Chapman, 141 Cal.App.2d 387, 295 P.2d 573 (1956). The term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d covers a great deal of ground, however, for the questions of whether a petitioner\u2019s alleged acts constituted contempt, and whether the evidence was sufficient to establish those alleged acts, have been held \u201cjurisdictional\u201d inquiries. In re Ciraolo, 70 Cal.2d 389, 74 Cal.Rptr. 865, 450 P.2d 241 (1969). Thus the scope of review by petition is practically as broad as the scope of review by appeal. <em>See </em>Comment, Contempt: Scope of Review of Contempt Orders in California, 37 Calif.L.R. 301 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">\n<em>Equal Protection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Bell contends that \u00a7 1222, Code Civ. P., violates the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution because it precludes an appeal from an order adjudicating a person in contempt of court, and precludes bail pending review by petition, while at the same time \u00a7 1237 and \u00a7 1466 of the Penal Code allow \u201ccriminal\u201d defendants these procedural benefits. (We temper this contention with the observation that persons convicted of contempt under \u00a7 166, Penal Code, are indeed permitted to appeal and have bail.)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">The California Supreme Court rejected an argument identical to Bell\u2019s in In re Buckley, 10 Cal.3d 237, 110 Cal.Rptr. 121, 514 P.2d 1201 (1973). Since the contention raises a federal question, we are not bound by that state decision and are required to make an independent determination. Yet we must keep in mind that we are dealing with a state statutory scheme and the state case law interpreting and upholding it. Thus, in accordance with our principle of affording state laws a presumption of validity in order to avoid unnecessary federal interference in state affairs, <em>see </em>McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 340, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819 (1943), we pay deference to the views of the California Supreme Court. The discussion that follows is our own analytical journey to the same end, reached more briskly by that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>\n<em>(a) Right to appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Respondent contends that Bell\u2019s argument regarding a right to equal treatment with \u201ccriminal\u201d defendants is eviscerated by the fact that Bell was not held in \u201ccriminal\u201d contempt. We reject the respondent\u2019s contention. It is true that Bell was convicted under \u00a7\u00a7 1209 and 1211, Code Civ.P., not under \u00a7 166, Penal Code, and hence was not a \u201ccriminal\u201d under the statutory terminology. But Bell\u2019s contempt was essentially \u201ccriminal\u201d in nature, even if not \u201ccriminal\u201d by virtue of \u00a7 166, Penal Code, because the purpose of the contempt sanction in this case was punitive rather than compensatory or coercive. <em>See </em>Morelli v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, 1 Cal.3d 328, 82 Cal.Rptr. 375, 461 P.2d 655 (1969); Gompers v. Buck\u2019s Stove &amp; Range Company, 221 U.S. 418, 31 S.Ct. 492, 55 L.Ed. 797 (1911); Penfield Co. of California v. Securities &amp; Exchange Com\u2019n, 330 U.S. 585, 67 S.Ct. 918, 91 L.Ed. 1117 (1947); In re Nevitt (8 Cir. 1902) 117 F. 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Accordingly, we consider the question whether it is constitutionally permissible to deny contemnors suffering essentially criminal sanctions the same right of appeal afforded those defendants actually labelled \u201ccriminal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">In equal protection cases, the burden of justification that must be carried by the state is sometimes <em>heavy </em>and sometimes <em>light, </em>depending on the nature of the classification in question and the nature of the imposition which the state law places upon the encumbered class.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">A <em>strict </em>standard of judicial review is invoked whenever the state law operates to the disadvantage of a \u201csuspect class\u201d (examples being a class based on race or alienage) or whenever the state law impairs a \u201cfundamental interest\u201d (such as the right to vote or to travel interstate); when such a law is challenged, it will be held unconstitutional unless the state can show it is necessary to promote a compelling state interest.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">On the other hand, if the law in question neither injures a \u201csuspect class\u201d nor impairs a \u201cfundamental interest,\u201d it will be evaluated under the <em>general </em>standard. Under this test, the state law is valid so long as it rationally furthers a legitimate state interest.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">In order to choose the correct standard of review in this case, we must ascertain whether or not a fundamental interest is impaired sufficiently to invoke strict scrutiny. (No serious contention can be made that state law here injures a \u201csuspect class.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">In this inquiry, the leading case cited by Bell is Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956), which held that an indigent was entitled to a free trial transcript on appeal. <em>Cf. </em>Mayer v. City of Chicago, 404 U.S. 189, 92 S.Ct. 410, 30 L.Ed.2d 372 (1971). But we do not find <em>Griffin </em>or <em>Mayer </em>controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">First, <em>Griffin </em>and <em>Mayer, </em>although recognizing the importance of adequate review of a criminal conviction, do not <em>expressly </em>call it a \u201cfundamental interest,\u201d nor is it clear a strict standard of review was applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">Secondly, assuming the Court in those cases did in fact <em>tacitly </em>find a \u201cfundamental interest\u201d and apply a strict standard of review, the Court did so largely because the classification in question was based on wealth. Classifications based on wealth are \u201ctraditionally disfavored.\u201d Harper v. Virginia Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 668, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 16 L.Ed.2d 169 (1966). But Bell\u2019s class is not indigent.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-17\">Since Supreme Court decisions provide no authority for regarding the right. to adequate appellate review as \u201cfundamental,\u201d we look to the Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>tion itself for guidance. The lesson of San Antonio School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 33-34, 93 S.Ct. 1278, 1297, 36 L.Ed.2d 16 (1973) is that \u201c. . . the key to discovering whether [an interest] is \u2018fundamental\u2019 . . . lies in assessing whether there is a right to [that interest] explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the Constitution.\u201d <em>San Antonio School District, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The Constitution, a basic text of criminal procedure, contains numerous provisions to safeguard the criminal defendant. But in all its provisions, we find no implicit, and surely no explicit, guarantee of the right to appeal. As said in <em>Griffin, supra, </em>351 U.S. at 18, 76 S.Ct. at 590, \u201cIt is true that a State is not required by the Federal Constitution to provide appellate courts or a right to appellate review at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Furthermore, even if the right to adequate review of a criminal conviction were a \u201cfundamental interest,\u201d we do not believe that this right or interest was significantly impaired in the instant case. The cases speak loosely at times of invoking the standard of strict scrutiny whenever a fundamental interest is \u201cinvolved.\u201d The facts in those cases make clear, however, that it is actually the significant \u201cimpairment\u201d of the fundamental interest, not merely its \u201cinvolvement\u201d that has led courts to apply the strict standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">In the instant case, there is probably some degree of detriment imposed on Bell by \u00a7 1222, Code Civ.P., but we believe it is slight. We have considered the two ways suggested by Bell in which an appeal is more advantageous than a petition for review: (1) because misde-meanants have more tim\u00e9 to prepare arguments to present to the reviewing court than do contemnors like Bell; and (2) because misdemeanants are assured a hearing before the reviewing court and a full consideration of their case, while contemnors like Bell often have their petitions denied summarily without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">As to (1), we note that misdemean-ants have a statutory allotment of time in which to prepare appellate arguments, as provided in the California Rules of Court 105 and 182. On the other hand, contemnors under \u00a7 1209, Code Civ.P., have no fixed time limits in which to file their petitions for review. While this allows them to take as much time as they please, as a practical matter they are forced to file their petitions within days or even hours if they wish to avoid incarceration. But we doubt whether a longer period would benefit contemnors significantly. Contempt cases generally present fewer and simpler questions for review than ordinary criminal cases. The contemning court will generally stay the execution long enough for the con-temner adequately to prepare the relatively simple petition. Bell, for instance, had the execution of his sentence stayed for five days while he prepared and filed petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">As to (2), we note that the California Rules of Court seek to guarantee that each misdemeanant will have a thorough consideration given to his case by the reviewing court. Rules 183, 190 and 106. On petitions by contemnors convicted under \u00a7 1209, Code Civ.P., no such rules are at hand to guide the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">We are not persuaded, however, that petitions for review are less adequately considered by the reviewing court than are briefs on appeal. Only if the petition can be disposed of on its face will the petitioner be denied a hearing. The petitioner with a serious claim will thus be on equal footing with a misdemeanor appellant with a serious claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">Bell points to the fact that his first petition was denied a mere ten minutes after its filing. Yet Bell makes no showing that his petition on its face displayed sufficient merit to warrant longer deliberation. Even if the first petition was too hastily denied, any error would have been cured by consideration of the subsequent petitions. The second petition was denied four hours after its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>filing. This was time enough to allow for a full perusal of its contents and adequate consideration of its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The mere fact that a decision is speedily forthcoming, therefore, is insufficient to raise a presumption that the reviewing court failed in its duty to .consider a ease thoroughly. To find a dereliction of duty we would require concrete evidence. Bell fails to adduce such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Therefore, even on the dubious assumption that the right to appeal is a \u201cfundamental interest,\u201d we believe that the interest was not sufficiently impaired to invoke strict judicial scrutiny. We therefore shall judge the California statute under the general standard. Accordingly, \u00a7 1222, Code Civ.P., insofar as it denies the right to appeal, must be held valid so long as it rationally<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> furthers a legitimate, articulated state objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">One objective behind \u00a7 1222, Code Civ.P., in the context of punitive sanctions, is to facilitate the preservation of order and administrative regularity. This objective is patently legitimate. We need only inquire, then, whether the California legislature had reason to believe that \u00a7 1222, Code Civ.P., would rationally further such goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">Since contempt, unlike other criminal behavior, is a direct attack on the authority of the court and tends to thwart the processes of justice, the legislature might reasonably deem it desirable to devise special procedures to safeguard the courts. Section 1222, Code Civ.P., arguably provides this safeguard in two respects. First, it encourages the trial court to mete out necessary punishment, for a court might be reluctant to cite a person for contempt if conviction might lead to lengthy appeals which would further delay and disrupt the trial process. Second, it increases the deterrent value of the punishment, for a conclusive, non-appealable judgment of conviction is assuredly a more frightening prospect for the would-be contemnor than a judgment whose sting is mitigated by the delay of time-eating appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">We therefore hold that \u00a7 1222, Code Civ.P., rationally furthers a legitimate state objective and thus does not violate the equal protection clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-14\">\n<em>(b) Right to bail</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-15\">Section 1222, Code Civ.P., as interpreted by the California Supreme Court, has been held to mean (1) that no con-temnor except one convicted under \u00a7 166, P.C., may <em>appeal </em>his conviction, and (2) that no contemnor except one convicted under \u00a7 166, P.C., is entitled to <em>bail </em>pending review of his conviction by petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-16\">Bell lacks standing to argue the unconstitutionality of the denial of bail rights, for although he had no right to bail, he was granted a stay of sentence, during which he petitioned both the California Court of Appeals and the California Supreme Court. The stay was an equivalent of bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-17\">In Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U.S. 249, 73 S.Ct. 1031, 97 L.Ed. 1586 (1953), the Supreme Court stated the familiar rule that \u201ca person cannot challenge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>constitutionality of a statute unless he shows that he himself is injured by its operation.\u201d (at 255, 73 S.Ct. at 1034). A\u2019corollary of this rule is that, if a statute contains separable provisions, a person may challenge only those provisions which operate to injure him, and he may not challenge those provisions that cause him no harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Bell therefore cannot be heard to argue that the rule as to bail, in its application to his case, denied him equal protection of the laws. \u201c . [O]ne to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional.\u201d United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17, 21, 80 S.Ct. 519, 522, 4 L.Ed.2d 524 (1960). This principle cannot be relaxed in the present case, for Bell lacks the type of relationship with other persons which might give him standing to assert their rights, and because persons adversely affected by the bail provision will be able adequately to protect their own rights regardless of the outcome of this litigation. <em>See </em>Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">There is another reason why the question of the right to bail is not before us. This is a habeas corpus proceeding, the ultimate purpose of which is to secure the petitioner\u2019s release from unlawful custody. Bell could raise the bail question only if an improper denial of bail was the cause of his custody at the time of the instant petition. At the time Bell commenced this habeas corpus proceeding, however, the review of his contempt conviction had been completed within the state courts and, therefore, even if he was constitutionally entitled to bail pending state court review, that time had expired when this habeas corpus proceeding began. No relief can be afforded in this habeas corpus proceeding for the allegedly improper denial of bail, for the denial of bail was not the cause of Bell\u2019s custody at the time petition herein was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\n<em>Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">Bell contends it was fundamentally unfair for the trial judge to find him in contempt summarily under \u00a7 1211, Code Civ.P. Of his various arguments in support of this contention, the majority are frivolous, but two warrant a short discussion. First, he argues that the trial judge was personally embroiled with him and thus should have been disqualified from adjudging him in contempt. Secondly, he argues that the conviction was so erroneous as a matter of state law that it denied him due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">When a judge becomes so \u201cpersonally embroiled\u201d with a lawyer that he is unable to sit impartially in judgment on the contempt charge, due process requires that he must be disqualified. Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, 400 U.S. 455, 465, 91 S.Ct. 499, 27 L.Ed.2d 532 (1971). But on the facts of this case, we are far from persuaded that the trial judge was \u201cpersonally embroiled\u201d with Bell. Bell\u2019s conduct did not vilify the judge. To the contrary, Bell was polite throughout. And the judge\u2019s comments on record do not demonstrate a bias or anger against Bell. Accordingly, we see no constitutional violation in the contemned judge sitting in judgment on the contempt charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">As for Bell\u2019s argument that the conviction was flagrantly erroneous under state law, thereby denying him due process, we are not persuaded. Bell\u2019s conviction was reviewed three times in the higher California courts. Each time his conviction was allowed to stand. We infer that the higher California courts found the conviction correct under the state law.

A statute does not \u201crationally\u201d further certain goals merely because it <em>logically </em>tends to promote them. A legislature does not act \u201crationally\u201d when it acts in logical furtherance of lesser goals at the gross expense of more vital goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Thus, to determine whether a statute is rational, the court must consider the statute\u2019s logical tendency to promote its avowed goals against its tendency to impair other, more important goals. This does not mean we shall oversee a legislature in its policy decisions, or try to impose our will in choosing among competing values. That would exceed our province. But when a legislature\u2019s choice is manifestly contrary to certain basic values inherent in a just society, we must hold that choice to be irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-19\">In the instant case, we see nothing in the statute to indicate that certain values basic to a just society are being sacrificed irrationally for the sake of inferior values. Hence in this case we should hold the statute \u201crational\u201d so long as it tends <em>logically </em>to further its purposed objectives.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b411-4\">. On June 26, 1974, the Supreme Court decided Taylor v. Hayes, 418 U.S. 488, 94 S.Ct. 2697, 41 L.Ed.2d 897. There the judge, following the trial, proceeded to hold the petitioner in summary contempt. The Court held in part that because of the acrimony of the confrontation between the trial judge and the contemnor, another judge should have tried the contempt matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">On July 8, 1974, in Grossman v. Striepeke (9 Cir., July 13, 1973, No. 72-2526) unpublished, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded for reconsideration in view of Taylor v. Hayes, <em>supra. </em>(42 U.S.L.W. 3710). As in <em>Hayes, supra, </em>the judge, following the trial, held Grossman in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The factual situations in both <em>Hayes </em>and <em>Grossman </em>were vastly different from the factual situation in the case at bar. In <em>Hayes </em>and <em>Grossman </em>the exchanges between the contemnor and the court were acrimonious. In each the contempt was imposed following trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In the case at bar, the contempt occurred when the trial was about to start. There was no acrimonious exchange between the court and contemnor. The judge simply ordered the attorney to proceed with the trial and inquired, \u201cWhat is your reply to that?\u201d Bell responded, \u201cI refuse to go to trial, your Honor.\u201d See footnote [la] for the full exchange between court and counsel.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">In <em>Hayes, </em>the Court stated 418 U.S. at 497, 94 S.Ct. at 2702:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-9\">\u201cWe are not concerned here with the trial judge\u2019s power, for the purpose of maintaining order in the courtroom, to punish summarily and without notice or hearing contemptuous conduct committed in his presence and observed by him. Ex parte Terry, 128 U.S. 289 [9 S.Ct. 77, 32 L.Ed. 405] (1888). The usual justification of necessity, see Offutt v. United States, 348 U.S. 11, 14 [75 S.Ct. 11, 99 L.Ed. 11] (1954), is not nearly so cogent when final adjudication and sentence are postponed until after trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">By &gt;way of comparison with the procedure followed in <em>Hayes </em>the Court notes an important event which ordinarily occurs in a summary contempt proceeding such as we have before us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-12\">\u201cEven where summary punishment for contempt is imposed during trial, \u2018the con-temnor has normally been given an opportunity to speak in his own behalf in the nature of a right of allocution.\u2019 Groppi v. Leslie, <em>supra, </em>404 U.S., at 504 [92 S.Ct. 582, at 587] (and cases cited therein).\u201d 418 U.S. at 498, 94 S.Ct. at 2703 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">Added enlightenment is found in <em>Groppi </em>at the page cited by the Court as authority for its statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-15\">\u201cWhere a court acts immediately to punish for contemptuous conduct committed under its eye, the contemnor is present, of course. There is then no question of identity, nor is hearing in a formal sense necessary because the judge has personally seen the offense and is acting on the basis of his own observations. Moreover, in such a situation, the contemnor has normally been given an opportunity to speak in his own behalf in the nature of a right of allocution.\u201d Groppi v. Leslie, 404 U.S. 496, 504, 92 S.Ct. 582, 587, 30 L.Ed.2d 632 (1972) (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-16\">Here the record reflects that Bell had an adequate opportunity to speak in his own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-17\">In a companion case decided on the same day as <em>Hayes, </em>Codispoti v. State of Pennsylvania, 418 U.S. 506, 94 S.Ct. 2687, 2692, 41 L.Ed.2d 912, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-18\">\u201cThere are recurring situations where the trial judge, to maintain order in the courtroom and the integrity of the trial process in the face of an \u2018actual obstruction of justice,\u2019 In re McConnell, 370 U.S. 230, 236 [82 S.Ct. 1288, 1292, 8 L.Ed.2d 434] (1962) ; see also In re Little, 404 U.S. 553, 555 [92 S.Ct. 659, 660, 30 L.Ed.2d 708] (1972), convicts and sentences the accused or the attorneys for either side for various acts of contempt as they occur. Undoubtedly, where the necessity of circumstances warrants, a contemnor may be summarily tried for an act of contempt during trial and punished by a term of no more than six months. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-19\">If the contempt in the case at bar, occurring at the commencement of a trial, could not be punished summarily by the judge before whom the contempt occurred, then no such contempt could ever be punished by the judge before whom it occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
