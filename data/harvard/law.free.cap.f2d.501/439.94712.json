(\u201cTracy Leigh\u201d), contends vigorously that it is our province, and indeed our duty, to supply a term to the Virgin Islands Code which, it is asserted, the draftsmen unintentionally omitted. Standing in sharp counterpoint to this contention are doctrines of judicial temperance, doctrines which take on a heightened significance when the elemental relationship of , courts to legislatures is put in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-22\">The facts of the case have been stipulated by the parties. Tracy Leigh was incorporated under the laws of the Virgin Islands on February 24, 1967. On June 23, 1967, Tracy Leigh purchased about four acres of land on St. Thomas, for approximately $130,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 26, 1967, the corporation applied for a grant of \u201ctax or fee exemptions and subsidies\u201d under the Virgin Islands Industrial Incentive Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A public hearing on the application was held on December 14, 1967, and an executive committee of the Industrial Incentive Board approved the application on February 11, 1969.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The grant was made effec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>tive from October 26, 1967, the date of the application, for a period of ten years. Subsequently, in 1970, the Government of the Virgin Islands refused to pay Tracy Leigh the subsidies provided for in the grant, declined to recognize any of the tax exemptions conferred by the grant, and filed a lien against Tracy Leigh for taxes owed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Government\u2019s failure to comply with the terms of the grant reflected a recommendation by the Comptroller of the Virgin Islands to the Governor that \u201cno subsidy payments be made under this grant\u201d and \u201cthat any taxes or fees exempted under this grant be billed and collected, and that the grant be voided.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Under protest Tracy Leigh paid the asserted tax deficiency, and then brought this lawsuit in the district court. It sought a declaration of the validity of the exemption and subsidy grant, a payment of the subsidies, and a refund of the taxes it had paid under protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In defending the suit, the Government asserted that the tax exemption and subsidy grant exceeded the terms of the authorizing statute. The district court declared the grant void as not supported by the terms of the statute, and Tracy Leigh has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">The Virgin Islands Industrial Incentive Act was enacted by the Islands\u2019 legislature \u201cto promote the economic development of the Virgin Islands by the offering of certain incentives to the establishment or expansion of industries or businesses.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Incentive program was repealed in July of 1972.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As of September 25, 1967, the Act provided in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-12\">\u201cA person, firm, or corporation engaged in or about to engage in an industrial or business activity in the Virgin Islands, which industrial or business activity in the judgment of the Governor of the Virgin Islands, will promote the public interest by economic development of the Virgin Islands, may apply for the [tax exemption and subsidy] if such person, firm, or corporation meets the following requirements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-13\">(3) undertakes to invest in an industry or business in the Virgin Islands. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-14\">(B) at least $75,000 in the establishment of a business engaged in the ownership of housing projects . . . , factories, industrial plants, or commercial warehouses, industrial parks, <em>condominium(s) . </em>. . , including the <em>actual construction of such housing projects, factories, industrial plants or commercial warehouses, industrial parks </em>when such construction is engaged in by the owner.\u201d (Emphasis added) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-17\">It is conceded by the parties that Tracy Leigh was engaged in the \u201cconstruction\u201d of condominiums. Indeed, the tax exemption and subsidy form reflects that the award to Tracy Leigh was predicated on the corporations\u2019s intended \u201cconstruction and sale to first buyer of condominium units.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Government, in seeking to justify the voiding of the grant, points out what is plain: that in authorizing grants to those engaged solely in \u201cconstruction,\u201d the legislature did <em>not </em>include condominiums among the facilities for which construction grants could be given. Tracy Leigh, the Government urges, was thus not entitled to any grant for the construction of condo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>miniums and, since condominium construction was the precise and express basis for Tracy Leigh\u2019s tax exemption and subsidy, the grant was void <em>ab ini-tio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Tracy Leigh\u2019s central contention is that the failure of the legislature to include condominium construction among those activities for which exemptions and subsidies might validly be granted, was an \u201cobvious drafting oversight.\u201d In support of this contention we are pointed to an earlier version of the authorizing statute, enacted a few months prior to the amendment of September 25, 1967.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The earlier statute, after listing condominiums among the facilities for which \u201cownership\u201d grants could be given, further authorized grants for \u201cconstruction or operation of <em>the same.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This terminology, beyond doubt, meant that exemptions and subsidies could validly issue under the earlier version of the Act for the construction of condominiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">However, in the September 25th amendment the legislature did not use the phrase \u201cthe same\u201d. Instead, the legislature undertook a specific enumeration of all those types of facilities for which <em>construction </em>grants were authorized. This enumeration tracked the listing of valid <em>ownership </em>grants, with the single exception of condominiums. Tracy Leigh maintains that, when read against the earlier enactment, the omission from the September 25th amendment of an authorization of grants for construction of condominiums was clearly an unintended omission \u2014 an \u201coversight\u201d- \u2014 by the legislature. We are asked to rectify that oversight by supplying the missing term, and so uphold the validity of Tracy Leigh\u2019s grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-10\">This we decline to do. We take it as a tenet of our jurisprudence that \u201c[a] judge must not rewrite a statute, neither to enlarge nor to contract it.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At base, this adage is expressive of the fundamental separation in our system between the judiciary and the legislature. Where a statute is on its face clear, strict, literal interpretation renders a federal court <em>functus officio. </em>Departure from the plain import of statutory terms is justified only where terminological ambiguity is apparent,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> where inherent contradiction exists,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or, perhaps, where the legislative history conclusively establishes that an oversight in draftsmanship has clearly occurred.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> None of these situations obtains here. Despite Tracy Leigh\u2019s assertion that the legislature fully intended to authorize grants for the construction of condominiums, not a single fragment of legislative history \u2014 except perhaps the above-mentioned predecessor of the applicable statutory section \u2014 has been brought to our attention indicating that the legislature intended to authorize grants for the construction of condominiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">Indeed, we hesitate to adopt Tracy Leigh\u2019s characterization of the omission from the statute of condominium construction grants, as \u201cobvious\u201d. For reasons that may have been perfectly rational, the legislature may have intended <em>precisely </em>what Tracy maintains was unintended. Under the Incentive Act, \u201ccondominium\u201d was a statutory term, of art. It meant \u201cthe <em>ownership </em>of single units in a multi-unit building with com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>mon elements.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Inasmuch as the legislature promulgated an express definition of \u201ccondominium\u201d, we think it somewhat unlikely that the lawmakers would simply neglect to include that term in the grant authorization section of the same Act. At any rate, the reason for the omission of the term \u201ccondominium\u201d in the grant section of the Act is considerably less clear than Tracy Leigh would have us conclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">Additional considerations militate against judicial insertion of an allegedly \u201cmissing\u201d word into this section of the Act. As Judge Maris has pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0b\">\u201cIt is a well settled rule that statutory exemptions from taxation, being a matter of grace, are to be strictly and narrowly construed.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"azh-dedup-0\">This rule, when compounded with the precept that \u201cto supply [statutory] omissions transcends the judicial function,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> makes the present case \u2014 a case involving a tax exemption \u2014 a particularly inappropriate occasion for judicial tampering with the clear language of a statute. Thus, we conclude that the grant to Tracy Leigh was <em>ultra, vires </em>the statutory authorization, and therefore invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Tracy Leigh mounts a second argument against the district court\u2019s judgment. It maintains that, in reliance upon the Government\u2019s initial approval of the grant, Tracy Leigh \u201cchanged its position\u201d and \u201cgambled on building and selling the first condominiums constructed in the Virgin Islands.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Notwithstanding that this is part of a stipulation, we think it of limited significance. First, it is conceded that Tracy Leigh bought the land for the condominiums in question well before the approval of the tax exemption and subsidy.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The purchase involved a substantial risk; this risk cannot be deemed to have been undertaken in \u201creliance\u201d on a grant that had not yet been made.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, another brace of venerated principles dictate that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-11\">\u201c. . . [Contracts with agents of the Government must be in strict conformity with the [statutory] authority conferred .... The Government is neither bound nor estopped by acts of its officers or agents in entering into an arrangement or agreement to do or cause to be done what the law does not sanction or permit.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">Thus, even were we of the opinion that, under some circumstances, Tracy Leigh\u2019s \u201creliance\u201d on the grant might have been significant, it cannot overcome, the fact that the grant was not authorized under Virgin Islands law. The district court was therefore entirely justified in refusing to enforce the terms of the grant.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">It may be argued that the general objective of the Industrial Incentive program might have been furthered somewhat by judicial enforcement of the grant to Tracy Leigh. Nonetheless, we are always loathe to substitute our own notions of how best to administer a legislative program, when the legislature it<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>self has set out the guidelines.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The general inhibition against the \u201crewriting\u201d of statutes is reinforced here by the fact that a tax-exemption statute is involved. In these circumstances, strict adherence to the literal terms of the statute would appear to be the appropriate course.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">There is some suggestion by Tracy Leigh that, irrespective of our interpretation of the \u201cconstruction\u201d section of the Incentive Act, we should still deem Tracy Leigh\u2019s tax exemption and subsidy grant to be valid and enforceable. This argument is grounded on the proposition that, before it could sell any of the condominium units it had planned to construct, Tracy Leigh would perforce <em>own </em>such units. Therefore, the contention goes, Tracy Leigh\u2019s grant was technically authorized by the \u201cownership\u201d provision of the Act.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It is on this point that the dissent agrees with Tracy Leigh.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">This final argument overlooks the fact that Tracy Leigh\u2019s tax exemption and subsidy grant was explicitly tailored to reward only the \u201cconstruction\u201d of condominiums, an enterprise for which, as we have seen, the legislature did <em>not </em>authorize such grants. Moreover, the \u201cownership\u201d section of the statute authorized grants to \u201cbusiness [es] engaged in the ownership of condominiums.\u201d ' Even conceding the fact that at some point in time Tracy Leigh was technically an owner, it can hardly be said that the corporation was \u201cengaged\u201d in the \u201cbusiness\u201d of owning condominiums. The language of Tracy Leigh\u2019s grant reflected that the corporation intended to engage in the \u201cconstruction and sale to first buyer of condominium units . . .,\u201d not the continued ownership of such units. Moreover, we note that the statute, in authorizing certain construction grants, seeks to insure that such \u201cconstruction is engaged in by the owner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-13\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-12\">.

Actual construction applied to (1) housing projects, (2) factories, (3) industrial plants, (4) commercial warehouses, and (5) industrial parks.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The subsidies pertinent to \u201cownership\u201d are real property taxes and fees (33 V.I.C. \u00a7 4061(a)(1), (3) ) and a percentage of income tax liability (33 V.I.C. \u00a7 4071(a)(2)). On the other hand, the subsidies relevant to construction activities are excise taxes on materials and equipment (33 V.I.C. \u00a7 4061(a)(2) ) and a percentage of import duties and taxes paid on imported materials used in construction (33 V.I.C. \u00a7 4071(a)(1) ). The relevant portions of these statutes- are reprinted in the margin below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-15\">The majority opinion deals mainly with the issue of construction subsidies despite what is to me a very evident abandonment by Tracy Leigh of its claims to the excise taxes and import duty subsidies relevant to \u201cconstruction\u201d. As I understand the Complaint, Tracy Leigh presently claims subsidies for having, in the first instance, established a business (condominiums) in the Virgin Islands, and for having main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>tained ownership of the condominiums until it sold the first 42 units built.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The grant of tax exemption and subsidies reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">\u201cWhereas, on October 26, 1967, the Virgin Islands Industrial Incentive Board received from Tracy Leigh Development Corporation ... an application for tax exemption and subsidies pursuant to the Provisions of the Code, as aforesaid, covering THE Construction and Sale to First Buyer of Condominium Units at Estate Nazareth, St. Thomas, V.

I cannot subscribe to such an argument, for it would mean that in order to qualify for such exemptions or subsidies, an individual purchaser would havfe had to expend at least $75,000 in the purchase of his condominium. In addition, he would have to be regarded as having \u201cestablished a business\u201d by his purchase, even though he was the resident and occupant of the condominium unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">If we were to adopt the appellee\u2019s argument and construe the statutes as both the appellee and the majority would apparently have us do, it would appear that: (1) the developer, Tracy Leigh, having established a business of condominiums for sale, could not obtain a subsidy; and (2) the individual who purchased the condominium for residence could not obtain a subsidy. The question is then presented: why specifically include in that portion of the statute referring to the \u201cestablishment of a business,\u201d the term \u201ccondominium\u201d and then advocate a construction of that statute making it impossible for any exemptions or subsidies to be afforded thereunder?</p>\n<p id=\"b500-14\">There can be no doubt but that Tracy Leigh was fully qualified under the statute and grant as an owner, and as a corporation engaged in the business of owning condominiums which it then sold.
