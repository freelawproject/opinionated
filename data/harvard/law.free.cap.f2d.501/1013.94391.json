(1970), against alleged racial discrimination in employment. We imply no criticism of the conduct of the trial (nor necessarily of the District Judge\u2019s decision therein) as we remand this case for reconsideration in the light of McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). In May of 1973, (more than a year after the trial and decision of our instant case) Justice Powell, for a unanimous United States Supreme Court, laid down a new and historic three-step procedure for the determination of racial employment discrimination cases under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-11\">Step I. Justice Powell held that initially the complainant was required to carry the burden of proving a prima facie case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-12\">\u201cThe complainant in a Title VII trial must carry the initial burden under the statute of establishing a prima facie case of racial discrimination. This may be done by showing (i) that he belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of complainant\u2019s qualifications.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-15\">Step II. He then recognized that the burden shifted to the defendant \u201cto articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d for refusal to hire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-16\">\u201cThe burden then must shift to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the respondent\u2019s rejection. We need not attempt in the instant case to detail every matter which fairly could be recognized as a reasonable basis for a refusal to hire. Here petitioner has assigned respondent\u2019s participation in unlawful conduct against it as the cause for his rejection. We think that this suffices to discharge petitioner\u2019s burden of proof at this stage and to meet respondent\u2019s prima facie case of discrimination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-17\">\u201cThe court of Appeals intimated, however, that petitioner\u2019s stated reason for refusing to rehire respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>was a \u2018subjective\u2019 rather than objective criterion which *carr[ies] little weight in rebutting charges of discrimination,\u2019 [8 Cir.], 463 F.2d [337,] at 352.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-4\">-* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"auk-dedup-1\">Regardless of whether this was the intended import of the opinion, we think the court below seriously underestimated the rebuttal weight to which petitioner\u2019s reasons were entitled. Respondent admittedly had taken part in a carefully planned \u2018stall-in,\u2019 designed to tie up access and egress to petitioner\u2019s plant at a peak traffic hour. Nothing in Title VII compels an employer to absolve and rehire one who has engaged in such deliberate, unlawful activity against it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 802-803, 93 S.Ct. at 1825. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">Step III. The Court then recognized that even an otherwise valid reason might be used as a pretext and remanded for claimant to have the opportunity to prove such facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-6\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s reason for rejection thus suffices to meet the prima facie case, but the inquiry must not end here. While Title VII does not, without more, compel rehiring of respondent, neither does it permit petitioner to use respondent\u2019s conduct as a pretext for the sort of discrimination prohibited by \u00a7 703(a)(1). On remand, respondent must, as the Court of Appeals recognized, be afforded a fair opportunity to' show that petitioner\u2019s stated reason for respondent\u2019s rejection was in fact pretextual. Especially relevant to such a showing would be evidence that white employees involved in acts against petitioner of comparable seriousness to the \u2018stall-in\u2019 were nevertheless retained or rehired. Petitioner may justifiably refuse to rehire one who was engaged in unlawful, disruptive acts against it, but only if this criterion is applied alike to members of all races.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-7\">\u201cOther evidence that may be relevant to any showing of pretextuality includes facts as to the petitioner\u2019s treatment of respondent during his prior term of employment, petitioner\u2019s reaction, if any, to respondent\u2019s legitimate civil rights activities, and petitioner\u2019s general policy and practice with respect to minority employment. On the latter point, statistics as to petitioner\u2019s employment policy and practice may be helpful to a determination of whether petitioner\u2019s refusal to rehire respondent in this case conformed to a general pattern of discrimination against blacks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 804-805, 93 S.Ct. at 1825. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-8\">Our instant case has a background much more deeply rooted in historic race discrimination than the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>case. It also involves a plaintiff who (whether or not she is ultimately held to have been refused a job for racially discriminatory reasons) is obviously far less vulnerable than was claimant Green in the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-9\">This case originated in Fayette County, Tennessee. This county has produced much civil rights litigation. Sixty-five per cent of its population is black and it has been dominated by the 35% minority until very recently. This court has much prior experience with civil rights cases from Fayette County. <em>See e.g., </em>McFerren v. Fayette County Board Education, 455 F.2d 199 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 407 U.S. 934, 92 S.Ct. 2461, 32 L.Ed.2d 817 (1972); United States v. Beaty, 288 F.2d 653 (6th Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-10\">The plaintiff and her husband are longtime civil rights activists. (Among other activities, Floyd Franklin engaged in pressuring defendant Troxel Manufacturing Co. to hire blacks.) Troxel had moved to Moscow, Tennessee, in Fayette County from Ohio in 1961. The record makes clear that prior to Title VII Trox-el did not hire blacks as production workers either in Ohio or Tennessee. In 1965 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>plaintiff filed an application for employment with defendant. Neither she nor any other blacks in the county had ever been employed in manufacturing production work. Troxel was in fact the first manufacturing company ever to locate in the county. On July 21, 1965 (after the effective date of Title VII) appellant was refused employment and subsequently on inquiry was refused any reason as to why she was not employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">Defendant\u2019s testimony at the trial of this case before the District Judge indicated that defendant\u2019s personnel manager, after receiving plaintiff\u2019s application, called a white mail carrier upon whom they had been relying for character references and asked him about Mrs. Franklin. The mail carrier said he didn\u2019t know her but also said that her father-in-law had said Mrs. Franklin didn\u2019t agree with him (the father-in-law) about hardly anything and didn\u2019t get along with people too well. The mail carrier suggested the personnel manager call the father-in-law. This, however, was not done and plaintiff was not hired. Subsequently Troxel did hire numerous black employees, including some of appellant\u2019s female relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">After a careful review of the facts provided by this record, we believe that as of July 21, 1965, appellant established a prima facie case of discriminatory refusal to hire under the standard just quoted from <em>McDonnell Douglas, supra, </em>(Step I). The District Judge\u2019s opinion (refusing relief on the rationale of Troxel\u2019s stated reason for refusing to hire) was not, of course, written in the light of the standards subsequently laid down in <em>McDonnell Douglas, supra </em>\u2014 particularly Step II and Step III, as outlined above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">We therefore vacate the judgment and remand the case for reconsideration in the light of <em>McDonnell Douglas, supra, </em>and such further proceedings as the District Court may think necessary to give adequate consideration to the provisions of Steps II and III therein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1068-13\">\u201c13. The facts necessarily will vary in Title VII cases, and the specification above of the prima facie proof required from complainant in this case is not necessarily applicable in every respect to differing factual situations.\u201d Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
