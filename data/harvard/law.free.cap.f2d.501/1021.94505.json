In his complaint, Tritsis alleged that, on July 24, 1971, he was arrested, pursuant to a warrant, for illegally transferring a certain firearm in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(e). The charges against Tritsis were dismissed when he proved that he was in Europe on June 7, 1971, the date of the alleged transfer. The defendants in this suit were employees of the Internal Revenue Service in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (\u201cBureau\u201d) at the time of Tritsis\u2019 arrest: Ronald Backer was a Special Employee; Eugene Healey was Acting Chief Special Investigator; Kenneth Borcia was a Special Investigator.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jurisdiction was alleged under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1332 and 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-16\">The district court denied the defen-ants\u2019 motion to dismiss but sustained their motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff appeals, claiming generally that the defendants had failed to show that there was no genuine dispute of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-17\">In Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), the Supreme Court held that damages may be recovered for injuries resulting from a federal officer\u2019s violation of the Fourth Amendment. In the sequel to the Supreme Court decision, the Second Circuit noted that if the federal officer could show that he acted in good faith and with a reasonable belief in the validity of the arrest and search, the officer would have a valid defense to the suit for damages.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1076-18\">\u201c[T]o prevail the police officer need not allege and prove probable cause in the constitutional sense. The standard governing police conduct is composed of two elements, the first is subjective and the second is objective. Thus the officer must allege and prove not only that he believed, in good faith, that his conduct was law<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>ful, but also that his belief was reasonable.\u201d Bivens v. Six Unknown Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 456 F.2d 1339, 1348 (2d Cir. 1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">This court is in agreement with the Second Circuit\u2019s statement as to the elements of a valid defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">In the present case, the defendants submitted affidavits in support of their contention that they acted reasonably and in good faith and moved for summary judgment. The facts concerning Tritsis\u2019 arrest, as set forth in the affidavits, are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">On June 7, 1971, Backer, acting in an undercover capacity for the Bureau,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> purchased several guns including a Schmeisser 9mm. German machine gun from one Ernie Semet at the Atlas Arms Company, of which company plaintiff was an owner and manager. Backer stated, in his affidavit, that Se-met was aided by another man in the store in locating parts for the machine gun. On June 11, 1971, Backer, in another visit to Atlas, asked Semet if the individual who had helped locate the gun parts on June 7 was presently in the store. Semet replied that \u201cTasi\u201d was not there. Boreia stated in his affidavit that, on June 14, 1971, he telephoned Atlas and asked for Tasi. The person answering the telephone told him that Tasi was not in and that Tasi was the manager of the store. In checking the Bureau\u2019s firearm licensee file, Boreia found that Anastasius Tritsis was listed as the manager and president of Atlas. On July 23, 1971, on the basis of this information, Boreia obtained arrest warrants for Semet and Tritsis. The warrant against Tritsis was executed the following day by Healey.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-12\">Along with the affidavits of the three defendants, the' defense submitted two affidavits from Donald Kline, the Chief Special Investigator for the Bureau and the supervisor of Boreia and Healey. Kline described the proper procedure for making an arrest and stated that, in his opinion, Boreia and Healey acted within the scope of their authority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1077-13\">The plaintiff argues, albeit in an abbreviated fashion, that Backer\u2019s affidavit clearly establishes that the firearm was not \u201ctransferred\u201d by the person identified as Tasi. Presumably if there was no basis for securing an arrest warrant, good faith would properly be subject to challenge. However, the affidavits clearly show that the individual identified as Tasi, while not physically handing the machine gun to the purchaser, did aid and abet in its transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-14\">In opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff filed his own affidavit and that of Quentin Durst, sheriff of Woodford County. Neither of these affidavits contained any information which opposed the facts set forth in defendants\u2019 affidavits. Thus, the sheriff\u2019s affidavit stated that Backer had never been a deputy sheriff of Woodford County although the sheriff had given him a deputy sheriff\u2019s card. We fail to see how this creates a dispute of fact bearing on the state of mind of the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>which, of course, was the issue before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">We agree with the district court that the defendants were entitled to summary-judgment in this situation. The facts set forth in the affidavits filed by the defense affirmatively establish that the defendants acted both reasonably and in good faith. Since the affidavits submitted by Tritsis raised no genuine issue of fact as to defendants\u2019 good faith or reasonable belief, summary judgment was proper. Strutt v. Upham, 440 F.2d 1236 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1076-13\">. Eugene Healey and Kenneth Borcia were misnamed \u201cJames Healy\u201d and \u201cKenneth Borscia,\u201d respectively, in the complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1076-19\">. The district court\u2019s opinion is reported at 355 F.Supp. 225 (N.D.Ill.1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1077-9\">. During some eight months prior to July 1971, Backer had \u201cmade undercover purchases of machine guns, destructive devices, stolen guns and other types of illegal firearms from over twenty (20) different individuals in several states. In the course of this investigation, Mr. Backer was always truthful and reliable.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1077-10\">. Plaintiff argues that the affidavits of Bor-cia, Backer, and Kline were incompetent to the extent that they contained hearsay statements. Plaintiff does not specify to which statements he is referring. Presumably, he is complaining of the statements of persons other than the affiants that the man\u2019s name was Tasi and that Tasi was the manager of the store. Plaintiff\u2019s argument is without merit. These statements are not here excludable as hearsay since they were offered not as proof of the matter asserted but, rather, to show the affiants\u2019 reasonable belief and good faith. McCormick, Law of Evidence \u00a7 249, at 589-90 (2d ed. 1972). In the affairs of daily life, people do net upon the basis of utterances of others when, as here, there was a reasonable basis for doing so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
