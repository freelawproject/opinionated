Swank, 404 U.S. 282, 286, 92 S.Ct. 502, 30 L.Ed.2d 448 (1971); Wilson v. Weaver, 499 F.2d 155 (7th Cir. 1974); Alcala v. Burns, 494 F.2d 743 (8th Cir., 1974). If such eligibility is established, we must find secondly, either: (a) that there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a congressional intention to permit the extension of AFDC benefits to the unborn only at the option of the states, <em>see </em>Townsend v. Swank, <em>supra </em>at 286, 92 S.Ct. 502; or (b) that having voluntarily extended AFDC benefits to the unborn, New Hampshire is required to do so in the manner prescribed by the Social Security Act. On the basis of either theory, the order of the district court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1246\">*1246</page-number> We consider first the question of eligiblity. Section 402(a) (10) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a) (10), directs that AFDC benefits be \u201cfurnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.\u201d Eligibility is generally defined under \u00a7 406(a), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a), which describes \u201cdependent child\u201d in part as a needy child who has been deprived of parental support and who is living with one of several relatives.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We see no reason why a fetus may not be deprived of material and medical assistance as easily as a newborn infant, or any child for that matter, to the extent that deprivation of aid to the mother may deny the fetus adequate nutrition or medication. Nor does it appear anomalous that a fetus may be described as \u201cliving\u201d with the mother. Indeed, a child is \u201cliving with\u201d his mother more directly <em>in \u00fatero </em>than at any other time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus we find nothing in the languge of \u00a7 406 which precludes a determination that Congress intended to include the unborn within the meaning of \u201cdependent child\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-4\">While the language of the Act is thus not inconsistent with a congressional intention to benefit the unborn, it is not sufficiently unambiguous to dispose of the eligibility question,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we turn to other indices of congressional intent. We agree with the district court that the legislative history of the Social Security Act \u201cbespeaks no specific intent on the part of Congress in respect of either the exclusion or the inclusion of the unborn child.\u201d 369 F.Supp. at 212. It is true that isolated statements in the 1935 debate on the Act advert to the need to protect children \u201cfrom the time of birth\u201d, <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but there is no evidence that Congress as a body passed the Act with that limitation. It is also- true that when Congress passed the AFDC proposal as Title IV of the Act, it enacted a separate program for maternal care in Title V, <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq. But Titles IV and V are qualitatively different weapons against poverty and deprivation, the latter providing medical services while the former disburses cash for improvement of the home environment. Moreover, because the medical services provided under Title V extend to born as well as unborn children, it seems incongruous that Congress would not make similar provision under Title IV. Thus, the congressional concern evidenced by Title V with respect to pre-natal care does not militate against an intention to assist the unborn through AFDC payments as well. <em>See </em>Whitfield v. Minter, 368 F.Supp. 798 (D.Mass.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1300-9\">A final bit of evidence from the legislative history of the Social Security Act is Congress\u2019 recent<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> failure to enact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1247\">*1247</page-number>amendments to the Act which would have expressly excluded eligibility for the unborn.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The fact that Congress thought it necessary to amend the Act to exclude the unborn suggests to us that the Act as written does make the unborn eligible for AFDC assistance, especially in light of the HEW interpretation to that effect, 45 C.F.R, \u00a7 233.90(c) (2)(ii). <em>See </em>Wilson v. Weaver, <em>supra; </em>Alcala v. Burns, <em>supra; </em>Whitfield v. Minter, <em>supra. </em>That suggestion, if weakened by the statement of the House committee considering the amendments that the change would \u201cmake clear\u201d that the unborn child is ineligible,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is strengthened by the opinion of the Senate committee that the amendments \u201cwould <em>make </em>unborn children ineligible.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-5\">Absent dispositive indications from the legislaive history of the Social Security Act, we turn to the record of its administration by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, mindful that \u201cthe construction of a statute by those charged with its execution should be followed unless there are compelling indications that it is wrong.\u201d Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 381, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1802, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969); <em>see </em>Wilson v. Weaver, <em>supra, </em>499 F.2d 155; Doe v. Lukhard, 363 F. Supp. 823, 829 (E.D.Va.1973), aff\u2019d, 493 F.2d 54 (4th Cir. 1974). There can be no doubt that HEW\u2019s interpretation of the Act supports a finding of eligiblity. HEW regulations explicitly provide federal funds to states extending AFDC benefits to the unborn, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.-90(c) (2)(ii), and the Department has consistently followed that practice since 1941.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Wilson v. Weaver, <em>supra. </em>In other words, if unborn children are ineligible under the Act, HEW and its predecessors have illegally succored them for a third of a century.</p>\n<p id=\"b1301-14\">Moreover, we think that a finding of eligibility for the unborn is consistent with the purposes and policies of the Social Security Act. The Supreme Court has declared the \u201cparamount goal\u201d of the AFDC program to be the protecton of needy children. King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309, 325, 88 S.Ct. 2128, 20 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1968). Payments to the unborn are an appropriate, if not essential, means to that end, especially in light of the undisputed evidence, accepted by the district court, that pre-natal nutrition and medical care are important determinants of \u201clater susceptibility to disease, neurological problems and long-term learning capacity.\u201d 369 F.Supp. at 208. See Wilson v. Weaver, <em>supra, </em>499 F.2d 159, n. 3.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And while various provisions of the Act suggest congressional purposes subordinate to this overall policy of protecting children, we find that none of them conflict with a finding of eligibility of the unborn.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>A final support for a finding of eligibility is that such a construction may be necessary to forestall a successful equal protection challenge to the AFDC legislation, brought on behalf of unborn children or their mothers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has concluded that \u201c[a]ny doubt must be resolved in favor of [a] construction to avoid the necessity of passing upon the equal protection issue\u201d, Townsend v. Swank, <em>supra, </em>404 U.S. at 291, 92 S.Ct. at 508. There is at least some doubt whether the justifications proferred here by New Hampshire, <em>see </em>369 F.Supp. at 215, unrelated as they are to a recipient\u2019s need for assistance, would survive even the \u201cloose review\u201d of a \u201crationality test\u201d. <em>Cf. </em>Whitfield v. Minter, <em>supra, </em>368 F.Supp. at 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-4\">In concert, the at least non-exclusionary language of the Act, the implicit congressional recognition of eligibility in consideration of amendments to exclude the unborn, the consistent administrative recognition of eligibility, the manifest purposes of the Act, and the significance of a constitutional challenge to a contrary interpretation, warrant our holding that unborn children are eligible for AFDC benefits under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1302-5\">A finding that the' unborn are eligible for assistance does not end our inquiry. Though Congress may have intended to make eligible a class of recipients, it may also have intended to permit the exclusion of that class at the option of the states. <em>See, e. g., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 607(b). The Supreme Court has made clear, however, that upon a finding of eligibility the states bear a heavy burden to demonstrate a congressional intention to permit exclusion. Townsend v. Swank, <em>supra, </em>404 \u00dc.S. at 286, 92 S.Ct. 502. But here there is nothing in the language, legislative history, or purposes of the Act to sustain such a burden. We recognize the consistent and long standing practice of HEW, see 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 233.90(c) (2)(ii), of permitting states the option to benefit the unborn, but this cannot substitute for \u201cclear\u201d evidence of <em>congressional </em>approval.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Alcala v. Burns, <em>supra; </em>Doe v. Lukhard, 363 F.Supp. 823, 828-29 (E.D.Va.1973), aff\u2019d, 493 F.2d 54 (4th Cir. 1974). We, therefore, conclude that Congress has not \u201cclearly evidenced\u201d an intention to permit the exclusion of the unborn.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1302-19\">Alternatively, we find that even if such an optional policy exists, New Hampshire has exercised its option, though not in the manner prescribed by the Social Security Act. Appellants admit to a practice of making retroactive AFDC payments, covering the pre-natal period, under certain circumstances, after a child qualifying for AFDC benefits is born.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> New Hampshire permits a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>mother to bill the state for the costs of delivery of a child, and because of administrative difficulties in determining which portion of the total doctor bill reflects pre-natal and which post-natal costs, regularly pays the <em>entire </em>bill. Regardless of its reasons, New Hampshire, albeit retroactively, has recognized the eligibility of unborn children by making AFDC payments to such children. However, the Act specifically requires that AFDC payments \u201cshall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a)(10). And the Supreme Court has indicated that the statute precludes the states \u201cfrom denying benefits, even temporarily, to a person who has been found fully qualified for aid.\u201d Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U.S. 535, 545, 92 S.Ct. 1724, 32 L.Ed.2d 285 (1972). New Hampshire has made its decision to comply with the provisions of the Social Security Act permitting payments to unborn children. Now it must do so fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b1303-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1300-5\">. Section 406(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1300-6\">\u201cThe term \u2018dependent child\u2019 means a needy child (1) who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home, or physical or mental incapacity of a parent, and who is living with his father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, brother, sister, stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, or niece, in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or their own home, and (2) who is (A) under the age of eighteen, or (B) under the age of twenty-one and (as determined by the state in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary) a student regularly attending a school, college, or university, or regularly attending a course of vocational or technical training designed to fit him for gainful employment; . . . . \u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 606(a).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1300-10\">. Though the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), arguably proscribes as unconstitutional the governmental characterization of a fetus, at least during the earlier portions of pregnancy, as a \u201chuman being\u201d for the purposes of assessing the interests implicated by a decision to abort, that decision neither proscribes the recognition of a fetus as \u201cliving\u201d nor forbids the government to benefit the fetus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1300-11\">.

Both proponents and opponents of coverage of the unborn wrestle with provisions spelling out particular purposes. These range from encouraging \u201cthe care of dependent children in their own homes\u201d, 42 TJ.S.C. \u00a7 601, strengthening family life, \u00a7 601, and notice to law enforcement officials in a case of abandonment by a parent, \u00a7 602(a) (11), to a plan of social services for the child and his family, \u00a7 602(a) (13)-(15), and consideration of a child\u2019s \u201cincome and resources\u201d, \u00a7 602(a)(8). Some of these apply quite as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1248\">*1248</page-number>well to the unborn as to the born child. Some are family-oriented, with little or no bearing on eligibility. A few provisions fit more comfortably with the assumptions of the opponents, but not to the exclusion of the rationale urged by proponents. If there is a net result favoring those opposing inclusion of the unborn, it is at best a small one, deriving from a few minor provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1302-15\">. Appellees raised an equal protection challenge to New Hampshire\u2019s practice of excluding the unborn, but it was not reached in light of the district court\u2019s decision that the practice violates the Supremacy Clause. <em>See </em>369 F.Supp. at 206, 215.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1302-17\">. The Supreme Court has expressly disapproved the HEW \u201cpolicy which permitted States to vary eligibility requirements from the federal standards without express or clearly implied congressional authorization.\u201d Carleson v. Remillard, 406 U.S. 598, 600-601, 92 S.Ct. 1932, 1934, 32 L.Ed.2d 352 (1972), citing Townsend v. Swank, <em>supra, </em>404 U.S. at 286, 92 S.Ct. 502.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1302-21\">. There is no contradiction between this conclusion and our earlier reliance upon HEW interpretations in determining eligibility ; the inference from HEW practice is the same in both areas, but the standard of review is different here, where congressional intentions must be \u201cclearly evidenced\u201d. <em>See </em>Alcala v. Burns, <em>supra; </em>Doe v. Lukhard, <em>supra, </em>363 F.Supp. at 828-829.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1302-22\">. We speak here of New Hampshire\u2019s practice of providing retroactive AFDC benefits after birth, and not of the state\u2019s responsibilities under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq. The provisions of Title XIX aid the states in extending medical assistance, including pre-na-tal care, to individuals who <em>otherwise </em>qualify for categorical assistance, including AFDC. Thus New Hampshire extends medical assistance to pregnant mothers who qualify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1249\">*1249</page-number>for AFDC benefits because they have other children, but does not extend such benefits to pregnant mothers with no other children. Because these Medicaid provisions utilize whatever is the prevailing definition of AFDC eligibility and extend pre-natal assist-anee by that standard rather than by virtue of a recipient\u2019s expectancy, New Hampshire\u2019s compliance with such provisions cannot be said to concede the eligibility of the unborn under the AFDC program.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
