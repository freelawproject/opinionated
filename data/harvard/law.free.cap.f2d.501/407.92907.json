While it appears that Johnson may have been administered rather harsh punishment for apparently trivial offenses, the warden testified that such punishment was not unusual and was administered in a nondiscriminatory manner.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In reviewing the record, we note that Johnson has posed a disciplinary problem to the institution but testimony indicates that his attitude has improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-20\">On the basis of the record presented to us, Judge Urbom\u2019s opinion is entitled to affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-14\">. These punishments were often meted out without an opportunity for a fair hearing. In the future, of course, the Nebraska penal authorities will be obliged to conduct their disciplinary hearings in the institution in conformity with the principles announced in Wolff, Warden et al. v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
