Appellant Bowdach moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that Rule 6(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure had been violated by the presence of an unauthorized person in the Grand Jury room, and on February 23, 1971, the motion was granted. United States v. Bowdach, 324 F.Supp. 123 (S.D.Fla.). A new grand jury returned a superseding indictment, charging the same defendants with the same violations, on March 4, 1971. Bowdach was the only defendant brought to trial, and he was tried on fifteen counts. After trial by jury, he was convicted on one count of conspiracy to violate section 892<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (count 1) and six counts of substantive violations of sections 892 (counts 2, 12, 14 and 16) and 894 (counts 3 and 17).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ment dismissed seven counts against Bowdach, and the jury found him not guilty on one count. He was sentenced to concurrent terms of fifteen years imprisonment on each count. On appeal, Bowdach raised for the first time the issue of validity, under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510 et seq., of procedures used to secure wiretaps used as evidence that led to his conviction. We remanded the case to the district court for an evidentiary hearing, in light of this Court\u2019s en banc decision in United States v. Robinson, etc., 472 F.2d 973 (1973), to determine whether the wiretap applications were properly authorized under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(1). <em>See </em>United States v. Bowdach, 474 F.2d 812 (5 Cir. 1973). On remand, the district court held (1) that the Attorney General had personally authorized the request for the application for the wiretap order, and (2) that the disparity between the \u201cauthorizing individual\u201d designated in the application for the order and in the subsequent order was not fatal to the validity of the procedure. United States v. Bowdach, 366 F.Supp. 1368 (S.D.Fla.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">We have held this case pending decision by the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Chavez, 416 U.S. 562, 94 S.Ct. 1849, 40 L.Ed.2d 380, on the wiretap issue. Bowdach challenges his convictions not only on the ground that they were obtained with the fruits of invalidly approved wiretaps, but also on the grounds <em>\u00a1,,iier alia </em>that certain provisions of the Extortionate Credit Transactions Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) are unconstitutional and that certain evidence was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">At the time of his arrest, Bowdach was employed as a used-car salesman in Miami. There is ample evidence that he frequently made extortionate cash loans on the side, many to others in the used-car business. His conviction for conspiring to violate section 892 of the Act, which prohibits making extortionate extensions of credit,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was based primarily on the evidence of transcribed wire-tapped conversations between him and Cic-chini. His convictions on the substantive counts of violating sections 892 and 894, which prohibit collections of extensions of credit by extortionate means,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were based on the testimony of several debtors \u2014 principally Joseph S. Leal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Richard (\u201cRick\u201d) Moore, and James Bell \u2014 and of a Mrs. Margaret Stallard.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">It is unnecessary to review the wiretap evidence, because appellant complains only of the procedures used to obtain it and not of its sufficiency; however, the evidence of the three debtors named above and of Mrs. Stallard requires specific attention. Count 12 of the indictment pertained to loans made to Leal; counts 2 and 3 pertained to loans made to Moore; counts 14, 16 and 17 pertained to loans made to Bell. Appellant was convicted on each of these counts. Mrs. Stallard did not borrow money from the appellant; she testified of threats made to her by the appellant in a dispute over a car sold to her by him, and of a threatening message he asked her to deliver to Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Leal borrowed money twice from Cic-chini, $100 in January, 1970 and $300 in March or May, 1970. The interest on each loan was \u201c6, 7 or 8%\u201d per week. Leal reluctantly admitted that he knew at the time of the first loan that if he didn\u2019t repay it, he would \u201cget a broken leg or something.\u201d He said he knew at the time the second loan was made that Ciechini had a reputation for violence concerning the lending of money. Leal was instructed twice by Ciechini to make his payments to the appellant, and Leal paid off the final installments of principle and interest on each loan to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Moore borrowed a total of $300 to $350 from the appellant in two transactions early in 1970. Interest was $14 per week for one year on the $200 transaction. Moore said that at the time of the loans he knew the appellant had a reputation for violence in his collection practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">Bell took out two loans from the appellant, for $200 in early 1970 and for $50 a few months later. Interest was $20 per week. Bell said that he \u201cunderstood\u201d at the time of the first loan that \u201cif I didn\u2019t pay somebody comes around and beats you up.\u201d In April, 1970, Bell left Miami while still owing the appellant $250.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Mrs. Stallard testified that she had purchased a car from the appellant for $1,005 in early 1970, paid $300 down and arranged with the appellant to make weekly payments of $15. The car did not run properly, and Mrs. Stallard returned it to the appellant but continued \u25a0 to make weekly payments. At one point, she threatened to go to the State Attorney over the transaction, but the appellant told her \u201c. . . you got those two kids to think about, if you do this [complain to the State Attorney], a lot of harm can come to you and those kids.\u201d Mrs. Stallard also testified that after Bell left Miami, the appellant telephoned her and asked her to relay a message to Bell: \u201cHe [the appellant] said that he had men looking for Bell in North Carolina and that they were going to bring him back and shoot him and cut his balls off and hang them in the Dolphin\u2019s Locker [a bar where she worked].\u201d She added that the appellant also told her that he had held a gun on Moore and cut him with a knife. Mrs. Stallard relayed the message to Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-12\">II. VALIDITY OF THE WIRETAPS</p>\n<p id=\"b278-13\">Appellant contends that the evidence obtained from wiretaps on three telephones at his place of business should have been suppressed at trial, because the procedures used in obtaining the taps did not comport with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516(1),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which requires authorization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>for wiretaps to be made by the \u201cAttorney General, or any Assistant Attorney General specially designated by the Attorney General,\u201d and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(1) (a), (4)(d),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which requires that the individual authorizing the application and order for a wiretap must be identified to the issuing judge. When the point was raised for the first time on appeal, we remanded for evidentiary hearing to determine whether then Attorney General Mitchell had personally authorized the application or whether he had designated then Assistant Attorney General Will Wilson to undertake the discretionary act of authorization. <em>See </em>United States v. Bowdach, 474 F.2d 812, 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The facts developed at the hearing were almost identical in effect with those in the Supreme Court case of United States v. Chavez, <em>supra. </em>The wiretap phase of the case has therefore been decided adversely to Bowdach\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">III. USE OF BEPUTATION EVIDENCE IN SECTION 892 CONVICTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Appellant challenges his convictions for substantive violations of section 892 on the grounds that the admission of evidence as to his reputation for violence in credit practices was not statutorily authorized and not constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-15\">A. <em>Statutory Authorization</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-16\">Appellant contends that the admission of reputation evidence was not authorized under \u00a7 892(c), because the prerequisite was not met of showing that \u201cdirect evidence of the actual belief of the debtor as to the creditor\u2019s collection practices is not available.\u201d It is unnecessary to meet this contention, however, because the admission of such evidence was clearly authorized under \u00a7 892(b)(3)(B), which allows evidence of the debtor\u2019s reasonable belief that the \u201ccreditor had a reputation for the use of extortionate means\u201d in his collection practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-17\"> Although reputation evidence is allowed under both \u00a7\u00a7 892(b)(3)(B) and 892(c), the operation of the two sections is not identical and it may be helpful at this point to note the differences. \u00a7 892(c) allows the introduction of evidence of the creditor\u2019s reputation in collection practices, provided three prerequisites are met:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-18\">1) evidence has been introduced tending to show that the loan would be legally unenforceable, and</p>\n<p id=\"b279-19\">2) that the annual rate of interest exceeded 45 per cent, and</p>\n<p id=\"b279-20\">3) \u201cdirect evidence of the actual belief of the debtor as to the creditor\u2019s collection practices is not available.\u201d Where the requirements are satisfied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>reputation evidence may be introduced \u201cfor the purpose of showing the understanding of the debtor and the creditor\u201d at the time of the loan.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There are no prerequisites, however, for the introduction of reputation evidence under \u00a7 892(b)(3)(B). Such evidence is merely one of four factors that must be established to make out a prima facie case of violation .of the section.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">B. <em>Constitutionality</em></p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Appellant contends that the introduction of reputation evidence is so prejudicial that it deprives him of Due Process of law as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment. It is true, of course, as a general principle that in criminal eases the prosecution may not introduce any kind of evidence in its case-in-chief of the defendant\u2019s evil character or reputation in order to establish probability of guilt. <em>See </em>Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 475, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168 (1948); Railton v. United States, 127 F.2d 691, 692 (5th Cir. 1949); Hurst v. United States, 337 F.2d 678, 680 (5th Cir. 1964). The principle is not absolute, and this Court has noted exceptions. <em>See Hurst, supra, </em>at 680-681.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">The use of reputation evidence under the Act is not really an exception to the general principle, however, because such evidence is used <em>not </em>to establish probability of guilt but to demonstrate the <em>victim\u2019s state of mind </em>regarding the transaction. Fear is the central element in crimes of extortion, and often the victim may reasonably be in fear without possessing knowledge of specific acts of the victimizer. This fear may extend beyond the act or transaction involved, and may even follow the victim to the witness stand, as Congress recognized when considering the Act. The legislative history of the Act shows that Congress felt it was necessary to permit the use of reputation evidence under certain circumstances, due to the reluctance of loan-sharking victims to testify; <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> otherwise, it might be virtually impossible to demonstrate the victim\u2019s state of mind toward the transaction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Following the intent of Congress, the courts have uniformly allowed the introduction of reputation evidence under the appropriate circumstances fbr the purpose of showing the victim\u2019s state of mind. United States v. De Lutro, 309 F.Supp. 462, 467-468 (S.D.N.Y.1970); United States v. Curcio, 310 F.Supp. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>351, 357 (D.Conn.1970); United States v. Webb, 463 F.2d 1324, 1328 (5th Cir. 1972). Reputation evidence has also been allowed to show the victim\u2019s state of mind in prosecutions for extortion under the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. Carbo v. United States, 314 F.2d 718, 741-742 (9th Cir. 1963), cert. den. sub nom., Palermo v. United States, 377 U.S. 953, 84 S.Ct. 1625, 12 L.Ed.2d 498; United States v. Tropiano, 418 F.2d 1069, 1081 (2nd Cir. 1969), cert. den. sub nom., Grasso v. United States, 397 U.S. 1021, 90 S.Ct. 1258, 25 L.Ed.2d 530; United States v. DeMasi, 445 F.2d 251, 257 (2nd Cir. 1971), cert. den., 404 U.S. 882, 92 S.Ct. 211, 30 L.Ed.2d 164; United States v. Billingsley, 474 F.2d 63, 65-66 (6th Cir. 1973); United States v. Stubbs, 476 F.2d 626, 627-628 (6th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The courts in De <em>Lutro </em>and <em>Curdo </em>specifically addressed the question of the constitutionality of permitting reputation evidence under the Act, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and found it permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We agree with the courts that have upheld the constitutionality of the Act in allowing the use of reputation evidence in the prescribed circumstances, and we are not convinced by the appellant that such evidence prejudiced his trial in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The evidence was used only to show the victim\u2019s state of mind; where such evidence is admitted for this limited purpose, the Constitution is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">IV. ADMISSIBILITY OF MRS. STALLARD\u2019S TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Appellant contends that Mrs. Stal-lard\u2019s testimony as to a threat made by him to her over the legal automobile sale was inadmissible, because it was not similar fact evidence, not statutorily authorized and, thus, it unfairly prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\"> It should be emphasized that the appellant was not charged with violating the Act with respect to Mrs. Stallard. Her testimony was admitted as \u201csimilar fact\u201d evidence for the purpose of showing the appellant\u2019s \u201cintent\u201d in collection practices generally. The admission of such evidence is discretionary, and the exercise of this discretion requires \u201cbalancing of the probative value of the proffered evidence against its prejudicial character.\u201d United States v. Byrd, 352 F.2d 570, 574 (2nd Cir. 1965). One factor to be weighed in this balance is the necessity for the prosec\u00fation to \u201csharpen\u201d its proof of intent by showing similar acts to demonstrate that the alleged crime in question was not done innocently or by accident or by mistake. United States v. Byrd, <em>supra, </em>at 575. In the case before us, the prosecution was not faced with this necessity. Appellant\u2019s reputation for violence in collection practices had been established. Nor was Mrs. Stallard\u2019s evidence necessary to establish or to \u201cilluminate\u201d the relationship between the appellant and Leal, Moore or Bell. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Nakaladski, 481 F.2d 289, 296 (5th Cir. 1973). The prejudicial effect of Mrs. Stallard\u2019s testimony is obvious, and \u201c[w]here the prejudice is substantial and the probative value, through the nature of the evidence or the lack of any real necessity for it, is slight, its admission . may be held to be an abuse of discretion.\u201d United States v. Byrd, <em>supra, </em>at 575. Under this test, Mrs. Stallard\u2019s testimony as to threats connected with the sale of the car should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-13\">Moreover, it cannot be said that Mrs. Stallard\u2019s testimony on this point was specially authorized by the Act under \u00a7 894(b), which allows evidence of other extortionate collections made by the defendant <em>with the victim\u2019s knowledge </em>to be introduced for \u201cshowing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>implicit threat\u201d to the victim. The prosecution in the case before us did not attempt to show that the threat to Mrs. Stallard was made with any victim\u2019s knowledge. Thus, the testimony was not authorized by the Act. <em>See </em>United States v. Marchesani, 457 F.2d 1291, 1296 (6th Cir. 1972).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">However, our conclusion that this testimony was inadmissible does not mean, as appellant declares, that it \"infected the entire proceedings and prejudiced the defendant beyond any hope of recovery.\u201d The government had proved its case completely without Mrs. Stallard\u2019s testimony on this incident. We conclude, after a thorough and independent examination of the record, that the admission of this testimony was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt and thus that appellant\u2019s convictions must be affirmed. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); United States v. Resnick, 483 F.2d 354, 357 (5th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1008, 94 S.Ct. 370, 38 L.Ed.2d 246.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For a case in which it was held that erroneous admission of such evidence in similar circumstances did not require reversal, <em>see </em>United States v. Kennedy, 291 F.2d 457, 459 (2d Cir. 1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">V. USE OF REPUTATION EVIDENCE IN SECTION 894 CONVICTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">Appellant challenges his convictions for substantive violations of section 894 on the same ground that he challenges his convictions under section 892. <em>See </em>section III, <em>supra. </em>Because the issues with respect to the admissibility of reputation evidence are essentially the same here as they are under section 892, and because appellant received concurrent sentences on each count, under the \u201cconcurrent sentence doctrine\u201d we find it unnecessary further to examine this argument. Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 105, 63 S.Ct. 1375, 87 L.Ed. 1774 (1943). <em>See also </em>Lawn v. United States, 355 U.S. 339, 362, 78 S.Ct. 311, 2 L.Ed.2d 321 (1958); Thomas v. United States, 431 F.2d 940, 941 (5th Cir. 1970); United States v. Abi-gando, 439 F.2d 827, 829 (5th Cir. 1971); United States v. Johnson, 496 F.2d 1131 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-12\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b282-13\">We have examined the other contentions made by the appellant, but find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court must be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-7\">.
