The actions filed by the shippers in the District Court were maintained to enforce an Interstate Commerce Commission refund order.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">In March of 1968, the Middlewest Motor Freight Bureau, a tariff publishing agent for motor carriers in the middle-west territory, filed a schedule of rate increases with the I.C.C. These rate increases were to take effect on April 1, 1968. Although the I.C.C. did not suspend the operation of the schedule, it instituted an investigation of the lawfulness of the rates because of protests by various parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">The Commission ordered that certain evidence be filed, and set a hearing date of May 20, 1968. On April 12, 1968, the General Services Administration and the Department of Transportation requested a 90-day extension for submission of the required evidence. On April 22, 1968, the Middlewest Bureau sought a like postponement for \u201cthe reason . that it [was] a physical impossibility for the respondents to compile the required data within the time allowed by the order . . . \u201d. On April 25, 1968, the Commission granted the extension in an order which read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtA\">It is further ordered, That the time for filing the requested information and supporting data be, and, it is hereby extended to August 5, 1968; that the hearing be, and it is hereby postponed to August 19, 196&amp;, conditioned upon respondents\u2019 compliance with the refund provision ordered below * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-12\">And it is further ordered, That respondents be, and they are hereby, ordered to make refunds to the shippers on any shipment moving after May 20, 1968, to the extent that the increases or any portion thereof under investigation herein are not approved by the Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b984-13\">Increased Rates and Charges, From, To and Between Middlewest Territory, I.C. C. No. 34971 (Order of April 25, 1968). The Bureau petitioned for reconsideration of the refund requirement. It withdrew the petition when it learned that in other similar proceedings the Commission had, at the request of other carriers, vacated a refund order but reinstated the original hearing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-14\">The hearing was held on August 19, 1968. The Commission found, on June 5, 1969, that the proposed increases had not been shown to be just and reasonable,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and it ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-15\">* * * That, in accordance with the order entered herein on April 25, 1968, the respondents be, and they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number><em>hereby, </em>required to refund to shippers the charges on shipments moving after May 20, 1968, to the extent that such charges included the increases herein found not shown to be just and reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">Increased Rates and Charges, From, To and Between Middlewest Territory, No. 34971, 335 I.C.C. 142, 151 (June 5, 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">The carriers petitioned the Commission to reconsider the refund order or reopen the proceedings for further hearing. They also cancelled the disputed increases on statutory notice, effective August 31, 1969, and filed new rate schedules to become effective September 1, 1969. The schedules filed called for rates higher than those filed in March, 1968. The Commission entered an order on August 29, 1969, declining to suspend or investigate the new increases. It also denied the carriers\u2019 petition to reconsider the refund order. It ordered the carriers, in accordance with its decision of June 5,1969, to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-6\">* * * make refunds to the shippers presenting their claims to the carriers supported by paid freight bills or other appropriate evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARDp\">Increased Rates and Charges, From, To and Between Middlewest Territory, I.C. C. No. 34971 (Order of August 29, 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">On October 27, 1969, the Commission denied an October 9, 1969, petition for reconsideration of the June 5, 1969, decision as affirmed on August 29, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">On January 26, 1970, sixty of the approximately 1,100 carriers filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. They asked that a three-judge court be convened pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2284 and 2321-2325. They sought a declaration that the Commission\u2019s refund orders were beyond the statutory authority and jurisdiction of the Commission and an injunction against enforcement of the refund requirement. On June 19, 1970, the Colorado District Court issued an order temporarily restraining the I. C.C. from effectuating its refund order. On November 6, 1970, the three-judge court issued a preliminary injunction to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">In a memorandum opinion and order filed on January 14, 1971, the three-judge court dismissed the carriers\u2019 complaint finding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b985-12\">We are unable in good conscience, in view of the circumstances presented, to annul the order of the Commission. The Commission was acting in good faith in granting the extension, and the carriers were at the time agreeable to acceptance of the benefits of such an extension order. Their present posture appears to us to be grossly inequitable and not deserving of court intervention. While we do not commend the procedure as one which should be or could be practiced, we do hold that the peculiar facts of this case, arising as they did, are such as to not justify the granting of the relief requested, namely annulment of the Commission\u2019s order and approval of the carriers\u2019 conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b985-13\">Admiral-Merchants Motor Freight, Inc. v. United States, 321 F.Supp. 353, 360 (D.Colo.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-14\">The three-judge court entered judgment against the carriers on February 4, 1971, and vacated the injunction. The United States Supreme Court affirmed the judgment without an opinion on October 12, 1971, 404 U.S. 802, 92 S.Ct. 51, 30 L.Ed.2d 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-15\">The appellee-shippers then filed suit in the District Court for the Western District of Missouri seeking enforcement of the Commission\u2019s refund order. The District Court entered judgment for the shippers in each case before it. It wrote its principal opinion in case No. 73-1201, Proctor and Gamble Co. v. Byers Transportation Co., Inc., 355 F. Supp. 547 (W.D.Mo.1973). It held: (1) that the carriers were precluded because of the decision in <em>Admiral-Merchants </em>from challenging the validity of the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>fund order under the principle of res ju-dicata and its related concepts; (2) that the Commission\u2019s order was an order for the payment of money and, thus, enforceable under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(2); (3) that the shippers were not barred from recovering damages because of the applicable statute of limitations; and (4) that the shippers were entitled to damages, interest and attorneys\u2019 fees. The carriers question the court\u2019s decision on each point.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">EFFECT OF ADMIRAL-MERCHANTS</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">The District Court found that all carriers before it were either parties to or privy to parties in the three-judge court action and were bound by the latter court\u2019s decision. The carriers do not challenge the court\u2019s finding on privity. They do contend, however: (1) that the validity of the Commission\u2019s order was not decided by the three-judge court and was subject to attack in the court below; and (2) that the Commission\u2019s order is confiscatory and should not be enforced for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">The Seventh Circuit, in discussing the first issue in a case similar to this one stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-7\">* * * The assertion of this argument requires, as the court below concluded, a \u201cmyopic reading of the opinion\u201d of the Colorado three-judge court. * * * The statement of issues given by the three-judge panel negates any argument that the court was not concerned with the validity of the Commission\u2019s refund order: * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-12\">Aluminum Co. of Amer. v. Admiral Merchants M. Frgt., Inc., 486 F.2d 717, 720 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1113, 94 S.Ct. 843, 38 L.Ed.2d 739 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-13\">An examination of the three-judge court\u2019s statement of the issues before it leads us to agree with the Seventh Circuit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-16\">We must decide whether an order of the Commission in which a rate increase is denied, which order directs repayment of interim rates, if determined to be invalid, and which refund order wg,s entered by the Commission as a condition of granting an extension of time to the carriers at their request, is invalid and subject to a judgment annulling the same. We are not involved with the Commission\u2019s order denying the increase. We are limited to the propriety and validity of a conditional rate refund order, which order was tacitly or impliedly (by withdrawals of objection) accepted by the carriers, plaintiffs herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a6t-dedup-0\">Admiral-Merchants Motor Freight, Inc. v. United States, <em>supra, </em>321 F.Supp. at 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-17\">As the validity of the Commission\u2019s order was determined by the three-judge court, the doctrine of <em>collateral estoppel </em>was applicable and the appellees could not reassert its invalidity in the court below. <em>See, </em>IB J. Moore, Federal Practice |fff 0.410, 0.441 and 0.-443 (2d ed. 1965). <em>Accord, </em>S. S. Kresge Company v. A &amp; B Transfer, Inc., 488 F.2d 894 (6th Cir. 1973), cert. denied, 415 U.S. 960, 94 S.Ct. 1491, 39 L.Ed.2d 575 (1974); Aluminum Co. of Amer. v. Admiral Merchants M. Frgt., Inc., <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b986-18\">The carriers\u2019 second contention is that enforcement of the refund order will result in the confiscation of their property without due process. They argue that they have never had an opportunity to present evidence on this issue to the Commission or to a federal court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the due process requirements of the Constitution require that they be given such an opportunity. The District Court viewed this contention as an additional attack upon the validity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>the order and held that the three-judge court decision in <em>Admiral-Merchants </em>precluded such an attack. We agree with District Court\u2019s characterization of the attack. This is not to say that we necessarily agree that the three-judge court properly decided the issue by dismissing the complaint without granting the requested relief, but only that the carriers were precluded from raising the issue in the court below because of the three-judge court\u2019s decision and the Supreme Court\u2019s affirmance of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">The carriers suggest alternatively that they are not attacking the validity of the order but are simply arguing that even if the order is valid, enforcement of it results in their property being taken without due process and that the courts should give them a hearing on this issue. The answer to this suggestion is the same. They raised the issue before the three-judge court and the Supreme Court, and were denied relief by both.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">At oral argument, the carriers argued that public policy requires that we abrogate the carriers\u2019 obligation to pay the refunds \u2014 the theory being that if the carriers were required to pay the funds, many of them would be bankrupted and the flow of goods throughout the United States would be slowed. To the extent that this concern is a valid one, it can be recognized by the Commission in a future proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-11\">ENFORCEMENT OF THE REFUND ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">Although the Interstate Commerce Act originally established a scheme for the regulation of railioads, the Act was amended in 1935 to give the Commission the additional authority to regulate motor carriers. 49 Stat. 543. The sections regulating railroads were designated Part I (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq.), and the sections regulating motor carriers were designated Part II (49 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq.). Part I of the Act provides two methods by which shippers may recover damages against railroads in post-shipment litigation. Section 15(7) [49 U. S.C. \u00a7 15(7)] provides for refunds, and \u00a7\u00a7 13 and 16 [49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 13 &amp; 16] provide for reparations.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Part II does not contain refund provisions. However, in response to T.I.M.E., Inc. v. United States, 359 U.S. 464, 79 S.Ct. 904, 3 L.Ed.2d 952 (1959),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a reparations section was added in 1965.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b987-13\">The carriers contend that \u00a7 16(2) \u201ccreates a cause of action to enforce a railroad reparations order and for recovery of damages thereunder, only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b987-14\">The District Court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-15\">* * * jror reasons enunciated in Aluminum Company of America v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>Admiral-Merchants Motor Freight, Inc., 337 F.Supp. 674 (N.D.I11.1972) and Aluminum Company of America v. Burlington Truck Lines, 342 F. Supp. 166 (N.D.111.1972), the Court finds that Section 16(2) does provide a statutory cause of action to the plaintiff under' the facts presented.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Av9V\">355 F.Supp. at 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">The cases cited by the District Court held that \u00a7 16(2) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of Part I of the Interstate Commerce Act, was incorporated into \u00a7 205(g) <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> of Part II of the Act, thus providing the shippers a statutory remedy for enforcement of the Commission refund order. We agree.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">We read \u00a7 205(g) as providing that shippers by motor carrier shall have the same right of relief with respect to final orders of the Commission as do shippers by rail, and read the phrase \u201cright of relief\u201d as encompassing the right to bring an action. As \u00a7 16(2) gives shippers by rail a right to bring an action to require carriers to comply with an order for the payment of money in federal District Court, shippers by motor carrier have the same right.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-14\">The carriers assert that \u201c[u]nless <em>T. I.M.E. </em>is to be disregarded entirely, plaintiffs have no cause of action under \u00a7 16 against motor carriers.\u201d In <em>T.I.M.E., </em>a shipper challenged the reasonableness of motor carriers\u2019 charges although they were in accordance with the published tariffs. The shipper contended that Part II of the Act creates a judicially enforceable right to recover unreasonable charges and that the Act preserves the common law right of a shipper by common carrier to recover exorbitant rates. The Supreme Court rejected both contentions. As to the first contention, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-18\">The very provisions of Part I, and their counterparts in Part III, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>give a right of action to shippers against carriers for damages incurred by carrier violations of the Act and provide the mechanics for the enforcement of that right are conspicuously absent in the Motor Carrier Act. Thus, whereas \u00a7 8 of Part I provides that \u201cany common carrier subject to the provisions of this chapter (who) shall do any act in this chapter . . . declared to be unlawful . . . shall be liable to the person or persons injured thereby for the full amount of the damages sustained . . . ,\" Part II has no comparable provision. Again, whereas \u00a7 9 of Part I gives an injured shipper the right to sue in the I.C.C. or in the Federal District Court, Part II contains no comparable provision. In addition, \u00a7\u00a7 13(1) and 16 of Part I give a shipper claiming reparation the right to proceed in the Commission and to enforce his reparation award in the courts, and Part II contains no comparable provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">T.I.M.E., Inc. v. United States, <em>swpra, </em>359 U.S. at 470-471, 79 S.Ct. at 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">The dissenting judge in S. S. Kresge v. A &amp; B Transfer, Inc., <em>supra, </em>488 F.2d at 899, concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-10\">The import of <em>T.I.M.E. </em>to the present case is apparent. The Supreme Court found that the remedies available to shippers by rail under \u00a7 16(2) were not present in the Motor Carrier Act. Consequently, any suggestion that \u00a7 16(2) is incorporated into Part II must fail unless, subsequent to the decision, Congress has provided for such incorporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">However, in Aluminum Co. of Amer. v. Admiral Merchants M. Frgt., Inc., <em>supra, </em>486 F.2d at 722, the Seventh Circuit ruled that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-12\">* * * [t]he <em>T.I.M.E. </em>decision is clearly distinguishable since it involved the shippers\u2019 right to reparations not their right to enforce a valid refund order. As stated by Judge Will in the court below, \u201cin no sense did the <em>T.I.M.E. </em>decision consider the issue of whether, when the Commission does issue a valid refund order under Part II, the shippers for whose benefit the order was issued can proceed under Section 16(2) of Part I.\u201d Admittedly, there is a dearth of legislative history and/or cases to which the court might look for assistance in interpreting \u00a7 305(g). Nevertheless, the plain language of the statute provides ample basis for the district court\u2019s conclusion that the statute incorporates \u00a7 16(2) of Part I: * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-15\">We agree with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation of <em>T.I.M.E.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-16\">The carriers also argue that conditions precedent to the maintenance of an action under \u00a7 16(2) are not present here. We simply quote from Aluminum Co. of Amer. v. Admiral Merchants M. Frgt., Inc., <em>supra </em>at 724.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-17\">We remind defendants that we are concerned with plaintiff\u2019s \u201cright of relief,\u201d i. e., its right to enforcement of the refund order, and not its compliance with technical requirements of questionable applicability. * * * Having accepted the benefits afforded by the continuance of the rate hearing, defendants should now be required to provide the agreed-upon exchange \u2014 the <em>quid pro quo.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-19\">STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b989-20\">The court below held that the applicable statute of limitations, 49 U.S. C. \u00a7 16(3) (f), was tolled from June 19, 1970, the date the Commission\u2019s refund order was restrained by the three-judge court, until February 4, 1971, the date final judgment was entered in <em>Admiral-Merchants </em>and the preliminary injunction was vacated. It found that the Commission\u2019s June 5, 1969, refund order did not become final until October 27, 1969; and because the complaint in this case was filed on November 12, 1970, it was filed within the one-year limitation period. We affirm. During the period that enforcement of the Commission\u2019s refund order was enjoined, \u201c * * * there was not an effective order upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>which the statute of limitations could run.\u201d 355 F.Supp. at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">INTEREST AND ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">We agree with the District Court that interest on refunds should run from August 12, 1970, the date of the shippers\u2019 demand on the carriers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We hold that the rate of interest should be set at four percent in all cases on appeal in this Circuit as a result of the Commission\u2019s June 5, 1969, refund order.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This interest rate will be consistent with that generally set by the Commission, <em>see, e. g., </em>Marion Power Shovel Co. v. Penna. R.R., 305 I.C.C. 465, 470 (1958), and will tend to promote nondiscrimination among competing carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">The District Court did not err in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to the shippers pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(2). <em>See </em>n. 8 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">We turn to No. 73-1202, United States v. Burlington Truck Line, Inc., 356 F.Supp. 582 (W.D.Mo.1973), in which the District Court entered judgment for the shipper after trial. The issues in this case are virtually identical to those in <em>Proctor and Gamble. </em>With the exception of the following, the issues raised in this case are governed by our conclusions in <em>Proctor and Gamble:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-15\">(1) The District Court\u2019s application of the three-year statute of limitations, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(3) (i),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to the cause of action of the United States did not constitute error; and</p>\n<p id=\"b990-17\">(2) the District Court did not err in awarding interest from May 4, 1971 (the date of the filing of the complaint), because no evidence of a demand by the shipper was presented. <em>See </em>n.ll <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-18\">Finally, in No. 73-1200, Western Electric Co., Inc. v. Burlington Truck Lines, Civil No. 18471-4 (W.D.Mo. March 6, 1973), the District Court entered judgment for the shipper after a trial upon stipulated facts. This case is also governed by our conclusions in <em>Proctor and Gamble. </em>In addition:</p>\n<p id=\"b990-19\">(1) the District Court was correct in holding that the statute of limitations, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(3) (f), did not begin to run until October 27, 1969, the date that the Commission\u2019s June 5, 1969, order became final; and</p>\n<p id=\"b990-20\">(2) the District Court did not err in awarding interest from June 25, 1970, the date Western Electric filed its complaint. <em>See </em>n.ll <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-21\">Costs on appeal shall be taxed to the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-22\">Affirmed with modifications and remanded for action consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b984-9\">. In case No. 73-1201, jurisdiction was asserted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1336. In case No. 73-1202, jurisdiction was asserted under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337.
