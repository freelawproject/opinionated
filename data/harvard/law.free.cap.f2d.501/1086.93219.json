The Tax Court\u2019s opinion is reported at j[ 73, 161 P-H Mem. TC. Taxpayers are husband and wife who filed joint returns for the years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-23\">Ms. Gibb, a Ph.D. in physiological chemistry, was appointed in 1966 to a position as a research assistant to the Ohio State University Research Foundation to do research in vision. It is appellant\u2019s contention that certain amounts of her income were received by her as a postdoctoral fellowship subject to exclusion under Section 117(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 117(a) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-24\">The Tax Court found that Ms. Gibb received over $10,000 in salary and fringe benefits in the years in question and excluded $300 each month on the ground that that sum represented a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>postdoctoral fellowship. The opinion also noted that she was expected to devote her full time to her contractual commitment with the Research Foundation, she was expected to submit the results of her research and make them available to the scientific public, the amount paid her was unusually large for a fellowship and that the Ohio State University gave her all the fringe benefits normally associated with employment as a \u201cregular\u201d employee. The Tax Court opinion concluded \u201cwe think it clear that petitioner was being paid to work and not to study.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">We find the findings of fact of the Tax Court not clearly erroneous and agree with the conclusions of law set forth therein. Bingler v. Johnson, 394 U.S. 741, 89 S.Ct. 1439, 22 L.Ed.2d 695 (1969). The judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
