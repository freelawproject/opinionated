Having analyzed this submission, the FDA on August 25, 1972 withdrew approval from Cooper\u2019s NDA, finding that the proffered materials did not constitute substantial evidence of efficacy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On appeal Cooper asserts that the Administration should have granted it a hearing before acting.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">The 1962 amendments define \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201cconsisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations,\u201d 21 U. S.C. \u00a7 355(d) (1970), a standard explicated in considerable detail by FDA regulations promulgated in 1970, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.12(a)(5) (April 1, 1973). While the amendments speak of FDA action \u201cafter due notice and opportunity for hearing,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(e), the Administration has established summary procedures for finding a drug ineffective where the applicant\u2019s proffered evidence clearly does not include \u201cadequate and well-controlled investigations\u201d and thus does not raise a \u201cgenuine and substantial issue of fact\u201d requiring a hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has \"recently construed these procedural regulations and declared them lawful.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The narrow question before us is whether the FDA\u2019s recourse to summary procedures was proper, given the evidence submitted to the Administration by Cooper. We find that it was and affirm the FDA\u2019s order of August 25, 1972 in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">I. ADMINISTRATIVE HISTORY OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">The 1962 amendments required the FDA to reevaluate more than 4,000 outstanding NDAs which had been approved solely on safety grounds since the passage of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in 1938.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To simplify this task, the Administration engaged the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>National Academy of Science \u2014 National Research Council in 1966 to create expert panels for preliminary screening of the effectiveness of these drugs; holders of NDAs were invited to submit data supporting the efficacy of their drugs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Protamide was evaluated by three such panels, which reported their conclusions in 1969. The Panel on Neurological Drugs found Protamide \u201cineffective\u201d for neuritis and herpes zoster; the Panel on Drugs Used in Dermatology III found the drug \u201cineffective\u201d for herpes zoster; and the Panel on Drugs Used in Ophthalmology found the drug \u201cpossibly effective\u201d for treatment of ophthalmic herpes zoster.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Citing these findings, the FDA in March 1969 required the maker of Pro-tamide to delete label \u201cindications [for] neuritis, herpes zoster, and tabes dorsal-is,\u201d and to provide, within six months, \u201csubstantial evidence of effectiveness of the drug for use in ophthalmic herpes zoster.\u201d 34 Fed.Reg. 5753 (March 27, 1969).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Receiving no reply, the FDA in December 1969 notified the maker of Protamide that withdrawal proceedings would be initiated. 35 Fed.Reg. 11535 (July 17, 1970). It gave Cooper 30 days to request a hearing and to submit evidence of efficacy, warning that a hearing would be denied if Cooper\u2019s submission revealed \u201cno genuine and substantial issue of fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">Cooper made a timely request for a hearing and submitted three types of evidence to show Protamide\u2019s efficacy in treating various illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">(1) By sworn affidavits, similarly worded, five licensed physicians testified that they had found Protamide effective in treating herpes zoster in their clinical practices. They further stated that the clinical experience of specialized physicians was peculiarly important in judging this drug\u2019s effectiveness because herpes zoster is difficult to diagnose, runs a variable course in patients, and produces a symptom \u2014 pain\u2014which is highly subjective and thus resistant to objective means of detection and measurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">(2) In letters responding to a written request by Cooper for information, 15 practicing doctors declared their belief that Protamide is more effective than any other regimen in treating herpes zoster and related ailments.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">(3) Cooper also introduced nine clinical studies, printed in various medical journals, on Protamide\u2019s efficacy in treating herpes zoster and related illnesses. Eight of the studies, published between 1947 and 1960, concluded that the drug provided beneficial treatment; the ninth study, published in 1968, concluded that Protamide had no effect on herpes zoster.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-16\">There ensued, in the FDA\u2019s language, \u201can extensive exchange of letters and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>numerous conferences\u201d between Cooper and the Administration to explore \u201cmethods of establishing the effectiveness of Protamide.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Two years of such discussions did not result in supplementation of Cooper\u2019s evidentiary submission. On August 25, 1972, pursuant to an analysis of this submission, the FDA simultaneously denied Cooper\u2019s request for a hearing and withdrew approval from the NDA for Protamide, explaining in an item-by-item critique of Cooper\u2019s evidence that none of the materials indicating efficacy constituted \u201cadequate and well-controlled investigations\u201d as required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d) and (e) and defined by 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.-12(a)(5).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">II. THE IMPACT OF <em>Hynson</em></p>\n<p id=\"acv-dedup-0\">After this appeal was filed, the Supreme Court decided Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott &amp; Dunning, Inc., 412 U.S. 609, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973), which, as both parties concede, governs the instant case. In <em>Hynson, </em>as here, the FDA had withdrawn approval from an outstanding NDA without a hearing on a finding that the applicant\u2019s evidence of efficacy did not consist of \u201cadequate and well-controlled investigations.\u201d The Court affirmed the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>Circuit\u2019s conclusion that Hynson\u2019s particular evidentiary submission was sufficient to require a hearing, but the opinion also set out three general principles which went beyond the facts of the case and are thus pertinent to this appeal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">(1) The Court upheld the validity of the FDA\u2019s regulatory criteria for \u201cadequate and well-controlled investigations,\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.12(a) (5).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-5\">t is not disputed here that they express well-established principles of scientific investigation. Moreover, their strict and demanding standards, barring anecdotal evidence indicating that doctors \u201cbelieve\u201d in the efficacy of a drug, is amply justified by the legislative history. The hearings underlying the 1962 Act showed a marked concern that impressions or beliefs of physicians, no matter how fervently held, are treacherous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">412 U.S. at 618-619, 93 S.Ct. at 2777.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">(2) The Court upheld the validity of the FDA\u2019s regulations allowing summary withdrawal of approval from NDA s, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.14(b) (April 1, 1973). Summary action was deemed proper</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-8\">where it is apparent at the threshold that the applicant has not tendered <em>any </em>evidence which <em>on its face </em>meets the statutory standards as particularized by the regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-9\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-10\">There can be no question that to prevail at a hearing an applicant must furnish evidence stemming from \u201cadequate and well-controlled investigations.\u201d We cannot impute to Congress the design of requiring, nor does due process demand, a hearing when it appears conclusively from the applicant\u2019s \u201cpleadings\u201d that it cannot succeed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-14\">412 U.S. at 620-621, 93 S.Ct. at 2478. (Emphasis in original.) A footnote qualified this statement to apply \u201conly to those regulations that are precise\u201d and indicated that \u201cit might not be proper to deny a hearing [on] the grounds that [a] study did not comply\u201d with regulatory standards which \u201cdo not lend themselves to clear-cut definition.\u201d 412 U.S. at 621 n. 17, 93 S.Ct. at 2479.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-15\">(3) Courts of Appeals were instructed, in reviewing a hearing denial, to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-16\">determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s findings accurately reflect the study in question and if they do, whether the deficiencies he finds conclusively render the study inadequate or uncontrolled in light of the pertinent regulations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-17\">412 U.S. at 622, 93 S.Ct. at 2479.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-18\">With these parameters in mind, we move directly to consider Cooper\u2019s claims that its evidentiary submission was sufficient to require a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-19\">III. COOPER\u2019S CLAIMS FOR A HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b831-20\">Cooper argues that its evidence raised two broad issues of fact which the FDA could not lawfully resolve in summary fashion. First, Cooper contends that its five doctors\u2019 affidavits concerning the nature of herpes zoster raise the \u201cfactual\u201d question whether Protamide\u2019s efficacy can fairly be determined by the \u201cobjective\u201d methods prescribed in the FDA regulations defining controlled investigations. Second, Cooper asserts that a factual dispute exists as to whether those regulatory criteria are met by the published clinical studies submitted to the FDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>A. <em>Affidavits on the Nature of Herpes Zoster</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The affidavits state that herpes zoster is hard to diagnose, runs a variable course, and causes pain \u2014 a symptom difficult to measure objectively. From these undisputed premises, Cooper concludes that a factual question exists whether the testimonials of experienced physicians, rather than the controlled studies required by regulation, should be recognized as substantial evidence of Protamide\u2019s efficacy. We do not think this is an issue requiring a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The regulations are subject to waiver upon a properly detailed showing of how and why they are inappropriate for a particular disease or drug.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Cooper has never petitioned for such a waiver. Presumably, Cooper is inviting us to consider its evidentiary submission to the Administration as a <em>de facto </em>waiver petition and to construe the final order under review as a formal rejection of the petition. With some reluctance, we accept the invitation in this case, for the FDA has established no particular procedures for filing waiver petitions. We note, however, that orderly review would be facilitated by promulgation of, and adherence to, such procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Cooper\u2019s submission does not, as the waiver regulation requires, \u201cset forth clearly and concisely the specific provision or provisions\u201d in the regulations which are assertedly inapplicable to Protamide research, nor does the submission specify or defend \u201calternative procedures\u201d which should be used to test the drug\u2019s efficacy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Rather, Cooper contends broadly that efficacy should be assessed through the experience and testimonials of doctors who have treated herpes zoster, rather than through \u201ccontrolled\u201d investigation. This constitutes a request to waive not merely the Administration\u2019s regulations but also the fundamental requirement of the 1962 legislation. Granting such a waiver is beyond the power of either the FDA or the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">The 1962 amendments clearly demand that efficacy be shown by controlled tests \u2014 that is, by studies where some diseased persons receive the drug in question while other diseased persons, otherwise comparable, receive nothing, or a \u201cplacebo,\u201d or some substance of known effect.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b832-11\">The \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d requirement reflects the conclusion of Congress, based upon hearings, that clinical impressions of practicing physicians and poorly controlled experiments do not constitute an adequate basis for establishing efficacy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>Properly implementing the legislative intent, FDA regulations state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aim-dedup-1\">Uncontrolled studies or partially controlled studies are not acceptable as the sole basis for the approval of claims of effectiveness. * * * Isolated case reports, random experience, and reports lacking the details which permit scientific evaluation will not be considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Cooper argues that controlled tests are impossible because of the nature of herpes zoster and of the symptom \u2014 pain\u2014which Protamide aims to alleviate and which only experienced doctors can appraise. We do not perceive the logic of this argument. That accurate diagnosis of a disease requires the talents of experienced doctors does not preclude the use of controlled tests, but only entails that these tests should be conducted or supervised by experienced doctors. The 1962 legislation itself provides that the necessary controlled studies shall be made \u201cby experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d). That pain is difficult, or even impossible, to measure quantitatively does not entail the infeasibility of controlled tests; rather this consideration would seem to call for unusually careful procedures of control and observation so as to cross-check or normalize the observations of those administering the drug.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The regulations nowhere require that a drug\u2019s efficacy be either measurable on instruments or ascertainable without communication between the experimenter and the subject. There is nothing in the pertinent legislative history to suggest that Congress intended the FDA to adjudicate the virtues of controlled investigation \u2014 a central tenet of the scientific method, expressly incorporated in the legislation \u2014 every time the effectiveness of a pain-relieving drug was put in question. That pain is involved does not constitute grounds for waiver of the FDA\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">Finally, we note that none of Cooper\u2019s affidavits or testimonial letters suggests the impossibility of investigating Pro-tamide\u2019s efficacy in a controlled manner. In fact, the only two doctors who addressed the question conceded that a controlled study could be undertaken.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Even Cooper\u2019s counsel admits the feasibility of such a study \u2014 claiming that Cooper itself has one \u201cunderway.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">B. <em>The Medical Studies as Controlled Investigations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b833-16\">There remains the question whether Cooper\u2019s evidentiary submission does in fact comply with the FDA\u2019s regulations. By the teaching of <em>Hynson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>we must affirm the Administration\u2019s summary finding of non-compliance if we determine that the final order\u2019s characterization of each piece of evidence accurately identifies defects which \u201cconclusively render the study inadequate or uncontrolled in light of the pertinent regulations.\u201d <em>Hynson, supra, </em>412 U.S. at 622, 93 S.Ct. at 2479. In addition, <em>Hynson </em>states in a footnote that such a determination \u201cmight not be proper\u201d when the regulations invoked are not \u201cprecise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621 n. 17, 93 S.Ct. 2469.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">Cooper argues that very few of the regulations are in fact \u201cprecise\u201d and thus that hearing denials are rarely proper. This is not the thrust of <em>Hyn-son. </em>The Court there broadly approved the FDA\u2019s summary procedures and expressly liberated them from the technical limitations which the Seventh Amendment makes necessary with respect to summary judgment procedures in civil litigation.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Court found that the controls regulations correctly reflect Congress\u2019 intent, competently express the canons of scientific investigation, and adequately notify drug manufacturers \u201cof the evidence they must present to sustain their NDA\u2019s.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> With a few exceptions, <em>Hynson </em>did not indicate which regulatory provisions are \u201cprecise\u201d and which are not.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> An exhaustive classification along these lines is surely impractical. Like most, these regulations enjoy varying degrees of precision, and even to rank them according to their relative precision would be difficult in the abstract. The Court did not say that FDA reliance on a less than \u201cprecise\u201d regulatory provision is necessarily improper, but only that it \u201cmight\u201d be so.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This choice of language, we think, recognizes that the precision of a regulation will vary with the context in which it is invoked. Even a relatively precise regulation may create a small zone of ambiguity, and a particular piece of evidence submitted by an applicant may fall into that zone. By the same token, a regulatory provision which seems vague in the abstract may nonetheless be conclusively at odds with a peculiarly deficient item of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">No simple verbal formula can much lighten the tasks of judicial review in cases such as this. The court must see that the FDA does not shut itself off from relevant facts; at the same time, as <em>Hynson </em>teaches, the court must vindicate the general public\u2019s right to an efficient administration of the congressional mandate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-9\">The NAS-NRC panels evaluated approximately 16,500 claims made on behalf of the 4,000 drugs marketed pursuant to effective NDA\u2019s in 1962. Seventy percent of these claims were found not to be supported by substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>tial evidence of effectiveness, and only 434 drugs were found effective for all their claimed uses. If FDA were required automatically to hold a hearing for each product whose efficacy was questioned by the NAS-NRC study, even though many hearings would be an exercise in futility, w\u00e9 have no doubt that it could not fulfill its statutory mandate to remove from the market all those drugs which do not meet the effectiveness requirements of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><em>Hynson, supra, </em>412 U.S. at 621, 93 S.Ct. at 2479.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-5\">* * * This is an age of ever-expanding dockets at the administrative as well as at the judicial level. If the administrative controls over drugs are to be efficient, they must be exercised with dispatch. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 626, 93 S.Ct. at 2481.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">After a searching examination of Cooper\u2019s evidentiary submission, of the FDA\u2019s characterizations of it, and of the regulatory provisions invoked in those characterizations, we are convinced that the Administration has located for each item of evidence at least one deficiency (and usually many such) which conclusively disqualifies the item \u201cin light of the pertinent regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 622, 93 S.Ct. at 2479. As noted below,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the Administration could well, and should, have drafted a more detailed and informative order. But the document\u2019s purport is everywhere plain. The case with which it deals is not, we think, a close one.</p>\n<p id=\"Ai7F\">As Cooper does not claim that its affidavits and testimonial letters constitute \u201cadequate and well-controlled investigations,\u201d our inquiry focuses on the nine medical studies. These fall into three groups: the unfavorable, the uncontrolled, and the poorly controlled.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">1. <em>The unfavorable study: </em>The only submitted research done on Protamide treatment of herpes zoster since the 1962 legislation is the Australian study by Boundy and Bamford, published in 1968.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> This finds Protamide to be completely ineffective. The study is by far the most elaborate and sophisticated of those submitted by Cooper, and the FDA designated it \u201cwell-controlled.\u201d <footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Cooper attacks this finding, but we need not explore the dispute to a conclusion. We must of course hold the Administration to whatever regulatory interpretations are stated in or implied by its favorable verdict on the Boundy study. But the correctness of that verdict is not a prerequisite to summary rejection of Cooper\u2019s application. <em>Hynson </em>authorizes summary disposition where the NDA applicant fails to produce adequate and well-controlled studies showing efficacy. There is no burden on the FDA to produce adequate and well-controlled studies showing inefficacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">2. <em>The uncontrolled studies: </em>The FDA characterized six of the remaining eight studies as being entirely uncontrolled.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Cooper nowhere attempts to meet this fundamental allegation. An examination of the six studies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>has persuaded us that the allegation is correct in each instance.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> By the regulations, a study must have some kind of controls if it is to constitute more than merely corroborative support for a claim of effectiveness. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.-12(a) (5) (ii) (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">3. <em>The poorly controlled studies : </em>The two remaining studies employed what a layman might consider \u201ccontrols.\u201d The issue is whether the studies were \u201cwell-controlled\u201d as that term is defined by pertinent FDA regulatory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\"><em>The Combs study (1952) </em><footnotemark>30</footnotemark>: Here 50 patients with herpes zoster were treated with Protamide while six received a \u201cplacebo\u201d of saline solution. In the margin we quote the FDA\u2019s critique of the study, adding bracketed citations to those regulatory provisions plainly invoked by the critique.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We find no fault with the critique\u2019s accuracy, and several of the cited deficiencies are sufficient to support the FDA\u2019s summary rejection of the study.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">The FDA charges that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-15\">there was no method of selecting patients utilized to insure that subjects were suitable for purposes of the study [21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.12(a) (5) (ii) <em>(a)(2)(i)], </em>subjects were not assigned in such a way as to minimize bias [21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.12(a) (5) (ii) <em>(a) (2) (ii)], </em>and comparability of pertinent variables in test and control groups was not assured [21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.12 (a)(5)(ii)(c0(*)(m)].<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>The regulations invoked by this criticism use terms the precision of which may fairly be debated in the abstract: insure, suitable, minimize, bias, comparability, etc. But we are not deciding in the abstract. These criticisms have conclusive force in the context of the Combs study. This study treats of its control group in one sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-4\">Six \u201ccontrol\u201d patients were given physiologic saline injections without any benefit.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Thus the study unveils <em>no </em>method of selecting these patients, shows <em>no </em>attempt to control for any pertinent variables between the test and control groups, and describes <em>no </em>procedure for minimizing bias in the assignment of patients between the test and control groups.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">The FDA further charges, and accurately, that within the Protamide test group</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-7\">there was no correlation between the number of injections and days of treatment.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">The regulations quite understandably require drugs dosages to be \u201cstandardized\u201d so as \u201cto give significance to the results of the investigation.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.12(a)(5)(ii)(6). While the quoted criticism does not refer in terms to this regulatory provision, the logical connection is self-evident. Furthermore, both the variations in dosage and the cryptic description of the control group provide firm support for the FDA\u2019s observation that the study contained no</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A88\">comparison of the results of treatment of diagnosis with a control in such a fashion as to permit a quantitative evaluation [21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.12(a)(5) (ii) (a) (-4)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">and utilized no \u201cstatistical methods\u201d [21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.12(a)(5)(ii)(a)(5)].<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> As noted, these observations make plain reference to the language of particular regulatory provisions. Given that a single regulatory deficiency would be sufficient to disqualify the study, the FDA\u2019s summary rejection is abundantly justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-15\"><em>The Baker study </em><footnotemark>36</footnotemark>: Here 34 patients with herpes zoster were treated with Protamide and 10 with injections of Vitamin Bi2. (There were no cases of ophthalmic herpes zoster, the only ailment for which the drug was judged \u201cpossibly effective\u201d by the NAS-NRC investigation.) The FDA\u2019s characterization of the study <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> expresses or plainly implies several criticisms. By the placing of quotation marks, the order implies disapproval of Vitamin B12 as a control substance; the Administration charges that the study report provides \u201cno raw data * * '' upon which a comparison of the test and control groups can be made\u201d; and the order asserts that the \u201csize of'the control group\u201d is \u201cstatistically inadequate.\u201d <footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">To the last criticism, we cannot accord dispositive weight. While questions of statistical adequacy do seem peculiarly appropriate for summary disposition, the regulations as presently drafted provide no guidelines as to minimal sample size. As for the other two criticisms, each is presented in an overly cursory fashion. Nonetheless, however artlessly, the order does succeed here in identifying deficiencies which conclusively disqualify the Baker study \u201cin light of the pertinent regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b837-17\">The FDA should have expressed its disapproval of Vitamin Bi2 in a straight<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>forward manner, rather than relying on the disparaging implication of the quotation marks placed around the word \u201ccontrol.\u201d But the implication, urged by the Administration\u2019s counsel, does seem a fair one to us, and we perceive no merit in remanding this drawn-out controversy so that the Administration may convert a plain implication into a formal sentence. That Vitamin Bi2 fails to comply with the regulations is clear. Baker used the substance on the theory that it might have an effect on herpes zoster, a theory supported by the vitamin\u2019s usefulness in treating related ailments.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The pertinent regulations provide that a control substance be either \u201can inactive preparation designed to resemble the test drug as far as possible,\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.12(a) (5) (ii) (a) <em>U)(ii), </em>or \u201c[a]n effective regiment [sic] of therapy,\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.12(a) (5) (ii) (a) U)(m). We see nothing ambiguous or esoteric in these provisions. They incorporate the elementary scientific principle that a test of two possibly effective agents constitutes two uncontrolled tests, not a single test with two controls. From his experiment on ten subjects, Baker concluded that Vitamin Bi2 is ineffective against herpes zoster. But this limited experience hardly renders the substance a known \u201cinactive preparation,\u201d and there is no evidence presented that the vitamin is an \u201ceffective regimen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">In charging that the Baker study provides \u201cno raw data * * * upon which a comparison of the test and control groups can be made,\u201d the FDA is not closely paraphrasing any one provision of the regulations. Accordingly, to facilitate judicial review the order should have expressly drawn the connection between the criticism and the pertinent provisions. But, again, a remand for this purpose would exalt form over substance in the context of this case. For the quoted criticism quite obviously invokes the set of regulatory provisions dealing with the make-up and comparability of test and control groups.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> These provisions do not require that the report of a medical study contain all of the study\u2019s \u201craw data,\u201d but neither does the FDA\u2019s criticism suggest such a <em>per se </em>requirement. If the report describes the systematic attention given to proper selection and assignment of test and control groups, and to proper treatment of pertinent variables, the listing of raw data would serve merely to corroborate the accuracy of the report\u2019s description; the regulations do not seem to require the report to contain such corroboration. But if such a description of procedures and precautions is lacking or deficient in the report, logic suggests that only the raw data of the study could show the study\u2019s compliance with regulatory standards. If, under these circumstances, the raw data is omitted, the report fails to meet the regulatory requirements.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>The relevant portion of the Baker report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-4\">Thirty adults, 45 to 82 years old, and four children, 7 to 12 years old, were treated with Protamide for herpes zoster.

As for suitability of the subjects used, the report does not reveal how or whether diagnosis of the disease or of its stage of progress was cross-checked or otherwise normalized.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The report fails entirely to reveal procedures, if such there were, for \u201cassign-ting] the subjects to test groups in such a way as to minimize bias.\u201d <footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Finally, even for purposes of summary disposition we do not think the Administration must accept as \u201cassur[ance] [of] comparability in test and control groups of pertinent variables\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> the Baker report\u2019s comment that control patients were \u201cin the same age group\u201d as some of the test patients. The \u201cage group\u201d in question stretches from 45 to 82 years, and no variables other than age are mentioned.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-18\">Given that a single regulatory deficiency would suffice to disqualify this study, we have no trouble affirming the Administration\u2019s rejection of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-19\">We conclude that Cooper \u201chas not tendered <em>any </em>evidence which <em>on its face </em>meets the statutory standards as particularized by the regulations.\u201d <em>Hynson, supra, </em>412 U.S. at 620, 93 S.Ct. at 2478. (Emphasis in original.) A hearing in this case \u201cwould be an exercise in futility,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 621, 93 S.Ct. at 2479, for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-20\">[n]o amount of examination and cross-examination can change the scientific studies and the data reported into something they are not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-21\">Upjohn Co. v. Finch, 6 Cir., 422 F.2d 944, 955 (1970). Cooper has never indicated, either to us or to the FDA, exactly what a hearing would accomplish in this case. It is always conceivable, of course, that there exists information about the submitted studies which Cooper failed to include in its submission. But, for two reasons, this speculative possibility does not entitle Cooper to a hearing. First, the FDA\u2019s regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>clearly provide that \u201cthe report of the results\u201d of a study must itself demonstrate the study\u2019s compliance with the regulations. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.12(a)(5) (ii)(a). If evidence <em>dehors </em>the report is crucial to showing the study\u2019s compliance with regulations, the applicant should at the very least advert to the evidence when submitting its application. Second, Cooper has never, at any stage in these proceedings, suggested what, if any, outside information exists on these studies. The reports submitted were merely clipped from old medical journals; they dealt with studies completed between 13 and 26 years ago. Scientists customarily publish their experiments in such a form that colleagues can ascertain from the published report itself whether minimally acceptable methods of control, observation, and analysis were employed. Absent specific contrary indications, the FDA is justified in assuming conformance with this custom.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">We do not suggest that the Combs and Baker studies \u2014 or, indeed, the other studies, letters, and affidavits submitted by Cooper \u2014 are entirely without probative value in demonstrating Protamide\u2019s efficacy. Some or all of these items \u201cmay provide corroborative support\u201d for the efficacy claim, 21 C.F. R. \u00a7 130.12(a) (5) (ii) (c). The instant order merely declares, and properly so, that these studies do not, separately or collectively, constitute the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d required by statute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(e)(3). That an item is not substantial evidence does not preclude its reintroduction in future NDA applications. If, in a new application, Cooper supplements the materials submitted here with a new study which does not conclusively fail the regulatory standards, the <em>entire package </em>will require consideration in a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">While the FDA\u2019s order removed Pro-tamide from the commercial market, the drug is apparently eligible for an inves-tigational exemption.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> If Cooper is genuinely serious about testing this drug in a proper fashion, that route to progress remains fully open. But we do not perceive how the new research, or proper administrative assessment of it, would be advanced by holding a hearing at this point on old and clearly inadequate medical studies.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">IV. A <em>Caveat</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">While we sustain the FDA\u2019s action in this case, we are not pleased with the draftsmanship displayed in the instant order. Given the facts here, and given that the order does show full understanding of the applicable regulations and a conscientious examination of the submitted studies, we have been willing to take the plain meaning of the Admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>istration\u2019s language. Where the order implied a proposition, we allowed the implication and proceeded to assess it. Where the order clearly invoked the substance of a regulatory provision, we did not demand chapter and verse citations. In future, however, we shall apply a stricter rule of construction to Administration orders associated with summary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">We shall expect the FDA to make its criticisms express and detailed, and to cite precisely to the pertinent regulations and evidentiary flaws. The regulations are extensive and technical; submitted evidence is typically abstruse and voluminous. Courts cannot efficiently shoulder their heavy burden of review under <em>Hynson </em>unless the Administration\u2019s orders make utterly transparent why each piece of submitted evidence fails the particular regulatory provisions relied upon. If a regulatory provision or a piece of evidence is fairly open to several interpretations, the Administration must explain and defend its chosen interpretation. On occasion, interpretational differences between the FDA and the applicant will, under the <em>Hynson </em>standard, be insoluble without a hearing or some other orderly procedure for exchanging views. The FDA cannot, however, escape such procedures by issuing a cursory order which obscures the differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b827-25\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(a) (1970).

Final Order, <em>supra </em>note 5, 37 Fed.Reg. at 17228. While this interchange of views is not in the record, and is consequently not a proper factor in our decision, we recount here Cooper\u2019s version of the interchange, which the FDA has not chosen to either accept or rebut. Brief for petitioner at 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The FDA had announced in July of 1970 that any company whose drug was found \u201cpossibly effective\u201d for a particular ailment by the NAS-NRC study, as was Protamide for ophthalmic herpes zoster, would have six months from the date of the finding to supply new evidence justifying a summary change in the designation to \u201ceffective.\u201d 35 Fed.Reg. 11273 (July 14, 1970). This announcement preceded by three days the FDA\u2019s formal publication of notice to Cooper that withdrawal proceedings would be initiated for Protamide. In addition to answering this withdrawal notice by requesting a hearing and by submitting the evidence of efficacy here under review, Cooper also \u201cbegan a series of meetings with FDA scientists in order to determine what sort of study should be done\u201d during the six-month grace period pertinent to the efficacy claim relating to ophthalmic herpes zoster. Brief for petitioner at 12. Cooper contends that the parties finally agreed on a protocol for new research, \u201cbut so much time had been spent in this enterprise that it became apparent that the study could not be completed within the six-month time period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Cooper does not state when the agreement on a protocol was reached or supply any details of the agreement. In Feb. 1971 \u2014 near the close of Cooper\u2019s six-month grace period \u2014the FDA established procedures whereby grace period extensions could be requested by an applicant planning or engaged in new research. 36 Fed.Reg. 3127 (Feb. 18, 1971). Six months too late, on August 16, 1971, tiooper invoked the new procedures to request an extension. Brief for petitioner at 12. By this time, of course, Cooper had already enjoyed a 12-month grace period. Allegedly, the FDA did not formally reply to Cooper\u2019s request for further extension. <em>Id. </em>at 13. Instead, a further 12-month extension was granted <em>de facto, </em>for the order withdrawing Protamide from the market was not issued until Aug. 1972. <em>See </em>note 5 <em>supra. </em>In this order, the FDA of course dealt only with the evidence which Cooper had, by then, submitted for consideration. Cooper claims that, even now, \u201cclinical studies are underway to demonstrate the efficacy of Protamide for ophthalmic herpes zoster, studies being performed in accord with FDA regulations and procedures[.]\u201d Brief for petitioner at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">If Cooper\u2019s account is accurate, the FDA deserves rebuke for failing to reply formally to Cooper\u2019s Aug. 16, 1971 request for an extension of the grace period. But a 12-month extension was granted <em>de facto, </em>and we find nothing in the FDA regulations requiring even this. Certainly the Administration was justified in acting on the information before it <em>two full years </em>after affording formal notice of withdrawal proceedings. The 1962 legislation contemplated that withdrawals would commence two years after the Act\u2019s effective date.

Analogizing those procedures to summary judgment in judicial proceedings, the court stated that \u201cit was incumbent upon the Commissioner, before calling upon the petitioner for additional evidence establishing a right to a hearing, <em>to state facts and reasons </em>showing at least pri-ma facie that the evidence before him raised no material issue of fact which would justify a hearing.\u201d 151 U.S.App.D.C. at 290, 466 F.2d at 461.

Hynson, Westcott &amp; Dunning, Inc., 412 U.S. 609, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973). Because I believe the majority has applied <em>Hynson </em>improperly and has misperceived the nature of the relationship between this court and the FDA, I respectfully dissent. I take this course reluctantly, being wary that the claim advanced by petitioners may reflect a legal tactic more than a genuine controversy posed by a member of a regulated industry. However, I think the larger view of the public interest requires a ruling on the inadequacy of the FDA\u2019s approach. If petitioners have gained a litigating advantage, it will be only temporary, for if the FDA does its task correctly, it can proceed expeditiously and effectively in the public interest without undue sacrifice of interests of regulated companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">I. GENERAL DISCUSSION OF ROLE OF COURTS ON FDA WITHDRAWAL OR APPROVAL OF NDA\u2019s</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">In the Drug Amendments of 1962, 76 Stat. 780, amending 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq., Congress required the FDA to withdraw its approval of all ineffective prescription drugs. Because it required re-evaluation of the large number of approved drugs already in the market, the statute placed a heavy burden on the FDA. To discharge this burden, the agency has evolved certain innovative procedures, principal among which is the summary judgment technique validated in <em>Hynson. </em>That ruling is not to be applied grudgingly, for it is both sound in concept and necessary in practical administration. Yet <em>Hynson </em>imposes a limitation on FDA use of summary procedures : the agency must act on the basis of particularized regulations, and it cannot deny a hearing for failure to comply with qualitative regulatory standards that so lack clear-cut definition that it cannot be ascertained from the face of a study whether the standard has been met. <em>See </em>412 U.S. at 620, 621 n. 17, 93 S.Ct. at 2479 n. 17. The significance of this limitation is apparent from the statutory and administrative context of the summary judgment procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">A. <em>Statutory Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">The Food and Drug Act requires \u201cdue notice and opportunity for hearing to the applicant\u201d before FDA can withdraw approval of an existing New Drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, no evidentiary hearing need be held unless the manufacturer can demonstrate it would have a purpose. A hearing may be denied to an applicant who, having been given notice of a proposed withdrawal of and NDA for an allegedly ineffective drug, fails to present, in the words of the FDA regulation, a \u201cwell-organized and full factual analysis of the clinical and other investigational data he is prepared to prove in support of his opposition\u201d\u2014 and his claim of effectiveness. <em>See Hynson, </em>412 U.S. at 620, 93 S.Ct. at 2478.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The Supreme Court has predicated latitude in summary dispositions upon the FDA\u2019s having first issued clear-cut regulations that particularize the statutory standards. Regulations defining the content of \u201cadequate and well-controlled studies\u201d are necessary for the \u201cdue notice\u201d to drug manufacturers of what the manufacturers must provide to demonstrate that there are matters requiring a hearing. Absent such \u201cdue notice\u201d to inform the manufacturers\u2019 submissions, the agency cannot provide for \u201cbarring at the threshold those who neither measure up [to the statutory standards] nor show reasons why in the public interest the rule should be waived.\u201d FPC v. Texaco, 377 U.S. 33, 39, 84 S.Ct. 1105, 12 L.Ed.2d 112 (1964), quoted in <em>Hynson, </em>412 U.S. at 620, 93 S.Ct. at 2478.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Even with particularized regulations, the FDA cannot deny a hearing for failure to comply with the regulations unless the study or analysis proffered is \u201ctotally deficient\u201d in compliance. <em>Hyn-son, </em>412 U.S. at 621 n. 17, 93 S.Ct. 2479 n. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">B. <em>Role of Reviewing Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aop\">The Supreme Court charges the courts of appeals to monitor the FDA\u2019s application of its regulations to deny a hearing. It seems plain, as the FDA brief puts it, that the Supreme Court did not intend us to undertake a <em>de novo </em>review of the evidence upon which the Commission acted to deny a hearing. Certainly there is need to take into account the FDA\u2019s expertise.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, it is often not possible to understand, much less apply, the drug law and regulations without the benefit of technical knowledge that is not part of this court\u2019s working kit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">When the court is asked to review the substantive determination of an agency, the test that defines its review \u2014 both its supervisory aspect, and its obligation of restraint \u2014 calls for affirmance if the agency\u2019s determination has a reasonable basis and has not been shown to be arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">While the court of appeals does not engage in technical dialogue with the agency, it does ensure that the agency has followed procedures conducive to a full airing of technical issues, and has \u201cgenuinely engaged in reasoned decision-making.\u201d <em>See </em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, 143 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 393-394, 444 F.2d 841, 851-852 (1970), cert. denied, 403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2229, 2233, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). The requirement of reasoned decision-making is usually articulated for decisions rendered after an evidentiary hearing, but it also has vitality for the decision rendered without a hearing. Indeed, that decision requires reasons not only for the disposition of the matters under consideration, but also for the conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>that the applicant\u2019s contrary position does not even present a genuine and substantial issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">In its reviewing capacity the court is not to be hostile to the agency, but is rather to proceed in the context of a \u201cpartnership\u201d between court and agency in furtherance of the public interest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This is the model of the relationship envisioned in <em>Hynson. </em>In these drug efficacy cases the agency is permitted to adjudicate substantial rights in summary fashion, provided the court has assured itself the necessary preconditions exist: First, that the agency\u2019s regulations \u2014 its \u201carticulated standards\u201d \u2014 are sufficiently clear-cut to provide the \u201cdue notice\u201d needed for a summary disposition. Second, that the agency\u2019s application of the regulations, and its determination that the study proffered as compliance is totally deficient, reflects \u201creasoned decision-making.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">II. PARTICULAR APPLICATION OF GENERAL PRINCIPLES: THE SUMMARY WITHDRAWAL OF APPROVAL OF THE NDA FOR PROTAMIDE</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Examining Cooper\u2019s submissions to the FDA and the FDA\u2019s disposition of them, I do not feel that the agency\u2019s summary disposition comports with <em>Hynson. In </em>affirming the FDA, the majority, in my view, has exceeded the bounds of a court\u2019s role. To highlight my differences, I shall focus on the Baker study discussed in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">The matter before us is a new drug application for Protamide, for use with herpes zoster. In his study, \u201cUse of Protamide in the Treatment of Herpes Zoster,\u201d published in the Pennsylvania Medical Journal (63 Penn.Med.J. 697 (May, I960)), Dr. Baker obtained dramatic evidence of Protamide\u2019s efficacy. Baker treated 44 patients suffering from herpes zoster, administering Pro-tamide to 34 of the patients (30 adults and 4 children) and vitamin B-12 to the remaining 10 (adults). Therapy began as soon after the onset of herpes zoster as possible \u2014 some patients having sought treatment with more advanced symptoms than others \u2014 and continued for five to sixteen days, varying with the severity of the infection, with follow-ups for six months. Baker found that 94% of the patients receiving Pro-tamide obtained \u201cgood to excellent\u201d results, including symptom relief and shortening of the course of the infection. None of these patients suffered post-herpetic pain. By contrast, none of the control group receiving vitamin B-12 responded well to the therapy, and seven of the ten suffered some post-her-petic neuralgia. From these results, Baker concluded that Protamide had \u201cmarked therapeutic benefit\u201d when administered prior to or at the time when lesions appeared in patients suffering from herpes zoster.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">1. In dismissing the Baker study as \u201cnot well-controlled,\u201d the FDA gives only two reasons for its finding: (1) \u201cthe size of the control group is statistically inadequate;\u201d and (2) \u201cthere is no raw data provided upon which a comparison of the test and control groups can be made.\u201d The first reason, as Judge Wright concludes, has no basis in current regulations, and therefore cannot trigger a summary disposition. This conclusion accords with the teaching of <em>Hynson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">2. As to the second reason, the FDA rejected the Baker study because it lacks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>raw data, even though existing regulations contain no requirement that a petitioner submit raw data as part of his study. Under <em>Hynson </em>this summary rejection is impermissible because it is not based upon a promulgated regulation. Petitioners point out that another study approved by the FDA as adequate and well-controlled (the Boundy study) was also lacking in \u201craw data.\u201d Judge Wright acknowledges this, but in effect drafts a \u201craw data\u201d requirement that contains an exception which would justify both FDA rulings. He asserts that a petitioner must either describe the selection process whereby test and control groups were formed, or must submit sufficient raw data to allow the agency to decide whether the test complies with its conception of an adequate and well-controlled investigation. The difficulty, however, is that FDA has not promulgated a particularized regulation containing the requirement developed by Judge Wright. And summary judgment is only proper, under <em>Hynson, </em>when the petitioner has failed to present material required by a regulation it was on notice to satisfy.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">3. To remand to the FDA for compliance with the <em>Hynson </em>guidelines is not to \u201cexalt form over substance,\u201d as Judge Wright says, but is to insist on fair process. A court does not skimp fair process because of its view of the merits. We would all agree that if the issue were one of due process in a criminal trial, we would not skimp fair procedure merely because the evidence clearly showed the defendant was guilty. The values involved in an administrative agency proceeding are different, of course, but the need for process that is fair is too important to water down.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">4. Judge Wright\u2019s misapprehension of the judicial role is highlighted by his ruling \u2014 notwithstanding a total lack of any FDA comment on Baker\u2019s use of vitamin B-12 as a control substance \u2014 that FDA\u2019s Order \u201cplainly implies disapproval\u201d of that usage. The sole basis for this ruling is the FDA\u2019s use of \u201cdisparaging\u201d quotation marks around the word \u201ccontrol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">This exercise reverses the roles of agencies and courts. It is the agency\u2019s job to decide whether a study is adequate or not and, if not, to state the reasons. When there is no hearing, and the agency\u2019s stated reasons are not satisfactory, a court cannot sustain an order by conjecturing about unstated inferences. Ultimately the court lacks the capacity to develop its own analysis concerning the adequacy of the study.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">Thus, notwithstanding Judge Wright\u2019s reconstruction, the FDA\u2019s placing of \u201ccontrol\u201d in quotation marks seems to me entirely consistent with the two reasons expressly given in the Order, statistical inadequacy (rejected by Judge Wright) and lack of raw data (discussed above).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">There are good reasons why a court should confine itself to a review of the reasons the agency itself gives for the actions it takes. Agencies are weakened, not strengthened, if they can bypass their responsibilities and look to a sympathetic reviewing court to shoulder them. There is also the danger that the court\u2019s inferences, and construction of regulations, will differ from the agency\u2019s. When this happens, even clear-cut regulations become fuzzy, and their utility as \u201cdue notice\u201d may be vitiated. Judge Wright\u2019s treatment of vitamin B-12 brings us to this potential problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">Judge Wright attributes to FDA a reason not stated in the Order, that B-12 was an inappropriate control, in view of the regulation stating, <em>inter alia, </em>that a control substance must be either \u201can inactive preparation\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or \u201c[a]n effective regiment [sic] of therapy.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Judge Wright concludes that vitamin B-12 fits neither description because Baker originally felt it might be somewhat helpful, a category different from those described in the regulation. Although Baker later decided that vitamin B-12 was in fact ineffective against herpes zoster, Judge Wright asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>\u201cthis limited experience hardly renders the substance a known inactive preparation. . . . \u201d But the regulations do not specify a requirement of prior knowledge of some specified experimental data on which to base the required designation of inactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The dangers of judicial interjection are not mere word play. Indeed, it is my own intuition \u2014 for neither Judge Wright nor I have the material for a reasoned inference \u2014 that the FDA carefully avoided resting its decision on the ground that B-12 was an inadequate control within the meaning of the regulations cited by Judge Wright. The FDA may have been of the view that B-12 was an inactive preparation in present context, for all practical purposes, or it may have concluded that for study purposes it was not necessary to resolve whether B-12 was (a) inactive, as Baker finally concluded, or (b) helpful, as he at first premised, because the utility of B-12 as an adequate control was sufficiently established by the high probability that it was not a harmful substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Alternatively, the FDA may have concluded that any technical problems associated with use of a B-12 control could not fairly be used as the basis of decision because it was unlikely to account for the dramatic benefit shown by the Baker study in favor of petitioner\u2019s product in comparison with B-12. The nature of the results may have a bearing on the adequacy of a study. The dramatic results obtained by Dr. James Lind with administration of citrus fruit to only two scurvy-ridden sailors, out of a group of twelve, established this classic medical study of the 1740\u2019s. FDA\u2019s silence may well betoken the view that use of a beneficial substance, though not strictly \u201cinactive,\u201d would not realistically undercut the validity of Baker\u2019s experiment.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">The natural question that occurs to me \u2014 and I must think about this without the benefit of any reasoning from the FDA \u2014 is why a study is plainly not \u201cadequate,\u201d is too insubstantial for serious consideration, merely because the \u201ccontrol\u201d used is a preparation that may be generally productive of well being, even though it is neither an inert placebo nor an \u201ceffective regimen of therapy.\u201d I don\u2019t think this is the time or place to debate the validity of the FDA\u2019s regulation as such, but I can see good reasons why the FDA would hesitate to lay it on the line in a case involving B-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">I see particular problems for the FDA, in any rigidity concerning the requirement for an inert control substance, when the drug being tested is designed to relieve pain, as is Protamide, in view of striking analgesic effect assigned by authoritative medical research to placebos. A much-cited work reviewing pertinent studies concludes that in one-third of a patient population, a placebo will relieve severe pain as well as either morphine or aspirin, an impressive statistic, especially alongside the fact that one-fourth of that same population will obtain no relief from either the drug or the placebo.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> To avoid misunderstanding, I am not suggesting that FDA must or should forgo attempts to ascertain the efficacy of purported analgesic drugs, or that the \u201cplacebo effect\u201d necessarily vitiates the validity of the FDA regulation here in question. The point is that the methodological complexity of the various medical research issues involved in drug testing should make the courts hesitant in venturing judicial reconstruction of reasoning which FDA omitted, or in supposing, without benefit of any expertise, that the underlying principles of drug testing are so well-settled, widely known and agreed upon that the FDA\u2019s conclusory statement of a deficiency reflects a pal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>pable shortfall that does not merit a hearing of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">5. In sum, I find no reason in the FDA\u2019s Final Order rejecting the Baker study which satisfies the guidelines announced in <em>Hynson. </em>As to the case at hand, the FDA is not powerless to act; what is required is that it act after opportunity to explore the adequacy of Baker\u2019s methodology. Even without a particularized regulation, the FDA can structure a hearing that requires petitioner to produce Baker\u2019s raw data, and to offer evidence on the issue whether his study is \u201cadequate and well-controlled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">III. OPPORTUNITY FOR RESPONSIVE RECONSIDERATION</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">As a court, we are charged to oversee FDA\u2019s use of a summary procedure so as to be responsive to the agency\u2019s need for expedition, yet avoid deprivation of substantial rights without hearing. While we must defer substantially to the agency\u2019s exercise of technical judgment, we must have assurance that the agency is following a procedure that guards against abusive use of its power, and assures full access and input.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">In my view, modest changes in current FDA procedures would allow us to defer to agency expertise while receiving the assurance we require. These changes would also recognize the difficulty of constructing regulations particularized enough to meet the <em>Hynson </em>standard, yet broad enough to be generally applicable. As matters now stand, the FDA notifies an NDA holder that his product has been found \u201cineffective or possibly ineffective.\u201d This notification is quite summary in nature, and is generally the product of a concise ultimate finding by the NAS-NRC review panel. Thereafter, the manufacturer must submit \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d consisting of \u201cadequate and well-controlled studies\u201d in order to overcome the presumption of ineffectiveness established by the FDA and NAS-NRC findings. The FDA then responds to these studies with its final declaration. Often this is a bare conclusion that the submitted studies are not adequate and well-controlled, that no material issue of fact has been raised, and that a hearing is denied and approval of the NDA is withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">A central difficulty is that FDA is engaged in fleshing out general regulations with concrete applications. This is fair enough. What may not be fair is a system of particularization without hearings, letting applicants know after the fact that they were in default all along for failure to observe a requirement that had not yet been spelled out. And when FDA is administering regulations that are in some measure \u201cimprecise,\u201d \u201csubjective,\u201d or lacking in \u201cclear-cut definition,\u201d there are elements that militate against disposition without a hearing. <em>Hynson, </em>412 U.S. at 421 n.17, 93 S.Ct. 2479 n. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">The first move toward untying the tangle could be taken if the FDA allowed the petitioners an opportunity for at least a written response to the determination that is now issued as the FDA\u2019s final order, but which, under a change in procedure to cope with the problem, would become a proposed disposition. At that time, NDA holders would, for the first time, have the FDA\u2019s declared approach for rejection of the study, and have a genuine opportunity to respond to that approach. Such a procedure would open up the process toward a reasoned decision based on fair opportunity for input. Perhaps petitioners could supplement the studies, say, by provision of raw data, if that were identified as a need. Or perhaps they could point out flaws in the FDA\u2019s approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">It may be that such a response by the applicant would lead FDA to schedule a hearing. This is not an unthinkable calamity. We are not discussing a situation where the applicant is relying merely on subjective presentations that amount in essence to mere \u201canecdotal evidence indicating that doctors \u2018believe\u2019 in the efficacy of a drug\u201d \u2014 a submission that would confute the legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>approach that mere \u201cimpressions or beliefs of physicians, no matter how fervently held, are treacherous.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such subjective presentations have no serious claim to consideration as substantial evidence of a controlled study. But when we come to what purport on their face to be studies with a control element, conducted by persons who have at least a prima facie claim to expertise, then we have a matter that calls for resolution after hearing. The \u201chearing\u201d appropriate for such cases need not borrow the characteristics of conventional courtroom controversy, burdened with the impedimenta of the kind of arcane questions with which lawyers often bedevil expert witnesses. Marine Space Enclosures v. FMC, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 9, 420 F.2d 577 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">As <em>Marine Space Enclosures </em>points out, even when statutes contemplate an adjudicatory hearing baseline, a particular case may involve the kind of issue that calls for an oral argument rather than an evidentiary hearing<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or for a legislative rather than an adjudicative hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These comments are highly pertinent when what is at issue are technical questions of methodology. Indeed, in such a case the reality of technical dialogue and interchange of view can perhaps best be provided by an on the record conference-hearing procedure, modeled on conference discussions between lawyers and experts.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The law does not require a bog-down at the agency level, it seeks only an opportunity for reasonable give and take. If the hearing officer is worth his salt, he can keep counsel and experts to the business at hand in a straight-forward way.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">If the applicant\u2019s response to the proposed disposition, in the procedure outlined above, is thought by the FDA to be so palpably shallow as to permit the agency to take final action without any further proceeding, the agency would at least have the benefit of a more focused record which, hopefully, would foster reasoned findings in place of bare con-clusory statements. And there would be generated the kind of record that makes minimum judical review, without a <em>de novo </em>inquiry, a meaningful assurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">In my view, there should be a remand to require that petitioners be given such an opportunity to make a presentation at the administrative level.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-6\">.
