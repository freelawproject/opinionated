We reverse and remand for such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-24\">Appellant had been convicted by a jury in a Tennessee state court on two charges of unlawful sale of legend drugs (barbituates) and one charge of unlawful possession of such drugs without a prescription, in violation of Tenn.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 52-1204 and 52-1206 (1966). On each count he received a sentence of five years imprisonment, with the three sentences to be served consecutively. His convictions were reversed by the Court of Criminal Appeals of Tennessee, the conviction for unlawful possession was dismissed, and two convictions of unlawful sale were remanded for a new trial. The Tennessee Supreme Court, however, reversed the Court of Criminal Appeals and reinstated the convictions. State v. Manning, Tenn., 490 S.W.2d 512 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-25\">The facts disclosed by the record of the state court trial include the follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>ing. Appellant was stopped by police while driving about 20 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone about 4 a. m. in Morristown, Tennessee. The officer who arrested him called another squad car to the scene and then stopped appellant by flashing a spotlight on his car. The officer admitted that appellant was not violating any traffic law and that he had no reason to believe he had committed any crime. The officer testified at the state court trial that he stopped appellant because the chief of police had issued an order \u201cto check out all cars late at night.\u201d He testified that he thought this car was suspicious because it was out late and driving slowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Upon stopping appellant\u2019s car, the first police officer on the scene testified that he recognized the driver as appellant whom he knew as a bootlegger. The officer testified that he then asked if they could search his car and that appellant said that they could and opened the trunk. Appellant testified that the officer told him to open his trunk and that he did. Two officers then searched the trunk and the car. They seized some books described as \u201csex books\u201d and some women\u2019s bikini pants from the trunk, and some pills and a pengun from the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Appellant contends that the search of the automobile was illegal and that the evidence seized should not have been admitted at the trial. The government asserts that appellant consented to the search. The first basis for appellant\u2019s objection is that the stopping of appellant was unlawful because it was not based on probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Of course, \u201ca police officer may in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriate manner approach a person for purposes of investigating possibly criminal behavior even though there is no probable cause to make an arrest.\u201d Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 22, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). However, the circumstances in the case before us are different from those in <em>Terry.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This record offers no other explanation for the stop than the testimony of one of the officers that \u201cwe like to check them out to see who they are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">The difference between an investigatory stop and an arrest has yet to be spelled out. <em>See generally </em>Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), and Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972). The Supreme Court of the United States has said this about the question as to when an arrest occurs :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-14\">\u201cWhen the officers interrupted the two men and restricted their liberty of movement, the arrest, for purposes of this case, was complete. It is, therefore, necessary to determine whether at or before that time they had reasonable cause to believe that a crime had been committed. The fact that afterwards contraband was discovered is not enough. An arrest is not justified by what the subsequent search discloses, as Johnson v. United States [333 U.S. 10, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436], supra, holds.\u201d Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 103, 80 S.Ct. 168, 171, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 (1959).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-15\">This court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-16\">\u201cIt appears to this court that the arrest was actually made by Officer Miller when he detained Baxter for the several minutes before Reimer\u2019s arrival. The government concedes that this was an arrest. Further, this was clearly a deprivation of liberty under the authority of law. It does not take formal words of arrest or booking at a police station to complete an arrest. Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 80 S.Ct. 168, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 (1959); Long v. Ansell, 63 U.S.App.D.C. 68, 69 F.2d 386 (1934), aff\u2019d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>293 U.S. 76, 55 S.Ct. 21, 79 L.Ed. 208 (1934); Coleman v.

Baxter, 361 F.2d 116, 118-119 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 834, 87 S.Ct. 79, 17 L.Ed.2d 69 (1966).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\"><em>See also </em>Young v. United States, 140 U.S.App.D.C. 333, 435 F.2d 405 (1970); Bailey v. United States, 128 U.S.App.D.C. 354, 389 F.2d 305 (1967); Brown v. United States, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 43, 365 F.2d 976 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Our view on this score is strengthened by the recent opinion of the United States Supreme Court in Almeida-San-chez v. United States, 413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973). In holding a stop and search of a car within 25 miles of the Mexican border to be invalid without a search warrant, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">\u201cNo claim is made, nor could one be, that the search of the petitioner\u2019s car was constitutional under any previous decision of this Court involving the search of an automobile. It is settled, of course, that a stop and search of a moving automobile can be made without a warrant. That narrow exception to the warrant requirement was first established in Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 45 S.Ct. 280, 69 L.Ed. 543. The Court in <em>Carroll </em>approved a portion of the Volstead Act providing for warrantless searches of automobiles when there was probable cause to believe they contained illegal alcoholic beverages. The Court recognized that a moving automobile on the open road presents a situation \u2018where it is not practicable to secure a warrant because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought.\u2019 267 U.S., at 153, 45 S.Ct. at 285. <em>Carroll </em>has been followed in a line of subsequent cases,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but the <em>Carroll </em>doctrine does not declare a field day for the police in searching autonlobiles. Automobile or no automobile, there must be probable cause for the search.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">We recognize that <em>Almeida-Sanchez </em>is not precisely in point since in that case there was neither probable cause for the arrest nor even (as here) arguable consent to the search. <em>(Cf. </em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973), where both probable cause for the stop (arrest) and voluntary consent to the search were found.)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">We believe, however, in view of the deterrent purposes of the exclusionary rule <em>(see </em>United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974), any illegal arrest must require suppression of the evidence subsequently seized as a result under the rationale of Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). <em>See also </em>Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">Also applicable to our instant case is a recent case from the Ninth Circuit. In United States v. Mallides, 473 F.2d 859 (9th Cir. 1973), there was testimony that after a stop held by the court to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>completely without probable cause, Mal-lides gave permission to examine the trunk which resulted in damaging evidence which was admitted at trial. The Court of Appeals reversed for dismissal of the indictment, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-4\">\u201cNeither the Supreme Court nor this court has ever upheld the legality of a detention based upon an officer\u2019s unsupported intuition, and we refuse to do so now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">\u201cThe stop and detention were illegal, and the fruit of the illegal conduct was inadmissible.\u201d United States v. Mallides, 473 F.2d 859, 862 (9th Cir. 1973). (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The critical question in our instant case appears to be when the arrest occurred. More precisely, was the appellant free to leave (at any time prior to the search) after the police officer flashed his spotlight on appellant\u2019s car? The only trial record is that in the state court which did not focus on this question at all. Since the question is essentially an unresolved question of fact, we believe an evidentiary hearing and findings of fact are required.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">If the first question is answered favorably to the prosecution, the second question to be answered after evidentiary hearing is: Based on the totality of the circumstances, was the consent to search appellant\u2019s car freely and voluntarily given under the standards set for this in Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 228-229, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973) ? Appellant had been stopped late at night; there were three armed officers on the scene; appellant had only a third-grade education and had been in a state hospital for the insane on six occasions; and appellant was never advised that he had the right to refuse to consent to the search. On cross-examination, however, he said that he knew he did not have to agree to the search, although the record does not make clear whether he knew this at trial or the time of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Testimonial exploration of these facts will be required to answer the \u201cconsent\u201d questions stated or implied above.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The search and seizure issues in this case, of course, pertain only to appellant\u2019s conviction on the count alleging possession of legend drugs. He also attacks his convictions on all counts, including. two counts of sale of legend drugs, claiming due process violations in his state court trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">In this regard appellant asserts that the conduct of the prosecuting attorney during trial was both improper and so prejudicial as to violate his federal constitutional right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Three of the incidents relied on involve prosecutorial reference to appellant\u2019s alleged prior involvement in criminal acts concerning bootlegging and other incidents of possession of legend drugs not charged in the indictment, and not probative of either scheme or intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">Even more disturbing, there is evidence in this record that the prosecutor subsequently boasted in effect that he knew that his questions were objectionable, but that, even if they were stricken, the jury would not forget.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">Finally, it is asserted that the prosecuting attorney made a prejudicial statement before the jury when he realized that he would not be able to make a closing argument, because appellant\u2019s counsel had waived closing argument. The following exchange occurred between defendant\u2019s counsel and the prosecuting attorney :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-14\">MR. QUILLEN: May it please the Court, we would like to be informed just what the remark was \u2014 if the Attorney General did make one awhile ago in the presence of the Jury. Was there a comment made ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-15\">MR. WINSTEAD : Yes, I threw my notes back down on the table and I said that maybe I\u2019d get to use that argument next year. I hope not against this defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-16\">MR. QUILLEN: I think that was improper and I further renew my motion for mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-17\">MR. WINSTEAD: I think you\u2019ve thought just about everything was improper, Mr. Quillen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>With regard to the prosecuting attorney\u2019s conduct, we call attention to prose-cutorial duty as described by the Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">\u201c[The prosecutor] is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the two-fold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor \u2014 indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a. wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">\u201cIt is fair to say that the average jury, in a greater or less degree, has confidence that these obligations, which so plainly rest upon the prosecuting attorney, will be faithfully observed. Consequently, improper suggestions, insinuations and, especially, assertions of personal knowledge are apt to carry much weight against the accused when they should properly carry none.\u201d Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\"><em>Berger, </em>of course, was a federal case wherein the Supreme Court\u2019s superintending control afforded stricter supervision than is available to us in a federal habeas corpus proceeding attacking a state court conviction. But the facts we have referred to are disturbing enough to remand these issues also for an evidentiary hearing and findings of fact on appellant\u2019s claims of federal due process violation. In this regard the District Judge will, of course, have to determine the issue in accordance with the recent opinion of the Supreme Court in Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974), and decide whether \u201cthis incident made respondent\u2019s trial so fundamentally unfair as to deny him due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 645, 94 S.Ct. at 1872.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded for hearing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-7\">. This case is also clearly distinguishable from two recent cases, United States v. Robinson, 414 U.S. 218, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973), and Gustafson v. Florida, 414 U.S. 260, 94 S.Ct. 488, 38 L.Ed.2d 456 (1973). In both of those cases the officers involved clearly had probable cause for arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b465-9\">. <em>E. g., </em>Chambers v.

United States, 413 U.S. 266, 269, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 2538, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b467-11\">CELEBREZZE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A9n\">(concurring in part, dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">I agree with the majority that the police order to stop all cars out after midnight if, as the testimony indicated, \u201cwe think they\u2019re suspicious out late like that,\u201d was an arbitrary order and that the stopping of Appellant\u2019s car was illegal under the rationale of Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). However, I disagree that it is necessary to remand the case to the District Court for the purpose of taking evidence as to when, or whether, an arrest occurred prior to the search of Appellant\u2019s automobile. I would apply the \u201ctotality of circumstances test\u201d enunciated by the Supreme Court in Schenckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973), to determine whether Appellant voluntarily consented to the search of his automobile. United States v. Watson, 504 F.2d 849 (9th Cir. Mar. 20, 1974); United States v. Rothman, 492 F.2d 1260 (9th Cir., 1973). In Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963), the Supreme Court held inadmissible statements claimed to have been freely given following an unlawful entry by six or seven officers into the defendant\u2019s bedroom. The Court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-13\">\u201c[u]nder such circumstances it is unreasonable to infer that Toy\u2019s response was sufficiently an act of free will to purge the primary taint of the unlawful invasion.\u201d 371 U.S. at 486, 83 S.Ct. at 417.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-14\">This suggests that circumstances could exist under which a voluntary consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>could negate an unlawful entry. In balancing the circumstances involved in this case \u2014 armed officers physically larger than Appellant; the low degree of Appellant\u2019s education and his previous confinements in a state hospital for the insane; the absence of any advice that Appellant had the right to refuse consent to the search; and Appellant\u2019s testimony on the matter \u2014 I would find that Appellant had voluntarily consented to the search. At the hearing in the District Court, Appellant, on cross-examination, testified in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-4\">Q Mr. Manning, you\u2019re familiar enough with the law to know that you have the right not to let the man search your car without a search warrant ? Right ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-5\">A Well, if I want to, I can.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">Q You agreed to let him search the car? You knew you didn\u2019t have to let him search your car ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">The testimony does not reflect the use of any \u201cinherently coercive tactics \u2014 either from the nature of the police questioning or the environment in which it took place.\u201d Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. at 247, 93 S.Ct. at 2058. Appellant, although he testified on this matter, gave no intimation that he felt he was under duress or was being coerced to cooperate. His statement that he knew he could refuse consent diminishes the significance of his lack of education and his previous hospitalization. I would agree that \u201carrest is but one factor, albeit a critical one, in determining whether or not the consent was voluntary.\u201d United States v. Rothman, 492 F.2d 1260, 1264 n. 1 (9th Cir., 1973). However, Appellant\u2019s concession seems to me to be clear. Thus, I would arrive at the same conclusion whether the facts constitute an unlawful arrest or an unlawful Terry-type investigative stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">I also do not agree that a remand is necessary for any findings of fact relating to prosecutorial comments. The record demonstrates that the conduct of the prosecuting attorney during the trial was improper and prejudicial. On three occasions, reference was made to Appellant\u2019s prior involvement in criminal acts not charged in the indictment. On one occasion, the prosecuting attorney asked Appellant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-11\">\u201cWell, now you examine this one right here and this one here, aren\u2019t those both speckled birds? That\u2019s what they\u2019re known at in your trade, isn\u2019t it, Mr. Manning, speckled birds ? \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOL\">The Court sustained an objection to the phrase \u201cin your trade,\u201d but the jury was never instructed to disregard the statement. The second objection arose during the questioning of Appellant\u2019s mother by the prosecutor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-12\">Q Mrs. Shiflet, Dean Manning has been able to bootleg most of his life, hasn\u2019t he ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-13\">MR. QUILLEN: I\u2019m going to object to that, if the Court please. I move for a mistrial because of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"acq-dedup-0\">THE COURT: He may ask her what his occupation is. He can rephrase it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-14\">Two other incidents occurred when Appellant was recalled to the witness stand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-15\">Q You were there and you got 50 pills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-16\">A I did not pay for no pills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-17\">Q You didn\u2019t pay for them, you got them though. You went up there to get them on a forged prescription from Dr. Lynch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-18\">MR. QUILLEN: Your Honor, I object\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-19\">THE COURT: Sustained as to the forged. He may inquire of him if he got the pills at the drug store in Bulls Gap.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-20\">Q I\u2019ll ask you Mr. Manning, if on Saturday, May 16th, 1970, at 4:30 p. m., if you did not appear in Steinson\u2019s Drug Store in Bulls Gap, Hawkins County, Tennessee, and ask for 55 Oberdren capsules on a prescription from Dr. Lynch ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>A I went in there but I didn\u2019t ask for no 50 pills.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">Q You received a bag ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">A No, sir, I did not have it in my hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">Q You didn\u2019t have it in your hand? Dr. Stinson had it in his hand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-9\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-10\">Q And that\u2019s when you were arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-11\">MR. QUILLEN: I object, if the Court please and move that it be stricken from the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-13\">THE COURT: Sustained as to the arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">Again, the jury was not instructed to disregard the statement by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-15\">Coupled with this line of questioning was the prosecutor\u2019s closing statement, quoted by the majority. In addition to these statements by the prosecutor, Appellant contends that the Court improperly permitted testimony about items found in Appellant\u2019s car but not material to the case. These items were the \u201csex books\u201d and bikini pants found in Appellant\u2019s trunk and a pen gun found in the console of the car. The court overruled Appellant\u2019s objections and, regarding the books and the pants, stated: \u201cIt\u2019s for the jury to say whether they have a bearing on this particular ease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3h\">Regarding the cross-examination of Appellant, we have previously stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGW\">\u201cIt is clear that ordinarily on cross-examination a defendant may not be questioned as to whether he participated in unrelated specific acts of criminal conduct not resulting in a conviction, as such evidence has no relevancy to the issue of defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of the crime charged, and such evidence is likely to be extremely prejudicial.\u201d United States v. Rudolph, 403 F.2d 805, 806 (6th Cir. 1968)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-16\">While the Court sustained Appellant\u2019s objection, no instruction was given to the jury to disregard the questions. In <em>Rudolph, supra, </em>we reversed the conviction even though the jury had been given such an instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-17\">\u201c[w]e are of the opinion that the cautionary instruction did not remove the prejudice. It must be remembered that after the saber thrust, the withdrawal of the saber rUll leaves the wound.\u201d 403 F.2d at 807</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apt\">In the case before us, we have merely the court\u2019s sustaining of the objection. I would find that insufficient to cure the prejudice to Appellant. Similarly, the question asked Appellant\u2019s mother was also highly prejudicial. The reference to bootlegging had no bearing whatsoever on the charge against Appellant for possession of drugs. Upon Appellant\u2019s objection, the Court merely required that the question be rephrased. This repeated reference to criminal acts not the subject of the trial was highly improper and a failure to give any cautionary instruction increased the possibility of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-18\">In <em>Rudolph, supra, </em>even the cautionary instruction was not sufficient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-19\">\u201cThe Government contends that the error was cured by the court\u2019s instruction to the jury to disregard the question. While ordinarily the trial court has discretion to determine whether a cautionary instruction is sufficient to avoid granting a mistrial, we think that the question asked in this case was so clearly improper and prejudicial to the defendants that the harm could not be erased by any instruction which the court might give.\u201d 403 F.2d at 806.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-20\">With regard to the statement by the prosecuting attorney at the close of the case, I find it to be a flagrant disregard for the high duty owed in prosecuting a case. The conduct of the prosecutor certainly does not comport with that duty as described by the Supreme Court in Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). It is apparent to me that this conduct of the prosecutor was designed to improperly influence the jury. \u201cThat it was intended to prejudice the jury is suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>cient ground for a conclusion that in fact it did so.\u201d Pierce v. United States, 86 F.2d 949, 953 (6th Cir. 1936). I find my conclusion substantiated by an out-of-court statement made by the prosecutor and overheard by defense counsel and related to the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">I have a further thing, too, I\u2019d like to bring attention to before the Court before we go any further. A new motion for a mistrial for the reason, Dean Manning, from the indictment of this trial, has been denied a fair trial by the District Attorney General\u2019s comments and that General Winstead, with his experience, well knew the things that he was doing were wrong. I was having lunch, and he\u2019s here hearing what I have to say, he may correct me if I\u2019m wrong, I was having lunch within earshot of his table at which time he was talking with some people, including his witness, Nash, and some others and he commented on how he had asked a question about this defendant buying some pills either at Bulls Gap or Rog-ersville and said the defense could object all they wanted to then, the Jury had already heard it. I present this as highly improper and for that reason, the Attorney General knew it was unfair, denying this defendant a fair trial and I renew my motion for mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">THE COURT: Were any of the Jurors present when he made that statement ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">MR. QUILLEN: No jurors present that I knew of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">MR. WINSTEAD: I try my lawsuits in Court. I don\u2019t want any trouble.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">THE COURT: Gentlemen, I believe in freedom of speech, wherever people go.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">MR. QUILLEN: What I\u2019m getting at is, the Attorney General asked an improper question, knowing that it was improper, caring less how much we objected to it, he knew the damage had been done when the Jury heard the questions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-11\">THE COURT: Gentlemen, when you raised a proper objection, the Court sustained your objection. The record will disclose that at different times, there were no objections in certain of the testimony. And the Court will properly instruct the Jury when an objection is made to this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">Regarding similar conduct by a prosecutor, we have previously said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-13\">\u201cTo those with any breadth of experience in the trial of criminal cases it must be clear that suggestions, especially when often repeated, that a defendant has earlier been in trouble with the law, that he has elsewhere or previously been indicted, that he has been frequently detained and investigated by law enforcement officers, and that he is a fugitive from justice, are so prejudicial that no admonition from the court that they be disregarded, however promptly and forcibly made, may be safely relied upon to free the minds of jurors from the impression that the defendant is of bad character and capable of committing the crime charged. They may completely overthrow the presumption of innocence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-14\">* * * -\u00bb *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-15\">It is quite true that the court ruled correctly upon all objections interposed by the defendants, but in most instances the ruling came after the mischief had been done, and it was clearly a case where the misconduct of the prosecutors was neither slight nor confined to a single instance, but so pronounced and persistent that the cumulative effect upon the jury cannot be disregarded as inconsequential. Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, [85], 55 S.Ct. 629, 632, 79 L.Ed. 1314. As was said in that case: \u201cThe trial judge, it is true, sustained objections to some of the questions, insinuations and misstatements, and instructed the jury to disregard them. But the situ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ation was one which called for stern rebuke and repressive measures and, perhaps, if these were not successful, for the granting of a mistrial. It is impossible to say that the evil influence upon the jury of these acts of misconduct was removed by such mild judicial action as was taken.\u201d Pierce v. United States, 86 F.2d 949, 952-953 (6th Cir. 1936).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Since the jury was given no instructions to disregard the improper comments, there can be little doubt that they had a prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">I would also find that the testimony referring to the \u201csex books\u201d and bikini pants and the pen gun found in Appellant\u2019s car was not relevant to the case and was prejudicial to Appellant. Relevant evidence \u201cis evidence that in some degree advances the inquiry, and thus has probative value,\u201d C. McCormick, Law of Evidence 319 (1954). Its purpose is \u201cto prove or disprove some issue in the cause on trial. If proffered evidence does not tend to do either of these things, it has no place in the trial and is either immaterial or collateral to the inquiry.\u201d Herzog v. United States, 226 F.2d 561, 565 (9th Cir. 1955). The general rule is that the relevancy or materiality of evidence is a matter to be decided in the discretion of the trial judge. Wilson v. United States, 250 F.2d 312, 325 (9th Cir. 1958). However, as the \u201csex books,\u201d bikini pants and pen gun had no value in proving any issue before the court, and the chance was great that its admission would be prejudicial, I would find that the court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence. <em>See </em>United States v. Johnson, 254 F.2d 175, 176 (2d Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Thus, I would hold that the reference to prior criminal acts and the admission of prejudicial immaterial evidence \u201cso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d Donnelly v. DeChristo-foro, 416 U.S. 637, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 1871, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974). I would reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand the case with direction that the District Court grant the writ of habeas corpus to Appellant unless the State of Tennessee grants him a new trial within a reasonable time to be fixed by the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
