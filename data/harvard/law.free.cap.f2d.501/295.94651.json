Zirpoli, United States District Judge, Northern District of, California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\">OPINION</p>\n<author id=\"aq5-dedup-0\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Following a jury trial, Kenneth Wayne Harvill was convicted of a two count indictment charging him with possession of firearms in violation of 18 U. S.C. App. \u00a7 1202(a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The only error claimed on appeal is that the trial judge failed to comply with Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 30 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">At the close of the evidence or at such earlier time during the trial as the court reasonably directs, any party may file written requests that the court instruct the jury on the law as set forth in the requests. The court shall inform counsel of its proposed action upon the requests prior to their arguments to the jury, but the court shall instruct the jury after the arguments are completed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWj\">During the course of the proceedings, Harvill\u2019s counsel submitted requested instructions to the court on the question of specific intent which would require proof that defendant acted knowingly, purposely intending to violate the law, for conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-16\">Immediately prior to the testimony of the final defense witness, during a recess, the trial judge indicated he would give the requested instructions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The proceedings were reconvened, and counsel presented their arguments to the jury. Court was then recessed until the following morning, when the judge, without notifying counsel, failed to give the requested instructions, and instead instructed the jury that no specific intent was necessary to show a violation of section 1202(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-17\">Counsel for Harvill made timely exception to the failure to give the requested instructions and to the contradictory pattern of instructions. The exception was noted by the court (RT 41 -43).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-18\">The government does not argue that there was compliance with the rule, but claims that the court\u2019s instructions were proper <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and did not result in any prejudice to defendant. Whether the requested instructions were faulty is irrelevant; however, the court\u2019s failure to advise Harvill\u2019s counsel that he would not give the requested instructions requires reversal of the conviction only if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>counsel\u2019s closing argument was prejudi-cially affected thereby. Wright v. United States, 339 F.2d 578, 580 (9th Cir. 1964). <em>See also </em>United States v. Schef-fer, 463 F.2d 567, 574 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The focus of our inquiry must be on the effect which the court\u2019s misleading indications regarding the requested instructions had on the content of counsel\u2019s argument. \u201cThe obvious object of the rule in point is to require the judge to inform the trial lawyers in a fair way what the charge is going to be, so that they may intelligently argue the case to the jury.\u201d Ross v. United States, 180 F.2d 160, 165 (6th Cir. 1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">In this instance, Harvill\u2019s counsel argued to the jury after receiving misleading assurances that his instructions on specific intent would be given. Although only a portion of his closing argument stressed this issue, we cannot conclude that \u201cthe effectiveness of counsel\u2019s argument and hence of appellant\u2019s defense\u201d was not impaired by counsel\u2019s inaccurate information regarding the court\u2019s charge. Wright v. United States, <em>supra, </em>339 F.2d at 580. <em>See also </em>United States v. Mendoza, 473 F.2d 697 (5th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Although the government argues that the outcome of the trial could not conceivably have been affected had Harvill\u2019s counsel based his argument on accurate information about the court\u2019s action on his requested instructions, we cannot say that if the argument had been retai-lored to focus more vigorously on the questions of constructive possession and credibility of the witnesses, there would not have been a different outcome. In effect, part of counsel\u2019s argument was repudiated by the court, and thus the potential prejudice to defendant was considerably greater than in <em>Wright </em>and <em>Mendoza </em>where the court had not initially given an apparent unequivocal affirmative response to defendant\u2019s requested instructions. As the fifth circuit noted in <em>Mendoza:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">Although we recognize that the evidence against the [defendant] is nearly overwhelming, we cannot say with reasonable certainty that the outcome would be the same if the defense had argued before the jury with accurate information about the Trial Judge\u2019s proposed action upon the requested jury instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">473 F.2d at 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of conviction is reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b351-24\">.
