KAUFMAN, Chief Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Suits involving large damage claims inevitably spark intensive pretrial skirmishing, as the litigants bombard each other and the district court with a variety of motions. In this case, brought by the City of New York [City], which alone has a $12,000,000 claim, as a class action alleging that General Motors Corporation [GM] has violated the antitrust laws principally by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the nationwide market for city buses, we face appeals by GM from interlocutory orders deciding two bitterly contested pretrial, although unrelated, motions. The first is the City\u2019s successful motion to permit the suit to proceed as a class action; the second, GM\u2019s unsuccessful motion to have the City\u2019s privately-retained counsel, George D. Reycraft, disqualified for breach of the ethical precepts embodied in Canon 9 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After carefully applying the <em>Cohen</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>collateral order doctrine to separate the appealable from the non-appealable order, we dismiss the appeal from the court\u2019s order determining that this action may proceed as a class action because in the context of this case that order is not appealable. With respect to the motion to disqualify counsel, however, we conclude, without intending to suggest any actual impropriety on the part of Reycraft, that his disqualification is required to \u201cavoid even the appearance of professional impropriety.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court\u2019s order denying disqualification of Reycraft is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b695-15\">The facts necessary to an understanding of our disposition of these appeals have been gleaned, in the main, from the complaint and from the affidavits filed by the parties in support of and in opposition to the respective motions at issue. They are, thankfully, rather straightforward and, in all material respects, undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-16\">On October 4, 1972, the City filed a complaint alleging that GM had violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by attempting to monopolize and monopolizing \u201ctrade and commerce in the manufacture and sale of city buses.\u201d The complaint contained, as a second cause of action, the allegation that GM had breached Section 7 of the Clayton Act<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by acquiring, in 1925, a controlling interest in Yellow Truck &amp; Coach Manufacturing Co. [Yellow Coach] \u2014 an acquisition which purportedly \u201cthreatens substantially to lessen competition and to tend to create a monopoly in the manufacture and sale of buses within the United States . . . . \u201d The action, furthermore, was commenced on behalf of a class consisting of \u201call non-federal governmental units and instrumentalities in the United States which have purchased or have contributed to the purchase of city buses or city bus parts .\u201d The relief sought was, <em>in</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>ter alia, </em>for appropriate divestiture, treble damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">According to Reycraft\u2019s affidavit, filed in opposition to the disqualification motion, he was asked by the Office of the Corporation Counsel, sometime in July 1972, to assist in the preparation of the complaint. When approached by the Corporation Counsel, then J. Lee Rankin, Reycraft responded by informing Rankin of his prior and substantial involvement in an action brought by the United States against GM, under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, based on GM\u2019s alleged monopolization of a nation-wide market for the manufacture and sale of city and intercity buses. United States v. General Motors (No. 15816, E.D.Mich.1956) [1956 <em>Bus </em>case].</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In his affidavit, Reycraft described his participation in the 1956 <em>Bus </em>case, and his work for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">I was employed as an attorney for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice from the end of December, 1952 through the end of December, 1962. From sometime during the middle of 1954 through the end of 1962 I was employed in the Washington Office of the Antitrust Division. My initial assignment in the Washington Office of the Antitrust Division in 1954 was as a trial attorney in the General Litigation Section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">One of my first assignments as a member of the General Litigation Section was to work on an investigation of alleged monopolization by General Motors of the city and intercity bus business. The chief counsel in that matter from at least 1954 until the case was settled by Consent Decree in 1965 was Walter D. Murphy. At no time was I in active charge of the case. <em>That investigation culminated in the Complaint filed on July 6, 1956 which I signed and in the preparation of which I participated substantially.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-11\">In 1958, I became Chief of the Special Trial Section of the Antitrust Division and no longer had any direct or indirect involvement with the 1956 <em>Bus </em>case. Subsequently in 1961 I became Chief of Section Operations of the Antitrust Division and had technical responsibility for all matters within the Washington Office of the Antitrust Division, including the 1956 <em>Bus </em>case. I have no recollection of any active participation on my part in the 1956 <em>Bus </em>case from 1958 through the time I departed from the Antitrust Division in December of 1962. The case was in the charge of Walter D. Murphy from its inception and he continued in charge until the Consent Decree was entered on December 31, 1965. (emphasis added)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">In light of his substantial involvement as an employee of the Department of Justice in a matter which, at the very least, was similar to the dispute for which his retention was sought, Rey-craft initially consulted his partners in the firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft and, subsequently, requested the advice of the Antitrust Division on the applicability of the Federal conflict of interest statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That statute, we note, is penal in nature and its prohibitory rules, only two in number, must therefore be specifically defined and strictly construed. With that in mind, the Justice Department had little difficulty in concluding that the statute placed no bar on Reycraft\u2019s employment by the City. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Its response to Reycraft states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-5\">It is clear that section 207(b) [which applies for only one year after separation from government employ] has no bearing on your case. As for section 207 (a) [which applies only where the United States is a party or has a direct and substantial interest in the matter], although it appears that you participated personally and substantially in the case brought by the United States against General Motors, the Antitrust Division advises us that the United States will not be a party to or have a direct and substantial interest in the private antitrust suit by the City of New York against General Motors. Therefore, section 207(a) has no application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Accordingly, with Cadwalader\u2019s approval and the absence of any barrier posed by federal law, Reycraft agreed to represent the City on a contingent fee basis, a not infrequent arrangement in actions where recovery is at the same time uncertain but potentially great.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">On February 22, 1973, the City moved before Judge Carter for a determination that its suit could proceed as a class action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a) and 23(b)(3). GM responded by opposing the class determination and, in turn, moved for the disqualification of Rey-craft. Argument on both motions was subsequently heard by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">The City represented to Judge Carter that the class for which it sought representation would consist of 200-300 readily identifiable non-federal governmental units. It submitted a preliminary list of 177 entities identified as of the date of argument.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The City also informed the judge that it would bear the cost of notifying all class members. The argument in the district court on the disqualification motion, although quite thorough, as indeed it was in this Court, added no material facts other than those we have already related.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-14\">In August 1973, Judge Carter entered his order, and filed an accompanying memorandum opinion,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> granting the City\u2019s motion for class action status and denying GM\u2019s motion to disqualify Rey-craft. Rejecting GM\u2019s twofold contention that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> had not been met, the district judge concluded: (1) \u201cthat the common underlying issue of liability pursuant to an unlawful, nationwide monopoly predominates over any questions as to the varying nature or amount of damages;\u201d and (2) that the class action mechanism was the superior method for resolving this controversy because \u201c[i]t is inconceivable that other governmental units will not pursue such claims [of monopolization] in the event that the class action motion is denied and the suit brought by the City of New York is, or appears likely to be, successful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-17\">Turning to the disqualification motion, the district court recognized that DR9-101(B) requires<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Reycraft\u2019s disqualification, in order to avoid \u201ceven the appearance of impropriety,\u201d if his participation in this action would constitute \u201cprivate employment in a matter in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>which he had substantial responsibility while he was a public employee.\u201d Since it was virtually conceded that Reycraft had \u201csubstantial responsibility\u201d over the 1956 <em>Bus </em>case, the only questions which remained were whether his engagement to represent the City was \u201cprivate employment,\u201d and whether the City\u2019s antitrust action was, for purposes of DR9-101(B), the same \u201cmatter\u201d as to the 1956 <em>Bus </em>case. Judge Carter answered both questions in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">II. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">We need not tarry over the question of our jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order denying disqualification, for our recent en banc decision in Silver Chrysler Plymouth, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors Corp., 496 F.2d 800 (2d Cir. 1974) (en banc) concluded that such an interlocutory order falls within the narrow confines of permissible appeals under the collateral order doctrine. Hence, it is appealable as a \u201cfinal\u201d order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See e. g. </em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">It is equally plain, however, in accordance with the teachings of an even more recent decision of this Court, Kohn v. Royall, Koegel &amp; Wells, 496 F.2d 1094 (2d Cir. 1974), that interlocutory orders granting class standing are not uniform-Iy deserving of such exceptional treatment. In <em>Kohn, </em>we sought to provide some guideposts to aid in discerning requisite finality.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Our product, distilled from previous decisions of this Court, was a three-pronged test for appealability of an order granting class standing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-9\">(1) whether the class action determination is \u201cfundamental to the further conduct of the case</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-10\">(2) whether review of that order is \u201cseparable from the merits</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-11\">(3) whether that order will cause \u201cirreparable harm to the defendant in terms of time and money spent in defending a huge class action <em>)&gt;</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">Kohn v. Royall, Koegel &amp; Wells, <em>supra, </em>at 1098. <em>See also </em>Herbst v. International Telephone and Telegraph, 495 F.2d 1308 (2d Cir. 1974). Here, as in <em>Kohn, </em>none of these requirements has been met.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-14\">The fundamental-to-the-further-conduct requirement, we concluded in <em>Kohn, </em>is satisfied where \u201cthe action\u2019s viability turns on the class action determination.\u201d Kohn v. Royall, Koegel &amp; Wells, <em>supra, </em>at 1099. Although a narrow definition, we believe that our interpretation of the \u201cfundamentality\u201d requirement is not only consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s application of that concept<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>necessary, as well, lest this exception, in conjunction with the collateral order doctrine, \u201cswallow the salutary \u2018final judgment\u2019 rule.\u201d Weight Watchers of Phila. v. Weight Watchers Int., 455 F.2d 770, 773 (2d Cir. 1972). Since it is undisputed that the City with its $12,000,000 claim would continue this action were class standing denied, it is quite clear that the first element of the appealability equation is lacking in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Nor is the second prong of the appeal-ability test fulfilled for, as in <em>Kohn, </em>review of the court\u2019s class action determination would take us far into the merits of the City\u2019s antitrust claim that GM has monopolized or attemped to monopolize a nationwide market in the manufacture and sale of city buses. GM, for example, vigorously disputes the district court\u2019s conclusion that proof of monopolization or attempted monopolization will present common questions of law or fact that will predominate over individual proof of damages. To buttress this contention, GM argues that \u201cproof relating to market, competition, economic power, [and] relevant economic behavior . \u201d will vary for each purported member of the class. <em>See </em>Brief for Appellant at 27-28. A mere recitation of these factors demonstrates their obvious relationship to the very issues critical to the success of the City\u2019s underlying antitrust claim. Thus, we are asked at this preliminary stage in the ligation to undertake the difficult though eventually unavoidable task of product and geographic market definition, simply to determine whether evidence submitted in the course of this definitional process will be common or individual in nature. The redundancy of effort and consequent waste of judicial resources must be apparent; accordingly, we shall not belabor the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">Finally, we do not find in this case the spectre of irreparable harm, either in terms of costs of defending the action or in its judicial management, as we did in the huge class actions before us in Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, 479 F.2d 1005 (2d Cir. 1973), aff\u2019d, 417 U.S. 156, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>94 S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974) (estimated identifiable class of 2,250,000) and Herbst v. International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., <em>supra </em>(estimated identifiable class of 16,000). Although the instant case is a Rule 23(b)(3) class action, the class here, tentatively estimated at 177, does not remotely approach the thousands or, indeed, millions encountered in <em>Eisen </em>and <em>Herbst. </em>Moreover, the procedural costs unique to the class action mechanism\u2014 essentially the cost of notice \u2014 will be assumed by the plaintiff City, as indeed, they now must be under <em>Eisen. </em>And, since the City\u2019s claim of nationwide monopolization will, even absent class action status, sustain broad discovery and evidentiary admissibility at trial as to alleged national predatory practices, the <em>incremental </em>cost of defending this action as a class action should not be significant. <em>See </em>Kohn v. Royall, Koegel &amp; Wells, <em>supra, </em>496 F.2d at 1100-1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Despite our conclusion that nonappeal-ability is mandated by <em>Kohn </em>GM urged at argument that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, <em>supra, </em>might well have broadened the parameters governing the ap-pealability of orders granting class action status. To the contrary, we find in <em>Eisen </em>a reaffirmation of the exceptional circumstances required to justify departure from the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d rule\u2014 circumstances not present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The Supreme Court, in <em>Eisen, </em>once again examined the policy behind the <em>Cohen </em>collateral order doctrine and found it applicable to the single question it was deciding \u2014 the propriety of the notice procedure adopted by the district court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This, we might add, included consideration of both the method of notice and the cost of notice. The Court emphasized that the notice ruling by the district court was not \u201ctentative, informal or incomplete,\u201d citing <em>Cohen, </em>337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, nor did review of the order\u2019s validity require consideration with the merits of the underlying cause of action, <em>see </em>Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., <em>supra, </em>337 U.S. at 546-547, 69 S.Ct. at 1225. Accordingly, giving the requirement of finality a \u201cpractical rather than a technical construction,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1226, the Court, in <em>Eisen, </em>struck the balance between \u201c <em>\u2018the </em>inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review on the one hand and the danger of denying justice by delay on the other,\u2019 Dickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp., 338 U.S. 507, 511, 70 S.Ct. 322, 334, 94 L.Ed. 299 (1950) (footnote omitted),\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> by permitting an immediate appeal from \u201cthe District Court\u2019s resolution of the class action notice problems in this case. .\u201d Eisen v. Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin, <em>supra, </em>417 U.S. at 172, 94 S.Ct. at 2150.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Applying each of the considerations discussed in <em>Eisen </em>to the facts here, it is clear to us that the district court\u2019s order granting class action status in this ease is not now appealable. Unlike the rulings in <em>Cohen </em>and <em>Eisen, </em>Judge Carter\u2019s determination to permit the City\u2019s action to proceed as a class action is very much \u201ctentative,\u201d subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>always to reconsideration as the cause of action unfolds.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We noted in Green v. Wolf Corp., 406 F.2d 291, 298 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 977, 89 S.Ct. 2131, 23 L.Ed.2d 766 (1969) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-4\">Rule 23 now emphasizes the flexibility which a trial court exercises in the management of the action It is this flexibility which indeed enables us to view liberally claims which assert a right to a class action ... at the early stages of the litigation ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Thus, if the concern voiced by GM at argument respecting the potentially explosive class size<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or the possible confusion bred by the disparate proof required for a proper market analysis should become a reality, we are confident that the district court will act appropriately, limiting or even striking the class if necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">We consider it imperative, furthermore, to recognize the sharp distinction between the bases for attacking the class action determination in this case as contrasted with <em>Eisen. </em>In ' <em>Eisen, </em>as noted, the Supreme Court focused narrowly on the unprecedented and extraordinary notice procedure authorized by the district court. In this case, however, there is nothing unique about the notice procedure approved by the court below \u2014 individualized notice is to be given to all identifiable class members, and at the City\u2019s expense. Rather, GM\u2019s attack on the class action determination rests, as we have indicated, on the twofold contention that the requirements of Rule 23(b)(3) are not met because: (1) common questions of law or fact do not predominate and (2) the class action is not \u201csuperior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\u201d Accordingly, we would review here not a finite and conclusive determination of judicial power \u2014 e. <em>g. </em>the power to shift notice costs and forego individualized notice, as in <em>Eisen, </em>or the power to dispense with security, as in <em>Cohen </em>\u2014 but a discretionary decision, the propriety of which will necessarily vary from case to case. That this distinction is of fundamental importance in the calculus of ap-pealability was plainly acknowledged in <em>Cohen </em>itself. Mr. Justice Jackson stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b701-14\">But we do not mean that every order fixing security is subject to appeal. Here it is the right to security that presents a serious and unsettled question. If the right were admitted or clear and the order involved only an exercise of discretion as to the amount of security, a matter the statute makes subject to reconsideration from time to time, appealability would present a different question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b701-15\">Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., <em>supra, </em>337 U.S. at 547, 69 S.Ct. at 1226. <em>And see </em>Weight Watchers of Phila. v. Weight Watchers Int., <em>supra, </em>455 F.2d at 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-16\">A final distinction, which cannot be overlooked, is that in reviewing the legitimacy of the notice procedure authorized in <em>Eisen, </em>the Court was not called upon to consider any aspect of Eisen\u2019s underlying antitrust action against the odd-lot brokerage firms. Accommodating the notice procedure contemplated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Rule' 23(c)(2) with the overriding considerations of due process is a task wholly divorced from review of the underlying merits of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Although the interlocutory order granting class action status is thus clearly not appealable at this nascent stage in the litigation, GM argues that since we have jurisdiction to hear the appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying disqualification, we should exercise our discretionary power to consider this nonappealable order as well. To be sure, the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction at the appellate level has been utilized. <em>See e. g. </em>Deckert v. Independence Shares Corp., 311 U.S. 282, 61 S.Ct. 229, 85 L.Ed. 189 (1940) ; Green v. Wolf Corp., supra, Semmes Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 429 F.2d 1197, 1201 (2d Cir. 1970); 9 J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b6 110.25[1] (2d ed. 1973). But, further analysis suggests the inappropriateness of exercising that power here.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\"> The guiding principle to inform the discretionary application of pendent jurisdiction is whether review of the appealable order will involve consideration of factors relevant to the otherwise nonappealable order. <em>See </em>9 J. Moore, <em>supra, </em>\u00b6 110.25[1] at 272. In this case, it is transparently obvious that no such overlap exists between the order granting class action status and the order denying disqualification of counsel. \u201cIn addition,\u201d according to Professor Moore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-6\">where an interlocutory order is properly appealed and review is sought of an incidental discretionary order, the appellate court should not review the discretionary order where there is no showing of an abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-7\"><em>Id. </em>Professor Moore\u2019s observation suggests that he would look with disfavor upon the exercise of pendent jurisdiction in the instant ease because the determination to grant class standing for a relatively small class (less than 200), where notice will be given to all identifiable class members and paid for by the plaintiff City, is clearly not a prima facie abuse of discretion. And, indeed, it would be particularly inappropriate for us to reach out to review this order, at this very early stage in the litigation, for, as we have already indicated, the district judge retains the flexibility to modify or even strike the class should further developments prove his initial determination erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">In a final effort to gain review of the class action determination, GM has also followed the mandamus route in the event we should hold the class action order nonappealable. In denying the mandamus petition, suffice to say, as we did in Donlon Industries, Inc. v. Forte, 402 F.2d 935, 937 (2d Cir. 1968) and repeated in Weight Watchers of Phila. v. Weight Watchers Int., <em>supra, </em>455 F.2d at 775:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">we do not \u2014 indeed may not \u2014 issue <em>mandamus </em>with respect to orders resting in the district court\u2019s discretion, save in [the] most extraordinary circumstances not remotely presented here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">III. DISQUALIFICATION OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">We turn now to GM\u2019s unsuccessful motion to disqualify the City\u2019s privately-retained counsel, George Reyeraft. It is necessary that we begin our discussion by focusing again on the language of Canon 9 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-13\">A lawyer should avoid even the appearance of professional impropriety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-14\">Providing a measure of specificity to this general caveat, DR9-101(B) commands :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-15\">A lawyer shall not accept private employment in a matter in which he had substantial responsibility while he was a public employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-16\">The purpose behind this plain interdiction is not difficult to discern. Indeed, the City recognizes its salutary goal, as stated by the ABA Comm, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Professional Ethics, Opinions, No. 37 (1931)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-4\">[to avoid] the manifest possibility that ... [a former Government lawyer\u2019s] action as a public legal official might be influenced (or open to the charge that it had been influenced) by the hope of later being employed privately to <em>uphold or upset </em>what he had done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 124 (emphasis added). Viewed in this light, the question before us is whether Reycraft\u2019s decision to represent the City on a contingent fee basis in an antitrust suit strikingly similar, though perhaps not identical in every respect, to an antitrust action brought over his signature by the Department of Justice would raise an \u201cappearance of impropriety,\u201d as private employment \u201cto uphold . , . what he had done\u201d as a Government lawyer. Unlike the court below, we are constrained to answer in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Before we commence our analysis, we would do well to recall the following description of our task:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-8\">We approach our task as a reviewing court in this case conscious of our responsibility to preserve a balance, delicate though it may be, between an individual\u2019s right to his own freely chosen counsel [we do not presume the City to have a lesser right] and the need to maintain the highest ethical standards of professional responsibility. This balance is essential if the public\u2019s trust in the integrity of the Bar is to be preserved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Emle Industries, Inc. v. Patentex, Inc., 478 F.2d 562, 564-565 (2d Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">Indeed, the \u201cpublic\u2019s trust\u201d is the rai-son d\u2019etre for Canon 9\u2019s \u201cappearance-of-evil\u201d doctrine. Now explicitly incorporated in the profession\u2019s ethical Code,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> this doctrine is directed at maintaining, in the public mind, a high regard for the legal profession. The standard it <em>sets </em>\u2014 i. <em>e. </em>what creates an appearance of evil \u2014 is largely a question of current ethical-legal mores. <em>See </em>Kaufman, The Former Government Attorney and the Canons of Professional Ethics, 70 Harv.L.Rev. 657, 660 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">Nor can we overlook that the Code of Professional Responsibility is not designed for Holmes\u2019 proverbial \u201cbad man\u201d who wants to know just how many corners he may cut, how close to the line he may play, without running into trouble with the law. Holmes, The Path of the Law, in Collected Legal Papers 170 (1920). Rather, it is drawn for the \u201cgood man,\u201d as a beacon to assist him in navigating an ethical course through the sometimes murky waters of professional conduct. Accordingly, without in the least even intimating that Reycraft himself was improperly influenced while in Government service, or that he is guilty of any actual impropriety in agreeing to represent the City here, we must act with scrupulous care to avoid any <em>appearance </em>of impropriety lest it taint both the public and private segments of the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-15\">It is undisputed that Reycraft had \u201csubstantial responsibility\u201d in initiating the Government\u2019s Sherman \u00a7 2 claim against GM for monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the nationwide market for city and intercity buses. Thus, we are left to determine whether the City\u2019s antitrust suit is the same \u201cmatter\u201d as the Government\u2019s action and whether Reycraft\u2019s contingent fee arrangement with the City constitutes \u201cprivate employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>Directing our attention to the simpler question first, we are convinced beyond doubt that Reycraft\u2019s and, indeed, his firm\u2019s opportunity to earn a substantial fee for Reycraft\u2019s services is plainly \u201cprivate employment\u201d under DR9-101(B). The district judge apparently grounded his contrary decision on the rationale that Reycraft \u201chas not changed <em>sides\u201d </em>\u2014 i. <em>e. </em>\u201cthere is nothing antithetical in the postures of the two governments in the actions in question. .\u201d But, as we have already noted, Opinion No. 37 of the ABA Commission on Professional Ethics uneauivoeally applies the ethical precepts of Canon 9 and DR9-101(B) irrespective of the side chosen in private practice.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>And see </em>Allied Realty of St. Paul v. Exchange Nat. Bank of Chicago, 283 F.Supp. 464, 466 (D.Minn.1968). We believe, moreover, that this is as it should be for there lurks great potential for lucrative returns in following into private practice the course already charted with the aid of governmental resources. And, with such a large contingent fee at stake, we could hardly accept \u201cpro bono publico\u201d as a proper characterization of Reycraft\u2019s work, simply because the keeper of the purse is the City of New York or other governmental entities in the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">It is manifest also, from an examination of the respective complaints (see the appendix to this opinion), that the City\u2019s antitrust action is sufficiently similar to the 1956 <em>Bus </em>case to be the same \u201cmatter\u201d under DR9-101(B). Indeed, virtually <em>every </em>overt act of attempted monopolization alleged in the City\u2019s complaint is lifted <em>in haec verba </em>from the Justice Department complaint. We cite, merely by way of illustration, paragraphs appearing in both complaints alleging the withdrawal of more than 20 companies from bus manufacturing, the coincidence of directors on the boards of GM'and another bus manufacturer, the Flxible Company, and GM\u2019s acquisition of a controlling stock interest in Yellow Coach in 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">To be sure, as the City urges, the four-year statute of limitations, embodied in 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15b, requires the City to focus on market conditions since 1968, some ten years after Reycraft ceased his involvement in the <em>Bus </em>ease.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> But, an equally essential element in proving a violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act is either an intent to monopolize or an abuse of monopoly power. <em>See </em>United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U.S. 563, 570-571, 86 S.Ct. 1698, 16 L.Ed.2d 778 (1966) ; Coniglio v. Highwood Services, Inc., 495 F.2d 1286, 1293 (2d Cir. 1974); United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, 148 F.2d 416, 429-430 (2d Cir. 1945). Moreover, to decide the question whether GM is a passive recipient of monopoly power, a history of its operations will be imperative. See e. <em>g. </em>United States v. Aluminum Co. of America, <em>supra </em>(included an exhaustive study of Alcoa\u2019s operations from 1902 to the date of the lawsuit). Accordingly, at the very forefront of the City\u2019s case will be proof of alleged predatory practices amassed by the United States, with the substantial participation of Reycraft, when the Justice Department built its case against GM in 1956.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The addition of the Clayton Act claim, based solely on the same 1925 Yellow Coach acquisition which was part of the Sherman Act violation alleged by both the United States and the City, hardly alters the nuclear identity of these two suits.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Both, after all, allege monopolization or attempted monopolization of the <em>same </em>product line<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> \u2014 city buses\u2014 and, in the <em>same </em>geographic market\u2014 the United States. The subtleties of differential proof will not obviate the \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d to an unsophisticated public. We opined in <em>Ernie:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"azc-dedup-0\">Nowhere is Shakespeare\u2019s observation that \u201cthere is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so,\u201d more apt than in the realm of ethical considerations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Emle Industries, Inc. v. Patentex, Inc., <em>supra, </em>478 F.2d at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The City maintains, in the end, that if we reverse the court below and disqualify Reycraft, we will chill the ardor for Government service by rendering worthless the experience gained in Government employ. Indeed, the author of this opinion is hardly unaware of this claim, for he has cautioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-6\">If the government service will tend to sterilize an attorney in too large an area of law for too long a time, or will prevent him from engaging in the practice of a technical specialty which he has devoted years in acquiring, and if that sterilization will spread to the firm with which he becomes associated, the sacrifice of entering government service will be too great for most men to make.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">Kaufman, <em>supra, </em>70 Harv.L.Rev. at 668. But, in that commentary, and the case upon which it was based (United States v. Standard Oil Co. (N.J.), 136 F.Supp. 345 (S.D.N.Y.1955) \u2014 Esso Export Case), the accommodation between maintaining high ethical standards for former Government employees, on the one hand, and encouraging entry into Government service, on the other, was struck under far different circumstances. Unlike the instant case, in which Reycraft\u2019s \u201csubstantial responsibility\u201d in the <em>Bus </em>case is undisputed, the writer of this opinion concluded in <em>Esso Export </em>that the lawyer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-14\">never investigated or passed upon the subject <em>matter of </em>the pending case never rendered or had any specific duty to render any legal advice in relation to the regulations involved in the litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-15\">Kaufman, <em>supra, </em>70 Harv.L.Rev. at 664. More to the point, therefore, is another admonition voiced in that article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-16\">If there was a likelihood that information <em>pertaining </em>to the pending matter reached the attorney, although he did not \u201cinvestigate\u201d or \u201cpass upon\u201d it, . there would undoubtedly be an appearance of evil if he were not disqualified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-17\"><em>Id. </em>at 665 (emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-18\"><em>Esso Export </em>unquestionably presented a case for the cautious appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>cation of the \u201cappearance-of-evil doctrine,\u201d because the former Government lawyer\u2019s connection with the matter at issue was the tenuous one of mere employment in the same Government agency. If, for example, Reycraft had not worked on the 1956 <em>Bus </em>case, but was simply a member of the Antitrust Division at that time, a case not unlike <em>Esso Export </em>would be before us. To the contrary, however, Reycraft not only participated in the <em>Bus </em>case, but he signed the complaint in that action and admittedly had \u201csubstantial responsibility\u201d in its investigatory and preparatory stages. Where the overlap of issues is so plain, and the involvement while in Government employ so direct, the resulting appearance of impropriety must be avoided through disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal from the order granting class action status, and reverse the court\u2019s order denying disqualification of Reycraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The following comparison of portions of the complaints filed by the United States in the 1956 <em>Bus </em>case and by the City in the instant case was included in the record below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">United States v.

It seems rather paradoxical that our brother Mansfield would show discomfiture at our efforts to supply guidance for both appellate courts and litigants with respect to the admittedly difficult question of finality while, at the same time, urging us to do just that for district courts by removing the uncertainty which purportedly surrounds the class action determination. That district judges repeatedly face complex, indeed often impressionistic, decisions in the course of a lawsuit is a fact too plain for citation. Thus, if there is to be any meaning to the \u201cfinal judgment\u201d rule, then, as we have all too frequently emphasized, see, e. <em>g. </em>Kohn v. Royall, Koegel &amp; Wells, <em>supra, </em>at 1101; Weight Watchers of Phila. v. Weight Watchers Int., 455 F.2d 770, 773 (2d Cir. 1972), that burden alone cannot serve as justification for immediate appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b698-15\">. Four cases are generally cited as exemplary of the Supreme Court\u2019s application of the phrase \u201cfundamental to the further conduct of the case\u201d: Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., 379 U.S. 148, 153, 85 S.Ct. 308, 311, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1964), Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 685 n. 3, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628 (1949), Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731, 734 n. 2, 67 S.Ct. 1009, 91 L.Ed. 1209 (1947), and United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 377, 65 S.Ct. 357, 89 L.Ed. 311 (1945). We note, however, that only in <em>Gillespie </em>did the Court use that descriptive phrase to assess the finality of an interlocutory order for purposes of determining appealability. In the three previous cases, <em>Larson, Land </em>and <em>General Motors, </em>the relevant question before the Court was not one of jurisdictional power, but rather the ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>propriateness of reviewing a \u201cjudgment of the <em>Court of Appeals </em>[which] was not a final one . . . . \u201d Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Commerce Corp., <em>supra, </em>337 U.S. at 685 n. 3, 69 S.Ct. at 1459 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Nevertheless, in these three cases, as well as in <em>Gillespie, </em>the \u201cfundamental to the further conduct\u201d phrase was applied to decisions by an inferior court on which the very continuation of the action turned. In <em>Land </em>and <em>Larson, </em>for example, the Court granted certiorari to review judgments in which dismissals, predicated on claims of sovereign immunity, had been reversed and the cases remanded for trial. In <em>General Motors, </em>similarly, Supreme Court review was granted to consider a decision by the court of appeals which, in reversing the judgment of the district court, would, as in <em>Land </em>and <em>Larson, </em>have required a trial \u2014 although in <em>General Motors </em>it would have meant a second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">Finally, in <em>Gillespie, </em>Mr. Justice Black applied this \u201cfundamentality\u201d concept to inform the practical construction given to the jurisdictional prerequisite, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, of finality. Contrary to the contention of our brother Mansfield, the order at issue once again was viewed by the Supreme Court as vital to the life of the action with respect, at least, to certain parties for whose benefit, in part, the suit was brought, since the district court\u2019s order to strike the claims for relief on their behalf amounted to termination of the action as to them. Indeed, Justice Black was quite clear on this point, stating :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-12\">delay of perhaps a number of years in having the brother\u2019s and sisters\u2019 rights determined might work a great injustice on them, since the claims for recovery for their benefit have been effectively cut off so long as the District Judge\u2019s ruling stands. And while their claims are not formally severable so as to make the court\u2019s order unquestionably appealable as to them, cf. Dickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp., [338 U.S. 507, 70 S.Ct. 322, 94 L.Ed. 299] <em>supra, </em>there certainly is ample reason to view their claims as sev-erable in deciding the issue of finality, particularly since the brother and sisters were separate parties in the petition for extraordinary relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., <em>supra, </em>379 U.S. at 153, 85 S.Ct. at 311. Accordingly, we feel confident that our interpretation of the phrase \u201cfundamental to the further conduct of the case\u201d is fully consonant with its exceptional and narrow application by the Supreme Court to orders on which the action\u2019s viability turns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b700-6\">. Although our brother Mansfield quotes at length from <em>Eisen\u2019s </em>preliminary discussion of the difficulty in determining finality, he has apparently overlooked the most critical aspect of the case with respect to appealability \u2014its holding which limits that determination to the notice question. Indeed, the narrowness of its application of the <em>Oohen </em>doctrine is highlighted by footnote 10 of the opinion in which Mr. Justice Powell intimates that the other issues considered by our Court in <em>Eisen III </em>\u2014 class manageability and fluid class recovery \u2014 might not be appealable under the collateral order doctrine. Thus, he states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-10\">We therefore have no occasion to consider whether the Court of Appeals correctly resolved the issues of manageability and fluid class recovery, or indeed, whether those issues were properly before the Court of Appeals under the theory of <em>retained jurisdiction.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">Eisen v.

International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., 495 F.2d 1308 (2d Cir. 1974); and Kohn v.

Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. at 546, 69 S.Ct. at 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Turning to the first of the three prongs, the requirement that the district court\u2019s order be \u201cfundamental to the further conduct of the case,\u201d see United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.S. 373, 377, 65 S.Ct. 357, 359, 89 L.Ed. 311 (1945); Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., 379 U.S. 148, 153, 85 S.Ct. 308, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1964), I do not agree that an order <em>granting </em>class action status should be appealable only upon a showing that the action would otherwise have withered on the vine. Nothing in the origin or history of the \u201cfundamentality\u201d phrase so indicates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Where class action status has been <em>denied </em>by the district court, the likelihood that the action will survive as an individual suit or collapse entirely should weigh heavily in the scales of appealability, as Judge Kaufman pointed out in forging the \u201cdeath knell\u201d doctrine in <em>Eisen I. </em>However, where class certification has been <em>granted </em>by the district court it does not follow that merely because the suit would have continued as an individual action if class certification had been refused, review should be denied. The logic of such a \u201creverse death-knell\u201d doctrine, although it may have surface appeal to those dedicated to sheer symmetry, escapes me. Nor do I interpret Judge Friendly\u2019s reference in Korn v. Franchard Corp., 443 F.2d 1301, 1307 (2d Cir. 1971) to \u201cequality of treatment as between plaintiffs and defendants\u201d as sponsoring it. Indeed he there voiced serious doubts as to the workability of the \u201cdeath-knell\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Despite the fact that, if class action status is denied, a class suit may continue as a viable individual action, practical considerations may dictate the advisability in some instances of immediate review of an order granting class action status. One such consideration is the likelihood that because of the sheer size and complexity of the action, the added time, expense and effort needed to defend it as a class suit may force the defendant, despite the doubtful merit of the claims, to settle rather than to pursue the long and costly litigation route required for review of the class action certification. See West Virginia v. Chas. Pfizer &amp; Co., 314 F.Supp. 710 (S.D.N.Y.1970), affd., 440 F.2d 1079 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 871, 92 S.Ct. 81, 30 L.Ed.2d 115 (1971); Herbst v. International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., 495 F.2d 1308, 1312-1313 (2d Cir. 1974); American College of Trial Lawyers, Report and Recommendations of the Special Committee on Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 15-17 (1972). To be meaningful the review must be from an interlocutory order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Otherwise appellate review, although theoretically available years later after trial, becomes prohibitive as a practical matter, principally because of the time and expense factor. Despite the pendency of hundreds of Rule 23(b)(3) class suits, only a handful have been tried to judgment, much less thereafter reviewed by a court of appeals. American College of Trial Lawyers, Report, <em>supra, </em>15. In the meantime, because most class damage suits prove to be behemoths in the world of litigation, the district court judge who has been saddled with actions that have erroneously been granted class status under Rule 23(b)(3) must assume onerous and time-consuming duties not characteristic of most other litigation. He must make more interlocutory determinations than in other actions. He must identify the class and determine what sub-classes, if any, are to be established. Green v. Wolf Corp., 406 F.2d 291, 299 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 977, 89 S.Ct. 2131, 23 L.Ed.2d 766 (1969). He must supervise the type and terms of the notice and other communications to be sent to members of the class. He must classify and handle queries from class members, determine whether and when filing of proofs of claim by members will be required. He must register opt-outs, supervise pretrial discovery, formulate pretrial orders, and handle a plethora of motions. He must consider proposed settlements and hold hearings with respect to them. He must preside at trial of common issues, if trial there is to be, preside at such later trials of any individual issues as may occur, and supervise the distribution of awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">We should not allow this complex, time-consuming and expensive process to be launched without ample justification. As we said recently in <em>Herbst, supra, </em>495 F.2d at 1313:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">\u201cWe believe that in the exercise of our supervisory powers over the administration of justice in the district courts it is desirable for us to review orders authorizing class actions before the parties and the district courts expend large amounts of time and money in managing them. Candor compels us to add that as appellate judges we would be reluctant to hold that a class action had been improper after the district court and the parties had expended much time and resources although we might have had serious doubts if we had reviewed the question at the inception of the action. Judicial efficiency requires that appellate review be made before the parties and district courts have spent considerable time, effort, and money, on such actions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">Our initial reaction, upon first being exposed eight years ago to Rule 23(b)(3), was to urge that it be construed liberally, see <em>Eisen II, </em>391 F.2d 555, 563 (2d Cir. 1968) (\u201cwe hold that the new rule should be given a liberal rather than a restrictive interpretation\u201d) (Medina, C. J.) and Green v. Wolf Corp., 406 F.2d 291, 298 (2d Cir. 1968) (the \u201cguiding principle\u201d should be that \u201cif there is to be an error made, let it be in favor of and not against the maintenance of the class action\u201d) (Kaufman, C. J., quoting from Esplin v. Hirschi, 402 F.2d 94, 99 (10th Cir. 1968)). The time may have come for reappraisal of this philosophy, which may prove to have been somewhat overly enthusiastic. However, as long as the district courts in this Circuit are so advised, I question the wisdom, much less the practicality, of adopting a restrictive set of conditions for review. Such tests, especially if applied in a wooden-like fashion, may have the effect of imposing an unnecessary and staggering burden upon the district courts and of delaying justice until the central issue becomes academic. Although the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Eisen III, </em>417 U.S. 156, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974), has dealt a lethal blow to those consumer-type class suits in which the named plaintiffs cannot afford the cost of individual notice to the class, the courtroom doors remain open to numer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ous actions where the class is smaller than in <em>Eisen </em>and the members are identifiable. See e. g., Illinois v. Harper &amp; Row Publishers, Inc., 301 F.Supp. 484 (N.D.Ill.1969). The present case is but one example. Rather than hold that an order granting class action status will be reviewed only if the action could not have been continued as an individual suit, I would dispense with the \u201cfundamentality\u201d requirement as a condition for such review and use the simple test of weighing \u201cthe inconvenience and costs of piecemeal review\u201d against \u201cthe danger of denying justice by delay.\u201d See Dickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp., 338 U.S. 507, 511, 70 S.Ct. 322, 324, 94 L.Ed.2d 299 (1950); Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., <em>supra, </em>379 U.S. pp. 152-153, 85 S.Ct. 308.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Turning to the second requirement\u2014 that a class certification, to be appeala-ble, must be \u201cseparable from the merits\u201d \u2014strict application of this condition would preclude almost any review of a trial judge\u2019s determination that common questions \u201cpredominate\u201d or that a class action is \u201csuperior\u201d to other available methods for adjudicating the controversy. In the absence of any judicial or legislative definition of the term \u201cpredominate\u201d as it is used in Rule 23(b)(3), the trial judge, upon being faced with some claims and proof common to all class members (e.g. joint action on the part of defendants) and others that are individual to each class member (e.g., differing affirmative representations made to different members, materiality, or proximate cause), looks for some controlling principles of general application. See, e.g., Epstein v. Weiss, 50 F.R.D. 387, 393 (E.D.La.1970); Siegel v. Chicken Delight, Inc., 271 F.Supp. 722, 726 (N.D.Cal.1967). Guiding principles are also required to determine whether injunctive relief, administrative action, or some other remedy would be superior to a damage suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">For these enormously important threshold decisions, which determine whether the class action genie is to be released from the bottle, the district courts need guidance. Instead, because so few class action determinations ever reach the point of appellate review, the trial judges are asked to \u201cfly by the seat of their pants.\u201d Despite the passage of seven years since the adoption of Rule 23, except in one or two instances, see, e.g., Green v. Wolf Corp., 406 F.2d 291, 300-301 (2d Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 977, 89 S.Ct. 2131, 23 L.Ed.2d 766 (1969); Korn v. Franchard Corp., 456 F.2d 1206 (2d Cir. 1972), we have yet to provide any meaningful guidelines interpreting key terms used in the Rule, such as \u201cpredominate\u201d and \u201csuperior\u201d found in (b) (3) and \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d in (c)(1). As a result, district judges, left to fend for themselves, have adopted varying individual standards. We cannot disregard the fact that some judges, possibly influenced by our early exhorta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>tions to take a liberal view of the Rule, have tended to \u201cjump the gun\u201d by making an early determination in favor of a class certification without benefit of adequate data. Others, perhaps more aware of the consequences of unleashing the titanic class action weapon, have sought to avoid the harmful effects of an unwarranted or premature grant of class action status in a doubtful case by adopting the principle that \u201cit is preferable to proceed with the claims of those before the Court, without prejudice to subsequent class action treatment if, upon further development of the litigation, it appears appropriate.\u201d Morris v. Burchard, 51 F.R.D. 530 at 536 (S.D.N.Y.1971); See also Schaffner v. Chemical Bank, 339 F.Supp. 329 (S.D.N.Y.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Similarly some judges, at least where the plaintiff\u2019s individual claim is large enough to be prosecuted individually, have refused to grant class certification in the absence of evidence that additional, duplicate suits have been instituted or that a multiplicity of suits is threatened. See, e.g., Caceres v. International Air Transport Ass\u2019n, 46 F.R.D. 89 (S.D.N.Y.1969), appeal dismissed, 422 F.2d 141 (2d Cir. 1970); Free World Foreign Cars, Inc. v. Alfa Romeo, S.p.A., 55 F.R.D. 26 (S.D.N.Y.1972); City of New York v. International Pipe &amp; Ceramics Corp., 44 F.R.D. 584 (S.D.N.Y.1968), appeal dismissed, 410 F.2d 295 (2d Cir. 1969). In contrast, others have indicated that a class action might be warranted in the absence of evidence of other existing or prospective litigation, see Fidelis Corp. v. Litton Industries, 293 F.Supp. 164, 171 (S.D.N.Y.1968).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the present case Judge Carter has granted class action status despite the fact that the City would continue its own individual suit for $12,000,000 and despite the fact that, although 17 years have elapsed since the institution of the Government suit upon which the present action is based, and 8 years have passed since the settlement of the Government\u2019s action by entry of a consent decree, no other governmental body has seen fit to institute a coattail action of its own, much less to join as a named co-plaintiff in the City\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Such sharply conflicting views as to the conditions required for maintenance of an action as a class suit under Rule 23(b)(3) indicate that the decision in close cases may depend on the interpretation and philosophy of the judge rather than upon uniform principles established by appellate review. The uncertainties posed by Rule 23 should be resolved in a manner that will enable district judges to act with some degree of uniformity. For these reasons and to permit meaningful review and appellate formulation of critical guidelines, I would suggest that, in lieu of a \u201cseparability from the merits\u201d test (which is not mandated by Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp.), the district court be required, where it has granted class certification, to make definitive findings prior to trial on the issues of \u201cpredominance\u201d and \u201csuperiority.\u201d Review might then be permitted upon a prima facie showing that the findings are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d Cf. Ecology Action v. AEC, 492 F.2d 998, 1001 (2d Cir. 1974). Such a condition would permit review without undue involvement in the merits or excessive examination of record proof. It would also allow the district judge sufficient time to determine <em>prior to trial </em>whether an action that has tentatively been accorded class action status should be decertified.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">With respect to the third requirement of the \u201ctripartite analysis,\u201d i.e., that the defendant demonstrate that the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>will cause \u201cirreparable harm to the defendant in terms of time and money spent in defending a huge class action,\u201d I take no issue except to state that the additional judicial management necessitated by prosecution of a suit as a class rather than an individual action should also be taken into consideration. Satisfaction of this condition, however phrased, will turn on the facts of the particular case presented for review. If common questions of fact do not predominate over those affecting individual members, the scope of proof, and accordingly the time, expense and resources, required to defend a class suit should be substantially greater than that required to defend an individual action, and the judicial time and energy consumed should be proportionately greater. It therefore would be a rare case where the grant of class action status would not meet this test.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Applying the foregoing considerations to this case, I would at this point in time reach the same conclusion on the issue of appealability as that reached by Judge Kaufman. Of necessity Judge Carter\u2019s conclusions on the essential elements of \u201cpredominance\u201d and \u201csuperiority\u201d had to be extremely tentative. Having virtually no facts with respect to these essential issues, he based his decision principally upon the allegations of the complaint and his speculation, despite many years of experience to the contrary, that other government units would probably bring similar suits. Under the circumstances he would have been better advised, in my view, to withhold class certification until relevant facts could be developed through pretrial discovery.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, as Judge Kaufman accurately observes, nothing prevents the district court, upon presentation of evidence, from concluding at a later point that the action must be de-certified as a class suit because common questions do not predominate. In view of that possibility, it should be recognized that we are not here confronted with a claim of a single price-fixing conspiracy or agreement in violation of \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act where, as with a charge of fraud in violation of the federal securities laws, liability can be established by proof of one set of facts common to all parties, such as a price agreement or fraudulent prospectus. The principal claim here is monopolization in violation of \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act, which presents a potential for widely varying questions of law and fact that may not, at this early stage in the proceedings have been fully appreciated.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-9\">The complaint, which is virtually a copy of a civil complaint filed by the Government years ago, charges monopolization on a nationwide scale and alleges a series of some 12 or more separate and distinct monopolization activities. GM has offered to show that the relevant facts and circumstances with respect to many members of the proposed class differ radically from those existing as to others, thus giving rise to what in effect is a series of separate relevant markets and different competitive conditions in different municipalities within the purported class. Pretrial discovery may disclose that non-federal governmental purchasers differ widely in their modes of purchase, use differing competitive bidding arrangements, purchase different types and sizes of buses (\u201ccity,\u201d \u201cintercity,\u201d and smaller sizes not manufactured by GM) and have available different competitive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>means of mass transportation (e.g., small buses, subways, trains, electric trolleys). If this proof should indicate that there was not one nationwide market as alleged in the complaint but a series of individual dissimilar relevant local markets, there would be little purpose in permitting the suit to proceed on behalf of a nationwide class of municipalities. Indeed such a suit might prove to be a chaotic affair, joining a series of individualized issues that could be resolved more efficiently in individual suits. Common questions of fact would not predominate. Evidence of GM monopolization in Atlanta or Albuquerque, which have no subways, would not be probative on the question of whether there has been monopolization in New York, which not only has subways but other competitive means of transportation, or in some smaller city which may be in a position to switch its purchases at will from GM to a competing manufacturer of smaller buses. Proof that GM may have rigged bid specifications to exclude competitiors in one city would be of questionable relevance in proving monopolization in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Under the foregoing circumstances proof adduced in an individual suit by the City of New York would be but a fraction of that presented in a suit on behalf of almost 200 municipalities. A class action would not then achieve any appreciable savings in time, expense or energy for the parties or for the court, particularly when it is doubtful that many other municipalities would think well enough of the claims to institute individual suits on their own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">For these reasons I would prefer to consider our own holding, like that of the district court, to be tentative in nature and without prejudice to consideration upon a future appeal after the district court, upon renewal of the motion by GM on the basis of the additional facts which it proposes to show, makes a more informed determination on the issue of class action status.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-13\">. The formula, which would require that the order, to be considered \u201cfinal,\u201d must (1) be \u201cfundamental to the further conduct of the case,\u201d (2) be separable from the merits, and (3) must cause irreparable harm, appears to have evolved from Judge Medina\u2019s decision in <em>Eisen III, </em>479 F.2d at 1007 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-6\">. Prior to our decision in <em>Eisen III, </em>479 F.2d 1005 (2d Cir. 1972), the only Supreme Court decision in which the \u25a0\u201cfundamentality\u201d phrase was used in considering the finality of a district court interlocutory order was Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., 379 U.S. 148, 153, 85 S.Ct. 308, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1963). There, however, the Court was dealing with an order <em>striking </em>certain claims in a wrongful death action on the ground that they could not be asserted under the Jones Act, which provided the exclusive remedy, and not with an order <em>granting </em>relief to the plaintiff. In concluding that the order was \u201cfundamental to the further conduct of the ease\u201d the Court did not suggest that the plaintiff-Administratrix might otherwise be unable to pursue her remaining Jones Act claims and then appeal from the judgment striking her claims under the Ohio survivor statute and those for the benefit of the decedent\u2019s brother and sisters. Applying a \u201cpractical construction\u201d the Court concluded that, although the appeal was \u201cpiecemeal\u201d in nature, \u201ctire eventual costs . . . will certainly be less if we now pass on the questions presented here rather than send the case back with those issues undecided,\u201d and that the long delay before those issues would otherwise be resolved \u201cmight work a great injustice.\u201d 379 U.S. 153, 85 S.Ct. 311. Thus the term \u201cfundamental to the further conduct of tire case\u201d was not intended to mean that unless review were granted the action would no longer be viable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b713-5\">. To the extent that \u201cfundamentally\u201d remains a requirement, rather than merely a consideration, in the decision as to appeala-bility, an order granting class status would ordinarily be attended by such fundamentality. In neither of the leading decisions in this area, see p. 1910, <em>supra, </em>is there even a hint of concern for the death-knell or reverse death-knell consequences of the orders being appealed. The Supreme Court was concerned with the ixractical rather than the macabre when it determined the orders to be fundamental. In United States v. General Motors, <em>supra, </em>the Court concluded that a ruling excluding proof of certain items of damage was fundamental to the further conduct of a condemnation proceeding and so appealable. In <em>Gillespie </em>the Court reasoned tliat an order striking certain claims in a Jones Act complaint was likewise fundamental and axipealable. These orders were fundamental because they would in an elemental way affect the course and outcome of the case. In tliat sense it would be difficult\u2019 to imagine an order more fundamental to the conduct of a case than one which certifies a class action. I have sketched above some of the tactical and strategic consequences of a class order. The parties i&gt;ut so much the better xxart of their effort into the work of seeking or opposing the class order precisely because they appreciate these consequences. If the word \u201cfundamental\u201d is to mean anything, it surely must encompass an order of class certification which so dramatically affects the course and {'onduct of a case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b714-5\">. Judge Bonsai, however, did imply that the existence of a stockholders\u2019 protective committee made it likely that unless class action status was granted more individual suits would be brought, see 293 F.Supp. at 171.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b714-6\">. Even assuming that the trial judge \u201ctentatively\u201d declares that a suit may be maintained as a class action, he certainly should be required to make his final determination of that issue prior to trial. Otherwise the uncertainty as to his ultimate ruling on the issue could reduce the trial to a shambles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b715-6\">. Rule 23 requires that the court make the class action determination \u201cas soon as practicable after the commencement of an action brought as a class action,\u201d which is a flexible term. The Manual for Complex Litigation \u00a7 1.40 at 10 (1973), argues that an early determination of this question is necessary. The cases cited by the Manual for this proposition in fact lend little or no support to the idea. And to the extent that the Manual\u2019s recommendation derives from a concern for the effect of a statute of limitations upon absent members, we need only note that the Supreme Court has now put that fear to rest.
