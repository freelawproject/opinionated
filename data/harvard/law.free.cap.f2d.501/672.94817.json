Citizens Casualty Company of New York et al., 5 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b727-8\">AINSWORTH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">Reserve Private David White brought this action against the Secretary of the Army and White\u2019s Reserve Company Commander, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief from an order directing White to enter involuntarily upon active duty in the Army due to unsatisfactory performance of his Reserve duties. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of relief from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">White was notified on August 5, 1972, by his Company Commander, Captain Robert L. Carlyle, to prepare for involuntary active duty for a period of eighteen months and seven days because of his absence without authority from annual active duty training during the period July 22, 1972 to August 5, 1972. Appellant concedes that there was a sufficient factual basis for the Army\u2019s decision here that there was no valid medical excuse for White\u2019s absence from summer camp. The crux of White\u2019s appeal is that the order to report for involuntary active duty was nonetheless void because the Army failed to follow its own regulations in determining that White should be ordered to active duty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-14\">Two provisions of Army Regulation [AR] 135-91 are relevant to this dispute. AR 135-91, H5(d)(3), C 8 (Aug. 28, 1970), defined \u201csatisfactory participation\u201d in Reserve activities (such as would avoid involuntary activation) to include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-15\">Attendance at and satisfactory completion of annual training (AT), unless \u25a0 excused by proper authority as provided herein, or the member fails to attend or satisfactorily complete AT for reasons that are <em>not </em>within his control. (Emphasis in original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aer-dedup-0\">AR 135-91, [[11(b)(1), C 9 (April 8, 1971) read in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agu-dedup-0\">11. Unexcused absences from annual training. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-16\">b. The following procedures will apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-17\">(1) The commander (unit or CO, US A AC) <em>will determine </em>if the member was notified in sufficient time to comply, and whether or not emergency or cogent reasons existed for his absence. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aix-dedup-0\">Synthesizing the regulations, it is apparent that they required Capt. Carlyle to \u201cdetermine\u201d that Reserve Private White\u2019s absence was for reasons \u201cwithin his [White\u2019s] control\u201d before the Captain' concluded that White\u2019s absence from annual training was unexcused and that involuntary activation was indicated. White claims that Capt. Carlyle did not make the determination required by the regulations prior to issuing the notice to prepare for active duty because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>\u201che made no inquiry of Reserve Private White himself, or conducted anything like an adequate investigation in order to make the necessary determination.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">It is generally accepted that federal courts should decline invitations to review the discretionary rulings of the military. <em>See, e. g., </em>Orloff v. Willoughby, 1953, 345 U.S. 83, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842; O\u2019Mara v. Zebrowski, 3 Cir., 1971, 447 F.2d 1085, 1087 and cases cited. Nonetheless; where the military takes action against a serviceman, and that action is governed by applicable regulations, the military must adhere to its own regulations in taking such action. Antonuk v. United States, 6 Cir., 1971, 445 F.2d 592, 595; Schatten v. United States, 6 Cir., 1969, 419 F.2d 187, 191; Smith v. Resor, 2 Cir., 1969, 406 F.2d 141, 146; <em>cf. </em>United States v. Joseph G. Moretti, Inc., 5 Cir., 1973, 478 F.2d 418, 425. \u201cWhen [military] regulations prescribe specific steps to be taken to insure due process they must be substantially observed.\u201d Friedberg v. Resor, 2 Cir., 1971, 453 F.2d 935, 938. Thus, we may properly require of Capt. Carlyle and the Army a \u201cdetermination,\u201d that is, a good faith review of White\u2019s record and a consideration of the surrounding facts and circumstances, prior to White\u2019s involuntary activation.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">On this record, Capt. Carlyle clearly made a proper determination as required by AR 135-91. Before making his decision, Capt. Carlyle was aware that White had been attempting to obtain a medical discharge from the service, that White had taken a physical examination only eleven days before summer camp which showed him to be medically qualified for military service, that White had signed a statement acknowledging his obligation to attend annual training less than two weeks before the summer camp session began, that White had failed to appear for summer camp as required, that White knew he was subject to involuntary activation if he did not satisfactorily perform his Reserve obligation, that White had been contacted by a member of Capt. Carlyle\u2019s staff about his absence, that White had stated he was not going to summer camp because he had a discharge due him, and that White had not contacted his commanding officer to give any \u201cemergency or cogent reasons\u201d for his absence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To require, notwithstanding all this, that Capt. Carlyle secure additional information, speak with White personally, or undertake some kind of formalized invest\u00ed-' gation would be to revise substantially the meaning of AR-135-91. It would be an improper, <em>ad hoc </em>construction of procedural niceties for a court to say the Army should have done things differently here. Holding the Army to its own regulations is one thing; imputing unnecessary procedural prerequisites into a regulation is something entirely different. As the Supreme Court said in Or-loff v. Willoughby, <em>supra, </em>\u201c[J]udges are not given the task of running the Army.\u201d 345 U.S. at 93, 73 S.Ct. at 540, 97 L.Ed. at 849. There was clearly a \u25a0proper basis for ordering the active duty sanction, and thus the decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-11\">. White also asserts that the trial court erred in denying his motion for taking additional testimony and for reconsideration. The only evidence introduced by White in support of this motion was a letter dated Sept. 28, which was introduced into evidence at the first trial but which White\u2019s present counsel was not aware of until after the hearing before the district court. Since no substantial new evidence was proffered to the trial court, it did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-6\">. White did subsequently attempt to speak with Capt. 'Carlyle, an attempt which the Captain rebuffed. However, this occurred only <em>after </em>White was alerted for involuntary active duty because of his failure to submit a cogent excuse for his nonparticipation in summer camp.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
