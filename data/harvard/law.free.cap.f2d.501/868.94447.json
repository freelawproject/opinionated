The Board\u2019s Order of March 28, 1973<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> held that the conduct of Intervenor Southern Frozen Foods, Inc. (\u201cthe Company\u201d) during an organization campaign conducted by Petitioner Laborers\u2019 District Council of Georgia and South Carolina, Affiliated With Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America, AFL-CIO (\u201cthe Union\u201d) did not violate \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the reasons stated below we affirm the decision of the Board and deny the Petition to Review.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">The Company operates two frozen food vegetable processing plants in Montezuma, Georgia, which average 650 employees. In October, 1971, the Union filed a petition with the Board seeking to represent the Company\u2019s production and maintenance employees. An election, held in December, 1971, resulted in 310 votes for the Union, 20 votes for an intervening union, and 304 votes for \u201cno union.\u201d No one choice on the ballot having received a majority, the Board directed that a runoff election be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-19\">Prior to the runoff election the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Board, alleging that the Company had violated \u00a7 8(a)(1). In the runoff election, held January 22, 1973, the Union again failed to gain a majority of votes cast.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Union filed objections to the election, however, the representation case was severed and remanded to the Board\u2019s Regional Director before the instant unfair labor practice case was sent to the Board for decision <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and there are no representation issues before us for review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-20\">A hearing was held May 3-4, 1972, and the Administrative Law Judge found, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Company had violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) by distributing certain campaign literature to its employees between November 3, 1971 and January 27, 1972. The A.L.J. also found that a certain speech from the management supervisor to several employees violated the Act. Lastly, he found that one employee was threatened with discharge because of her union activities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-21\">The Board on review, found: 1) that with one exception <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Company\u2019s literature was a permissable exercise of free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>speech and not violative of the Act; 2) that the supervisor\u2019s remarks did not violate the Act; and 3) that the employee was not unlawfully threatened.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The Union now petitions for review asserting that the Board committed error in finding that the Company had not violated \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act in the various ways enumerated above. We will treat each alleged violation separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">A. <em>Campaign Literature</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">The organization campaign was characterized by the Board as \u201ca heated campaign typified by sharp conflicts of interests.\u201d 202 NLRB No. 92 at 9. Both sides actively campaigned, distributing much printed material in the form of leaflets, letters, posters, and crudely drawn pictorial appeals which for want of a better name may be called \u201ccartoons.\u201d Of all the material circulated by the Company, four items are of particular importance: a letter from the Company president to all employees dated January 5, 1972 ;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a similar letter dated January 14, 1972 ;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a third letter dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>January 24, 1972 ;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and a cartoon distributed January 21, 1972.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Administrative Law Judge found specifically that these individual items</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b926-4\">. were not predictions \u201ccarefully phrased on the basis of objective fact to convey an employer\u2019s belief as to demonstrably probable consequences beyond his control.\u201d Rather they directly conveyed that Respondent would \u201ctake action solely on [its] own initiative for reasons unrelated to economic necessities and known only to [it]\u201d to resist demands for changes that Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>spondent might make in the absence of a union and leave the Union with a strike as its only alternative carrying with it the probable result of loss of jobs or a plant shutdown. The conclusion follows that Respondent intended \u201cto threaten to throw employees out of work regardless of the economic realities,\u201d if the Union won the election. I find that Respondent\u2019s written communications to its employees during the pre-election period violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act as alleged in the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">J.A. I. at 28 (citations omitted). As to the bulk of other items distributed by the Company, the Administrative Law Judge found that \u201cthe express content of [the above enumerated letters] was not repeated in [the Company\u2019s] other literature, but the campaign literature otherwise served only to reinforce them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The Board, in its review of the whole campaign, focused on the aforementioned four communications upon which the A.L.J. had relied to find specific unlawful Company threats of reprisal. The Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-7\">In our view, a reading of the entire record does not support the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s conclusion that the above-mentioned pieces of literature distributed on January 14, 21, and 24, along with others, constituted a threat that Respondent would throw its employees out of work regardless of the economic realities if the Union won the election. Respondent\u2019s communications at most represent one side of a heated campaign typified by sharp conflicts of interests. We note that from time to time the Union replied in an equally vigorous, partisan, and aggressive manner. Accordingly, we find on the basis of the totality of the campaign that with the exception of the January 5, 1972 letter Respondent\u2019s literature did not contain unlawful threats of retaliation if the Union were selected to represent the employees but rather were recitals of Respondent\u2019s beliefs regarding demonstrable economic consequences which could possibly flow from unionization. As such, the statements are protected by Section 8(c) of the Act. Accordingly, we shall dismiss the complaint except as it relates to the January 5 letter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">202 NLRB No. 92 at 9-10. Section 8(c), the provision relied upon by the Board reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-11\">(c) The expressing of any views, argument, or opinion, or the dissemination thereof, whether in written, printed, graphic, or visual form, shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair labor practice under any of the provisions of this Act, if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">The Union here argues simply that the A.L.J.\u2019s findings were correct and that the \u201cBoard erred grievously in reversing [the A.L.J.\u2019s] conclusions . ,\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Union states that in its communications, the Company \u201crepeatedly stressed the likelihood of the plant closing in the event of unionization, although it did absolutely nothing to demonstrate any objective basis for this prediction.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Union does not, however, direct us to <em>any specific </em>language from company letters, leaflets, or cartoons by which to illustrate threats or coercion on the part of the Company. We therefore take it that the Union here reasserts the views of the A.L.J. as to which specific company communications were unlawful, and shall review the findings of the Board as to those specific items.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>It is well established that an employer has a right to express his opinions and to predict unfavorable eonse-v quences which he believes may result from union representation. Such predictions or opinions will not violate the Act if they have some reasonable basis in fact and are in fact predictions or opinions and not veiled threats of employer retaliation. In NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969) the Court enumerated the standards to be used in evaluating an employer\u2019s pre-election statements.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-4\">But we do note that an employer\u2019s free speech right to communicate his views to his employees is firmly established and cannot be infringed by a union or the Board. Thus, \u00a7 8(c) (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c)) merely implements the First Amendment by requiring that the expression of \u201cany views, argument, or opinion\u201d shall not be \u201cevidence of an unfair labor practice,\u201d so long as such expression contains \u201cno threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit\u201d in violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-5\">Thus, an employer is free to communicate to his employees any <em>of </em>his general views about unionism or any of his specific views about a particular union, so long as the communications do not contain a \u201cthreat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\u201d He may even make a prediction as to the precise effects he believes unionization will have on his company. In such a case, however, the prediction must be carefully phrased on the basis of objective fact to convey an employer\u2019s belief as to demonstrably probable consequences beyond his control or to convey a management decision already arrived at to close the plant in case of unionization. ... If there is any implication that an employer may or may not take action solely on his own initiative for reasons unrelated to economic necessities and known only to him, the statement is no longer a reasonable prediction based on available facts but a threat of retaliation based on misrepresentation and coercion, and as such without the protection of the First Amendment. [A]n employer is free only to tell \u201cwhat he reasonably believes will be the likely economic consequences of unionization that are outside his control,\u201d and not \u201cthreats of economic reprisal to be taken solely on his own volition.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">395 U.S. at 617-619, 89 S.Ct. at 1941 (citations omitted). <em>See also </em>Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America v. NLRB, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 330, 424 F.2d 818 (1970); NLRB v. Lenkurt Electric Company, 438 F.2d 1102 (9th Cir. 1971); Automation &amp; Measurement Division, Bendix Corp. v.

NLRB, 124 U.S.App.D.C. 289, 364 F.2d 682 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-13\">Turning first to the letter of January 24, 1972,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> there is substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that it carries no threats or coercive language. It begins by encouraging all employees to vote. It mentions the honor and honesty of the author, \u201cthe importance of keeping his word\u201d to his employees. The letter makes an appeal to loyalty, stressing that the employees and the Company will share equally in both the good and the bad which may come in the future. It continues to the effect that the Company has helped its employees in the past and will, pledges the author, continue to do its very best for them in the future. The only slightly aggressive language is the request \u201cdon\u2019t let an outsider change all of that.\u201d We must ascertain whether this let<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>ter has an apparent tendency to coerce<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> when viewed in the context of a labor relations setting.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In our view, there is substantial evidence to support the finding of the Board<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that the letter indicates the Company. intended to continue its past policy of caring about its employees and that by so doing, it would try to give employees more than would the Union. The Board reasonably concluded that the letter contains no express or implied threats of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The letter of January 14, 1972,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> states that the Union would require dues; that the Company did not have to agree to any Union proposal; that the Union may have to strike; that strikers could be replaced; that the Company had already granted all wage increases permitted under the wage price guidelines then in effect. The letter then stated that other Union plants had experienced strikes and that \u201cwe know of some customers we would lose if the Union caused us to up our prices.\u201d Finally the letter referred to \u201cwhat has happened at Seabrook,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> a reference to a reduction in work force at another Sea-brook-owned plant in New Jersey following the imposition of union work restrictions concerning the simultaneous handling of fresh and frozen foods. These Union rules resulted in a work reduction in New Jersey and a transfer of work to Southern\u2019s Georgia plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">We believe that the Board was correct when it found that the letter of January 14, 1972 was not a threat that the Company would remove employees from the job regardless of economic realities should the Union prevail. The letter contained statements which the Board could find not coercive and which the employer had a right to state.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The reference to the possibility of a strike was a reference to possible <em>union </em>action, not Company action, and thus is protected by 8(c) since it had a reasonable basis in fact.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The reference to \u201csome customers\u201d who would be lost if prices were increased was not a prediction of business disaster as it did not identify those customers as significant to the Company.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Indeed the Company had consistently predicted full production.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The letter\u2019s reference to the \u201cSeabrook\u201d incident was a factually accurate statement. In sum, we believe the record amply supports the finding that these employer statements were based on objective facts and conveyed the Company\u2019s reasonable belief as to possible economic consequences of unionization beyond the Company\u2019s control. <em>See Gissel, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918; NLRB v. Lenkurt Electric Company, 438 F.2d 1102 (9th Cir. 1971); NLRB v. River Togs, Inc., 382 F.2d 198 (2d Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-15\">Turning finally to the cartoon of January 21, 1972,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> we believe that there exists substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s finding that the \u201cclosed\u201d sign on the plant depicted in one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>six drawings does not constitute a serious threat that the Company would close <em>in retaliation for a union vote. </em>This is especially true since the Company specifically stated its desire to \u201cuse [the plant] to the fullest\u201d regardless of the election\u2019s outcome.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> At the most, the \u201cclosed\u201d sign could be read as the result of the \u201cfight\u201d <em>(i. e. </em>strike) which unionization might precipitate; it does not represent a threat to close the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">B. <em>Speech by Mr. Kato Harvey</em></p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Mr. Kato Harvey was assistant manager of the Company\u2019s poly-repack<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> department. Several times during the several pre-election periods he spoke to the workers in his department. Both the complaint and evidence received focus upon the last of Mr. Harvey\u2019s speeches, the exact date of which is unknown.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The testimony concerning the contents of the speech was confused and conflicting,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and the A.L.J. chose to credit Mr. Harvey\u2019s recollection of the speech while discrediting the testimony of other witnesses.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">The A.L.J. found and the Board accepted the following: Mr. Harvey told the employees that he worked as a supervisor and therefore that he \u201chad to be for the Company.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> He expressed his wish that they would feel the same. He stated his belief that Company employees generally did \u201call right\u201d and thay they would continue to do so without a union.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> He also spoke about the possibility of the loss of the poly-repack turnip packaging operation. Previously, this packaging had been done at the parent company\u2019s New Jersey plant but a union contract concerning the handling of mixed fresh and frozen produce caused the work to moved to this Company\u2019s plant. Mr. Harvey testified concerning his remarks as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-13\">Q. All right. So was there anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-14\">A. Anything else I told them ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-15\">Q. Right. At that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-16\">A. Well I told them about the \u2014 together were putting up about seventy-eight million pounds of turnips with roots and so that that handline was doing about seventy-five percent of them. And also I thought if they cut that out, that was sort of hurt their jobs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-17\">Q. What do you mean \u201cif they cut that out,\u201d Mr. Harvey ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-18\">A. If they cutting out putting up turnips with roots in the poly repack, they wouldn\u2019t have much to do, wouldn\u2019t stay in business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-19\">Q. Had anything happened that made you think they might cut out the roots ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-20\">A. Well I was told that they were putting up turnips with roots up at Seabrook Farms and also \u2014 and also if the Union come in, they may cut that out at Southern Frozen Foods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-21\">J.A. I. at 104-05.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-22\">A. So I told the people that worked in my department they had enough turnip roots for three weeks, I mean they behind. And if they cut that out, they was cutting their job and so that mean that why they not putting the turnip roots at Seabrook the time the Union come in. And I figure if the Union come in here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>that\u2019ll come out with your work. That\u2019s what I meant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-4\">Trial Examiner: That\u2019s what you said to the people ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-5\">The Witness: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s what I said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-6\">Q. (By Mr. Currie) Did you give any explanation of how or why the union cut out the turnip roots at Sea-brook ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-7\">A. Well they said they didn\u2019t allow them to mix together like we was doing down here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-8\">Q. Didn\u2019t allow them to mix them together.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-9\">A. Yes, sir, like we was doing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-10\">J.A. I. at 109.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-11\">Q. (By Trial Examiner) Well did you say anything about why the turnips would be cut off or when the turnips would be cut off ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-12\">A. I didn\u2019t say' they was gonna be cut off, I say if they be cut off. I didn\u2019t say that they was, I say they had been cut off in Seabrook. We was putting up Seabrook\u2019s turnips for them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">J.A. I. at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">The record further revealed, and the Board found, that on January 10, 1972, the Company mailed a letter to all employees which contained a reference to the job reductions at Seabrook, New Jersey. It read in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-15\">At the New Jersey plant the company is restricted from running frozen and fresh vegetables together. They don\u2019t run turnips and greens as we do. If we were restricted like this, we would not run the 7,500,000 pounds of turnips and greens we ran in 1971. Think how many hours of work and jobs would be lost. Also, if the union by unreasonable demands caused us to stop running any particular products, we would have to permanently lay off people. What would this do to you? We know the men could probably travel to other towns for jobs, but what jobs could the women get?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-20\">J.A. II. at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-21\">On the basis of this evidence, the A.L. J. concluded that Mr. Harvey\u2019s remarks \u201cconveyed a threat of reprisal and violated Section [8] (a)(1) of the Act.\u201d <footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The Judge stated his reasons for this finding to be that Mr. Harvey\u2019s remarks were \u201cnot a reasoned and factual statement of what had happened in New Jersey\u201d <footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and that the remarks implied that if the Union were to prevail, the poly-repack operation might be lost \u201cfor reasons unrelated to the economic necessities or any contract the Union might negotiate.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The A.L.J. did not accept the proposition that the January 10 letter dispelled or nullified any possible threat contained in Mr. Harvey\u2019s speech because the letter did not mention Mr. Harvey\u2019s remarks and did not fully explain the work restrictions.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXZ\">The Board found that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-22\">In our view, Harvey\u2019s remarks are ambiguous and do not clearly imply a threat that a union victory would automatically be followed by a loss of employment. Harvey\u2019s statements especially when taken together with Respondent\u2019s January 10, 1972, letter, do nothing more than raise the possibility that if the Union came in it could conceivably restrict Respondent the way it had restricted the parent company in New Jersey, with the result that the turnips would be packed elsewhere. Considering the totality of statements concerning the turnip operation, we are not prepared to say that Respondent\u2019s communications threatened employees with loss of employment. Accordingly, we find such remarks permissible and not violative of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-23\">202 NLRB No. 92 at 7.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>We believe that the decision of the Board was a permissible one, supported by substantial evidence. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951). In so holding, we again recognize that the Board\u2019s findings must be accorded great weight because they carry the \u201cauthority of an expertness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488, 71 S.Ct. 456. We recognize that it is the Board\u2019s duty \u201cin the first instance to judge the impact of utterances made in the context of the employer-employee relationship.\u201d <em>Gissel, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 620, 89 S.Ct. at 1943.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> We believe the Board could correctly find that Mr. Harvey's remarks when considered with the Company\u2019s January 10th letter did no more than suggest the possibility that a Union victory could result in work restrictions leading to the loss of employment. This is what occurred in the New Jersey plant after unionization.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Therefore we find that these predictions were \u201ccarefully phrased on the basis of objective fact to convey [a Company] belief as to demonstrably probable consequences beyond [its] control . . .\u201d and are thus lawful under <em>Gissel, supra, </em>395 U.S. at 618, 89 S.Ct. 1942.

About a week prior to the first election, Ms. Butler was summoned to the office of the department supervisor, Mr. Kato Harvey. There, with Mr. Harvey present, Mr. Studdard, Company Personnel Director, informed Ms. Butler that there had been complaints <footnotemark>42</footnotemark> about her \u201crunning her mouth on the line about the Union.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Mr. Studdard told Ms. Butler that he did not care how she felt about the Union, that she could talk about it on her break time or her lunch time, but not on the line during working periods. Mr. Studdard informed her that if her behavior occasioned similar complaints in the future, she would be dismissed.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b932-10\">The A.L.J., after making these findings of fact, found that Ms. Butler \u201cwas warned only against talking about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Union during working time and threatened with discharge should she again do that.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> In so doing, he rejected Ms. Butler\u2019s contention that the warning was against any pro-union conversation anywhere within the plant at any time. The A.L.J. found a violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1) of the Act because Ms. Butler was threatened with discharge not for the purpose of prohibiting her talking in general during working time, but to stop her from talking about the Union in particular.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">The Board disagreed with the legal consequences of the facts as found by the A.L.J. The Board stated in this regard :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-6\">The evidence shows, and the Administrative Law Judge found, that Stud-dard\u2019s warning to Butler followed a conversation Studdard had with Trice on the previous day wherein Trice informed him that Butler\u2019s talking about the Union while working was disturbing another employee who had complained and did not want to hear about the Union. While there is no evidence that any other employees who were regularly told to stop talking were threatened with discharge for failure to comply, there is no evidence that their talking had interfered with the work of others. Since Butler\u2019s talking prompted a complaint from a fellow worker, Respondent could for legitimate business reasons have required that she stop talking during worktime. Studdard\u2019s warning referred only to worktime and made it clear that at other times Butler was free to talk about the Union. As there is no evidence that would otherwise indicate discriminatory enforcement of Respondent\u2019s prohibition against talking while at work, we shall dismiss this allegation of the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-15\">202 NLRB No. 92 at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-16\">We think that the Board\u2019s findings are reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. Ms. Butler was clearly assured that she could speak out for the Union at all times and in all places other than the production line. We agree with the Board that an employer can make and enforce \u201creasonable rules covering the conduct of employees on company time. Working time is for work.\u201d <footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The Company has such a rule against talking on the job <footnotemark>48</footnotemark> and absent proof of discriminatory anti-union application, it is a lawful rule.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The Company had a legitimate interest in stopping Ms. Butler\u2019s pro-union comments on the line when other employees had made complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-17\">For the reasons stated above we find that the Petition to Review was properly denied.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The order here under review is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"ANmQ\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-9\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f) (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b924-10\">.

The polling places will be the same as before.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">The time has come for us to talk turkey. We know we need to make some changes, and we will once we get this union mess out of the way. The plain facts are the union can not do anything for you to make this a better place to work or get you more money.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">Put yourself in our position: If you have a friend who is appreciative of what you try to do for him and another who makes demands \u2014 which one of them are you going to help the most? The answer is obvious \u2014 we are human the same as you are. If we are going to continue to grow and maintain our operation providing jobs in Montezuma, we must have your help. You probably have not looked at the company\u2019s side of the situation \u2014 but you should. Believe me, what is good for the company is good for you. Having a union would not be good for the company \u2014 so it can not be good for you.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">The best thing you can do \u2014 if your future is here in Montezuma and you plan on making a career working for Southern Frozen Foods \u2014 is to vote this union out of here once and for all. When that is done all of us can get back to the business at hand \u2014 trying to make a profit which is where whatever benefits you and I enjoy come from.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-18\">If you have any question about what has been said above or anything else pertaining to this company or your situation, ask me, your supervisor, or your department head.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-19\">Sincerely,</p>\n<p id=\"b925-20\">/s/ Preston Preston Williams President</p>\n<p id=\"b925-21\">J.A.

The rules keep us from visiting your home. We can only write you or talk to you at the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-26\">You do not now pay union dues. You are now receiving yearly wage reviews and including your fringe benefits. The Union wants you to pay $6.50 a month in dues. What will they guarantee you for your money?</p>\n<p id=\"b925-27\">If they give you a promise or guarantee, how can they carry it out? Your Company doesn\u2019t <em>have </em>to agree to anything the Union proposes. We won\u2019t agree to anything we feel is bad for you or the Company. The only thing the Union can do about it is try to force us by a strike. If you strike we have the right to replace you. Strikes only happen in Union plants. The Union would have to get you an extra $6.50 a month for you to even break even. Your Company has given all the raise Phase 2 of the wage freeze allows. No one knows when the freeze will end. We appreciate your help in making the Company what it is. We feel that we would never do more for Mr. Bartlett than we would do for you voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"Afn_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>Several people have asked why we are against the Union. We are against the Union because we know they can wreck the Company and reduce the number of jobs. We have all seen what has happened at Seabrook. We don\u2019t want that here. We don\u2019t know of a single plant where more jobs have been created by a union. We don\u2019t know a single customer that the Union can get us. We do know of some customers we would lose if the Union caused us to up our prices.</p>\n<p id=\"A9kd\">Mr. Bartlett doesn\u2019t care about layoffs. Union dues are only paid by the people working.

Any good fortunes and successes the Company has should cause you to experience a new sense of joy since you will share in that success through our being in position to do more for you.

Each of us has a responsibility to be concerned \u2014 I am \u2014 and I hope you are.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-17\">We all have our faults and certainly we have all experienced many failures. No one is kidding me and I don\u2019t want someone else to try to kid you into believing that what the union is offering is better than my intents \u2014 which have been proven. We need each other \u2014 the way our system is today my help is always available \u2014 don\u2019t let an outsider change all of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-18\">Those of you who are wise, and I honestly feel most of you are, will gratefully accept the concerned efforts of those who really care about you. This is a day when we cannot make it alone. We should be grateful for the unselfish concern of those around us who are not looking to profit at our expense but help solely because they care and are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-19\">Concern, however, is not enough unless we intend to give ourselves in a real and positive program seeking solution to these problems.

AVe are of the opinion - that the existence of but one violation of \u00a7 8(a)(1) is not the exceptional case where employer unfair labor practices were outrageous or pervasive. There is a broad presumption in favor of the remedy chosen by the Board. Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U.S. 177, 61 S.Ct. 845, 85 L. Ed. 845 (1941) ; NLRB v. Rutter Rex Mfg. Co., 396 U.S. 258, 90 S.Ct. 417, 24 L.Ed.2d 405 (1969) ; International Union, United Auto, A. &amp; A. I. Workers v. NLRB, 147 U. S.App.D.C. 289, 455 F.2d 1357 (1971). Given the limited scope of the Company\u2019s unfair labor practice, we think the remedy granted was entirely proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
