The shipments were received without exception by the consignee. Defendant shipper has paid the amount that Consolidated originally quoted to it for the shipments, $2,455.78, but denies Consolidated\u2019s right to recover the additional charges, which are based on \u201ccorrected\u201d bills calculated under a different, higher tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-19\">The district court ruled in favor of Consolidated. The court\u2019s opinion in its entirety reads: \u201cAfter careful consideration of the stipulation of facts, arguments and authorities, the Court finds that the plaintiff is entitled to judgment in the amount of $5,165.00, plus interest.\u201d Forty-Eight Insulations has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-4\">The freight charges listed in Consolidated\u2019s first bills, which amounts the Shipper relied upon in negotiating a contract with its customer, had been computed from the Middlewest Motor Freight Bureau Tariff 50-B, MF-ICC 516 (the \u201cMidwest Tariff\u201d). Item 130 of that tariff states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-5\">\n<em>\u201cGeneral Application of Rates\u201d</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-6\">\u201cThe rates published herein <em>apply only </em>from points of origin to points of destination <em>named </em>and <em>may not be used as factors in computing combination rates </em>from or to origins or destination <em>not named.\u201d </em>(Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1455-7\">Item 281-A, entitled <em>\u201cRates From or To Unnamed Points,\u201d </em>modifies this provision. Part 1 defines the key terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-8\">\u201c(c) An \u2018UNNAMED\u2019 point is one from or to which class rates are not provided, other than by use of this rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1455-9\">\u201c(d) A \u2018NAMED\u2019 point is one from or to which class rates are provided in this tariff (or in tariffs governed hereby), other than by use of this rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1455-10\">Part 2 of Item 281 \u2014 A provides for using the nearest named point of origin or destination where the unnamed point is located on a highway between named points. Part 3 provides for adding an arbitrary rate based on the distance in miles of the unnamed point from or to the nearest named point when the unnamed point is not located between named points. Item 281-A also includes an exception clause: \u201c(a) The provisions of this item will not apply from or to unnamed points in Canada.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-15\">Consolidated, upon reinvestigation, concluded that it had erred in quoting to defendant shipper rates based upon the Midwest Tariff. It subsequently recomputed the freight charges in accordance with the Rocky Mountain Tariff. Under that schedule, the shipping costs came to $7,620.78, or $5,165.00 more than the sum previously calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-17\">In its answer to Consolidated\u2019s complaint, Shipper advanced various defenses, some of which might have prevailed if proven. On appeal, however, the primary thrust of the defense is that Consolidated\u2019s error was one of misrouting rather than one of misquotation of rates, a distinction which has received judicial recognition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Shipper contends that if Consolidated had initially given it full and accurate information, it would have shipped the goods to Edmonton, a port of entry for customs inspection of commodities entering the province of Alberta and a \u201cnamed point\u201d under the Midwest Tariff, and then transshipped them from Edmonton to South Beaver Hill Lake, sixty miles west, under the inexpensive local Canadian rate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The total freight costs would have been considerably less than those derived from the Rocky Mountain Tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>In accordance with this viewpoint, defendant formulates the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-4\">\u201cWas it proper for plaintiff to so route these shipments as to incur a tariff rate of $5,165.00 for the 60 miles from Edmonton to South Beaver Hill Lake, Alberta, Canada, or should plaintiffs have routed said shipments to be transshipped that distance at the local Canadian tariff rate of $165.-26?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1456-5\">For this defense, Shipper relies upon Hewitt-Robins, Inc. v. Eastern Freight-Ways, Inc., 371 U.S. 84, 83 S.Ct. 157, 9 L.Ed.2d 142 (1962), and Johnson Machine Works, Inc. v. Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R. R., 297 F.2d 793 (8th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-6\">The simple, and dispositive, answer to this contention is that Shipper arranged to ship the merchandise to South Beaver Hill Lake and not to Edmonton. No misrouting question is involved, only one of the applicable rate. The rate quoted was erroneous because there was only one correct rate for the shipments to South Beaver Hill Lake, and that was contained in the Rocky Mountain Tariff and not in the Midwest Tariff.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under well-established authority, a carrier has no choice but to seek to recover the correct amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-7\">In argument to this court, Shipper contends that the carrier should have informed Shipper that it could have designated Edmonton as the consignment point and that independent arrangements could then have been made for a further shipment at the local rate from Edmonton to South Beaver Hill Lake. What might have been, as opposed to what in fact was, is frequently the basis of lawsuits, but in the absence of a duty it is an infirm basis. While we are unaware of any rule prohibiting Consolidated from volunteering this information, if the quoting agent was aware of it, which appears doubtful, we are equally unaware of any duty on the carrier to suggest a shorter haul than to the point to which the consignor stated the goods were to go. <em>Cf. </em>Kentner Truck Line, Inc. v. Maier Brewing Company, 183 Cal.App.2d 89, 6 Cal.Rptr. 572, 575 (1960) (duty to specify size of shipments so as to secure a more favorable rate), and Montpelier &amp; Wells River R. R. v. Caldbeck-Cosgrove Corp., 110 Vt. 390, 8 A.2d 681, 682 (1939) (duty to specify a competitor line to the same destination.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-11\">The present case, being therefore simply one of misquotation of the applicable rate to a particular designation, falls within the established law to which we have adverted. That law which may produce, and frequently has produced, harsh results is not founded on any principles of equity but on an overriding public policy, the necessity of eliminating discriminatory treatment between various shippers. The policy \u201cis so strong that the courts almost universally hold that it is not a defense to an action by a carrier to recover the full rate after a mistaken undercharge that the carrier had originally informed the shipper that the rate was somewhat less than it is presently seeking to recover.\u201d Annot., Carrier \u2014 Understatement of Charges, 88 A.L.R.2d 1375, 1377 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-12\">Accordingly, we hold that Consolidated is entitled to recover the balance due under the Rocky Mountain Tariff. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1454-12\">. Tlie district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337 and the Interstate Commerce Act, esp. Part II, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301-326. <em>See </em>Madler v. Artoe, 494 F.2d 323 (7th Cir. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1455-11\">. Even though a carrier misquotes the rate applicable to a particular shipment and adherence to the correct tariff would cause the shipper hardship, the carrier must collect the amount due under the authorized schedules. See 49 TJ.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 316(d) and 317(b), and e. <em>g., </em>National Van Lines, Inc. v. United States, 355 F.2d 326, 331 (7th Cir. 1966). Further, all properly authorized tariff rules and regulations published by the carriers automatically become part of the contract between the carrier and the shipper. Eastern Motor Express, Inc. v. A. Maschmeijer, Jr., Inc., 247 F.2d 826, 828 (2d Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 959, 78 S.Ct. 535, 2 L.Ed.2d 534 (1958). The purpose of these rules is to prevent discrimination or preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-18\">In contrast, a shipper may be relieved from the consequences of misrouting by the carrier. See Hewitt-Robins, Inc. v. Eastern Freight-Ways, Inc., 371 U.S. 84, 83 S.Ct. 157, 9 L.Ed.2d 142 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1455-19\">.
