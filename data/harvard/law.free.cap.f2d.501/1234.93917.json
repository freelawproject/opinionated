Carter, /., on two counts of distributing and possessing (with intent to distribute) cocaine, and conspiring to do so. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A), 846; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. On February 14, 1974, the judge sentenced each defendant to a three year term of imprisonment on count 1, execution of which was suspended except for six months, and three years of probation on count 2. On appeal, defendants press various claims of error. For reasons stated below, we reverse Frattini\u2019s conviction but affirm as to Cardile.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-17\">The charges involved here stem from a government agent\u2019s purchase of 56.35 grams of cocaine from Floyd M. Parton, a co-defendant who pleaded guilty to one count prior to trial and testified for the Government against appellants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The prosecution\u2019s theory of the case \u2014 supported chiefly by testimony from the agent, Douglas Driver, and Parton \u2014 was that Parton functioned as middleman between appellants and the buyer, exchanging the drugs conveyed by the former for the purchase money ($1,700) provided by the latter. According to the Government\u2019s opening statement as well as Parton\u2019s evidence, Cardile was the one who actually supplied the drugs to Parton. Frattini participated in the transaction by negotiating with Parton and accepting the payment from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-18\"> During the trial, the judge allowed into evidence \u2014 over Frattini\u2019s objection \u2014 Government Exhibit Nine, a chemist\u2019s report on the cocaine bought by Agent Driver. Aside from the chemical analysis, signed by the chemist, the document contained a notation above the signature of Agent Driver that the material submitted for testing was received by defendant Parton</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-19\">from one John Doe # 1 (believed to be Theodore Frattini) who was parked in front of the Diner [where the sale took place] in a 1968 yellow Chrysler bearing N.Y. registration XT 1417.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-20\">On appeal, Frattini contends that this statement was inadmissible hearsay,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the introduction of which was error; we agree, and accordingly reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>This case is governed by United States v. Ware, 247 F.2d 698 (7th Cir. 1957), which overturned a narcotics conviction because of the improper admission into evidence of envelopes bearing notes by government agents on the circumstances of the drug purchases. Accord, United States v. Brown, 45\u00cd F.2d 1231 (5th Cir. 1971); Sanchez v. United States, 293 F.2d 260 (8th Cir. 1961). Cf. United States v. Adams, 385 F.2d 548- (2d Cir. 1967) (harmful comments never received in evidence). Although the bare chemist\u2019s report was admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay prohibition, <em>Ware, </em>supra, 247 F.2d at 699-700, the incriminating remarks of Agent Driver were not. Moreover, the erroneous receipt of these comments in evidence cannot be viewed as harmless since the prosecutor stressed them in summation, and the jurors were allowed to examine the exhibit during their deliberations. <em>Ware, </em>supra, 247 F.2d at 700-701; <em>Brown, </em>supra, 451 F. 2d at 1234; <em>Sanchez, </em>supra, 293 F.2d at 267, 269. See note 2 supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">The Government, however, seeks to distinguish <em>Ware </em>in that there the hearsay declarations neatly condensed the whole case against the defendant, 247 F.2d at 700, while here the objectionable statement actually \u201cmuddie[d]\u201d the prosecution\u2019s proof, given by Parton, that Cardile and not Frattini transmitted the drugs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But appellee misconceives the essential thrust of this argument. In <em>Ware, </em>the fact that the challenged \u201cmemoranda were merely cumulative of other evidence properly in the record\u201d was regarded as a <em>mitigating </em>factor. 247 F.2d at 700. In this ease, however, the exhibit at issue contained evidence not theretofore admitted and not admissible at all because it was speculation by Agent Driver based upon what he had learned from some other source. In addition, the exhibit \u201cswitched theories\u201d on Frattini in devastatingly harmful fashion. Until admission of the report, the jurors heard no testimony placing the cocaine in Frattini\u2019s possession. But after its receipt, they could have concluded that Frattini was directly linked to the sale. We cannot therefore say that this highly significant piece of evidence, specifically requested by the jurors for scrutiny in the jury room, did not affect their view of the case or influence them to defendant\u2019s detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-9\">The Government also contends that the part of the report relating to the yellow Chrysler was \u201cin fact admissible as an implied prior consistent statement of Parton after his testimony had been attacked as a recent fabrication . \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to appellee, the challenged statement tends to show that Parton had told the agent</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1290-10\">long before he had been arrested and had a motive to fabricate, that the occupant of the Chrysler was one of the people who supplied him with cocaine. Otherwise, the agent would not have recorded and checked out the ownership of the vehicle and come to the erroneous conclusion that Frattini had handed the drugs to Parton.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaC\">Even ignoring the strained nature of the argument (which relies on supposed statements by Parton to Agent Driver to rehabilitate the former\u2019s testimony, attacked as the product of his post-arrest lies), we would in any event reject the claim because it does not go far enough. Whatever its merits with respect to the remarks about the Chrysler, the prior consistent statement rubric clearly fails to cover the vital preceding phrase identifying Parton\u2019s supplier as \u201cone John Doe # 1 (believed to be Theodore Frat-tini)\u201d since, as we have already remarked, this comment was not consistent \u2014but, on the contrary, was wholly at odds \u2014 with the Government\u2019s earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>proof via Parton as to the source of the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">In the absence of any justification for admitting the challenged hearsay evidence, we reverse appellant Frattini\u2019s conviction and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-7\">We turn now to appellant Cardile. Although he does not urge this point, we have nonetheless considered whether our holding in co-defendant Frattini\u2019s case dictates a similar outcome here. Upon reflection, however, we do not believe that the hearsay error as to Frattini could have had any significant prejudicial \u201cspillover\u201d onto Cardile, which would call for reversal of the latter\u2019s conviction for the same evidentiary reason. We note that Cardile never objected below to the admission of Government Exhibit Nine. (Nor does he now in his brief on appeal except by a blanket adoption clause, incorporating \u201call of the points of argument . in the brief of the other appellant herein insofar as applicable to his case.\u201d)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This failure to raise a claim is hardly surprising in view of the fact that the agent\u2019s hearsay comments, if anything, actually helped Cardile. Certainly, trial counsel thought so since, in his summation, in an effort to impeach the credibility of Parton, he dwelt on the discrepancy between the prosecution\u2019s theory of the case (that Cardile supplied the contraband) and the statement inculpating Frattini.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-8\">Cardile\u2019s principal claim on appeal is that the court improperly refused to grant a short continuance pending the arrival of a witness from Atlanta. Appellant requested an overnight adjournment for this purpose after the final defense witness had been heard. Trial counsel informed the court that the case was ending earlier than he had anticipated \u2014 hence the Atlanta witness\u2019s absence \u2014 but that the projected testimony would consume no more than 20 minutes on the next day. The judge denied the continuance, however, on the ground that the intended evidence would be merely cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-13\">The court was told that the Atlanta witness would \u201ctestify about some conversations that he had with Floyd Par-ton . . . September 18th, the time of his arrest . . . . \u201d After a brief exchange between the judge and the Assistant United States Attorney, the former responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-16\">If that\u2019s what he is going to testify to, you have had testimony from you [trial counsel], . . . from Mr. Mancuso, . . . from Mr. Cardile. I don\u2019t see where that is going to be anything more than cumulative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1291-19\">Cardile argues on appeal that the proposed evidence was not, as the court thought, cumulative since it dealt with an earlier talk with Parton than the one already related by others.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree with this contention and \u2014 had we been in the trial judge\u2019s place \u2014 might well have decided to grant the adjournment, brief as it was. But \u201c[t]he matter of continuance is traditionally within the discretion of the trial judge . \u201d Ungar v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S.Ct. 841, 849, 11 L.Ed.2d 921 (1964). On this record, we cannot say that the failure to grant a continuance constituted an abuse of dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>cretion. Trial counsel for Cardile never made an offer of proof, as to the contents of the alleged \u201cconversations.\u201d Nor did he \u2014 after the return of the verdict and the witness\u2019s presumed arrival from Atlanta \u2014 make a motion for a new trial, with an affidavit setting forth the testimony in detail. (At that point, having had the chance to interview the witness in person, he should have known the exact nature of the proffered evidence.) Given the vagueness of counsel\u2019s allusion to the witness\u2019s story, the judge acted within bounds in refusing appellant an adjournment. Cf. United States v. Wyler, 487 F.2d 170, 173-174 (2d Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">We have considered Cardile\u2019s other points on appeal<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">We therefore affirm the conviction of appellant Cardile.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1289-13\">. On February 21, 1974, Parton was sentenced to two years probation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1289-14\">. In his brief on appeal, Frattini alternatively argued that the report had never been received in evidence at all, yet was nonetheless improperly allowed to be brought into the jury room. At oral argument, appellate counsel conceded that this position was incorrect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1290-5\">. Supplementary Brief for Appellee at 2 (submitted in letter form, in response to the panel\u2019s request at oral argument).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1290-11\">. Supplementary Brief for Appellee at 2, supra note 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1290-12\">. Id. at 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1291-9\">. In light of our disposition of this matter, we do not reach Frattini\u2019s second claim on appeal: that the court erred by failing to hold a hearing to determine whether one of the jurors was able to understand English. Cardile wisely does not make this argument since his counsel objected in the trial court to excusing the juror, on the grounds that \u201c[h]e understood the questions that were put to him by [the court] and he gave answers to those questions . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1291-21\">. Brief for Cardile at 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1291-22\">. Mancuso, Cardile, and trial counsel Chris-tiansen testified to a conversation that occurred on December 3,1972.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1292-9\">. Cardile additionally complains of the court\u2019s alleged refusal to allow testimony as to his and his wife\u2019s life style and working habits (to rebut the inference that they lived on illicit profits from drugs) and of supposed violations of Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964), in the admission of incriminating statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1292-6\">FRIENDLY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A-W\">(concurring and dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-7\">While I join in the reversal of Fratti-ni\u2019s conviction, I would also reverse Car-dile\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-8\">I am unable to share my brothers\u2019 belief that it is feasible to disentangle the two defendants. The Government\u2019s testimony linked them inextricably; there was no evidence on which the jury could rationally find Frattini innocent and Cardile guilty. Even though Exhibit 9' cast Frattini rather than Cardile in the role of the person making the actual delivery, it bolstered the Government\u2019s case that a narcotics transaction had taken place and weakened the testimony of both defendants that nothing of the sort had occurred. Beyond this, reversal of Cardile\u2019s conviction is necessary in justice not only to him but to Frattini. The Government\u2019s evidence at the new trial inevitably will include reference to Cardile, the jury will wonder why he is not a defendant, and if it speculates that he has been convicted, this will work against Frattini. Furthermore, Car-dile\u2019s testimony was helpful to Frattini; it will be the opposite if he now takes the stand and the Government shows he has been convicted. These considerations are of special weight because the Government\u2019s case rested almost entirely on the testimony of Parton and both defendants offered plausible and partially corroborated explanations that their presence on the scene was innocent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-11\">My belief that Cardile also should have a new trial is reinforced by what I consider an arbitrary denial of his counsel\u2019s request for a continuance from 3:30 P.M. until the following morning for the presentation of a witness from Atlanta and an erroneous refusal to permit Cardile to explain that his apparently easy life style was due to hard work by himself and his wife rather than to narcotics profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-12\">This is the rare narcotics case where the defendants may be innocent. There must be a new trial in any event, and it will take only a few hours longer if both defendants are included. Our duty is to \u201crequire such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106. I do not think it just to either Cardile or Fratti-ni that the new trial should be truncated by our attempting to put asunder two defendants whom the Government\u2019s chief witness so tightly joined.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
