It evolves from an action instituted by a group of dissatisfied employees who charged that the surviving carrier, Burlington Northern, Inc. (BN), and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE), as the authorized bargaining representative for the craft of locomotive engineers, had discriminated against them for hostile and invidious purposes in the negotiation and implementation of an agreement which established, <em>inter alia, </em>the method for consolidating certain of the predecessor carriers\u2019 seniority rosters.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">In early 1961, the above-mentioned rail carriers filed joint application with the Interstate Commerce Commission, I. C.C. Finance Docket Nos. 21478-80, for authority pursuant to Section 5(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 24 Stat. 380, as amended, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(2), to merge the GN, NP, Pacific Coast and Burlington lines, and for the surviving carrier to lease the SP&amp;S.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After extensive hearings on the application, and in spite of a favorable recommendation by the hearing examiner, the Commission initially refused to approve the merger, 328 I.C.C. 460 (1966).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, on January 4, 1967, the carriers\u2019 petition for reconsideration was granted, and shortly thereafter a second set of hearings were held. On November 30, 1967, the Commission reversed its earlier position and issued an order giving its authorization for the merger, 331 I.C.C. 228 (1967). There ensued numerous third-party requests for further reconsideration, and the Commission issued a series of orders, not pertinent here, in conjunction with those requests. In addition, several court actions were commenced in an attempt to overturn the agency\u2019s authorization. <em>See, e. g., </em>United States v. United States, 296 F.Supp. 853 (D.D.C.1968). On March 3, 1970, the merger finally became effective by order of the Supreme Court. United States v. Interstate Commerce Commission, (Northern Lines Merger Cases), 396 U.S. 491, 90 S.Ct. 708, 24 L.Ed.2d 700 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">After the issuance of the hearing examiner\u2019s recommended report and order, but while the merger proposal was still pending before the Commission, the rail carriers entered into an agreement with the BLE to establish the job protections which would be accorded the union mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>bership following the merger. This agreement, denominated the Merger Protective Agreement of June 29, 1965, guaranteed, <em>inter alia, </em>normal attrition and premerger wages for all locomotive engineers who had been employed on the predecessor lines. It also provided for subsequent negotiation by the carriers and the union of implementing agreements relating to the use of employees, rearrangement and changes in seniority districts, integration of seniority rosters in the consolidated seniority districts and other adjustments necessary to effect the merger.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">In January of 1966, the rail carriers and the BLE entered into a second agreement, known as Implementing Agreement No. 1, which contained, in pertinent part, certain provisions for the consolidation of seniority districts throughout the merged railroad system. The Implementing Agreement established five consolidated seniority districts. At issue in this case is the newly-formed Pacific Seniority District.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It also provided that the consolidated seniority rosters for each of the five new districts were to be prepared on a percentage allocation <em>basis </em>\u2014 viz. on the basis of a ratio which contrasted the total engine hours and car miles within the newly consolidated district with the total engine hours and car miles in each of the former seniority districts so combined.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">The Merger Protective Agreement and Implementing Agreement No. 1 were cancelled by the BLE, pursuant to their terms, following the Commission\u2019s initial decision to withhold its approval of the merger. However, in anticipation of receiving a more favorable ruling from the Commission on their petition for reconsideration, the carriers entered into a third agreement with the BLE on September 13, 1966. Under this third agreement, the two prior agreements were reinstated with several amendments, only one of which has particular relevance here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As amended, the September 13, 1966 Agreement expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>provided that the interested General Committees of the BLE could agree to reject a percentage block allocation and establish a different method for consolidating the seniority rosters in their respective districts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Absent objection by the various carriers, the method so chosen would then be incorporated into the post-merger collective bargaining agreement executed by BN and the BLE.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">During the interval in which the BN merger was temporarily inactive \u2014 between the initially adverse decision of the Commission and the execution of the September 13, 1966 Agreement \u2014 the delegates to the BLE convention had convened and extensively revised, effective July 19, 1966, that portion of the BLE Constitution which dealt with mergers and other related transactions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In conj unction with certain of these changes, the Grand Chief Engineer of the BLE assigned one of the union\u2019s officers to coordinate the intra-union activities associated with the proposed BN merger. Among his duties, the officer was to assist the General and Local Chairmen in reaching a decision, pursuant to Standing Rule 36 and the September 13, 1966 Agreement, as to the method by which seniority rosters would be consolidated in the newly-formed districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">In August of 1967, following numerous meetings among all interested parties, four proposals were offered to the Local Chairmen<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for their consideration; and, after further debate, a fifth and sixth proposal were added.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On October 17, 1968, the General Chairmen of the NP, GN and SP&amp;S sent a joint letter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>the Local Chairmen requesting that each indicate his preference as to the consolidation method which would be adopted in his district. Additional meetings were held, and the BLE\u2019s Executive Committee was consulted on a number of occasions regarding the various proposals. When the process was finally completed, the Local Chairmen in the Pacific District had voted to recommend the implementation of a date of hire method in their district.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It was this recommendation which was' ultimately incorporated into the BN-BLE post-merger collective bargaining agreement, dated February 19, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The present action, charging a violation of the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et seq., </em>and the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 <em>et seq., </em>was instituted by a group of locomotive engineers employed on the merged BN.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In their prayer for relief, the plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the consolidated seniority roster for the Pacific District and the February 19, 1970 collective bargaining agreement between BN and the BLE were illegal, null and void. In addition, injunctive relief was requested to prohibit BN and the BLE from implementing the agreement and thereby utilizing a date of hire consolidated roster.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">Following a trial on the merits, the district court held that the BN-BLE agreement of February 19, 1970, and in particular those provisions specifying that the seniority rosters in the Pacific Seniority District were to be consolidated using the engineers\u2019 date of hire, was contrary to the \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d language of Standing Rule 35 of the BLE Constitution and therefore void. The court also held that by interpreting its constitution to permit a date of hire consolidation the BLE had breached its statutory duty of fair representation under the Railway Labor Act, thus rendering the agreement and resulting seniority roster illegal and unenforceable. Finally, it held that in implementing the agreement the union had placed the plaintiffs in a \u201cworse position with regard to work opportunity\u201d in violation of Section 5(2)(f) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(2)(f), the intent of the I.C.C. order approving the merger, 331 I.C.C. 228 (1967), and the Merger Protective Agreement and Implementing Agreement No. 1. A declaratory judgment was entered, and an injunction issued which prohibited BN and the BLE from giving effect to the February 19, 1970 agreement or utilizing a date of hire consolidated roster in the Pacific District. For the reasons which follow, we reverse with directions that the injunction be dissolved and judgment entered for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">BREACH OF DUTY OF FAIR REPRESENTATION</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Our analysis of whether the BLE has breached its statutory duty of fair representation under the Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 <em>et </em>seq.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>gins, and in this instance ends, with our determination that the union\u2019s decision to implement a date of hire method for consolidating seniority rosters on the merged carriers was neither inequitable nor in violation of the \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d language of the BLE Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Although the district court made no express findings on whether a date of hire consolidation was equitable under the facts of this case, we believe the record before us is more than adequate to support this conclusion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It has long been recognized that the use of such a method to integrate seniority rosters is an equitable arrangement for resolving the inevitable conflicts which arise whenever a merger occurs. Humphrey v. Moore, 375 U.S. 335, 347, 84 S.Ct. 363, 11 L.Ed.2d 370 (1964) and eases cited therein.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Provided that the use of this method was not foreclosed by Standing Rule 35 of the BLE Constitution, we thus view the implementation of a date of hire consolidation to be well within the \u201cwide range of reasonableness [which] must be allowed a statutory bargaining representative in serving the unit it represents. . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349, 84 S.Ct. at 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">The pertinent portion of Standing Rule 35(a)(1)(D), which has been set forth in full in the margin,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-8\">In the preparation of seniority rosters to cover the Seniority Districts <em>on an equitable basis, </em>the General Chairman shall request the carrier to furnish promptly to him <em>all statistical information such as, but not limited to, </em>number of trains, car miles, train miles, and yard engine hours and/or inbound car count <em>for use in determining a proper ratio to govern the parties, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">In determining that the above-quoted language empowers the BLE to adopt a. date of hire consolidation for integrating seniority rosters, we begin by recognizing the general proposition that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-13\">Trade union constitutions should be read in their living context. The interpretation or construction of the constitution and laws of a union is for the union, through its appropriate board or officers; and th,e courts will accept such interpretation, as long as there is no claim of fraud, and as long as the officer or body on which this power of interpretation has been conferred does not substitute legislation or amendment for construction, does not transgress the bounds of reason, common sense, or fairness, or act arbitrarily, or contravene public policy or the law of the land, or destroy the property or contractual rights of, the members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-14\">Wirtz v. Local Union No. 125, International Hod Carriers B. &amp; C. L. U., 270 F.Supp. 12, 16 (N.D.Ohio 1966), <em>quoting from </em>51 C.J.S. Labor Relations \u00a7 58, pp. 686-687. Thus, in the present context, the central issue which must be resolved is whether the Rule is sufficiently broad so that the officers of the BLE could properly construe it as allowing the Gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>eral Chairmen, once having considered the statistical information they receive from the carriers, to utilize a method of consolidation which yields an equitable result but which, in so doing, may either de-emphasize or entirely disregard certain of the expressly enumerated criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Viewing the literal language of Standing Rule 35(a) (I)(D),. we cannot say that it provides for an exclusive method of consolidation based upon a mandatory application of specific factors. As we see it, there are only two mandatory provisions in the Rule. First, there is the requirement that the General Chairmen, in determining the method which is to be implemented in a particular instance, must, consider all relevant statistical data before <em>rendering </em>their decision. Second, there is the overriding requirement that the integration of seniority rosters must be accomplished in an equitable manner. Thus, under our construction of the Rule, the union has been given a wide range of flexibility which permits it to adopt a variety of different consolidation methods depending upon the varying situations with which it may be confronted and the peculiar interests of the employees who will be affected. In reaching its decisions, the union may emphasize certain criteria\u2014 such as date of hire \u2014 over others and it may also, reject any of the data, whether it be expressly enumerated or not, provided that the consolidation method which is ultimately chosen proves to be an equitable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-12\">A review of the legislative history underlying the passage of Standing Rule 35 further bolsters our conclusion that the BLE was not \u201clocked in\u201d to a single method of consolidation. The discussion surrounding the adoption of the Rule does include statements which, if read in isolation, might indicate that some form of percentage block allocation was envisioned by the delegates to the BLE Convention.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, these statements must be considered in the context of the entire floor debates.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> When viewed as a whole, the legislative history clearly suggests that the primary purpose of the Rule was to give the union officers great flexibility in formulating methods to integrate seniority rosters; that no single method was intended to be prescribed; and that an employee\u2019s data of hire was one of the elements which was properly to be considered in determining which method would be equitable in any given case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Nor does the precedent which deals with Standing Rule 35 undercut or in any way limit our belief that the Rule should be broadly construed. For example, in Price v. Seaboard Coastline Railroad Co., 332 F.Supp. 1093 (N.D.Ala., 1970), aff\u2019d per curiam, 449 F.2d 1371 (5th Cir., 1971), a case in which, <em>inter alia, </em>the BLE was charged with having breached its duty of fair representation because of certain limitations imposed on the post-merger exercise of seniority rights, the agreement then before the court had provided for seniority dovetailing on two independent bases. Prior to the merger, one of the lines had maintained separate seniority rosters for its yard and road engineers. In order to consolidate these intra-line rosters, the agreement between the union and the surviving carrier provided for a modified date of hire dovetailing.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The resulting consolidated roster was then integrated with the seniority rosters in effect on each of the other merged carriers pursuant to a modified percentage block allocation formula utilizing four specific statistical elements.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">In its findings of fact, the district court first determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-13\">As to each former seniority district, its equity in the work of the new consolidated seniority district was determined on the basis of its percentage of the total work performed in the former districts, as established by consideration of the four elements prescribed. Section 35 of the Stand-, ing Rules of the BLE Constitution, <em>which section sets forth the exclusive procedures governing the handling of merger related problems, including seniority, provides for the use of these four elements in determining the proper ratio for consolidating seniority rosters on an equitable basis in the event of merger, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-14\">332 F.Supp. at 1097. The court then went on to hold that there had been no breach by the union of its duty of fair representation, primarily on the ground that each engineer had been placed in \u201cthe same relative standing or position in regard to work opportunity as he was in prior to the merger.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Id. at 1097. <em>See also, </em>Cole v. Seaboard Coastline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>Railroad Co., 65 C.C.H. Lab. Cases, \u00b6 11,567 (E.D.Va.1970), aff\u2019d, 64 C.C.H.Lab.Cases \u00b6 11,499 (4th Cir, 1971)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">In Witherspoon v. Grand International Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 260 S.C. 117, 194 S.E.2d 399 (1973) the Supreme Court of South Carolina dealt with another attack upon the same merger agreement which had been litigated in <em>Price. </em>The appellants in <em>With-erspoon, </em>however, contended that the agreement was invalid on the ground that the union could show no rational basis for its adoption of a percentage block allocation. They further contended that the only equitable method for consolidating the seniority rosters would have been one based solely upon the engineers\u2019 date of hire. In resolving the issue then before it, the court first noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">Section 35 of the standing rules of the BLE Constitution, which sets forth the procedures governing the handling of merger-related problems, including seniority, <em>contemplates elements other than date of hire in determining the method and proper ratio for consolidating seniority rosters on an equitable basis </em>in the event of merger, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">194 S.E.2d at 402. The court then went on to hold that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">The record fairly indicates that the BLE and Seaboard entered into the agreements with the good faith and honest belief that, considering all members, <em>dovetail percentage blocking was the most equitable method </em>to consolidate seniority rosters; and that the dovetail percentage blocking method <em>was one of a number of fair and reasonable methods available, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-12\">Contrary to the assertions .of appel-lees; we do not read these opinions as establishing that Rule 35 mandates a percentage block allocation in the consolidation of seniority rosters. In both cases, the courts\u2019 overriding concern was with whether the method of consolidation actually implemented by the union had resulted in an equitable solution to what often proves to be an extremely difficult type of problem.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In each instance, the court resorted to the language of the Rule primarily as an aid in determining the central issue of whether the consolidation had been equitable; and in both the court was careful to avoid becoming enmeshed in the question of whether, and to what extent, the BLE was limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>in the factors it could apply.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The references to Standing Rule 35 having been made in the context of demonstrating the equity of a particular method, we are not willing to accept the argument that these cases foreclosed other methods of consolidation which might have proven equally equitable but which were not as clearly within the express language of the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Having determined, contrary to the court below, that Standing Rule 35 does not require the BLE to utilize a percentage block allocation in consolidating its seniority rosters, we are thus not prepared to say that the union has breached its statutory duty of fair representation. <em>See, e.g., </em>Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967); Humphrey v. Moore, 375 U.S. 335, 84 S.Ct. 363, 11 L.Ed.2d 370 (1964); Ford Motor Company v. Huffman, 345 U.S. 330, 73 S.Ct. 681, 97 L.Ed. 1048 (1953). While it may be that another method for consolidating the rosters at issue here would have satisfied a larger number of engineers affected by the merger, without more this Court should not substitute its views for those of officials elected by the employees to represent them in such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">INTERSTATE COMMERCE ACT VIOLATION</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">In its conclusions of law, the district court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-12\">As a result of the Agreement dated February 19, 1970 (Joint Exhibit 7) and the resulting engineers\u2019 seniority roster . . . the plaintiffs have been placed in a worse position with regard to work opportunity . in violation of . . . Section 5(2)(f) . . . and of the intent of the I.C.C. order approving the merger, the Merger Protective Agreement <em>and Implementing Agreement No. 1 ... . </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-16\">Although supported neither in its finding of fact nor by anything this Court has managed to glean from the record, the only possible ground for such a holding would be if the Commission considered the two above-mentioned agreements, but not the September 13, 1966 Agreement, in the discharge of its statutory duty under Section 5(2) (f) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5(2)(f).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> While logic and the record would both seem to indicate that such a construction of the facts may have been erroneous \u2014 i. e. that the Commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>had before it either all three of the pre-merger agreements or solely the initial Merger Protective Agreement<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u2014 it is our view that even if the situation was as the district court seems implicitly to have held the plaintiffs below would be entitled to no relief under the Act.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">If either of the alternative factual contexts actually pertained, as the present record would lead us to believe, then the issue before us would-be capable of ready disposition and we would be forced to overrule the district court.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> However, if the Commission did consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Implementing Agreement No. 1, but not the September 13, 1966 Agreement, then the issue becomes more complex. The union\u2019s integration of seniority rosters based on employee\u2019s date of hire would not have directly violated the intent of the Commissioner\u2019s order \u2014 the consolidation being equitable and the Commission not having expressly mandated that a particular method be used <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u2014 however it would violate the terms of Implementing Agreement No. 1. Thus, the issue before us would be the extent to which BN and the BLE will be bound by the terms of their pre-merger agreements where the Commission has reviewed those agreements prior to its approval of a merger. In particular, we must determine the extent to which a merged carrier and its employees\u2019 collective bargaining representative will be bound by those provisions in their premerger agreements which deal with matters not directly related to the compensation of discharged or displaced employees \u2014 here, the relative post-merger seniority rights of retained employees \u2014 in those situations where the Commission has adopted the agreements in discharge of its statutory duty under Section 5(2) (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">For purposes of this analysis, the first case to clarify the scope and effect of Section 5(2) (f) was Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Assn. v. United States, 339 U.S. 142, 70 S.Ct. 530, 94 L.Ed. 721 (1950). In RLE A, the Court was confronted with the issue of whether the four-year period contained in the second sentence of Section 5(2) (f) had established a ceiling on the Commission\u2019s authority to require protections for employees affected by a consolidation or merger. In holding that the Commission\u2019s powers were not so limited, the Court began by examining the legislative history surrounding the enactment of the statute.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> After a review of history from which the initial sentence of the Section evolved, Mr. Justice Burton first concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">If this provision, which later became the first sentence of \u00a7 5(2) (f), now stood alone as it did then, the Commission unquestionably would have the power to grant at least as much relief to employees as it had under \u00a7 5(4) (b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">339 U.S. at 150, 70 S.Ct. at 534.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> He then went on to reject the argument that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-12\">the second sentence of \u00a7 5(2) (f), which was inserted soon thereafter, amount [ed] not only to an additional provision for the protection of labor, but also to a limitation upon the discretion vested in the Commission by the first sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-13\"><em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In so doing, Mr. Justice Burton placed heavy reliance <em>not </em>only on the lit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>eral language of the statute, but also on an analysis of the introduction and subsequent modification of a legislative proposal known as the Harrington amendment.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">However, it was not until some eleven years later that the Court in Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees v. United States, 366 U.S. 169, 81 S.Ct. 913, 6 L.Ed.2d 206 (1961) finally established the <em>type </em>of protections which were encompassed by Section 5(2) (f).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Squarely faced with the issue of whether monetary compensation for discharged or displaced employees satisfied the congressional mandate embodied in the Act, the Court rejected the contention that the Section contemplated a</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">\u201cjob freeze\u201d for employees on the predecessor lines. As the Court saw it, Section 5(2)(f) was not concerned with maintaining employment status, <em>per se, </em>but rather with insuring that those employees affected by a merger would not be placed in a \u201cworse position\u201d with respect to their compensation for, at a minimum, the statutory four-year period.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">The final Supreme Court case which we must consider is Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Co. v. Nemitz, 404 U.S. 37, 92 S.Ct. 185, 30 L.Ed.2d 198 (1971). In Nemitz the Court dealt with the validity of a post-consolidation collective bargaining agreement that had substantially abrogated certain eompensation/attri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>tion protections guaranteed employees under a prior agreement which had been adopted by the Commission in discharge of its Section 5(2) (f) duty.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The Court, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Douglas, refused to accept the argument that the final sentence of Section 5(2) (f) \u2014 the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d proviso\u2014 had relieved the Commission of <em>any </em>duty to review the adequacy of protective provisions contained in the post-consolidation collective bargaining agreement. As Mr. Justice Douglas analyzed the problem :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">We reviewed the history of \u00a7 5(2) (f) in Railway Executives\u2019 Assn. v. United States, 339 U.S. 142, 70 S.Ct. 530, 94 L.Ed. 721, and said that \u201cone of its principal purposes was to provide mandatory protection for the interests of employees affected by railroad consolidations.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 148, 70 S.Ct. 530, at 533. That \u201cmandatory protection\u201d can be accorded by terms provided by the Commission, or, as is more likely, by provisions of a collective agreement which the Commission adopts or approves as adequate for a minimum of four years (as required by the second sentence) or longer (as allowed by the first sentence) if the Commission so provides, Id., at 154, 70 S.Ct. 530 at 536. <em>The purpose of </em>\u00a7 <em>5(2) (f) was not to freeze jobs but to provide compensatory conditions. </em>Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees v. United States, 366 U.S. 169, 175-176, 81 S.Ct. 913, 916-917. 6 L.Ed.2d 206. In that case, we noted that the Commission has consistently followed that practice \u201cin over 80 cases, with the full support of the intervening brotherhoods.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 177, 81 S.Ct. 913, at 917. And the Commission over and over again has adopted the set of labor conditions contained in collective agreements in discharge of its duty under \u00a7 5(2) (f). <em>See </em>Gulf, M. &amp; O. R. Co. Purchase, 261 L.C.C. 405, 434; Erie R. Co. Trackage Rights, 295 I.C.C. 303, 305; Delaware, L. &amp; W. R. Co. Trackage Rights, 295 I.C.C. 743, 755-756.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-11\">When there is a collective agreement and the Commission, as here, adopts or approves it, the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d sentence of \u00a7 5(2) (f) is not, as suggested, read out of the Act. <em>The collective agreement then becomes a \u201ccondition\u201d of the Commission\u2019s \u201capproval\u201d of the consolidation under the first sentence of </em>\u00a7 <em>5(2) (f) and its provisions are deemed by the Commis</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number><em>sion to be \u2018\u2018a fair and equitable arrangement to protect the interests\u201d of the employees within the meaning of the first sentence. </em>Thus, the significance of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d proviso is that it provides the machinery for the terms of a pre-merger collective agreement and thus supplies the minimum measure of fairness required under the first sentence of \u00a7 5 (2) (f). (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">404 U.S. at 42-43, 92 S.Ct. at 188. He then went on to approve the holding of the Court of Appeals that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">An agreement made pursuant to the last sentence of Sec. 5(2) (f) may vary the protections afforded by the I.C.C. order, but it <em>may not substantially abrogate employees\u2019 rights grounded in an I.C.C. order, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">404 U.S. at 44, 92 S.Ct. at 189, <em>quoting from </em>436 F.2d 841, at 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\"> In the instant case, all locomotive engineers who would be affected by the BN merger were guaranteed normal attrition and pre-merger wage levels. Nor can it be argued that these protections have been abrogated by the BNBLE post-merger collective bargaining agreement. Thus, the issue before us is whether the broad language of <em>Nemitz, </em>delineating the effect that Commission approval of pre-merger agreements will have upon subsequent collective bargaining, is to held applicable to all terms in the pre-merger agreement or, as was the case then before the Court, only to those terms dealing directly with compensatory protection for displaced or discharged employees.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> It is our belief that the language in <em>Nemitz </em>should properly be limited to the context which engendered <em>it </em>\u2014 viz. to those matters which have a direct bearing on insuring that employees who may be adversely affected as a result of a merger or consolidation are compensated in a \u201cfair and equitable\u201d manner. We thus hold that, even assuming the Commission had before it the Merger Protective Agreement and Implementing Agreement No. 1, but not the September 13, 1966 Agreement, those provisions in the Agreements which established the method for consolidating seniority rosters would not be binding upon the parties in their post-merger collective bargaining activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">We reach this result on two interdependent grounds. First, because Section 5(2) (f) was designed \u201c. . . not to freeze jobs but to provide compensatory conditions,\u201d Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Co. v. Nemitz, <em>supra </em>at 42, 92 S.Ct. at 188, the lifetime guarantees of wages and normal attrition given to employees in this case have provided the full measure of protection which that Section was meant to provide. Second, we feel that a contrary result would have the effect of severely emasculating the collective bargaining process both by eliminating the very flexibility upon which such bargaining depends and by interjecting the Interstate Commerce Commission and/or the courts into matters of substance which have historically been beyond their province, <em>see, e. g., </em>Chicago &amp; North Western Railroad Co. v. United Transportation Union, 402 U.S. 570, 579 n. 11, 91 S.Ct. 1731, 29 L.Ed.2d 187 (1971).<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>We do, however, recognize the possibility that under certain circumstances provisions in a pre-merger agreement which do not speak directly to compensation may nevertheless be so intimately related to the compensatory protections guaranteed employees as to require their inclusion in a post-merger collective bargaining agreement. But this is not such a case. Here, there has been no abrogation of \u201cthe standard of \u2018compensation\u2019 covered by the [premerger] agreement which had come under the protective order of the Commission,\u201d Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Co. v. Nemitz, supra at 44-45, 92 S.Ct. at 189. Nor can an argument be made, given the lifetime guarantees accorded, that over the term of their employment the relative seniority rankings of retained employees will have any bearing on their ability to work at a level of compensation at least as great as that which they enjoyed prior to the merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">The judgment below is, therefore, reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b649-7\">. Section 5(2) of the Interstate Commerce Act establishes certain requirements which control the merger of common carriers. Under Section 5(2) (a), the consummation of a merger and its related transactions is prohibited without the prior approval of the Commission. Section 5 (2) (b) provides, <em>inter alia </em>that, subject to such terms, conditions and/or modifications as it shall find to be just and reasonable, the Commission must determine that the merger is consistent with the public interest. Sections 5(2) (c)-(e) provide criteria for the Commission in making such a determination, and authority for it to require certain modifications of the merger proposal as a condition of its approval. Pursuant to Section 5(2) (f), <em>see infra </em>at n. 25, approval is also conditioned on the Commission\u2019s having insured a fair and equitable arrangement to protect the interests of the employees who are affected by the merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">For an historical analysis of the merger proceedings in this case, and a discussion of certain allied transactions not directly relevant here, <em>see </em>United States v.

The Merger Protective Agreement provided, in pertinent part, for the preservation of employment and guaranteed monthly earnings based on test period earnings; for limitations on the obligation of an employee to take a position requiring a change in residence, without loss of earnings guarantees; and for increased moving expenses and other monetary benefits for an involuntary change in work location. In addition, all protected employees were automatically certified as being adversely affected by the merger without the necessity of having to prove direct adversity. The monthly monetary guarantee was. to be automatically adjusted upward to compensate for general wage increases, and was to be independent of any outside earnings. Because the guarantee was based on a formula of average monthly earnings and average monthly hours worked, it would thus be possible for an employee to receive compensatory payments even though his actual wages exceeded the amount of his guarantee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b650-6\">. Prior to the merger, the individual predecessor lines had been divided into a number of operating divisions, each of which had a separate seniority roster for its employees.

Prior to the BN merger, each of the predecessor lines had a local organization of the BLE which generally, but not always, coincided with the operating divisions of the various railroads.

In our view, regardless of the circumstances which obtained, the plaintiffs would not be entitled to relief under Section 5(2) (f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b658-9\">. If the Commission considered solely the Merger Protective Agreement, then a date of hire consolidation would have violated neither the Act, the intent of the Commission\u2019s order, nor the Agreement itself. In addition to establishing wage and attrition guarantees, this agreement provided no more than that seniority consolidation would be affected on an \u201cequitable basis.\u201d As we have already held that the use of an employee\u2019s date of hire was an equitable method for integrating the seniority rosters in the Pacific District, the only issue would be whether the use of an equitable method could nevertheless violate Section 5 (2) (f) by placing some employees in a \u201cworse position with respect to their employment.\u201d Given the type of protections with which that Section is concerned, <em>see infra </em>at 606, we would find such an argument to be devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">If the Commission considered both of the subsequent agreements, then there could similarly have been no violation .of the Act, the Commission\u2019s order, or Implementing Agreement No. 1. The September 13, 1966 Agreement did not require a specific method of consolidation but provided, contrary to the earlier agreement, that the union could adopt whatever method its General Chairmen should choose. In addition, the Commission\u2019s approval would have constituted a determination that both the percentage block and the machinery for implementing a different method were \u201cfair and equitable.\u201d Thus the issue would again become whether the use of an equitable method, when coupled with wage and attrition guarantees, could be in violation of the \u201cworse position\u201d clause of Section 5(2) (f). As we have indicated, we would not accept such a contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">In attempting to frame their argument on the issue of a violation of the Commission\u2019s order, appellees attempt to make much of the language requiring that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-14\">. . . no employee is to be deprived of his employment status or placed in a worse position with respect to compensation, rules governing working conditions, fringe benefits or rights and privileges pertaining thereto at any time during such employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-16\">331 I.C.C. at 277-78. They would have us read \u201cemployment status\u201d as a requirement that every employee maintain the identical seniority rights as he had enjoyed prior to the merger. However, such a reading would necessarily require a \u201cjob freeze\u201d and as a practical matter render <em>any </em>consolidation a violation of the Commission\u2019s intent. As we read the language, it refers merely to the status of being employed and the attrition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>guarantees contained in the Merger Protective Agreement. Any broader reading would take such a requirement beyond the intendment of the Act. <em>See infra </em>at 606.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\">. It is also arguable that use of a date of hire method could not have violated the intent of the Commission\u2019s order because at that time the Commission\u2019s view of the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d proviso of- Section 5(2) (f) was such that the existence of the agreements removed the duty to provide <em>any </em>protection for employees covered by those agreements. 331 I.C.C. at 278. <em>See </em>Norfolk &amp; Western Ry.

Prior to the passage of the Transportation Act of 1940, which incorporated Section 5(2) (f) into the Interstate Commerce Act, there had been no statutory provision specifically requiring that protections be accorded employees adversely affected by railroad consolidations and mergers.

In reaching this result, Mr. Chief Justice Warren thoroughly reviewed the evolution of the Section, with particular emphasis on the Harrington amendment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-16\">First, it is clear that there were two alterations made in the substance of the original Harrington amendment: Not only was a four-year limitation imposed, but also general language of imprecise import was used in substitution for language clearly requiring \u2018job freeze\u2019 such as appeared in the original amendment and the 1933 Act. Secondly, the representatives whose floor statements are entitled to the greatest weight are those House members who had the last word on the bill \u2014 the House conferees who explained the final version of the statute to the House at large immediately prior to passage \u2014 rather than those Congressmen whose voices were heard in the early skirmishing but who did not participate in the final compromise. Finally, although it might be an overstatement to claim that their remarks are dispositive, the statements the House conferees gave in explanation of the final version <em>clearly reveal an understanding that compensation, not \u2018job freeee,\u2019 was contemplated, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-17\">366 U.S. at 175-176, 81 S.Ct. at 916. He then went on to cite a series of contemporaneous interpretations of the Statute which supported the Court\u2019s holding. Thus, for example, the fact that the Commission had adopted an identical construction in its next annual report, I.C.C. 5th Ann.Rep. 60-61, and had subsequently imposed \u201c . compensatory conditions, and only compensatory conditions, in proceedings involving \u00a7 5 transactions . . . \u201d, <em>Id. </em>at 177, 81 S.Ct. at 917, added great weight to the Court\u2019s view.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b661-6\">. The facts surrounding the initial agreement in <em>iiTemitz </em>were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">In anticipation of the 1964 consolidation, petitioner entered into an agreement with 19 labor organizations for protection of the employees of the several railroads coming into the consolidation. . . . Petitioner agreed to employ \u201call employees of the lines involved <em>with the guarantee that they will not he adversely affected in their employment </em>as a result of the proposed transactions or for any reason other than furloughs due to seasonal requirements or a decline in the volume of traffic or revenue.\u201d 324 I.C.C. 1, 89 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">Each employee was to receive a monthly supplement to his post-consolidation monthly earnings equal to the excess, if any, of his average monthly compensation for the 12 months prior to the consolidation in which he had performed services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlI\">404 U.S. at 39, 92 S.Ct. at 187. Later in the opinion, Mr. Justice Douglas described the effect of the subsequent agreement on junior employees in the following terms :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-13\">The 1965 agreement obviously placed these junior employees \u201cin a worse position with respect to compensation,\u201d as those words are used in the pre-consolidation agreement. For they no longer could work on any part of the former Toledo Division except the Sandusky Line and their prior compensation, reflecting in part the work on other parts of the Toledo Division, was no longer a measure of the \u201ccompensation\u201d to which they were entitled under the pre-consolidation agreement. For those whose historical average monthly earnings were so slight that they were now on unemployment insurance, the result would be much more drastic than \u201cnormal attrition,\u201d which the Commission said was the only way under the protective conditions by which jobs would be eliminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-14\"><em>Id. </em>at 44, 92 S.Ct. at 189.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b662-8\">. Wo note at this point in our analysis that the Third Circuit has apparently adopted the position that when Section 5 (2) (f) speaks of protecting the interests of \u201cemployees affected\u201d it refers solely to those employees whose jobs are lost and/or whose relationship with the carrier is severed, rather than to all employees who suffer the possibility of displacement by reason of the transaction. <em>See </em>Clemens v.
