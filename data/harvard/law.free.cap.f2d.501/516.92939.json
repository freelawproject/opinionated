On May 9, 1972, Nix was excused from working because of illness and was \u201cdeadlocked\u201d in his cell during the day. On the following day, he again asked to be locked in his cell so other inmates would not disturb him. The guard conducting the count of prisoners in their cells noticed Nix\u2019 bunk was occupied at the 4 p.m., 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. counts. When a new guard began his shift at the midnight count, however, he discovered the occupant of Nix\u2019 bunk was a dummy.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-25\">After a 45-minute search, officers found Nix locked in the rear of a trailer truck parked on a lot outside the prison walls. The trailer had been loaded with desks during the day and was moved outside to the parking lot shortly after 10 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-26\">Nix was indicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for \u201cunlawfully and wilfully attempt [ing] to escape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>At the trial several inmates testified they had seen Nix either before his disappearance or after his capture. They described him as \u201croaring drunk,\u201d \u201cdrunk as hell\u201d or noted particular behavior that led them to believe Nix was intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The following instructions were given:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">Three essential elements are required to be proved in order to establish the offense charged in the indictment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-7\">First, the defendant had been in custody of any institution or facility in which he is confined by direction of the Attorney General, or from any custody under or by virtue of any process issued under the laws of the United States by any court, judge or magistrate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-8\">Second, the defendant escaped or attempted to escape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-9\">Third, the escape is from a confinement based upon the conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAs\">Defendant has offered evidence that he was intoxicated at the time of the commission of the crime charged in the indictment. The crime does not involve specific intent. Therefore, the evidence that defendant acted or failed to act because of intoxication does not constitute a defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">Nix\u2019 attorney objected to the first instruction because it did not include \u201csome standard of mental state\u201d in the definition of escape. He objected to the second instruction on the ground that every \u201cattempt\u201d crime requires specific intent which may be negated by intoxication. The court overruled the objections without explanation. Nix was convicted and sentenced to five years\u2019 im prisonment, to run consecutive to his present sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-15\">On the day after Nix\u2019 appeal was argued, a different panel of this court heard the appeal of Samuel Peterson, No. 74-1074. Peterson had been drinking heavily throughout the day of May 27, 1973, at the honor camp at Marion. So intoxicated that he vomited, Peterson then took a towel and some toiletries to clean up. On his way to the lavatory, he again felt ill and wandered outside to rest against a tree. Peterson testified that the next thing he remembered was walking along some railroad tracks the next morning, trying to get back to the camp. He was apprehended about eight miles from Marion, the towel and toiletries still in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-16\">Peterson was also indicted under \u00a7 751, but charged with escape rather than attempted escape. He was tried before the same district judge, who gave virtually the same instructions as in the Nix trial. Peterson\u2019s lawyer objected on the theory that escape is a specific-intent crime to which intoxication is a defense. Peterson was convicted and sentenced to only one year, consecutive to his present sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-17\">Both defendants urge this court to employ the traditional analysis of specific intent versus general intent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nix argues, with substantial support,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that all crimes of attempt are classified as specific-intent crimes. Peterson claims, with somewhat less authority,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that the specific-intent label should be applied to escape as well as to attempted escape. If either crime requires specific intent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>defendants argue, then the jury should have been allowed to consider whether the prisoner was so intoxicated he could not form the requisite intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Under the traditional analysis, specific intent is indeed required for attempted escape. We could end the inquiry here and remand this case because the instruction given erroneously states the law. Simplistic as the traditional analysis is, however, it does not further a logical resolution of the problem. This is true for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Implicit in Nix\u2019 argument is an ac-knowledgement that escape is a general-intent crime.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nix would say that, by choosing to charge him with <em>attempted </em>escape, the prosecutor injected the element of specific intent into the case. Therefore intoxication would be relevant in his case but not in Peterson\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The trouble with this approach is the impossibility of drawing a line between escape and attempted escape. Was the difference between Nix\u2019 act and Peterson\u2019s the eight miles Peterson traveled? Or an overnight absence versus the hours Nix was missing? Any escapee brought to trial was ultimately unsuccessful.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">On reflection it will be seen that in eases arising under this statute [\u00a7 751] the line of demarcation between an escape and an attempt to escape is often too shadowy to permit of the laying down of absolutes.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">We believe the distinction between the two crimes is too flimsy to support a rule of law that would attach great importance to the prosecutor\u2019s choice between a charge of escape and one of attempted escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-12\">This deficiency in the traditional analysis might be overcome by labeling both crimes as general-intent crimes, as the district judge did, or as specific-intent crimes, as Peterson urges. These labels are \u201coften used in the eases but seldom defined.\u201d United States v. Williams, 332 F.Supp. 1, 3 (D.Md.1971). They were developed, at least with regard to intoxication, primarily to allow drunkenness as a defense to first-degree murder but not to lesser degrees of homicide. The attempt to apply the terms to nonviolent crimes such as escape has produced confused reasoning and disparate results.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-13\">Categorizing all crimes as either having \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cspecific\u201d intent seems too mechanical and often forecloses evaluation by the court of the important consideration involved, i. e., what elements are involved in the crime and whether the prosecution has satisfactorily established them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcM\">\u201cIntoxication as a Criminal Defense,\u201d 55 Colum.L.Rev. 1210. 1217 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-14\">Whenever intoxication (or coercion or mistake) is raised as a mitigating factor, use of the \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201cgeneral\u201d intent labels interferes with the crucial analysis a court should make in escape cases: what constitutes the \u201cescape\u201d element of the crime ?</p>\n<p id=\"b572-15\">Most courts, confronted with evidence that a defendant could not or did not form an intent to leave and not to return, have held such an intent essential to proof of the crime of escape. \u201cWe hold that the felony of escape has as a necessary element the <em>intent </em>of the accused to evade the due course of justice. It seems to us that the very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>word \u2018escape\u2019 connotes an attitude of mind as well as an act. One does not \u2018escape\u2019 without desire and intent to avoid confinement.\u201d Gallegos v. People, 159 Colo. 379, 387, 411 P.2d 956, 960 (1966). In <em>Gallegos </em>the court allowed defendant to introduce evidence that he was so drunk \u2022 he could not form the state of mind required. For other intoxication cases in agreement, <em>see </em>Chandler v. United States, 378 F.2d 906 (9th Cir. 1967); Mills v. United States, 193 F.2d 174 (5th Cir. 1951), cert. denied, 343 U.S. 969, 72 S.Ct. 1067, 96 L.Ed. 1365 (1952); <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> People v. Dolatowski, 94 Ill.App.2d 434, 237 N.E.2d 553 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Only a voluntary departure from custody is an escape. Although defendants in the following cases failed to prove their departures were coerced by others or compelled by necessity, the courts recognized that such proof would establish lack of necessary criminal intent. United States v. Snow, 157 U.S.App.D.C. 331, 484 F.2d 811 (1973); United States v. Chapman, 455 F.2d 746 (5th Cir. 1972); People v. Richards, 269 Cal.App.2d 768, 75 Cal.Rptr. 597 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">A prisoner who was released from jail upon presentation of a bond which he did not know was defective was not guilty of escape. State v. Pace, 192 N.C. 780, 136 S.E. 11 (1926). Nor did defendant escape after being told by an officer with apparent authority that he was discharged. People v. Weiseman, 280 N.Y. 385, 21 N.E.2d 362 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In a variety of other circumstances, intent to escape has been included as an element of the crime: United States v. McPherson, 436 F.2d 1066 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 402 U.S. 997, 91 S.Ct. 2181, 29 L.Ed.2d 163 (1971); United States v. Locke, 425 F.2d 313 (5th Cir. 1970); State v. Lakin, 131 Vt. 82, 300 A.2d 554 (1973); State v. Hendrick, 164 N.W.2d 57 (N.D.S.Ct.1969); Cassady v. State, 247 Ark. 690, 447 S.W.2d 144 (1969); State ex rel. Sublett v. Adams, 145 W.Va. 354, 115 S.E.2d 158 (1960), cert. denied, 366 U.S. 933, 81 S.Ct. 1652, 6 L.Ed.2d 392 (1961).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">The courts have been close to unanimous in requiring intent to escape probably for two reasons. The first is \u201cthe desire to have one human element of \u2018blameworthiness\u2019 as a basis for punishment.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The other reason is the knowledge that a prisoner who has no intent to escape \u2014 because he is grossly intoxicated, or thinks his jailer has told him to leave, or mistakes the boundaries of his confinement, or has a gun held to his head by another inmate \u2014 is not likely to endanger society, as a wilful escapee is. Escape is prohibited not only because the state wants its prisoners to remain confined until their sentences expire or their paroles are granted, but also because a determined escapee may kidn\u00e1p a hostage, kill a guard, steal an automobile or rob a store to facilitate his escape. A prisoner who leaves his custody without an intent to escape will not use force to leave the prison nor resist capture when he is found.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">These cases lead us to a definition of escape as a voluntary departure from custody with an intent to avoid confinement. Whatever label is placed on this intent, a defendant under \u00a7 751 is entitled to an instruction that includes this mental component as an element of the crime which the government must prove. If the defendant offers evidence that he was intoxicated at the time of the offense,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the jury must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>be instructed to consider whether he was so intoxicated he could not form an intent to escape.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The instructions in this case withdrew the mental element from the jury\u2019s consideration.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In overruling Nix\u2019 objections to the two instructions quoted earlier, the district court erred. Defendant\u2019s conviction is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-17\">. \u201cWhoever escapes or attempts to escape from tiie custody of the Attorney General or his authorized representative, or from any institution or facility in which he is confined by direction of the Attorney General, or from any custody under or by virtue of any process issued under the laws of the United States by any court, judge, or magistrate, or from the custody of an officer or employee of the United States pursuant to lawful arrest, shall, if the custody or confinement is by virtue of an arrest on a charge of felony, or conviction of any offense, be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-11\">. \u201cSpecific intent, as the term itself suggests, requires more than a mere general intent to engage in certain conduct.

The government in the <em>Peterson </em>brief cites a number of cases where the same instruction on the elements of escape under \u00a7 751 was given.

I do not quarrel, nor do I understand that the majority does, with the immediately preceding statement in the charge that the crime does not involve specific intent. I would accept the majority standard that escape is a voluntary departure from custody with an intent to avoid confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Looking at the record in the light of this standard I am convinced that Nix had a fair trial and that the jury found him guilty under instructions, which with the one questionable exception, properly were applicable under the standard stated in the majority opinion. While the reference to intoxication not being a defense might be prejudicially erroneous in some conceivable factual situations,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I do not deem it so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-13\">Intoxication unless it is pursued to the point of unconsciousness does not prevent an act from being voluntary nor from being participated in for the purpose of accomplishing a desired end. The fact that a prisoner might be less inclined to attempt an escape if his sense of derring-do were uninfluenced by spirits should be no defense any more than it would be in a driving-under-the-influence case to the still ambulatory besotted person who fancies that he can perform feats of driving which he would not have considered attempting if sober.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-14\">From the testimony of the defendant\u2019s fellow inmates (five of whom were serving time for bank robbery, one for kidnapping, and one for conspiracy and assault with a deadly weapon) home brew and occasionally whiskey were flowing with the freedom of water at the Marion federal penitentiary. Accepting their testimony at face value (despite the patent incredibility of much of it) Nix was drunk on May 10, 1972. The only testimony which corresponded at all timewise with Nix\u2019s apprehension in the truck outside the prison walls was from Richard Montgomery<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> who had been reading in his cell at about 1:00 a.m. on May <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>11. When Nix was brought by the cell Nix told Montgomery that he was being put in segregation for being drunk. Montgomery further testified that he could smell alcohol on Nix\u2019s breath, that he observed Nix as having bloodshot eyes, and that Nix was wobbling and unsure on his feet. One other witness testified that at some time during the day preceding Nix\u2019s apprehension he had observed Nix \u201cknocked out, the last time I seen him, laying on one of them crates.\u201d No witness described Nix\u2019s condition as either being sober or intoxicated at any time during the evening. Nix or the dummy was in Nix\u2019s cell at the checks at 4 p.m., 7 p.m., and 10 p.m. The truck had been loaded sometime before it was moved out of prison confine after the 10 p.m. check. Nix was standing inside the truck when the fastened rear door, the only entrance to the truck, was opened after midnight.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">Despite the fact that the judge stated that intoxication was not a defense, it is clear that the jury was informed that a conviction required a determination that Nix had intentionally committed the act of attempting to escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">As a background matter, the indictment, which was read to the jury and a copy of which was taken to the jury room during deliberations, charged that Nix \u201cdid unlawfully and willfully attempt to escape from such custody [of the Attorney General].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Counsel for Nix presented the case during final summation consistently with what I conceive to be the standard of intent laid down in the majority opinion. Thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-7\">\u201cVery briefly, let me explain something to you that\u2019s been left out of the final argument, that wasn\u2019t mentioned in the opening argument about what we\u2019re involved in, and that simply, ladies and gentlemen, is that this is a criminal case.

So to do an act unlawfully means to do willfully something which is contrary to law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-15\">Since, in my opinion, it was sufficient that the jury understand that there must be an intent to commit the crime, and inasmuch as the jury was fully informed to that effect and the evidence overwhelmingly supported the fact that there was an intent on the part of Nix to attempt to escape, I would affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-16\">I think it is a fair observation that following the publication of the majority opinion no escapee apprehended within a relatively short time after leaving prison walls will admit to being a teetotaler.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-16\">. For example, if the proof showed that Nix had climbed into a truck, and had then consumed alcoholic beverages to the point of becoming unconscious, after which the truck was moved outside the prison walls, the matter of intoxication might have some relevancy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-17\">. Montgomery\u2019s description of Nix\u2019s general aptitude as a drinker of alcoholic beverages was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b574-18\">\u201cWhen Joe Nix \u2014 when I have seen Joe Nix drinking alcohol, he \u2014 he just \u2014 through talk<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ing real loud, his eyes get real bloodshot, he gets acting like a real jolly person, just a jolly, happy-go-lucky person, and as \u2014 the more he gets to drinking, the more ignorant he becomes, and it\u2019s obvious he can\u2019t handle his liquor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b576-12\">. As indicative of the uncertainties involved in the use of specific and general intent, the trial judge in connection with doing something the law forbids did use the term \u201cspecific intent\u201d although later in the charge he stated that the crime itself did not involve specific intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
