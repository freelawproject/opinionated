The District Judge held that to permit the Government to raise the defense envisioned by the statute was the equivalent of the Government subjecting itself to suit under a local compensation system \u2014 an unauthorized waiver of sovereign immunity not contemplated by Congress. He rejected the defense. Disagreeing with these conclusions, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">To bring the problem closer to earth it is one of harmonizing the FTCA and the Louisiana Compensation Act. Under FTCA the tort liability of the Government is extended to tort claims for negligent damage to person or property \u201cunder circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable ... in accordance with the law . . .\u2019\u2019of the place of the tort.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tied as it is to liability of a private actor under local law, the case brings in famed \u00a7 6 of the Louisiana Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">\u00a7 6 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> imposes on the party for whom work is being done by a contractor (or subcontractor) the obligation of paying workmen\u2019s compensation to an injured employee of such contractor/subcontractor. The key is whether in the work at hand the contractor/subcontractor is doing work \u201c. . . which is a part of [the] trade, business, or occupation\u201d of the. party for whom the contracted work is being performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-11\">But while Louisiana, so its courts have many times said, adopted this device as a means of subverting the payment of compensation through the device of impecunious contractors<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, its sig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>nificance here is not in an asserted right by the claimants to recover Louisiana Compensation payments from the Government. Indeed, that is the last thing wished, hoped or prayed for. Rather it is that under Louisiana jurisprudence \u00a7 6 in imposing a vicarious liability for compensation payments clothes that party with the status of a \u201cprincipal\u201d or more descriptively, a \u201cstatutory employer,\u201d so that it will not constitute a sua-ble \u201cthird person\u201d under the provisions of the Act permitting suit by an employer (or his carrier) or an employee where the injury/death has been caused by the negligence of another.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-11\">This immunity to third party suit, presumably the creature of judicial interpretation of \u00a7 6,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> has survived the direct assault of the organized Louisiana plaintiffs bar<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and stands as a lion in the street unless on minute facts the case is outside the \u201cusual, trade, or business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-12\">The significance of all of this here is that since the Government neither had nor was subject to an enforceable obligation to procure Louisiana compensation insurance,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for it to have the Louisiana judge-made \u00a7 6 third party immunity would be, the claimants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>successfully urged below, to afford it the benefits with none of the burdens, Stated another way, their contention is that the \u00a7 6 immunity extends only to principals who are legally required to pay compensation. If that legal obligation is missing, so is \u00a7 6 immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"AH9\">The District Court agreed with this thesis. But as the claimants could not ever recover if this holding was reversed even if they jumped the \u00a7 6 \u201cusual trade business or occupation\u201d hurdle,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the District Court certified this appeal, 28 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1252 which we allowed,</p>\n<p id=\"Aft\">jn reso\u00a1ution of the basic \u00a7 6 problem, the facts can be quickly capsu-]ated&gt; These are eleven jrTCA suits by contractor-employees for injuries<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> sustained from the operation of the Louisiana Army Ammunition plant near Min-den, Louisiana. The plant is a government-owned facility privately operated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>by Sperry Rand Corporation pursuant to a contract with the Ammunition Procurement And Supply Agency of the United States Army (No. DA-11-173AMC-80). Under the contract Sperry Rand hires the employees, prepares and loads the products for shipping, and generally does all jobs necessary to operate the plant. The cost-plus-fixed-fee contract obligates Sperry Rand to maintain workmen\u2019s compensation for the plant employees and the premiums for that insurance are reimbursed by the government as a regular contract expense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Such coverage was obtained and in effect at the time of the accident that resulted in these suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"> If we approach this with literalism the Government cannot prevail. This is so because Louisiana cannot impose on it a legal obligation either to procure compensation insurance or to pay compensation benefits. (See note 8 <em>supra). </em>But this is not the history of FTCA or its generous development by the Supreme Court. That Act is given a broad interpretation to effectuate the legislative aim of putting citizen and national sovereign in tort claims suits on a footing of equality as between private parties within that state.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Nice pieces of casuistry and hypersensitive legalisms are avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Thus, in <em>Indian </em>Towing<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Court considered the Government argument that \u201cthe language of \u00a7 2674 (and the implications of \u00a7 2680) imposing liability \u2018in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances . . . \u2019 must be read as excluding liability in the performance of activities which private persons do not perform. Thus, there would be no liability for negligent performance of uniquely government functions.\u201d Declaring that \u201cwe would be attributing bizarre motives to Congress were we to hold that it was predicating liability on such a completely fortuitous circumstance \u2014 the presence of identical private activity [and there] is nothing in the Tort Claims Act which shows that Congress intended to draw distinctions so finespun and capricious as to be almost incapable of being held in the mind for adequate formulation.\u201d The Court held that the \u201clanguage of the statute does not support the Government\u2019s argument.\u201d The Court rejected literalism and read the private person liability of \u00a7 1346 (see note 2 <em>supra) </em>as being \u201cdesigned to . compensate the victims of negligence in the conduct of governmental activities in circumstances <em>like unto </em>those in which a private person would be liable . . . .\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Next, the Court in <em>Rayonier,</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>limiting sharply some of its pronouncements in the Texas City Disaster Case,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> held that the Government would be liable under vicarious Washington laws for fire fighting derelictions even though there was not like private activity and all usual activity \u2014 that of municipalities\u2014 would be subject to no liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">We have done similarly in Gavagan<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> where, against a similar Governmental assertion that there was no like private activity, we held the Government accountable under FTCA for a land-air-sea rescue search.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Of course, we are not dealing here with interpretations on <em>coverage </em>of FTCA. Rather, it is oh defenses. But we see no reason why in this liability by local standards criteria a like and sensible approach is not given to local defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">This takes us to the Louisiana aim of \u00a7 6 to assure compensation benefits to employees of contractors doing work for others. At bottom, claimants argue that the essence of the statute was to insure the employee \u201ctwo debtors not one.\u201d But one thing that is not intended is double payment of compensation, once by the \u201cactual\u201d employer and once by the \u201cstatutory\u201d employer. Indeed, while pursuit can in the Louisiana codal language be <em>in solido, </em>which is to say against (i) actual employer, (ii) statutory employer or (iii) both, only a single recovery is permitted.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-16\">Of course this objective is accomplished through the unquestioned requirement that Sperry Rand, the contractor, maintain at the Government\u2019s expense workmen\u2019s compensation. Not only was it done in fact, but presumably it was done in accordance with established policies<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> which have the effect of not only relinquishing any claim to Federal territorial sovereignty over lands of the Federal enclave, but carrying out the substantive policies of \u00a7 290 (see note 8 <em>supra) </em>to assure privately-employed workers on Federal projects equal treatment with other industrial laborers in the state. Thus the goals of Louisiana and the United States are mutually met. The workers have the protection in fact,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> that they would have if, in addition to Sperry Rand\u2019s insurer, they would have the direct obligation of the Government. On the other hand, with this assured in fact,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the Government, having seen to it that compensation by the contractor is afforded at the Government\u2019s expense, is, as would be a private Louisiana statutory employer, entitled to the \u00a7 6 immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-17\">The key finally is the existence of adequate insurance required and paid for by the Government. Whether the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>would be the same if the Government contract did not require maintenance of compensation insurance is a matter for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-5\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b143-13\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1346 provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-14\">\n<em>United States as defendant</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9V\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-15\">(b) * * * the district courts * * * shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions on claims against the United States, for money damages, * * * for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHO\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-20\">In addition the liability of the United States is set out in 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2674:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-21\">The United States shall be liable, respecting the provisions of this title relating to tort claims, in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, but shall not be liable for interest prior to judgment or for punitive damages.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b143-22\">.
