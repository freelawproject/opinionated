Mar-rero v. Warden, 483 F.2d 656 (3d Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">On June 19, 1974, the Supreme Court rendered its opinion, reversing the Third Circuit and holding that 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 109 and Section 1103(a) of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1294, barred parole eligibility, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4202, for persons convicted, prior to May 1, 1971, under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d), Warden v. Marrero, 417 U.S. 653, 94 S.Ct. 2532, 41 L.Ed.2d 383 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">In view of the holding in <em>Marrero, </em>we are compelled to determine that the district court did not reach the correct con-elusion. Thus, the judgments of this court entered on February 6, 1974, are now vacated and set aside. It is further ordered that the orders heretofore entered in the district court shall be vacated and set aside and the petitions in the district court shall be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-14\">These causes are remanded to the district court for proceedings in accordance herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
