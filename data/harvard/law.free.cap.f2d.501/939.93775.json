Mills contends that he was deprived of his constitutional right of access to the courts since: (1) correspondence from his out-of-state, A.C.L.U. attorney had been opened outside his presence ; and (2) an official letter from the clerk of court notifying him of the entry of an order denying his eoram nobis petition had been negligently delayed for a period of over three months, a delay which he claims was particularly onerous in view of his appointed counsel\u2019s default and the fact that there was no law library at Atmore. Mills concludes that the defendants thereby violated the injunction entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama in Lake v. Lee, 329 F.Supp. 196 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-20\">The district court dismissed the suit on the grounds that it presented no question cognizable under section 1983. Looking first at the complaint concerning tampering with the letter from Mills\u2019 attorney, the court concluded that the injunction entered in Lake v. Lee, <em>supra, </em>did not cover this action since it did not pertain to out-of-state attorneys. Shifting its attention to Mills\u2019 allegation of negligent processing of the notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>judgment, the court held both that such negligence was outside the ambit of the <em>Lake </em>injunction and that the allegation did not reach constitutional proportion.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">In view of the fact that the court did not have the benefit of two recent Supreme Court decisions (Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974) and Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974)) delineating the constitutional m\u00ednimums for procedures employed in the processing of prisoner mail, the judgment of dismissal must be vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of these decisions. In the course of its actions upon remand and after permitting such factual development as it may deem necessary, the court should specifically resolve Mills\u2019 allegation that defendants\u2019 negligent processing of his mail impaired his right of appeal from the denial of coram nobis. Similarly, the court should dispose of Mills\u2019 alternative, inconsistent claim of entitlement to punitive damages against his appointed counsel for counsel\u2019s alleged failure to perfect that appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
