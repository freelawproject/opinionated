Defendant does not contest its liability under the policy for $10,000, but strenuously asserts that plaintiff is only entitled to a waiver of premiums on the remaining $40,000 of the face amount. The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rendered final judgment for the plaintiff for $50,000 and defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Plaintiff, a former airline pilot, became totally and permanently disabled May 7, 1970. Under provisions of the group life insurance contract (No. 221416-06) issued by defendant he was entitled to the \u201camount of insurance in force on the Employee\u2019s life on the day he became Permanently Totally Disabled.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Other provisions of the policy provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATv\">The total amount of life insurance actually in force at any time on the employee is shown on the Braniff International Employee Insurance Statement and consists of term insurance or paid-up insurance or a combination thereof * * *. If the employee has not, at anytime, purchased paid-up insurance, his amount of insurance will consist of term insurance only.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Term Insurance is defined in the policy as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">The amount of term insurance in force on an employee at any time while he is insured for term insurance will equal the sum of the Basic and Additional amounts, if any, shown on the Statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">The plaintiff contends that the clear wording of the policy provisions requires a finding that he is entitled to the full $50,000 of term insurance in force at the time he became Permanently Totally Disabled. The company, however, points out that the disability provision appears on a page containing the following endorsement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-14\">The provisions set forth on this page shall apply only to amounts of term insurance excluding amounts of Additional Insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">The determination of what amount plaintiff is entitled to rests upon the construction of this endorsement. It is clear that without the endorsement plaintiff would be entitled to the entire $50,000 \u201camount of insurance in force\u201d as per the waiver clause. The insurance company contends that this endorsement limits plaintiff\u2019s recovery to only the Basic term amount ($10,000), excluding the Additional term amount ($40,000). The District Court disagreed; a Florida District Court of Appeals has disagreed;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we must disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">The District Court reached its conclusion by determining that the language of the endorsement creates an ambiguity. With this we agree and note the language of the endorsement might be construed consistent with plaintiff\u2019s claim. \u201cTerm insurance\u201d was defined by the company as the sum of the basic and additional amounts. \u201cAdditional insurance\u201d is nowhere defined in the policy ; further, there could be several types of additional insurance as this group policy included, in addition to term life insurance, paid-up life insurance, disability income insurance, and medical insurance. Had the insurance company wished to clearly exclude recovery of the additional term insurance, it could easily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>have worded its exclusionary endorsement to apply \u201conly to amounts of <em>Basic </em>term insurance excluding amounts of Additional <em>term </em>insurance.\u201d [emphasized words inserted].</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The failure to do so leaves the meaning of the endorsement ambiguous. Whether \u201cadditional insurance\u201d as used in the endorsement refers to additional term insurance or one of the other coverages of the group policy is not made clear. Such an uncertainty is within the concept of ambiguity,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which ambiguity under long standing rules of construction we must resolve against the insurer. Bergholm v. Peoria Life Insurance Co., 284 U.S. 489, 492, 52 S.Ct. 230, 76 L.Ed. 416 (1932); Looney v. Allstate Insurance Co., 392 F.2d 401, 405 (8th Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Another permissible construction would recognize that the employee has two types of possible life insurance coverage, term and paid-up. The payment clause of disability provision provides that the company will pay \u201cthe amount of insurance in force on the Employee\u2019s life\u201d which had been previously defined as the sum of term and paid-up insurance. The endorsement thus can be seen as excluding recovery of paid-up insurance in the event of disability but not negating the recovery of the full $50,000 Myre had in term insurance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The insurance company raises one further argument. It argues that this was a negotiated contract and thus any ambiguity should not be resolved against it and in favor of the insured. This claim is entirely devoid of any factual support in the record, whatever its merits as a legal argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-13\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-10\">.

(emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b665-14\">WEBSTER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A8yE\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-15\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-16\">In order for the District Court and the panel majority to perceive an ambiguity in the insurance policy it was necessary to ignore certain fundamental and well established rules of contract construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-17\">In testing for ambiguity, the entire contract must be reviewed as a whole to ascertain the interest of the parties;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it is presumed that every condition was intended to accomplish some purpose;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a court will attempt to give meaning and effect, if possible to every word and phrase in the context in determining the meaning thereof;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it is not permissible to lift one sentence from the remainder of the policy and attach a peculiar meaning to that sentence standing alone;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u201cwherein some confusion appears, or an apparent discrepancy or repugnancy exists between the various policy expressions, the court will attempt to harmonize such provisions and seek a construction which will give reasonable force and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>effect to all of such provisions without conflict.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Where the same words are used in different clauses of the insurance contract, they will ordinarily be understood to have been used in the same sense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In my view the total disability provisions of the certificate of insurance, read as a whole and in accordance with the foregoing rules of construction, can have but one meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Originally Braniff paid the cost of a \u201cbasic\u201d amount of term life insurance and employees were permitted to carry \u201cadditional\u201d amounts of term life insurance under the policy at their own expense. In 1971 Braniff took over the entire cost but the distinction continued in relation to provisions in event of total disability of the insured. Thus, \u201cterm insurance\u201d is defined in the policy as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"alh-dedup-1\">The amount of term insurance in force on an employee at any time while he is insured for term insurance will equal the sum of the <em>Basic </em>and <em>Additional amounts, </em>if any, shown on the Statement. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The first section relative to \u201cLife Insurance for Employer \u2014 Total Disability Benefits\u201d is preceded by the legend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">The Provisions set forth on this page will apply to amounts of term insurance <em>excluding </em>amounts of additional insurance. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The <em>next </em>section, labeled \u201cLife Insurance for Employer \u2014 Extension of Insurance During Total Disability\u201d, is preceded by the legend:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">The provisions set forth on this page will apply <em>only </em>to amounts of additional insurance. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">The policy thus provides for two kinds of term life insurance \u2014 basic and additional. \u201cAdditional\u201d is included in the definition of term insurance, but is expressly excluded from the application of the first section on total disability. The next section on total disability is made applicable <em>only </em>to additional insurance. Read in this light, and giving meaning to each clause, the separate treatment for \u201cbasic\u201d and \u201cadditional\u201d term life insurance is clear. In the event of total disability before age 60, the employee is entitled to receive \u201cthe amount of insurance in force on the employee\u2019s life\u201d but \u201cexcluding amounts of additional insurance\u201d. The next section provides that as to \u201cadditional insurance\u201d the insurance coverage will be extended from date of total disability, and premiums thereon waived, until the death of the employee, at which time the amount of \u201cadditional insurance\u201d in effect will be payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-15\">These integrated and inter-related provisions admit of no other reasonable interpretation. In order to find an ambiguity the majority must (1) hypothe-cate that \u201cadditional insurance\u201d, although used only in the context of <em>life </em>insurance could mean some other type of benefit and (2) totally ignore the section which expressly deals with treatment of \u201cadditional insurance\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This, is my view, distorts in an impermissible manner a logical and unambiguously stated plan of life insurance with total disability benefits. If \u201cadditional insurance\u201d meant something other than term life insurance, and <em>all </em>of the term insurance was to be paid out at time of total disability, as plaintiff contends, then the next following section providing for extended coverage and waiver of premium as to \u201cadditional insurance\u201d in case of total disability would have no meaning or application at all.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While in cases of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>doubtful meaning the construction most favorable to the insured will be adopted, \u201c[t]his canon of construction * * * furnishes no warrant for avoiding hard consequences by importing into a contract an ambiguity which otherwise would not exist, or, under the guise of construction, by forcing from plain words unusual and unnatural meanings.\u201d Bergholm v. Peoria Life Ins. Co., 284 U.S. 489, 492, 52 S.Ct. 230, 231, 76 L.Ed. 416 (1932). As we said in Terry v. New York Life Ins. Co., 104 F.2d 498, 504 (8th Cir. 1939):</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Even though we might think that the meaning of the challenged words used by the insurer could have been better or more accurately expressed, that would constitute no justification for disregarding the plain import of appropriate language.
