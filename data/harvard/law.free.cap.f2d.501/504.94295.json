Specifically, Petitioner, was charged with exposing its employees to hazardous airborne concentrations of lead. The Act\u2019s general purpose and its \u201cgeneral duty\u201d clause<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> evidence a clear Congressional purpose to provide employees a safe and nonhazardous environment in which business, including commercial and industrial, operations, is to be conducted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b559-17\">The complaint of the Union about unsafe working conditions triggered an investigation of plant conditions and monitoring of the working environment present in the Petitioner\u2019s plant by personnel of the Secretary of Labor\u2019s office. The airborne lead concentrations within the plant varied depending on the type of industrial operation being performed in certain work areas, but the results obtained were adequate to indicate that long-range preventative engi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>neering practices should be instituted within a six-month period, preceded by immediate administrative controls of approved respirators, rotation of employees, and any other appropriate measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The complaint and investigation, with its monitoring tests, resulted in a citation being issued pursuant to \u00a7 658(a). The citation was contested by Petitioner, causing the matter to be forwarded to the Commission for processing, which includes an opportunity for hearing. After a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge on March 1, 1972, found that airborne concentrations of inorganic lead at American Smelting and Refining Company\u2019s Omaha plant presented \u201ca recognized hazard that [was] likely to cause, if continued unabated, death or serious physical harm to employees, and as such, constituted a violation of Section 5(a)(1) [the general duty provision] of the Act.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (the Commission) directed review and on August 17, 1973, upheld the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s finding of a violation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Chairman Moran vigorously dissented. The Petitioner filed this appeal for review of the Commission\u2019s order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Respondents are the Commission; Peter J. Brennan, Secretary of Labor; the United Steelworkers of America; and Local 461 of the Union. We sustain the Commission and deny relief to the Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The Petitioner, a New Jersey corporation, operates a lead refining plant in Omaha, Nebraska, and employs 390 to 400 workers there. Receiving lead bullion in solid blocks, the plant produces commercial grades of refined lead and lead alloys by separating impurities from the lead. Recovery of the impurities is also accomplished where possible. The Omaha plant, one of the Petitioner\u2019s lead refineries, was purchased before 1910 and has since produced refined lead and lead alloys.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">Three representatives of the Secretary visited Petitioner\u2019s Omaha plant on June 30, 1971, to evaluate the presence of harmful concentrations of airborne lead.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plant\u2019s personnel director and plant manager fully cooperated and conducted a tour of the plant. Of the 390 to 400 workers, approximately 95 work in areas that may be affected periodically by high levels of airborne concentrations of lead. Of these 95, 60 work in the lead smelting area, 15 in the retort area (a furnace operation), 10 in the cupel area (another furnace operation), and 10 to 12 in the crane operating area. These are the areas of higher concentrations of airborne lead.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">While inspecting the plant, the Secretary\u2019s representatives \u2014 Charles Adkins, an OSHA Regional Hygienist from Kansas City; Gail Adams, an OSHA Compliance Officer from Omaha; and Howard Ludwig, a United States Public Health Sanitary Engineer from Salt Lake City \u2014 observed that all but one of the employees had their company-supplied respirators hanging around their necks, rather than properly wearing them over their noses and mouths. After the tour of the plant, the representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tives decided to take air samples of the melting, cupel, retort, and crane areas. Respondent chose seven employees and placed an air sampling pump on each employee. An air sampling pump is a device employed by industrial hygien-tists to collect contaminants in the air that an individual would normally breathe. Each air sampling pump consisted of a small pump powered by a battery, a rotometer to calibrate the air flow rate through the apparatus, a flow stabilizer device, a transport tube, and a membrane filter or monitor sender from which the sample of air contaminants is taken. The pump and battery were attached to a belt \u25a0 around the worker\u2019s waist, the flow stabilizer device was connected to the pump, the tube was connected to the pump, and at the end of the transport tube was connected the membrane filter, which was clipped to the worker\u2019s lapel as near the breathing zone of the nose and mouth as possible. The representatives activated the pumps on each of the seven workers, and the pumps were in place for approximately two hours and fifty-seven minutes. This period of time was sufficient to allow each worker to complete at least one complete cycle of his normal work throughout the plant. While the pumps were in place, none of the seven tested employees was wearing his respirator. A pump was not attached to the one worker who was wearing his respirator and working in a large kettle that melts lead. This worker had been chipping solid lead from a dry kettle with an air hammer, and since this job exposes workers to a very high level of lead contaminants, the worker wisely was wearing his respirator. The Secretary\u2019s representatives fairly did not sample the air in this work area.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The pumps were carefully calibrated for air flow at the Public Health Service Laboratory in Salt Lake City and at the plant, and each membrane filter was inserted in the apparatus at the plant. The filters were removed and sent to Salt Lake City to analyze them for the lead contaminant. The following results were obtained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">Employee's Name_ His Working Area_ Concentration of Lead<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\">Minard Furnace 0.16 mg/M?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">Mikinovie Furnace 0.22 mg/M!?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-12\">Marion Floor 0.10 mg/M?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-13\">Alley Crane 0.25 mg/M?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-14\">Zandijas Retort 2.70 mg/M:?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-15\">Gulizia Retort (cupel) 0.75 mg/M:?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-16\">Rojas_ Retort (cupel) 2.85 mg/M'<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-24\">The Respondents throughout these proceedings have maintained that the industry recognizes that any lead concentration above .2 mg/M3 constitutes a hazardous condition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Petitioner counters by claiming generally that air sampling is inferior to periodic biologi-. cal testing of each employee\u2019s blood and urine and acting upon those results with medical care and transfers to work areas of lesser lead concentrations. Mainly because of its biological monitoring of each employee, the Petitioner argues that there was not a recognized hazard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>in the plant causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">On July 7, 1971, the Kansas City, Missouri, Regional Administrator cited the Petitioner for a serious violation of \u00a7 5(a)(1) of the Act. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(1). The citation contained the following description of the alleged violation :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">Airborne concentrations of lead significantly exceeding levels generally accepted to be safe working levels, have been allowed to exist in the breathing zones of employees working in the lead melting area, the retort area, and other working places. Employees have been, and are being exposed to such concentrations. This condition constitutes a recognized hazard that is causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The citation allowed Petitioner 60 days to complete \u201cthe implementation of feasible engineering controls to reduce the concentration of the airborne contaminants\u201d and proposed a civil penalty of $600.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">On March 1, .1972, Administrative Law Judge Brennan filed an extensive report of 47 pages. He found that .2 mg/M3 of airborne lead concentration is generally recognized by the industry as the safe level, that a \u201crecognized hazard\u201d existed in violation of the general duty clause due to concentrations of airborne lead greater than .2 mg/M3, and that the Petitioner\u2019s \u201cpreventive program\u201d including biological monitoring, the required use of respirators, and transfers of employees with high levels of lead concentration in blood and urine samples did not negate a finding of a recognized hazard. Having found a violation of the general duty clause, the Administrative Law Judge required the Petitioner to complete feasible engineering controls to reduce the concentration of airborne lead contaminants to .2 mg/M3, or below within six months from the entry of a final order. He also approved the Secretary\u2019s assessment of a $600 fine, specifically finding it was a civil penalty and constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">On August 17, 1973, Commissioner Van' Namee, joined by Commissioner Cleary for the majority, upheld the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s factual findings and interpretation of the law with one exception. The Commission held that neither it nor the administrative law judges have the authority to rule on the constitutionality of provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">The Petitioner first argues that the work conditions at its Omaha lead refinery did not constitute a \u201crecognized hazard\u201d in violation of the general duty clause. This argument has two facets: (a) the legislative history of the Act purportedly indicates that the general duty clause does not apply to hazards that only can be detected by testing devices; and (b) the Petitioner has a program of protective measures that prevented any likelihood of harm to its employees from airborne concentrations of lead. We reject both arguments and conclude that there is substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole to. support the Commission\u2019s factual findings and no error of law appears.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Relying on limited though express legislative history, the Petitioner argues that the general duty clause was not intended to cover hazards that can be detected only by testing devices. Since the airborne concentrations of lead in excess of .2 mg/M3 were discovered by air sampling pumps instead of the human senses, Petitioner argues that no recognized hazard existed. In short, \u201crecognized\u201d only means recognized directly by human senses without the assistance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>any technical instruments. The Petitioner relies on a statement made by Representative Steiger on December 17, 1970, just prior to the House roll call enacting OSHA. Representative Steiger said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">The conference bill takes the approach of this House to the general duty requirement that an employer maintain a safe and healthful working environment. The conference-reported bill recognizes the need for such a provision where there is no existing specific standard applicable to a given situation. However, this requirement is made realistic by its application only to situations where there are \u201crecognized hazards\u201d which are likely to cause or are causing serious injury or death. Such hazards are the type that can readily be detected on the basis of the basic human senses. <em>Hazards which require technical or testing devices to detect them are not intended to be within the scope of the general duty requirement </em>* * *. It. is expected that the general duty requirement will be relied upon infrequently and that primary reliance will be placed on specific standards which will be promulgated under the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABO\">116 Cong.Rec, 11899 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 1970) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Although Representative Steiger\u2019s statement is unequivocally clear concerning his interpretation of \u201crecognized,\u201d it does not follow that his interpretation is correct; nor is it indicative of the entire Congress\u2019 understanding of \u201crecognized.\u201d We must review the legislative history in further detail.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">The Administration bill introduced by Senator Dominick required \u201cemployers to maintain the workplace free from \u2018readily apparent\u2019 hazards.\u201d 3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 5177, 5222, S.Rep.No. 91-1282 (91st Cong. 2d Sess.1970 (hereinafter 3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.

Senator Javits added these remarks in Senate Report No. 91-1282 for the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-10\">As a result of this amendment the general duty of employers was clarified to require maintenance of a workplace free from \u201crecognized\u201d hazards. This is a significant improvement over the Administration bill, which requires employers to maintain the workplace free from \u201creadily apparent\u201d hazards. That approach would not cover non-obvious hazards discovered in the course of inspection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 5222 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">The House of Representatives also debated the wording of the. general duty clause. Representative Daniels proposed that the clause require employers to \u201cfurnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which is safe and healthful.\u201d Committee Print, Legislative History of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 92d Cong. 2d Sess. at 726-27, 833 (hereinafter Legislative History). Representative Steiger proposed the \u201creadily apparent\u201d language identical to the Administration bill; however, Representative Daniels, changing his position, proposed the \u201crecognized hazards\u201d language of the Senate bill and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-13\">Our modified General Duty * * * differ [s] in important respects from the General Duty provision in the Steiger substitute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-14\">The first difference is that my amendment protects against \u201crecognized\u201d hazards while the Steiger substitute protects only against \u201creadily apparent\u201d ones.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-15\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u2022x- * * i am afraid that \u201creadily apparent\u201d used in the substitute means apparent without investigation, even though a prudent employer would investigate under the circumstances. A danger, in other words, may be recognized as such in the industry, but may not be apparent to an employer who is ill-informed and does not choose to investigate the danger of the situation. That is not sufficient protection for employees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Legislative History at 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The House replaced \u201creadily apparent hazards\u201d with \u201crecognized hazards.\u201d 3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 5229, Conference Report No. 91-1765, Statement of the Managers on the Part of the House (1970). On December 17, 1970, Representative Steiger explained what he thought \u201crecognized hazards\u201d meant, defining it not to include \u201c[h]azards which require technical or testing devices to detect them * * 116 Cong.Rec. 1189 (daily ed. Dec. 17, 1970) (quoted more fully <em>supra,).</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The House went on to pass the bill with the words \u201crecognized hazards,\u201d as originally amended in the Senate. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">No court has specifically interpreted the meaning of \u201crecognized hazards.\u201d In Brennan v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission and Vy Lac-tos Laboratories, Inc., 494 F.2d 460 (8th Cir. 1974), this court held that \u201crecognized hazards\u201d include \u201can employer\u2019s actual knowledge [and] the generally recognized knowledge of the industry as well.\u201d That case was remanded to the Commission to factually determine whether Vy Lactos Laboratories, Inc., had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d so as to constitute a <em>recognition </em>of a hazard. However, Vy Lactos Laboratories, Inc., did not interpret \u201crecognized\u201d any further. Also National Realty and Construction Company, Inc. v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, 489 F.2d 1257, 1265 n. 32 (D.C.Cir. 1973) (hereinafter <em>National Realty), </em>did not expressly decide this issue and only held that \u201crecognized\u201d may take into account the standard of knowledge in the industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">In this case, the Commission by a divided vote has first expressed its view as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-12\">It is also clear that Congress by rejecting the readily apparent hazards test and accepting the recognized hazards test in its place intended that non-obvious hazards be within the scope of the general duty requirement. There can be no question that non-obvious hazards include those that can only be detected by instrumentation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">Chairman Moran dissented. He first said that Senator Javits\u2019 views, including his approach to \u201cnon-obvious hazards,\u201d were expressed two months before enactment of OSHA and before a conference committee report which \u201creconciled the differing versions of the general duty requirement.\u201d Chairman Moran placed heavy reliance on the fact that \u201c[n]o Member of the House of Representatives or the Senate, at anytime subsequent to the conference committee report took issue with Representative Steiger\u2019s view that the general duty clause would not cover hazards requiring technical or testing devices to detect them.\u201d (footnote omitted). The fact that no senator or representative expressed a view on Representative Steiger\u2019s comments does not necessarily compel a conclusion that Congress agreed with Representative Steiger.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-14\">We find Petitioner and Chairman Moran\u2019s views unpersuasive. Looking to the words of the Act itself, \u201crecognized hazards\u201d was enacted instead of \u201creadily apparent hazards.\u201d From the commonly understood meanings of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>terms themselves, \u201crecognized\u201d denotes a broader meaning than \u201creadily apparent.\u201d The remarks of Senator Javits demonstrate that non-obvious hazards were intended to fall within the meaning of \u201crecognized hazards.\u201d Further, the House earlier had the opportunity to accept Representative Steiger\u2019s proposal of \u201creadily apparent,\u201d but chose not to. Undoubtedly, it is clear that Representative Steiger desired that the general duty clause be limited to \u201creadily apparent hazards.\u201d We think that it is also clear that Representative Steiger according to his comments on December 17, 1970, interpreted \u201crecognized hazards\u201d to mean apparent only to the human senses. In short, we conclude that Representative Steiger interpreted \u201crecognized hazards\u201d in the same manner that he would have interpreted \u201creadily apparent hazards,\u201d but that Congress decided otherwise by enacting the words \u201crecognized hazards\u201d with its meaning in the context of Senator Javits\u2019 and Representative Daniels\u2019 statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">We further think that the purpose and intent of the Act is to protect the health of the workers and that a narrow construction of the general duty clause would endanger this purpose in many cases. To expose workers to health dangers that may not be emergency situations<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and to limit the general duty clause to dangers only detectable by the human senses seems to us to be a folly. Our technological age depends on instrumentation to monitor many conditions of industrial operations and the environment. Where hazards are recognized but not detectable by the senses, common sense and prudence demand that instrumentation be utilized. Certain kinds of health hazards, such as carbon monoxide and asbestos poisoning, can only be detected by technical devices. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1918.83(a) and 1910.93a. The Petitioner\u2019s contention, though advanced by arguable but loose legislative interpretation, would have us accept a result that would ignore the advances of industrial scientists, technologists, and hygienists, and also ignore the plain wording, purpose, and intent of this Act. The health of workers should not be subjected to such a narrow construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Chairman Moran also eased his dissent on the rationale that the use of the general duty clause for the type of alleged violation in this case circumvents the spirit and purposes of the Act, which places much reliance on the promulgation of specific standards. Cf. Brennan v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, 491 F.2d 1340, 1343 (2d Cir. 1974). Pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(a), the Secretary must promulgate specific standards for the safety and health of employees. That section establishes a complex procedure whereby the Secretary may request the appointment of ah advisory committee to promulgate a specific standard; interested persons may object to the standard; a hearing may be held; the Secretary may promulgate, modify, or revoke the specific standard; and an employer can be granted a temporary order or variance from the specific standard. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(b). The Secretary under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(c)(1) also has the authority to enforce emergency temporary standards if the health of employees is subject to grave danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">Chairman Moran argues that the Secretary\u2019s use of the general duty clause renders the variance procedure unavailing, allows little advance warning to the employer of what the Government considers a safe and healthful working place, establishes standards on an ad <em>hoc </em>basis, renders the use of the temporary emergency standards provision a nullity, and extends the general duty clause beyond its limited purpose for coping with hazards that are obvious and admitted by all concerned and for which no specific standard has been promulgated. This argument is based on sounder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>grounds than the legislative history contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">Generally, Chairman Moran\u2019s analysis is sound. The Act does focus on the promulgation of specific standards <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and an elaborate procedure involving all interested parties in fairly arriving at those standards. Though the ancient ills of the lack of safety in certain industries are well documented,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> this Act is admittedly a new approach to insuring a safe and healthful working place. In the past, our law, both state and federal, has placed primary reliance on tort liability in an attempt not only to compensate victims, but also to encourage employers to provide a safe and healthful working environment. <em>National Realty, supra, </em>489 F.2d at 1260 n. 6. The Act wisely understands that the correction of unsafe conditions requires a transition period in which standards may be agreed upon. Section 655(a) specifically provides for a two-year period in which the Secretary had to promulgate specific standards according to a national consensus. The use of the general duty clause ordinarily should not be available when a\u2019 specific standard has been promulgated. Also, in an emergency situation, the Secretary can proceed under the procedure of an emergency temporary standard. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 655(c)(1). Yet we think that the general duty clause should be available at least under the facts of this case in which a specific standard was under review and in which the Petitioner was allegedly violating a health standard that had been recognized nationally for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">In this case, we cannot agree with either Petitioner or Chairman Moran that the general duty clause should not have been available for citing the alleged violation. On April 28, 1971, the entire Act became effective. On May 29, 1971, the Secretary published in the Federal Register the standard of .2 mg/M3 of maximum allowable concentrations of airborne lead particles, 36 Fed. Reg. 10466 (1971), which became effective August 27, 1971. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.-93, Table G-2. The Secretary\u2019s representatives inspected the Omaha plant on June 30, 1971; the citation was issued on July 7, 1971; and a pretrial hearing was held on September 28,1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Chairman Moran claims that the Secretary \u201cjumped the gun\u201d in issuing this citation under the general duty clause. That observation may well be apt in certain cases, but not in this one. The evidence in this case strongly demonstrates that .2 mg/M3 of airborne lead has been a nationally recognized standard of safety for years. Although the Secretary could be said to have \u201cjumped the gun\u201d in relation to enforcing a specific standard under consideration as a violation of the general duty clause, he certainly did not \u201cjump the gun\u201d in recognizing that the national standard of .2 mg/M3 of airborne lead has been recognized as the safe level. This is not a situation in which a new danger is involved or in which there is any serious debate on a national standard of industrial health.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">A brief understanding of the hazards of industrial lead poisoning is necessary to place this issue in perspective. In short, lead has been known for years as a heavy metal poison and in excess affects a myriad of bodily functions. The Senate Report of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee states that \u201c [occupational diseases which first commanded attention at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution are still undermining the health of workers\u201d and that \u201c[substantial numbers, even today, fall victim to ancient industrial poisons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>such as lead and mercury.\u201d 3 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News at 5178 (1970). Dr. Robert A. Kehoe <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in a chapter titled \u201cIndustrial Lead Poisoning\u201d in a recognized book in this field, Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology, Frank A. Patty, editor, stated in 1962 that severe forms of industrial lead poisoning are seen less frequently now in the United States, but that partial and temporary disability among a large number of workmen continues in a wide variety of industrial occupations. He wrote that few types of occupational exposure to lead offer insurmountable or even serious obstacles to modern engineering methods and that technical skills applied to the problem of production should also be applied to the problem of safe specifications for exposure to lead contamination.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Dr. Kehoe at trial and in his chapter explained that the danger of industrial lead poisoning is mainly through inhalation. He further said in his chapter that \u201cit is feasible to express the general magnitude of the lead hazards of a plant * * * in terms of the lead content of sufficient numbers of properly selected air samples, and to anticipate with reasonable accuracy the results of exposure thereto.\u201d <em>Patty, supra </em>at 950.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In his chapter written in 1962, Dr. Kehoe further stated that .2 mg/M3 of lead in the air of workrooms is the accepted standard at which \u201ccases of disabling lead intoxication will not occur among the men who work many years on the usual schedule and in such workrooms, and cases of questionable or mild intoxication will occur only rarely, if at all.\u201d <em>Patty, supra </em>at 952. Dr Kehoe, the Petitioner\u2019s expert, also stated at trial: <em>\u201c.2 </em>is the thing that we\u2019re quite prepared to accept. This is our standard in this country, .2.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> He further said that \u201c[i]f it was an average higher than this, I would regard it as unsafe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">Although Petitioner makes certain other arguments concerning the .2 mg/M3 lead standard, no expert of Petitioner contended that this standard was not the acceptable one for the industry. In fact, the record shows that two of Respondents\u2019 experts at trial, seven experts through their books introduced at trial by Respondents (including Dr. Kehoe), and one of Petitioner\u2019s experts (Dr. Kehoe) agreed that .2 mg/M3 of lead is the acceptable nation-wide standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-13\">The air sampling tests conducted on the seven employees demonstrated that pumps attached to five employees showed concentrations of lead greater than .2 mg/M3. Rojas\u2019 sample was 14% times greater than .2 mg/M3 of lead, Zandijas\u2019 sample was 13% times greater, Gulizia\u2019s sample was 3% times greater, and Alley and Mikinovie\u2019s samples were slightly higher. The expert testimony, including Dr. Kehoe\u2019s, indicated that air sampling is a scientifically acceptable manner of detecting hazardous concentrations of airborne lead. In light of the heavy concentrations of airborne lead detected,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>we </em>think that any discrepancies in testing as advanced by Petitioner must fail. There was con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>siderable evidence to prove that there was a nationally recognized standard of .2 mg/M3 of lead and that this standard was violated by Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">In light of the above evidence, we reject the position that use of the general duty clause in this case destroys the spirit and purpose of the Act. Though a specific standard for concentration of lead was under consideration at tfye time the Secretary cited the Petitioner for the alleged violation, the standard for airborne lead relied upon by the Secretary had been recognized for years. Dr. Kehoe\u2019s chapter agreeing on that same .2 mg/M3 of airborne lead was written in 1962. Lead poisoning is an ancient ill, not a new danger for which new standards and technology would have to be developed. The general duty clause should still be available for use by the Secretary, when an employer is violating a standard of health concerning a well-known industrial ill that is recognized as a hazard by the industry through its own nationally accepted criteria, even though a specific standard is under consideration at the time the Secretary cites an employer for violation under the general duty clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The Petitioner\u2019s second major contention is that it has instituted many protective measures that prevent the likelihood of harm to the employees. We agree with the Administrative Law Judge that Petitioner\u2019s program has not reduced the likelihood of serious physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Petitioner does have a program to attempt to eliminate the dangers of lead poisoning. It has spent over $400,000 since 1960 on various engineering controls to reduce airborne lead contamination. Industrial hygienists and physicians are employed. Respirators are supplied, but admittedly are awkward to wear and seldom used.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Most important in the Petitioner\u2019s view is a reliance on a biological monitoring program, which involves the testing of each employee\u2019s blood and urine to determine the concentration of lead. Dr. Nelson, the Petitioner\u2019s Director of Environmental Sciences, stated that this testing is \u201ca far more effective way of securing the safety of employees.\u201d Dr. Kehoe prefers biological monitoring, since air measurement \u201cis not a standard which we regard as crucial in relation to the individual.\u201d For as yet unexplained reasons, differing individuals can be exposed to higher amounts of lead without becoming ill. The candid Dr. Kehoe, however, had this exchange with the Administrative Law Judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">[Administrative Law Judge]: Which procedure, Doctor, in your opinion would most greatly detect a change in the lead environment of a workplace, biological sampling or air sampling ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-11\">[Dr. Kehoe]: Either one. I don\u2019t know that there is too much to choose from in this. But what I, as a physician am concerned with is John Doe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-12\">Although a carefully conducted biological monitoring system might prevent the likelihood of lead poisoning harm to employees, we think it was more than reasonable for the Secretary to rely on the effective and efficient air sampling method. In addition, the disadvantages of the biological sampling system are demonstrated in this case. About 10% of employees tested from 1970-71 were found to have unsafe levels of lead concentration in their blood and urine,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> yet generally these employees were not tested frequently enough, according to Petitioner\u2019s expert testimony, to ascertain whether they should be changed to another working area in the plant. In fact, the plant manager had no direct involvement with the monitoring plan. The plant\u2019s physician did not \u201cfollow up\u201d with what happened to individual employees who had high concentrations of lead in their blood and urine. Further, disruption of employees\u2019 working habits and the plant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>operation would result from transferring employees to new positions within the plant where exposure would be lessened. Most significantly, the record does not indicate that any employee was transferred due to high levels of lead concentration discovered by biological monitoring. The biological monitoring did not eliminate or even reduce the hazard ; it merely disclosed it. Although testing of the blood and urine is the most important test for each individual, the use of air sampling tests is the most efficient and practical way for the Secretary to check for a hazard likely to cause death or serious physical harm to the workers as a group. We think it also the most efficient manner for the employer to check the existence of a hazard. We do not intend to minimize the importance of the biological monitoring program; obviously, medical examinations of the individual are the most significant manner of assuring safety of the <em>individual </em>worker, provided that remedial steps are taken at the first indication of a hazardous concentration of lead accumulating in the blood and urine of a worker. The evidence showed that each human responds differently to exposure to lead. Yet we think that the safety of the workers and the practicality of detecting unsafe levels of airborne lead concentrations are best served by the air sampling method. Workers should not be subjected to hazardous concentrations of airborne lead; biological monitoring should complement an industrial hygiene program for clean or at least saf\u00e9 air, but is not a substitute for a healthful working environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">In addition, the Petitioner knew or should have known that the respirators would not reduce the likelihood of serious physical harm to the employees. During the unannounced tour of the plant by the Secretary\u2019s representatives, only one employee was properly wearing his respirator. The reasonable inference is that employees rarely used the awkward and uncomfortable respirators. It was reasonably foreseeable to the Petitioner that the respirators would not be properly worn.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We hold that there was adequate evidence on the record considered as a whole that the biological monitoring program would not prevent a likelihood of harm to employees.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">The Petitioner also argues that the $600 assessed pursuant to 29 U..S.C. \u00a7 666(b), though labeled a civil penalty, is punitive in nature and an unconstitutional abridgment of Petitioner\u2019s right to criminal enforcement only through the courts.
