Frank alleged in his motion and supporting affidavit that the guilty plea had resulted from promises made by his attorney to Frank and members of his family that a bargain would be struck with the judge and prosecutor for a prison term of only two years. Frank further alleged tliat his attorney\u2019s instructions were to \u201cremain quiet about this at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court denied the motion without a hearing after referring Frank\u2019s papers to a magistrate for scrutiny in light of the plea transcript. We affirm/</p>\n<p id=\"b228-17\">In Bryan v. United States, 492 F.2d 775 (5th Cir. 1974), this court dealt <em>en band </em>with the problem of determining when a federal prisoner should be ''afforded an evidentiary hearing in order to collaterally attack his guilty plea on the basis of alleged promises or inducements. Although we observed that \u201c[n]o guilty plea which has been induced by an unkept plea bargain can be permitted to stand,\u201d 492 F.2d at 778, we likewise recognized that Section 2255 authorizes the district court to refuse an evidentiary hearing when \u201cthe files and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief\u201d upon his allegations. We noted that a highly relevant subject of inquiry is the plea transcript itself. 492 F.2d at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-18\">In this case, as in <em>Bryan, </em>the district court conducted a scrupulous' hearing under Rule 11, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, at the time of plea entry. The court asked Frank specifically whether anyone had made him any promises concerning the sentence that might be imposed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Frank, like Bryan, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201ctestified without conflict or equivocation that no plea bargain had been made or promised, directly or indirectly.\u201d 492 F.2d at 780. We find this factor controlling in this appeal, and leave to other cases the determination of prisoner motions in the face of records silent on plea bargaining or indicative of specific motives to disclaim plea bargaining.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-10\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (1970).
