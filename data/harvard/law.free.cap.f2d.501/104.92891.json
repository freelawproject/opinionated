S. Department of Labor. The district court dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. 363 F.Supp. 428. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Plaintiff alleges that she filed a complaint with the Wage and Hour Division in October, 1969, which resulted in her being paid $445.22 in back wages; and a second complaint in September, 1970,. which resulted in her being paid $445.74 in back wages. On March 1, 1972, she was dismissed from her employment for the assigned cause of \u201cnumerous consumer complaints,\u201d but in fact, so the plaintiff alleges, because of her two complaints to the Wage and Hour Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The plaintiff makes no claim to a fixed or ascertainable term of employment. Under Louisiana law, in the absence of such a claim, she would have no right of action for dismissal whether with or without cause. 23 La.L.Rev. 553, 556 and cases there cited. Instead the plaintiff bases her claim upon the following provision of section 15(a)(3) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">\u201c(a) ... it shall be unlawful for any person\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">\n<em>\". . . . . .</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">\u201c(3) to discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee because such employee has filed any complaint or instituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter, or has testified or is about to testify in any such proceeding, or has served or is about to serve on an industry committee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">The plaintiff relies on Judge Rubin\u2019s scholarly opinion in Fagot v. Flintkote Company, E.D.La.1969, 305 F.Supp. 407. She acknowledges that the following earlier decisions have reached the opposite conclusion, namely, that there is no private right of action for damages for an employer violation of section 15(a)(3) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Powell v. Washington Post Co., 1959, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 374, 267 F.2d 651, cert. den., 360 U.S. 930, 79 S.Ct. 1449, 3 L.Ed.2d 1544; Bonner v. Elizabeth Arden, Inc., 2 Cir. 1949, 177 F.2d 703; Britton v. Grace Line, Inc., S.D.N.Y.1962, 214 F.Supp. 295. Thus, among cases construing the Fair Labor Standards Act, the only one supporting the plaintiff\u2019s claim is <em>Fagot, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-13\"> The Act provides for its enforcement by both criminal and civil proceedings. Those provisions include criminal penalties for violation of section 15, civil rights of action for unpaid overtime and for unpaid minimum wages, and injunctive relief. See 29 U. S.C. \u00a7 216. It seems evident to us that Congress did not see fit to provide any right of action for damages for wrongful discharge of an employee. Powell v. Washington Post Co., <em>supra, </em>holding that no such right of action should be implied, was decided more than fourteen years ago, and Congress has not yet seen fit to provide such a remedy. After all, the courts\u2019 duty in the premises is simply to make effective the purpose and intent of Congress. We conclude, that under the circumstances, there is not such necessity for effectuating the congressional purpose as to place on the courts either the duty or the privilege to add a remedy to those provided by Congress. See J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 1964, 377 U.S. 426, 433, 84 S.Ct. 1556, 12 L.Ed.2d 423; Breitwieser v. KMS Industries, Inc., 5 Cir., 1972, 467 F.2d 1391, 1394; Love v. Temple University, E.D.Pa.1973, 366 F.Supp. 835, 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-14\">The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b159-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b159-16\">JOHN R. BROWN, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AkZ\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b159-17\">I respectfully dissent. This case falls squarely under the reasoning first adopted and still followed by the Supreme Court in Texas &amp; Pac. Ry. v. Rigsby, 1916, 241 U.S. 33, 39, 36 S.Ct. 482, 484, 60 L.Ed. 874, 877. There the Court implied a civil remedy from the Federal Safety Appliance Act, thus allowing the employee to recover damages: \u201cA disregard of the command of the statute is a wrongful act, and where it results in damage to one of the class for Whose especial benefit the statute was enacted, the right to recover the dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>ages from the party in default is implied, . . <em>Id. </em>at 39, 36 S.Ct. at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The language and its meaning are clear, precise, and eminently sensible. The Supreme Court has since followed its own dictate and applied the \u201cimplied remedies\u201d theory to a wide range of statutes involving such areas as voting rights,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> property rights,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a rivers and harbors act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> securities,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and railway labor legislation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The most recent pronouncement of the Supreme Court on implied rights continues forthrightly to hold that \u201cprivate rights of action may be implied in favor of the intended beneficiaries of an Act in order to enforce compliance with its provisions.\u201d Bolger v. Laventhol, Krekstein, Horwath &amp; Horwath, D.C.1974, 381 F.Supp. 260.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-16\">This same theory has, not suprisingly, been received and securely anchored \u2014though sometimes wrongfully rejected as the majority does here<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u2014 in the judicial practice of this Court. Gomez v. Florida State Employment Service, 5 Cir., 1969, 417 F.2d 569.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Gomez </em>reinforced this Court\u2019s acceptance of implied remedies for two reasons: (i) the intended beneficiaries of an act are the most logical guardians of their own rights, <em>id. </em>at 575-576, and (ii) the im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>plied remedy insures the more complete enforcement of an act by allowing private individuals to help police its violations. <em>Id. </em>at 576. See Drew v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 5 Cir., 1973, 480 F.2d 69.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The carefully plotted history of implied remedies more surely encompasses the claim at hand. Plaintiff Martinez filed complaints against her employer with the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor; she was then fired and alleges that her discharge violated \u00a7 15(a)(3) of the FLSA, thus making the discharge wrongful. There can be no doubt that the purpose of the FLSA was and is to protect interstate employees by denying their employers the tool of toying with workers\u2019 wages when battling in the competitive market.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">It is in the light of that purpose \u2014 a protection of the interstate employee\u2014 that the entire statute should be interpreted. Ms. Martinez is clearly a beneficiary under the Act; as an interstate employee she sought relief under Act for minimum wages. Because of the exercise of this right, she alleges, she was discharged. Such a discharge is prohibited by \u00a7 15(a) (3) of the FLSA and Ms. Martinez as the victim of the discharge should be implied a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-17\">The Court is quick to conclude that because some remedies are laid out in the FLSA, all others are precluded. Such a conclusion can only be reached after apply the principles of the implied remedies theory as accepted by the Supreme Court, (notes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 <em>supra), </em>and this Court, (see <em>Gomez, supra).</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In sum, these principles dictate that the relief under an act is in no way limited unless: (i) the act contains an express statement that an action is to the exclusion of all others, or (ii) the intent of the Act indicates a limited type of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-18\">Neither of these exceptions exist in Ms. Martinez\u2019s case. The FLSA expressly provides for the following causes of action: (i) criminal liability, 29 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 216(a);<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (ii) all injunctive relief to be sought by the Secretary, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 211(a), \u00a7 217;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and (iii) an employee claim for unpaid minimum wages or overtime wages, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 216(b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> None of the actions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>couched in language excluding all other remedies. The intent of the Act also fails to limit Ms. Martinez\u2019s claim. To the contrary, it implies her claim by purporting to protect interstate employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">We recognize, as the Court points out, that this statute appears to present exclusive remedies by the precision with which it lists certain remedies. But the Court can surely not declare that Congress meant to ignore the most obvious and glaring violation of the Act \u2014 the wrongful dismissal of an employee seeking the protection of her rights under the Act. The Court apparently wipes this most important employee right from the Act merely because the Act specifically fashioned a claim for the violation of another employee right \u2014 the right to minimum and overtime wages, (see note 14 <em>swpra,).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Ms. Martinez\u2019s claim in no way diminishes the powers of the Secretary to police violations of the Act. The Secretary, after all, sits in a position as agent for all interstate employees with the task of insuring that all employees reap the benefits of the Act \u2014 even those too timid, unknowing, or threatened to bring their own action. Those employees wishing to sue in his or her own behalf can only lighten the burden of the Secretary and increase the effectiveness of the Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">To deny plaintiff an implied civil remedy is to deny Congress its full intent in enacting the FLSA.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-6\">. See Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 1969, 393 U.S. 544, 89 S.Ct. 817, 22 L.Ed.2d 1. The Court stated that an act created for the purpose of protecting a certain class of citizens would invest in members of that class an implied right to sue for its enforcement; such an act would most surely fail to achieve its purpose if the beneficiaries were not allowed to privately seek its enforcement. 393 U.S. at 557, 89 S.Ct. 817.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\">. See Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 1968, 392 U.S. 409, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189. Upholding an 1866 federal property rights statute, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1982, the Court implied a civil remedy on the basis that a right had been declared by the statute \u2014 a right for which the courts would provide a remedy in spite of a lack of an enforcement method stated in the statute. 392 U.S. at 414 n. 13, 88 S.Ct. 2186.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\">.

Civil actions are proper by persons within the protected class of the statute who were harmed by its violation. <em>Id. </em>at 202, 88 S.Ct. 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">In <em>Republic Steel </em>the Court stated that as long as the congressional intent is clear, \u201cappropriate remedies may be fashioned even though they rest on inferences. Otherwise we impute to Congress a futility inconsistent with the great design of this legislation.\u201d 362 U.S. at 492, 80 S.Ct. at 890.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b160-11\">.
