Where a city railroad company, by authority of the corporation of Hew York, and with the sanction of the Legislature, has constructed a , railroad, and is running cars thereon through the streets of the city, the public have nevertheless the right to drive upon and across their track; but 1. not so as to interfere with the proper business of the company.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b322-7\">2.

The company is entitled to the unrestricted use of its rails for the progress of its cars, within that limit of speed which the law allows them, and the driver of any other vehicle, being unnecessarily on the track, is bound to exercise greater care, than if upon the common pavement, to see that an approaching car is not impeded, and if through negligence or willfulness in this respect, a collision ensues, he should not have damages against the company, even though the servants of the latter are also in fault.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b322-9\">(Before Hoffman, Slosson and Pierrepont, J.

It was admitted that the Eighth avenue is 100 feet wide, and that the carriageway on each side of the railroad track is twenty feet wide; and there was no evidence that the car was driven faster than the usual and legal rate of speed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-6\">The defendants moved for a dismissal of the complaint upon the grounds (among others): 1st. That there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the defendants; and, 2d. That the plaintiff was himself in fault, and the injury was caused by his own negligence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-7\">The motion was denied, and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-8\">After the cause had been summed up by the respective counsel, the Judge charged the jury, among other things, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b323-9\">\u201c The fact that the plaintiff was driving on the railroad tracks of the defendants, was not such a wrong or fault on his part as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>will prevent his recovering in this action, if he was injured by the carelessness or negligence of the driver of the car, without any negligence on the part of the plaintiff, which contributed to produce the injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-4\">\u201c If an injury is produced by the concurring negligence of the party injured, and of a third person, the one who is injured cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-5\">\u201cIt was the plaintiff\u2019s duty to turn off the track, so as not to interfere with the cars making their trips, or making them within the time required by the articles which prescribe how often they shall be run.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-6\">\u201c But if the driver of the car should see a cart on the track, and that the driver of the cart did not mean to turn off, the driver of the car would have no right to run deliberately into or against the cart. For such improper conduct of a person on the track, other redress should be sought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-7\">\u201c If there was negligence in the plaintiff in the management of his wagon in turning off the track which contributed to the collision, and if there would have been no collision had there been no carelessness in that respect on his part, then he cannot recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-8\">\u201c But if he would have been run into if he had not turned ofij and if there was no negligence in the mode of managing his cart which contributed to the injury, and if it was produced by the negligence of the driver of the car, the plaintiff may recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-9\">\u201cAlthough the plaintiff did not look back, and therefore did not see the car (if you shall believe that to be the fact), yet if you believe that by the exercise of ordinary care on the part of the driver of the car, either by slackening his speed or applying his brakes, there would have been no injury, the defendants would be liable, if there was no other fault on the part of the plaintiff than mere negligence in not seeing the car until it was too late to get out of its reach, so as to avoid being injured by it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-10\">The Judge also instructed the jury in relation to the damages, and the rules by which they were to be governed in determining the same, in case they should find for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-11\">The defendants\u2019 counsel then requested the said Justice to charge the jury; (among other propositions,)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ALJ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u201c That from the fact of the plaintiff having driven his wagon upon the railroad track in front of the cars, and continuing thereon without any apparent necessity, he was bound to use more care and diligence, and keep a better look-out than he would have been if he had not been on the track, that he might avoid any collisionwhich the said Justice declined to do, on the ground that the charge as made, properly presented that matter to the jury, and the defendants\u2019 counsel then and there excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-5\">To the charge as made, no exception was taken. The jury found a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $250, damages. The defendants appealed from the judgment entered on the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-6\"><em>Mott &amp; </em>Cary, for the defendants (appellants).</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-7\">1. The question of carelessness or negligence becomes a question of law when there is no dispute about the facts, and a non-suit should be ordered when the proof, as a matter of law, is not sufficient to establish such negligence or carelessness, as to warrant a recovery against the defendants. <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>The New York Central R. R. Co., </em>22 Barb. R., 575; <em>Willetts </em>v. <em>The Buffalo and Rochester R. R. Co., </em>14 id., 585; <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>The Utica and Schenectady R. R. Co., </em>5 id., 337; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>6 Hill R., 592; <em>Hatfield </em>v. <em>Roper, </em>21 Wend. R., 615; <em>Brownell </em>v. <em>Flagler, 5 </em>Hill R., 282; <em>The Tonawanda R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Munger, </em>5 Denio R., 255, 268; 4 Comst. R., 359; <em>Haring </em>v. <em>The New York and Erie R. R. Co., </em>13 Barb. R., 9.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-8\">II. The Court should have nonsuited the plaintiff on his own proof:</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-9\">1; Because there was no proof whatever to show that the defendants or their agents were guilty of carelessness, negligence or fault.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-10\">2. The defendants were on their own track, using it in the ordinary way, as they had a right to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-11\">3. The plaintiff by his -own acts caused or brought about the collision he complains of, and which caused the injury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-12\">III. Before the plaintiff can recover, he must establish these two propositions:</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-13\">1. That the defendants\u2019 agents were guilty of negligence. This is charged in the complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ae1g\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>2. That the plaintiff was without negligence and without fault. <em>(Spencer </em>v. <em>The Utica R. R. Co., 5 </em>Barb., 338. And see cases above cited.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-5\">IY. After the plaintiff had rested his case, there was nothing in the defendants\u2019 testimony that added any strength to the plaintiff\u2019s case. But on the other hand the defense was, as a question of law, made much stronger, and the Court should have charged the jury as a matter of law to find a verdict for the defendants; because:</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-6\">1. The railroad was made by and belonged to the defendants absolutely for the purpose and use for which it was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-7\">2. The city had granted to the defendants the use of that part of the avenue and streets where the track was located, which grant was afterwards recognized and confirmed by an act of the Legislature. (\u00a7 3, chap. 140, Laws of 1854.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-8\">3. The defendants afterwards organized under the General Railroad Act. That the grant of the city and the acts of the Legislature have given the defendants all the power and rights of railroad companies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-9\">4. The corporation had a right to grant the use of so much of the street for railroad purposes. <em>(Drake </em>v. <em>Hudson River R. R. Co., </em>7 Barb. R., 508.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-10\">5. Having such right vested in them, any other use of the track would be an infringement and an usurpation, and consequently the plaintiff was, under the circumstances, on the track without right; and the injury he received not being caused by any willful or intentional act of the defendants or their agents, or by any gross carelessness on their part, the judgment ought not to be sustained. <em>(Lane </em>v. <em>Cranbee, </em>12 Pick. R., 177; 11 East. R., 61; 6 Cow. R., 191; 2 Pick. R., 621; <em>Pluckwell </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>5 Carr. and Payne, 375.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-11\">Y. The Judge erred in not charging the jury as requested by defendants\u2019 counsel in each request.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-12\">The requests of the defendants\u2019 counsel were in every respect in accordance with the well-settled principles of law; and if the Judge had so charged the jury, the verdict would have been for the defendants.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b326-13\"><em>Chauncey Shaffer, </em>for the plaintiff and respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>I. The nonsuit was properly refused, because a clear case of negligence was made out against the defendants; and for the further reason, that if there was any doubt upon the subject, the whole matter was a question of fact for the jury. (7 Cow. R., 202; 4 Wend., 423; 7 Barb., 271.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATb\">II. The exceptions taken to the refusal of the Judge to charge are not well taken, because the Judge had already clearly and explicitly charged on those requests, so far as the law would permit him to charge, in favor of the defendants. (See the case of <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>The New York Central Railroad, </em>decided at the November Term of the Court of Appeals, November Term, 1857. See also <em>Heegan </em>v. <em>The Eighth Avenue Railroad Company, </em>15 N. Y. R., 380.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-6\">The Court of Appeals have also decided (not officially reported,) that it is not negligence <em>per se </em>to drive a team oh a city railroad, where the cars are propelled by horse-power. <em>(Heegan </em>v. <em>The Eighth Avenue Railroad Company, supra.)</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b327-7\">By the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"Ant\">Slosson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac\">\u2014We are inclined to think, that the motion for a nonsuit might properly have been granted, as the evidence introduced to show negligence on the part of the defendants was very faint, and probably was quite as pertinent to establish negligence on the part of the plaintiff, as of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">But however this may be, we think the Court should have charged the first proposition, submitted by the defendants\u2019 counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">The Judge had charged, that if the plaintiff was not guilty of any greater negligence, than in not seeing the car until too late to avoid the collision, still if the driver of the car, in the exercise of ordinary care, by slackening his speed or applying his brakes, could have prevented it, the defendants would be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">The defendants\u2019 counsel then requested the Court to charge, that from the fact of the plaintiff having driven his wagon upon the railroad track in front of the cars, and continuing thereon without any apparent necessity, he was bound to use more care and diligence, and keep a better look-out, than he would have been if he had not been on the track, that he might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>avoid any collision, which proposition the Judge declined to charge on the ground that the charge as already made properly presented that matter to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">The charge as made, was that it was not negligence in the plaintiff, which would excuse the defendants, that the plaintiff did not see the car in time, the proposition which the defendants\u2019 counsel requested the J udge to charge was, that from the unnecessary and voluntary position in which the plaintiff had placed himself upon the defendants\u2019 track, he was bound to keep a better look-out, than if he had not been on the track. If this proposition is correct, and if the plaintiff\u2019s not seeing the car in time, was in consequence of his not keeping a proper look-out, then it is apparent that the charge was wrong, or that the proposition requested, should have been also charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">We think the proposition embodied in the request is a sound one. The public have a right, undoubtedly, to drive upon and across the track, but not so as to interfere with the proper business of the company, and if an individual sees fit to run his carriage or wagon upon the rails, he is bound to exercise more care than he would in driving upon the common pavement to avoid collision. Other vehicles may turn out to avoid him, coming or going either way, but a car can turn neither to the right nor left, and if the rule contended for by defendants\u2019 counsel be not true, and if the charge of the Judge be correct, then if the driver of a vehicle sees fit to place himself in front of a car in motion, and willfully to slacken his own speed so as to delay the car, and impede its progress, and restrict its speed within the time allowed by law, he could recover damages in case of a collision, if the driver of the car, in the exercise of ordinary care, either by retarding his own speed or by applying his brakes, could have prevented the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We think such a rule would place our city railroad companies at the mercy of every obstinate or reckless driver in the town, and would lead to disturbances and collisions innumerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The true rule is, that the company is entitled to the unrestricted use of its rails, for the progress of its cars, within that limit of speed which the law allows them; and that as between them and the driver of any other vehicle who may be upon their track, in front of one of their cars, the latter, being unne<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>cessarily there, must exercise more care than he would if he were upon a common pavement, to see that an approaching car is not impeded, and if through negligence or willfulness on his part in this respect, a collision ensues, he should not have damages against the company, even if the latter are also in fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">We cannot say that if the request had been charged the verdict would have been as it is. We think it might have been the other way, and, therefore, feel bound to direct a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
