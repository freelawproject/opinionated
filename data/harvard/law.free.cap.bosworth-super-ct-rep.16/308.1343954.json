He is clearly liable for the quarter\u2019s rent due November 1st, 1857; but not for the fourteen days following. <em>{Martin </em>v. <em>Black, </em>9 Paige, 643.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Judgment must be entered for the plaintiff as stipulated in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
