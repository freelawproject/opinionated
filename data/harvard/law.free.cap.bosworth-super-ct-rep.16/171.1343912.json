Poppe, William Poppe &amp; Henry Schultz, composing the firm of Poppe &amp; Co. It comes before the Court on an appeal by the defendants, from a judgment against them, for the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, entered on the report of a referee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-10\">The complaint alleges a sale and delivery by the plaintiff to the defendants, on the 29th of August, 1855, of 51 tons, 18 cwt. 2 qrs. and 18 lbs. of St. Domingo Logwood; and on the thirtieth of the same month, of 33 tons, 3 cwt. 2 qrs. and 4 lbs. of St. Domingo Logwood, of the value and at the price of $20 per ton, <em>\u201c </em>which the defendants then and there undertook and promised to pay in cash,\u201d but have neglected to do, although often requested to do so; and prays judgment for $1,702.11, with interest from the 30th of August, 1855.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-12\">The answer denies, formally, the several allegations of the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-13\">On the trial before the referee it appeared, that in August, 1855, the plaintiff was the owner of the logwood in question; when he bought (as well as when he contracted to sell it to the defendants), it was afloat; proper entries having been made at the custom-house, to put it in bond. The plaintiff purchased it with the intention of exporting it to Stockholm, in the ship <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>St. Andrew, and had caused the proper withdrawal entries, to enable him to do so, to be made at the custom-house.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-4\">The St. Andrew not being of sufficient capacity to take all of it, he authorized Herman Manny, a broker, to sell what she could not carry (viz.: the logwood in question).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-5\">Under this authority the 'broker contracted to sell it to the defendants, part on the twenty-ninth, and the residue on the thirtieth of August.

To which ruling of the referee, admitting the same in evidence, the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>The signature of \u201cHerman Manny\u201d to them, is printed, not written.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-5\">He testified, that he delivered contracts to each party, those \u201cdelivered to defendants were counterparts\u201d of the above, \u201c except the word bought, in place of the word <em>sold; </em>and that these notes expressed the contract agreed upon between the parties.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-6\">It further appeared that the defendants, expecting a delivery of the logwood, had engaged the \u201c Augusta and Emma,\u201d and the \u201c Fosca Helena,\u201d then lying at pier 8, North River, to take, the former fifty, and the latter thirty tons, and ordered the log-wood to be sent alongside of those vessels, or to the pier at which they lay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-7\">A custom-house order was delivered to the defendants, with a view to enable them to obtain a withdrawal of the logwood from bond. The custom-house officers refused to act upon it, on the ground that no logwood then appeared on its books, as belonging to the plaintiff. The plaintiff was notified of the difficulty, and personally or through his clerks promised to obviate it, but did not do so, although he was frequently urged to do it, and as frequently renewed his promise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-8\">By the thirtieth, all the logwood had been sent to pier 8 and weighed, and some part of it put on board the Augusta and Emma, and the Fosca Helena.

The referee admitted the evidence, \u201creserving\u201d (as the case states) \u201cthe question on the objection.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-17\">The referee found and reported as facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-18\">\u201cThat in August, 1855, the plaintiff was the owner of the logwood in question, and authorized his broker Herman Manny, to sell it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-19\">\u201c That under this authority the wood was sold to the defendants, in two lots, on the twenty-ninth and thirtieth of August, it then being afloat.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-20\">\u201c That after the sale had been made, the plaintiff\u2019s agent, by direction of the defendants, caused the logwood to be landed on the pier No. 8 North River, alongside of two vessels called the Augusta and Emma, and the Fosca Helena, and it was then delivered to the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201c That freight for the logwood was engaged by defendants on these vessels, a portion of the wood was carried on board the vessels, and a part of it actually taken to Europe in each.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-5\">His conclusions of law were:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">1. \u201cThat the delivery of the logwood in question by the plaintiff to the defendants was actual and complete so as to vest the title in defendants, and make them liable in this action for goods sold and delivered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">2. \u201c That the-testimony relating to the efforts to withdraw the wood from the custom-house is immaterial and should be excluded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">3. That the plaintiff is entitled to judgment against the defendants for the price of the wood.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-9\">To which conclusions of fact and of law the said defendants duly, severally and separately excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-10\">The referee, in an opinion accompanying his report, after stating summarily the facts and that the logwood was lost, proceeds to say, \u201c and the question now is, upon which party shall this loss fall? And the answer to this question turns upon the point whether there was in fact a delivery of this wood to the defendants, and an acceptance of it by them ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-11\">Without attempting any review of the many adjudications bearing upon this mooted question, I think enough is shown by the testimony taken before me, to warrant the conclusion that both parties regarded the delivery as actual and treated it as complete. At the time of the sale the wood was afloat. The bulky and heavy character of the article precluded the idea of a manual delivery, and the sale note stipulates that the delivery was to be made alongside the vessel. The vendor naturally inquired where the purchaser desired the wood should be sent. The defendants gave the proper direction, and it was sent there accordingly; and it was then I think delivered to the defendants so as to become their properly.\u201d . .... \u201cWhat more could be required in the way of delivery? If A sells a horse to B and B directs that he shall be sent to C\u2019s stable and he is sent there, is not the delivery complete ? So in this case, if the defendants direct the place to which they wish the wood sent, and it is sent, it is delivered to them and becomes absolutely their property. The vendor when he parts with the thing sold cannot repossess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>himself of it again, nor can the vendee when his own directions are complied with set up a non-delivery, although he may ever so much desire to be rid of his bargain. I do not see any reason for the assertion that the plaintiff, when the sale was made, undertook to enable the defendant to withdraw this logwood from the bonded warehouse, so that the defendants might have the benefit of the drawback on its exportation. There is no agreement to that effect in the sale note; no allegations are contained in the answer to -which any such proof could be pertinent, and the testimony so far as it relates to the efforts to withdraw the wood from the custom-house, and which testimony was objected to by the plaintiff's counsel, is immaterial and should be excluded. It is a hardship doubtless to the defendants to require them to pay for wood they never had any benefit from, but the hardship to the plaintiff would be still greater to compel him to bear the loss he was in no wise instrumental in occasioning. He sold the wood and delivered it at the place indicated by the defendants, thenceforth it became their property and was at their risk. An inundation that swept it from the pier, or a fire that consumed it, or any other of the many casualties by which it might be destroyed, could not in any way affect the purchaser\u2019s obligation to pay for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-6\">\u201cI think the plaintiff is entitled to judgment for the value of the wood, with interest from the commencement of the action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-7\">Judgment was entered on the report, and from that judgment the present appeal is taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-8\"><em>Mortimer </em>Porter, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-9\">I. The referee erred in finding as matter of fact that \u201cafter the sale, the plaintiff\u2019s agent, by direction of the defendants, caused' the logwood to be landed on pier 8 North River alongside of the two vessels, and that it was then delivered to the defendants.\"</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-10\">1st. The logwood had already been landed on the pier when the contract of sale was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-11\">2d. There is no evidence that the defendants ever directed plaintiff to deliver the wood alongside these vessels. The only evidence on the subject is that of Mr. Maas, who says, \u201che thinks Mr: Manny gave him the names.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>3d. Mr. Manny was agent for making the sale, and nothing more. He had no authority to direct about the delivery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-5\">4th. Although the defendants engaged freight for logwood by the two vessels, they never directed the vessels to take in this wood; and none of it would have been taken on board, except for the interference and orders of plaintiff\u2019s agents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-6\">5th. Defendants never accepted the delivery or exercised any acts of ownership over the wood. From beginning to end, they declined to receive it until the custom-house papers were fixed so that they could legally export it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-7\">6th. The plaintiff retained the possession, custody and control of the wood.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-8\">7th. The wood was not weighed off to defendants. Maas says it was weighed after it was landed on the pier, and a bill sent to defendants, but the weighmaster is not produced, and. there is no proof of what the weight was. ' , ,; -</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-9\">II. There was no delivery to the defendants, actual and complete, so as to vest the title in them. There must be an\", acceptance by the buyer, as well as a delivery by the seller. (2 R. S., 136, \u00a7 3; <em>Outwater </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>6 Wend., 397; <em>Schindler </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>1 Comst., 261; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>19 Barb., 416; <em>Dutihl </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>1 Dallas, 171; <em>Baldey </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>2 Barn. &amp; Cres., 37; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Bristolli, </em>id., 511; Story on Sales, \u00a7\u00a7 276 to 279; Addison on Contracts, 2d Am. Ed., 1857, pp. 240 to 245; <em>Maberly </em>v. <em>Sheppard, </em>3 Moore and Scott\u2019s Rep., 443; <em>Tempest </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>3 Barn. and Alderson, 681; <em>Ives </em>v. <em>Polak, </em>14 How. Pr. R., 411.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-10\">III. The referee erred in admitting the sale notes in evidence. The exception to its admission was well taken. (2 R. S., 136, \u00a7 3; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Shields, </em>26 Wend., 341; <em>James </em>v. <em>Patten, 2 </em>Seld., 9, 12, 15.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-11\">IV. If the sale notes are excluded, then there is no evidence of any agreement to sell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-12\">V. The referee erred in excluding the testimony relating to the efforts to withdraw the wood from the custom-house. This evidence was pertinent to the question of delivery. It shows that both parties at the time acted upon the understanding that something more was to be done before the sale would be complete. No goods intended to be re-exported shall be reladen before an entry is made, with bond and affidavits, &amp;c., and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>permit given. (1 U. S. Statutes at large, p. 45, \u00a7\u00a7 32, 34, 35; p. 182, \u00a7 5; p. 413, \u00a7 6, vol. 3, 486; vol. 4, 410 to 442 ; <em>Gillespie </em>v. <em>Durand, </em>3 E. D. Smith, 531.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-4\">VI. The referee cannot on the trial admit evidence <em>de lene esse, </em>and then reject it in his decision. <em>(Allen </em>v. <em>Way, </em>3 Code Reporter, 243.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-5\">While he says that the sale notes are of no importance, they in fact contain all the evidence of the terms of the bargain to be found in the case. \u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-6\">VII. The judgment founded on the report of the referee should be reversed, and the case sent to a new referee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-7\"><em>J. G.. Vose, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-8\">I. The contracts of sale were clearly proved by the testimony in the cause, and the referee was justified in his conclusion of fact in regard to such contracts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-9\">1. The witness Manny testified that he was a broker, and employed by the plaintiff to sell the logwood in question, and \u2022 that he did sell the same to the defendants upon the terms mentioned in the \u201c bought and sold notes \u201d which he delivered to the parties respectively.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-12\">2. The bought and sold notes state clearly the terms of the contracts, and furnish the best evidence thereof. - \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-14\">Whether they were \u201csubscribed\u201d in the way and manner required by the Statute of Frauds is not material, as that question does not arise in this case. They were signed or executed in sufficient form and manner to bind the parties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-15\">3. The acts of the defendants prove that they regarded themselves as purchasers of the logwood under the above contracts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-16\">H. The testimony shows a delivery to and acceptance of the goods by the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-17\">I. By the terms of the contract, the logwood was to be delivered alongside of certain vessels, to be named by the defendants. The vessels were -afterwards named and designated, and the logwood was delivered alongside of them, according to the contract. <em>(Dawes </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>8 Term R., 330; <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Solomonson, </em>3 Bos. and P., 582.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-20\">\u2022 2. .The defendants engaged freight in those vessels for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>logwood, and in pursuance of such engagements or contracts of affreightment, part of the logwood was actually taken on board with their knowledge and approbation, and was carried away in them. This was a virtual acceptance of the goods. <em>(Vincent </em>v. <em>Germond, </em>11 Johns., 313 (283); <em>Outwater </em>v. Dodge, 6 Wend., 397; <em>Sprague </em>v. Blake, 20 id., 61; <em>McKnight </em>v. Dunlop, 1 Seld., 537).</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-5\">3. The plaintiff also, at the defendants\u2019 request, gave them the usual order for the goods at the custom-house, which was accepted and acted upon by the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-6\">4. Nothing remained to be done by the plaintiff to render the delivery complete.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-7\"><em>a. </em>It was not necessary, nor did the parties contemplate, that the wood should be again weighed. It had been weighed by the proper weighmaster, and his returns of the parcels separately delivered to the defendants with the bill for the logwood, and no objection was then made that it should be reweighed. There was no ground for the subsequent demand to have it weighed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-8\"><em>b. </em>The pretended difficulty in clearing the goods was not substantial or material. It was merely a neglect of the customhouse officer to report that all the wood had not been shipped, as previously intended. It was not a breach of any duty which the plaintiff owed. It did not interfere with the defendants\u2019 possession of the wood. There was no proof of any damage occasioned by it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-9\">III. By the acceptance of the logwood the contract was so far executed that the defendants could not rescind the same. Certainly not without first returning and delivering back to the plaintiff that part of the logwood which had been taken aboard of the vessels, which they never did nor in any manner offered to do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-10\">If the plaintiff neglected to do what the contract required of him, the damages, if any, might perhaps be the subject of recoupment, but no such duty or damage is alleged or claimed in the answer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-11\">IV. The referee decided correctly in admitting the \u201c bought and sold notes \u201d in evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-12\">They were the best evidence of the terms of the contract, and were sufficiently executed to entitle them to be read. It is not \u25a0necessary that a written contract should be actually \u201csubscribed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>by the party to be bound thereby \u201d to make it valid, except in cases where the question arises under the Statute of Frauds, and even in those cases the contract must be received in evidence, in order that the Court may determine the question whether it is or is not properly subscribed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-5\">It is not a question of the admissibility but of the effect of evidence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-6\">V. The judgment of the referee should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b188-7\">By the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"Aoh\">Pierrepoht,</author>\n<p id=\"A9s\">J.\u2014The sale note, in this case, was not <em>\u201c </em>subscribed by the parties to be charged thereby,\u201d and the contract for the sale of the logwood is void by the Statute of Frauds (2 R. S., 136, \u00a7 3), unless it appears that the defendants accepted and received part of the goods \u201c or the evidences,\u201d or some of them at least.</p>\n<p id=\"A9p\">It is claimed by the plaintiff- that the delivery of his order upon the custom-house was a delivery of the goods, and that when the defendants received the order they accepted that as a delivery of the goods; and furthermore, that as some of the logwood actually went on board the vessels in which the defendants had engaged freight for.it, and as the rest of it was placed upon the dock where the defendants might have taken possession of it, and shipped it, that the delivery was complete and bound the defendants to pay for the wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">The evidence would perhaps warrant the conclusion that the defendants might have taken actual possession of the logwood; and that they might have shipped it, provided there had been no interference on the part of the government; but it is entirely clear that until the plaintiff changed his entry, the defendants could not withdraw the wood or ship it without violating the laws of the United States. (1 U. S. Statutes at large, pp. 45, 182, 413; vol. 3, p. 486; vol. 4, pp. 410 to 442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">A delivery by the plaintiff of an order, which did not give the defendants any legal control over the property mentioned in the , order, is not, in contemplation of law,- a delivery of such property. If the defendants had agreed to accept the plaintiff\u2019s order upon the custom-house as a delivery of the goods named in the order, and to take their own risk of getting them withdrawn from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>the custom-house or of shipping them without any formal withdrawal, then' the defendants might be bound; but the evidence warrants no such conclusion, and it is plain that no acceptance of such delivery was contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">We think the report of the referee erroneous, and that the judgment must be set aside, with costs to abide the event, and that the order of reference should be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
