Where a person, desiring to borrow money, applies for a loan to one who has, at the time, no money, but who has an accepted bill of exchange which can be discounted at the legal rate, and the holder of such bill, solely with a view to accommodate the applicant, consents to procure the bill to be discounted, and permit him to use the proceeds until the bill matures, the latter agreeing to pay the face of such bill at its maturity; and thereupon, in pursuance of such arrangement, the holder of the bill procures it to be discounted at the legal rate, and pays over to such applicant a part only of such proceeds, but all that he then desires to receive, and holds the residue until the maturity of the bill, subject to the call of such borrower; and the borrower, at the time of receiving the money, gives his note, payable when such discounted bill matures, for the sum so received and the sum paid on discounting said bill, such note is not usurious, although the sum included in it for the discount of the bill amounts to more than legal interest on the sum actually received by the person for whose benefit and accommodation the bill was procured to be discounted, there not having been any intention of the borrower to pay, or of the lender to reserve, more than seven per cent interest on the sum loaned.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b9-20\">2. The terms of the contract entitled the borrower to the use of the whole proceeds of the bill until its maturity; it was not the lender\u2019s fault that he did not have the use of the whole proceeds, and the lender should not be deprived of -the benefit of the contract because he held a part of the proceeds subject to the call of the borrower, instead of the borrower\u2019s holding them without any occasion to use them, or without making actual use of them until the maturity of the draft.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b10-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>3. Although such a transaction will be held usurious when it is shown to have been intended as a shift or device to evade the statute, and to reserve more than seven per cent on the amount actually intended to be, and, in fact, loaned, yet, when the transaction was, in the honest intent of the parties, such as the terms of such a contract import, it will not be held usurious because the borrower did not take and use the whole proceeds of the discounted bill, he having no occasion to use the whole proceeds, and they being held for him, and at all times subject to his order during the period for which, by the terms of the contract, he was entitled to use them.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b10-5\">(Before Hoffman, Slosson and Pierrepont, J.

It prayed, as further relief, on allegations contained therein, that the defendant Moultrie should execute and deliver to the plaintiff his bond and his mortgage of certain described real estate as security for the payment of so much of said note as remained unpaid, and that he should be, in the meantime, enjoined from disposing of or incumbering the real estate, which it was sought to compel him to mortgage to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b10-10\">The allegations of the complaint are stated more in detail in 1 <em>JBosw.

Moultrie was the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, and the plaintiff was daily in the defendants\u2019 office and kept his check-book in their drawer; Palmer, one of the defendants, applied to the plaintiff, in the latter part of April, and stated that the defendants expected a draft upon them from an Insurance Company, and did not know how they were to raise the money to meet it. James De Gray, another friend of the plaintiff, was also in want of money at this time. The plaintiff, wishing to help them out of their difficulty, and having a draft from California (for $15,000, in amount), accepted by Duncan, Sherman &amp; Co., which would mature on the 15th of July following, offered to get the draft discounted, if he could, with a view to let the defendants and De Gray use the proceeds of the draft until its maturity, when he expected to be paid the face of the draft. The plaintiff got the draft discounted, and the discount, at legal rates, amounted to $227. On the 3d of May, the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>ants received $1,500 out of the proceeds of the draft; and the plaintiff expected them to receive, in all, some six thousand dollars of the proceeds. The draft appears to have been originally discounted for the accommodation of De Gray and the defendants, with each of whom the plaintiff was on the most friendly terms. Of this money De Gray received six thousand dollars, and there is no satisfactory evidence that the plaintiff used any portion of the proceeds of the draft; and the evidence is positive that he did not want the draft discounted for his own use. There was a repayment, by the defendants, of a part of this money, and on the 8th of May the defendants gave their note to the plaintiff, on demand, without interest, for $1,037.50, and out of this note grows the alleged usury. It is claimed, on the defendants\u2019 part, that this note, though on demand and without interest, was, by agreement, to be paid on the 15th of July, when the plaintiff\u2019s California draft of $15,000 matured, and that the $37.50 is for interest, and that such sum is more than at the rate of seven per cent per annum. It is apparent that $37.50 is more than the legal rate of interest upon $1,000 from May 8th to July 15th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-5\">\u201cIt was in evidence that $37.50 bore the same ratio to $1,000 that $189.50 bore to the amount of the money which De Gray received; and that the intent of all parties in this case was to place the plaintiff, on the 15th of July, when his draft would mature, in the same situation as though the proceeds had not been anticipated; and so far as the evidence shows, if De Gray and these defendants had, on the 15th of July, paid the plaintiff so much of the proceeds of the discounted draft as they had received, without any interest, and the sum paid by him as the discount of the draft, the plaintiff would not have been benefited by the transaction, but' would have stood precisely as though he had retained the draft in his poclcet until its maturity. It appears, in fact, that De Gray and the defendants did not actually withdraw from the plaintiff but about one-half of the proceeds of the draft; but he seems to have been ready, and to have expected them to use the rest as they needed it. The plaintiff does not appear to have used the balance himself in any other way; but it seems to have remained in his hands as though he were the defendants\u2019 banker. \u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b13-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number><em>D.

It is usurious if done with intent to evade the statute, and to enable the plaintiff to receive more than lawful interest for the use of his money. Nor would the mere fact, that the plaintiff had at times drawn his bank account below the amount of the balance of the proceeds of this draft, thus left with him, necessarily make the transaction usurious. The usury in such a case depends upon the intent of the parties; it is not created by an error in computation, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>induced by an accident or a mistake, into which no corrupt intention has entered. Nor can a borrower by an act of- generosity, real or contrived, render that corrupt and usurious, which was not so by its terms, and which was not so designed by the lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-5\">The object of the statute is, to prevent the lender from receiving more than the legal rate of interest for the loan of his money. But it would be a monstrous doctrine to hold, that a borrower who induces a friend\u2019to pay $200 for the legal discount of a draft in order to accommodate him, with the use of its proceeds until its maturity, can take advantage of the statute of usury to defeat a recovery, <em>because </em>the borrower did not immediately withdraw the proceeds of the draft, and therefore, had not, according to strict computation, been in <em>actual </em>possession of the money the entire time for which his note bears interest, or because not wanting to use but half the money borrowed, he had suffered the rest to remain in the lender\u2019s bank, or because the borrower from a feeling of generosity or justice afterwards wished the lender to derive some uncertain advantage from the balance thus remaining. To make the transaction <em>usurious, </em>there must have been an intent on the part of the lender to receive, and on the part of the borrower to pay, more than legal interest. In any given case, all the circumstances are to be considered, in order to arrive at the corrupt intent, and any and every contrivance and subterfuge will be unavailing if the corrupt intention appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-6\">In this case, we. find no sufficient evidence that the plaintiff intended to receive <em>any </em>rate of interest, or to do anything more than accommodate his trusted friends, who agreed to place him on the 15th of July just in the same condition as though he had not caused the draft to be discounted, but had retained it in his own hands until its maturity on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-7\">New trial ordered with costs to abide the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
