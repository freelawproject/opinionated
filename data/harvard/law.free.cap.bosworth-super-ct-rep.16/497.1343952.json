Receiving from the president and agent of a corporation, on applying to him, as such agent, for payment of a sum then due from the company; part cash and the balance in a note, at thirty days, made by a firm of which such president is a member: and the giving of a receipt that the whole sum so due has been received, will not operate as payment by the company of the sum for which the note was taken, unless it was expressly agreed at the time, that it should be received as actual payment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b505-9\">2. The fact that such president and agent was, at the time of giving the note, largely indebted to such company, and was subsequently credited by the company, in account, as having paid the whole sum due, is no answer to such an action; the company not having in fact been actually prejudiced thereby.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b505-10\">3. Such a receipt will not exclude parol evidence, in an action against the company to recover the sum for which the note was given, (it not having been paid at maturity,) of what was said at the time of taking such note, to induce the creditor to take it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b505-11\">4. The declarations of the parties to the transaction, at the time of making it, are competent evidence, although one of them was the clerk of such president; he acting at the time for such president as his clerk and agent, the president not being personally present.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b505-12\">(Before Bosworth, Hoffman and Pierrepont, J.

Schuyler at thirty days for $8,500.00. On the trial, to prove the alleged payment, A. J. F. Vanderventer, the cashier and bookkeeper of R. &amp; Gr. L. Schuyler, was called as a witness and testified, that Mr. Baylies, on the 27th of June, 1854, called at the office of Geo. L. Schuyler, the president of the company, \u201cto get the money on the estimate due 20th June, 1854. The amount was $6,686.70. The amount was paid partly in cash. When Mr. Baylies came to collect the money on that estimate, there was not enough money on hand to make out the full amount. I proposed to Mr. Baylies to pay him the balance in note, as Mr. Robert Schuyler requested, which was $8,500. Mr. Baylies said he would do that, and took the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>at thirty days from the 27th June, 1854. The amount paid him .in cash was $3,186.70.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-4\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What was said at this time by Mr. Baylies on the subject of the payment of the estimate or talcing a note for part thereof? Question objected to by defendants\u2019 counsel on the ground that Baylies\u2019 declarations are not evidence, unless the president of the company was present. The objection was overruled, and the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Mr. Baylies said, if the company had not the money, that he would take a note for the balance with interest added.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-6\">\u201c <em>Q. </em>Was anything said by Mr. Baylies or by you as to the kind of note or whose note?

That they charged to the defendants on the 27th of June, 1854, $6,686.70, as having been paid for them to Baylies &amp; Stewart, and that such charge was contained in an account which the Messrs. Schuyler rendered to them on the 30th of June, 1854. That the defendants credited the whole charge to the Schuylers, and after such credit was made, the Schuylers remained indebted to them $278,000. Stewart &amp; Baylies assigned their claim against the defendants to plaintiff, January 15, 1856.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-14\">The referee reported that \u201che finds as matters of fact that the contract mentioned in the complaint was made between the defendants and Stewart &amp; Baylies; that, on June 27, 1854, there was due to the latter from the defendants, on said contract the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>sum of $6,686.70; that, at the date last mentioned, Mr. Baylies for said Stewart &amp;'Baylies) called for payment of the sum at the-office of Messrs. R. &amp; Gr. L. Schuyler, one of the members of said firm was, at the same time, the President of the defendants; and that said firm, under an agreement with the defendants, kept the accounts and paid the bills for the work under said contract; that they were furnished with funds therefor by the defendants, who were largely in advance to them at the time over and above the amount of the bill, payment of which was so demanded by Stewart &amp; Baylies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-5\">\u201cThe previous payments to Stewart &amp; Baylies, under the contract, had been made by R. &amp; Gr. L. Schuyler.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-6\">\u201cI find, that when Mr. Baylies called to collect the amount so due, Mr. Robert Schuyler (through his clerk, A. J. F. Vanderventer) represented to him that there was not money enough on hand to make out the full amount, and proposed to pay him three thousand one hundred and eighty-six dollars and seventy cents in cash, and to pay the balance three thousand five hundred in the note9of R. &amp; Gr. L. Schuyler to the order of Stewart &amp; Baylies; that Mr. Baylies then said if the company had not the money he would take the note for the balance, as proposed, with the interest added, which was, done accordingly, and the sum of three thousand one hundred and eighty-six dollars and seventy cents was at the same time paid to him in cash, and he thereupon gave a receipt in the words following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-7\">\u201c \u2018Received, New York, June 27, 1854, from Greo.

That the referee decides wrongfully that Stewart and Baylies did not accept the note of R. &amp; G-. L. Schuyler for $3,500 and $3,186.70 in cash, in full payment and satisfaction of the amount due to them upon estimate No. 10, mentioned in his report.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-9\">\u201cSecond. That the referee erred in deciding that there was no evidence that Stewart and Baylies had negotiated the note of R. &amp; Gr. L. Schuyler for $3,500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-10\">\u201cThird. That the referee erred in deciding that the plaintiff is entitled to recover from the defendants the sum of $3,500 with interest from the 30th day of July, 1854.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-11\">From the judgment entered on the report, the defendants appealed to the GreneraFTerm.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b509-12\"><em>G. W. Sandford, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-13\">I. The note was received by Stewart and Baylies as cash in payment of the estimate, and a receipt given for the whole amount to the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-14\">Stewart and Baylies show by their receipt, that they intended to discharge the defendants, and look to the note as payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-15\">IL The note was not negotiated to Stewart and Baylies by the defendants. They elected to take the note, and discharge the defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b509-16\">III. The referee, therefore, decided erroneously, that the note was not received in payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>TV. The note was indorsed by Stewart and Baylies to the plaintiff was protested while in his possession, and was produced by him on the trial. In the absence of other testimony, it is evidence of its absolute negotiation to plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-4\">V. The case of <em>Tobey </em>v. Barber, upon which the referee bases his decision, is not in point. The present suit is an attempt by the indorsee of the note (Higby) to collect a note which he took upon the credit of the drawers and indorsers from parties not upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-5\">YI. The receipt is evidence, that the note was taken in payment of the estimate,' and is not rebutted. The negotiation of the note, is conclusive evidence that they received it in payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-6\">VII. The referee improperly admitted the testimony of Baylies\u2019 declarations, and of Vanderventer\u2019s declarations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-7\">VIH. The report of the referee should be set aside.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-8\"><em>James S. Sandford &amp; O. N. Emerson, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqj\">I. The receipt of June 27th, 1854, was a technical receipt, containing not a word implying a new contract, between the party making it and the party to whom it was given; and it may be explained by parol. Had it contained words that literally implied a contract, \u201cto discharge,\u201d &amp;c., still it is open to explanation and qualification, and may be set aside upon the same ground that a Court of Equity would set aside a contract for \u201cfraud,\u201d \u201csurprise,\u201d \u201cmistake,\u201d or \u201cfailure of consideration.\u201d (1 Gfreenl. Ev., \u00a7 805; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Crittenden, </em>9 Conn., 406; <em>Tobey </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>5 Johns., 72; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>9 Johns., 310.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-12\">II. To sustain the defense of payment by the acceptance of a not\u00e9 of a third person, it must be conclusively shown:</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-13\">1. That it was the voluntary act of the creditor, made with a full knowledge of the effect of the acceptance, and not forced upon him by necessity, when nothing else could be obtained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-14\">2. That it was expressly agreed to be received by the creditor, as a payment, and full satisfaction. <em>(Noel </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>3 Kern., 168, and cases cited; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>9 Johns., 310; <em>Owenson </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>7 Term R., 66; <em>Puckford </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>6 id., 52; <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Friend, </em>5 Sandf., 568; <em>Whitbeck </em>v. <em>Van Ness, </em>11 Johns., 409; <em>Waydell </em>v. <em>Luer, </em>3 Denio, 410; <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>12 Johns., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>409.) The apparent conflict of the authorities in Maine and Massachusetts, with the whole current of decisions in this state, is rather apparent than real. It is rather a question of presumption, or burden of proof. <em>(Butt </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>2 Met., 76.) In New York it has been held that the burden of proof (in the absence of evidence of an express contract, superadded to the technical \u201creceipt of payment,\u201d) is on the defendant, to show that the note was taken as payment, or accord and satisfaction. ( Cases cited, <em>supra!)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-5\">III. If this had been the note of the defendants instead of the note of a third party, it still would only have been <em>prima facie </em>evidence of payment, and liable to be rebutted by showing its dishonor; unless expressly received as payment, or the same was outstanding. (Rolt v. <em>Watson, </em>4 Bing., 273; 2 Greenl. Ev., \u00a7 520; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Haight, </em>8 Wend., 535; Byles on Bills, in notes, p. 304.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-6\">IV. There is nothing in the form of the receipt, or in the language used by Baylies in his transaction with the clerk, or in the subsequent conduct of the holders of the note, from which an absolute discharge of the debtor corporation can be implied, much less any evidence of an \u201c express agreement \u201d to that effect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-7\">1. Payment under the contract, was to be made monthly, and at the solicitation of the clerk, Baylies extends the time of a portion of one payment, thirty days.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-8\">2. It seems evidently received as collateral, and merely an extension of the time of the monthly payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-9\">3. It was not, in fact, a full payment under that estimate No. 10, for 85 per cent only was provided for.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-10\">4. It was taken to accommodate the treasury as a favor to the debtor to allow him to provide funds ; and is rather to be viewed as an adjustment and accounting upon the estimate than an accord or satisfaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-11\">5. There is no evidence, that the note was ever negotiated. A blank indorsement, with possession on the part of indorser who is also payee, is only evidence of an indorsement for collection. (Story on Bills, <em>passim!)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-12\">V. The defendants cannot defeat the claim of the plaintiff by crediting the note to the account of the Messrs. Schuyler. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>not even pretended that plaintiff consented to such arrangement or even knew of it. In every aspect it was \u201cres <em>inter alios </em>actos.\u201d <em>(Ohasey. Smith, 5 </em>Vermont, 556.) And in this view, the evidence given as to the state of accounts between Messrs. Schuyler and the Company, was entirely immaterial, if not incompetent. Any conclusion derived from the state of these mutual accounts, presupposes an agreement expressly made on the part of Baylies to receive the jiote as an absolute payment, and there is no evidence to authorize such a presupposition. (Evidence of Vanderventer, <em>passim.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-5\">VI. The second exception of defendants\u2019 counsel is not warranted by a fair construction of the referee\u2019s report. He did not decide, \u201c that there was <em>no </em>evidence that Stewart and Baylies had negotiated the note,\u201d but that \u201cthe evidence was incomplete, and, so far as offered, was equally consistent with an indorsement for collection.\u201d Upon a review of the evidence, this Court can draw no different conclusion. It is further submitted by plaintiff, that even if such indorsement had been made for the purpose of realizing the money upon the note (by a discount or otherwise), the fact is sufficient and controlling, that the purpose failed, and the note is offered for cancellation or for the use of defendants. <em>(Kean </em>v. <em>Dupesne, </em>3 Serg. and R., 233.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-6\">VH. It is -submitted that upon the facts and the law of the case, the report of the referee should be sustained and confirmed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\">By the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"ACq\">Pierrepont, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW1\">\u2014Stewart &amp; Baylies having done their work, the amount claimed in estimate Ho. 10 was due. It has not been paid in money, nor has it been released by any formal- instrument. . The defendants have received the consideration upon which this action is founded, and for it they have paid nothing. The fact that Schuyler charged the company with this note, makes no difference in the present case; he was their debtor to a large amount at the time, and they parted with no new consideration in consequence of such charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">To make the receipt of Schuylers\u2019 note operate as payment <em>pro tanto, </em>it was necessary for the defendants to show an agreement to take it as actual payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Merely taking it and giving a receipt in full is not alone suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>cient to establish such agreement. <em>(Tobey </em>v. Barker, 5 J. R., 70; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>9 J. R., 310; <em>Noel </em>v. Murray, 3 Kern., 168.) The facts, therefore, are correctly found by the referee, and he has drawn therefrom a just conclusion of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The receipt given did not preclude an inquiry into the agreement actually made, in respect to the terms on which the note was taken; and it follows that what Yanderventer said at the time on that point, was competent evidence. <em>(Johnson </em>v. <em>Weed, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"AnE\">The terms of the agreement, if one was made, are to be determined upon a just consideration of what the parties to the transaction said at that time. There was no error in the admission of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b513-21\"> See <em>Purchase </em>v. <em>Mattison, ante </em>p. 310.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
