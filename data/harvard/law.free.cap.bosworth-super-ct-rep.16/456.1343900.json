Robert Chapman is the plaintiff, and Dines Carolin and James A. Carolin are the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-12\">The complaint (sworn to in January, 1858,) states as a cause of action, that the defendants, being partners, under the name and firm of D. Carolin &amp; Son, on the 2d of March, 1857, made their promissory note, in writing, of that date, \u201cwhereby they promised to pay to the order of themselves the sum of $792.21, and the said payees thereof indorsed the said note to the plaintiff.\u201d . . \u201cWhen the said note became due and payable it was duly presented to the said defendants, Dines Carolin and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>James A.

That the note sued on, as described in the complaint, was payable on demand, while that offered in evidence was payable eight months after date. The note so offered to be read (with the indorsement thereon,) was as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-9\">New York, March 2,1857.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-10\">\u201cEight months after date, we promise to pay to the order of ourselves, seven hundred and ninety-two dollars and twenty-one cents, value received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-11\">$792.21.

It was, by its terms, payable eight months after its date. The complaint, did not state when it was payable. It stated truly its date, and amount, the names of the makers and payees, and the indorsement of it. A note, stating no day of payment, would, as to that particular, correspond with the complaint. There was undoubtedly a variance between the note produced and that described by the complaint. But the variance was not material. The Code declares that no variance between an allegation in a pleading and the proof, shall be deemed material, unless it have actually misled the adverse party, to his prejudice, in maintaining his action or defense, upon the merits. (Code, \u00a7 169.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">If a party allege he has been misled, he must prove that fact to the satisfaction of the Court, and in what respect he has been misled. One of the defendants was sworn, and testified as to those matters, and his evidence showed that they had never made any note payable on demand, nor any other note of the date and amount of the one in suit, and he knew the plaintiff held this identical note, and he did not pretend there was any defense to it on the merits. The Court was therefore bound to disregard the variance. <em>(Catlin </em>v. <em>Gunter, </em>1 Kern., 368.)</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">When there is a variance between some of the allegations of a pleading and the proof and that is all, the Court has no power to nonsuit on the mere ground that such a variance exists, or is material.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">The only test of materiality of the variance, is proof, to be furnished by the party objecting to the variance, that it has actually misled him, to his prejudice, (if a defendant) in maintaining his defense, upon the merits. And the proof must show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u201cin what respect he has been misled.\u201d If it is not made to appear that he has been so misled, his objection is unavailing. He cannot be misled to his prejudice upon the merits, when he has no merits. These defendants had no merits, and no defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">It is only when, the allegation of the cause of action, to which the proof is directed, is unproved, not in some particular or particulars only, but in its entire scope and meaning, that it presents the case of a failure of proof, and ceases to be one of variance within sections 169 and 170 of the Code. (Code, \u00a7 171.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">In this case, the allegation of the cause of action was unproved in one particular only. In all others it was proved precisely as stated in the complaint. The nonsuit was properly refused, and there was no error in ordering a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
