It was brought to recover $665.58, which the plaintiffs had been compelled to pay by way of a general average contribution, as owners of a cargo of corn, shipped on the barque Helen Mar, on a voyage from Hew York to Belfast, and insured by a policy issued by the defendants, about December 11, 1855, to J. Wallace &amp; Co.,- which corn had been sold and which policy had been assigned to the plaintiffs, before the loss occurred. The corn insured was valued in the policy at $5,000.

In explanation, the counsel for the plaintiffs stated, that he proposed to prove that the Helen Mar was an A, 1, vessel; and then to show by competent testimony that the rate of insurance charged by the policy in question was as great as that fixed by the tariff of the board of underwriters at the date of the policy, for insuring corn on board the same class of vessels, in policies in which the words \u2018 free of average \u2019 were not used, and in which general average losses were included in the risks taken by the insurers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-13\">\u201cAnd the counsel for the plaintiffs further offered to prove by competent testimony, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-14\">\u201cThat the words \u2018free from average,\u2019 have a peculiar commercial meaning, wholly distinct from their ordinary and popular meaning, which meaning they have acquired by a known usage of trade.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-15\">\u201c That the words 1 free from average,\u2019 by a known usage among merchants, and officers of marine insurance companies, and adjusters of losses in marine insurance cases, do not mean free from general average contribution, but only free from partial loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_i\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u201c That in cases of settlement and adjustment of losses, these words, when inserted in the policy in writing, have been always construed by adjusters, not to exclude contribution in cases of general average losses, but that in such cases the underwriters were liable for general average contribution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-5\">\u201c That the established rate of premium on the 11th of December, 1855, on cargoes of corn shipped in bags, in vessels of the same class as the Helen Mar, from and to the same ports, 1 free from particular average only,\u2019 was the same rate as is charged in the policy on which this action is founded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-6\">\u201cThat the established rate of premium, and which was acquiesced in by defendants, in cases where insurance companies were not liable for general average contribution, was less than the rate charged in this policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-7\">\u201cTo all the foregoing testimony the counsel for the defendants objected, and the Court thereupon sustained said objection, and refused to admit said testimony, or any part thereof; to which ruling and decision the counsel for the plaintiffs then and there duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-8\">\u201cThe counsel for the plaintiffs then rested their case, and the counsel for the defendants moved that the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint be dismissed.

The evidence offered by the plaintiffs, and rejected, was admissible.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-13\">1. It was competent for the plaintiffs to prove that the Helen Mar was an A, 1, vessel; and that the premium charged upon the policy in question, was the established rate for insuring corn on board the same class of vessels, in policies in which the words \u201c free of average \u201d were riot used, and in which general average losses were included in the risks taken by the insurers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-14\">The class to which the vessel belonged, and the rate of pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>mimnpaid, were \u201csurrounding facts and circumstances, evidence of which is always received to aid in the interpretation of a contract. (1 Greenl. Ev., \u00a7\u00a7 287 to 289; 1 Phillips on Ins., 3d ed., \u00a7 126, n 3; 1 Duer on Ins., p. 171, chap. 2, part 1, \u00a7\u00a7 17 and 18; <em>Preston, </em>ex\u2019r, &amp;c., v. <em>Greenwood, </em>4 Doug., 27.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-5\">2. It was competent for the plaintiffs to show that the words \u201c free from average,\u201d by a known usage among merchants and underwriters and adjusters of losses, do not mean free from general average contributions, but only free from partial loss. (2 Parsons on Contracts, 67, 68; <em>Dana </em>v. <em>Fiedler, </em>2 Kern., Johnson, J., p. 46; 2 Parsons on Contracts, 4, 5, m, b, c; Phillips on Ins., 3d ed., \u00a7\u00a7 132, 145 ; Per Campbell, J., in <em>Garrison </em>v. <em>Memphis Ins. Co., </em>19 How., 316; 1 Duer on Ins., p, 179, chap. 2, part 1, \u00a7 31.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-6\">In deciding upon the words \u201cfree from average,\" Lord Mansfield referred to the usage which had prevailed in adjusting losses, as a ground of construction. (1 Phillips on Ins., 95.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-7\">H. The learned Judge erred in directing that the complaint be dismissed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-8\">I. Construing \u201caverage\u201d to mean \u201cpartial loss,\u201d occasions no inconsistency nor repugnancy between the written and the printed language. On the other hand, if it is construed to include general average, the words \u201cunless general,\u201d in the printed part, must be stricken out.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-9\">2. The word \u201caverage,\u201d in the phrase \u201cfree from average,\u201d always means particular average, or partial loss.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-10\">This is its popular sense among underwriters, adjusters of marine losses, and merchants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-11\">The same usage exists among writers on insurance. (2 Arnould on Ins., 854, <em>et seq., </em>at 955, 1129,1130,1131,1132; <em>Montoya and others </em>v. <em>The London Assurance Co., </em>4 Eng. L. and Eq. R., 500.).</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-12\">3. The reason for excepting average losses has no application whatever to general average losses, (2 Arnould on Ins., p. 851;: <em>Dyson </em>v. <em>Rowcroft, </em>3 Bos. &amp; Pul., 476, decision by Lord Advanley.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-13\">4. In all doubtful cases, policies of insurance are to be liberally-construed in favor of the assured, and an exception to the usual risks is to be strictly construed against the underwriters. (1 Duer on Ins., pp. 161 and 179, chap. 2, \u00a7 31.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Acm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>5. The construction contended for by the respondent, renders the provision, \u201cfree from average,\u201d absurd. And the \u201cCourt, in selecting among the different meanings of which the phraseology is susceptible, will avoid such as are absurd, or lead to unreasonable or inconvenient consequences.\u201d (1 Phillips on Ins., 3d ed., \u00a7 123; 1 Duer on Ins., p. 163, chap. 2, \u00a7 8.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-5\">If the circumstances of the case had been such as to call for the sacrifice of the whole of the plaintiff\u2019s corn, instead of a sacrifice of the vessel, the defendant would clearly have been liable as for a total loss. The question of general average would have had nothing to do with the case, as between the owners of the com and the underwriters. It would have been simply a total loss by jettison, one of the perils insured against, and the plaintiffs would have a right to look for their indemnity directly from the respondent. <em>(Maggrath </em>v. Church, 1 Caines, 215, Kent, J.; Watson v. <em>The Mar. Ins. </em>Co., 7 Johns., 62; <em>Greeley </em>v. <em>Tremont Ins. Co., </em>9 Cush., 419; <em>Forbes </em>v. <em>Man. Ins. Co., </em>1 Gray, 371.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-6\">The result of the respondent\u2019s construction would'be that they would be liable in case the property insured by them was sacrificed to \"save the property of others, but would not be liable in case the property of others were sacrificed to save theirs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-7\">If the respondents should contend that they would not be liable even in the former case, the matter would not be much helped; for then the result would be that the assured would receive no indemnity from the insurer even for a total loss, and that too of the most meritorious kind that could possibly happen.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-8\">6. A stipulation that underwriters shall not be liable to general average contribution, in any case, is in violation of the policy upon which the doctrine of general average is founded, and will not be upheld. (2 Arnould on Ins., 877; <em>Sturges </em>v. <em>Cary, </em>2 Curtis, 382; 2 Phillip on Ins., 1275; 1. Arnould on Ins., p. 8, \u00a7 9.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-9\">7. The case of <em>Coster </em>v. <em>The Phoenix Insurance Co., </em>(2 Wash. C. C., 51,) is unsound.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-10\">The learned Judge, who decided that case, erred in saying that the word average originally meant a contribution by the owner of the ship, cargo and freight, towards a loss sustained for the general benefit of all. (See 2 Arnould on Ins., 955.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-11\">He erred also in saying that the written and printed clauses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>were inconsistent with each other, and that one or the other must give away.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-5\">There is, however, a very important difference between that case and the present. There the stipulation was to be free from average under ten per cent. In the present case it is to be free from average to any amount. There might be a reason for an underwriter wishing to exempt himself from being called on for petty losses. But a stipulation that the underwriter would not-be liable for any amount of general \u00e1verage loss would be monstrous.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b399-6\"><em>Aleaxmder Hamilton, Jr., </em>for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-7\">I. Under the common memorandum (printed form), the underwriters were warranted free from all partial losses on grain, unless they were in the nature of \u201c general average.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-8\">Without the written words, therefore, no partial loss on \u201c corn in bags \u201d could have been claimed from them, unless arising in \u201c general average.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-9\">II. Such being their exemption under the memorandum, the words are written in, immediately after the description of the subject insured, \u201cfree from average.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-10\">It is confidently submitted, under well established rules of interpretation, that this refers to \u201c general average \u201d only.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-11\">1. By the settled rule of construction, effect must be given, if possible, to each part of the instrument, so that no part shall be rendered superfluous or unmeaning; in other words, to ascertain intention the Court must look to the consequences of different interpretations of the disputed phrase; if by one interpretation it would be superfluous, and by a different construction it would be operative, it is plainly the latter sense which should be adopted. (Duer on Ins., vol. 1, 163, \u00a7 8; id., 165, \u00a7 10.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-12\">2. This rule applies with special force to the written words,, as expressing the more immediate intentions of the parties to the contract. (1 Duer, 165; <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>French, </em>4 East., 136.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-13\">3. Under the common memorandum (the printed form), grain of all kinds was warranted free from particular average or partial loss, unless it were a partial loss in the nature of \u201c general average.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>4. The underwriter, under the printed form, being relieved from all partial losses, but remaining liable for \u201cgeneral average\u201d partial losses, the words \u201c free from average \u201d were added in writing, to take away a liability that existed, and not one already provided against.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-5\">5. To limit these written words to the case of a particular average loss, would require the addition of the words \u201c unless general,\u201d and thus repeat the phrase of the memorandum, or would render them entirely superfluous and unmeaning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-6\">III. There is no total loss pretended; and only a partial loss in the nature of general average. The clause \u201c free from average,\u201d must refer either to a partial loss or general average loss. To construe it as intending the former would be to render them entirely unnecessary; the assured having already by the memorandum warranted the underwriters against all partial losses on corn.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-8\">The phrase \u201c free of average \u201d in a policy like this was held to exclude general average losses as far back as 1807. <em>(Coster </em>v. <em>Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>2 Wash. C. C. R., 51.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-10\">IY. The construction is apparent from the policy itself; free of average obviously means average in general, the words \u201c whether general or particular \u201d .are implied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-11\">Such is the construction given to them in France and Italy. (Stevens and Benecke, pp. 448, 56, 57, 58.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-13\">Y. The parol evidence offered by the plaintiffs was inadmissible and properly rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-14\">1. If admitted the effect would have been to contradict or materially vary the terms of the policy, and that in a case where the settled rules of construction left no reasonable doubt as to the meaning. (1 Greenl. Ev., chap. 15, \u00a7\u00a7 275, 282 and 292; 3d Kent, p. 326, note 6; <em>The Schooner Reeside, 2 </em>Sumner, 568.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-16\">2. Parol evidence is inadmissible, except to construe new terms or exceptions not judicially settled, or to explain where the meaning is doubtful.</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-17\">The phrase \u201cfree of average\u201d is not a new term, but on the contrary one of the oldest in the policy, and has been judicially settled. <em>(Wadsworth </em>v. <em>Alcott, 2 </em>Seld., 64; 3d Duer, 264 ; 2 Comst., 235.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"An9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>3. The testimony offered by the plaintiff to show that the rate of insurance charged by the policy in question was- as great as that fixed by the tariff of the board of underwriters, at the date of the policy, for insuring in the same class of vessels, in which the words \u201c free of average \u201d were not used, and in which general average losses were included in risks taken by insurers, was properly rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-5\">It amounted in effect to an attempt to strike these written words out of the policy, under the proof of the tariff of the board of underwriters.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-6\">4. The testimony to show that the words \u201cfree of average\u201d have a peculiar commercial meaning wholly distinct from their ordinary and popular meaning was properly rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-9\"><em>a. </em>It was not shown to be relevant in any way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-10\"><em>h. </em>The words have been judicially settled, and are almost-as old as the policy itself\u2014parol evidence is only admissible to construe new or generic terms or expressions not judicially settled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-11\">5. The same objection applies to the offer to show by the usage among merchants and officers of marine insurance companies and adjusters of losses, that the words \u201c free from average\u201d mean only free from partial loss, and not from general average contribution. The offer was bad in form, and properly rejected. It should have been an offer to show the uniform use and practice of underwriters in settlement of losses, under policies similar to this one, to admit claims for general average. (1 Duer, 186, cases there cited.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-13\">6. The construction given by adjusters is matter of opinion only and should be rejected. Opinions of witnesses as to the proper interpretation of those words in a policy that are neither foreign nor purely technical cannot be received as legal evidence. Usage must be proved by facts- and practice, not by opinions however numerous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-14\">This objection applies to all the offers made by the plaintiffs. <em>(Syers </em>v. <em>Bridge, </em>Doug., 529; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Mech. Ins. Co., </em>1st Story, 607.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-17\">7. The offers to show the established rate of premium were properly rejected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-18\">The amount of premium paid is no evidence of the meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>of words used in the policy, which must be ascertained from the policy itself. The first offer was to show the established rate of premium, without averring that the defendants acquiesced in it. The proof, if admitted, would have been entirely irrelevant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-5\">The last offer to show that the established rate of premium acquiesced in by the defendants in cases where the insurers were not liable for general average contribution, was less than the rate charged in this policy, was of a character too indefinite, where the terms of the policy are as clear as in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-6\">VI. The decision of the Court below was correct, and the judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b402-7\">By the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"ARG6\">Hoffman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALO\">\u2014The term average was borrowed from the foreign law; and in that law it indicated every chance damage which happened to the merchandise or the ship. Average was such a loss. (Emer., 463, and the authors cited by him.) It excluded, from its very character, an absolute total loss. The ordinance of the marine of 1688 showed this in a plain form. (Art. 46.) Abandonment was applicable to cases of total loss. Average comprised all the minor disasters causing damage to the thing insured. (Emer., <em>ut supra, </em>and 468.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The 397th section of the Code of Commerce follows out this \u2022definition with marked exactness. It speaks of the term <em>avaries </em>thus: \u201c All extraordinary expenses incurred for the ship and the cargo conjointly or separately ; all damage happening to the vessel or goods from the time of their lading and departure until their arrival and discharge are reputed averages. There are two classes of averages, gross or common (general), and simple or particular averages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">In entire conformity with this description in the foreign law, there has grown up into English mercantile language and English mercantile law a two-fold meaning of the term average. The distinction is, between a particular and a general average. The first is that loss which falls solely upon a particular subject; the second is that damage or liability which falls upon property in question, by reason of an injury to something else.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Molloy does however define the term as used in the mercantile law to be, the contribution made proportionably, by others, to those who have their goods east into the sea, for general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>safety. It is made he says, \u201c after the rate of every man\u2019s <em>ave-ridge, </em>or goods carried.\u201d <em>(De jure Maratimo, </em>ch. 6, 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Cowell\u2019s Interpreter, quoted by Mr. Stevens, adopts a similar meaning for the phrase. (Step. &amp; Ben. on Average, Boston Ed., <em>1883, </em>p. 56.) \u201c What we term general average is the only case entitled to the appellation of average. A particular loss is no average at all.\u201d (1 Rob. Ad. Rep., 293.)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">But at page 39 he says, \u201c By the continental law all losses not total are said to be average losses, and so the Courts in this country use the term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">Particular average and general average, are terms pervading the whole mercantile law, and decisions of England and this country. Particular average is the damage or loss, short of total, falling directly upon a particular property. General average is the liability or claim falling upon that property, from the loss of or damage to something else.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Average then, in its generic sense, and used <em>simpliciter, </em>is a loss, injury or deduction, not amounting to a total loss, and then when the parties to a policy agree that goods insured shall be free from average, they agree that the liability of the insurers shall only arise when a total loss shall occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">This is the plain import and legal effect of the clause in writing in the first part of the policy in question. The insurance is made \u201c on 4,650 bushels of corn in bags, free from average.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">But then we find the clause, that in no case shall the insurers be liable for a partial loss, unless it exceed five per cent. So they would be liable under this clause for any such loss exceeding such rate. Yet the first clause exempts them from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">Again, in the memorandum clause we have the provision 11 that grain of all kinds shall be free from average unless general.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">I think it clear that this clause supersedes entirely the clause as to a partial loss over five per cent. It is a qualification as to particular articles of the general provision, and com is one of such articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-13\">And then it follows, that the case is to be determined by a comparison of this clause in the memorandum, with the first written clause in the policy. In substance the contract reads thus; We agree to insure this particular parcel of corn shipped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>on board the Helen Mar, from any loss which shall be total in its nature, but not from any partial loss or other damage which it may be subjected to; and then we agree to insure any grain laden by you on board the Helen Mar, from a. total loss, and also from any damage you may sustain by reason of a loss creating a case for contribution or general average.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">I am not able to reconcile these provisions. The question is, which must give way ?</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">That question is fully settled. The written words control the printed formula of a policy wherever there is a discrepancy. Mr. Duer states the rule to be that the inconsistent printed clause must be so limited or modified as to render it consistent with the written; or, if by no construction they can be reconciled must be wholly rejected.\u201d (Duer on Ins., vol. 1,166, citing Emer., and Lord Ellerbororgh in <em>Robertson </em>v. French, 4 East., 136.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The parol evidence offered in this case was we think correctly rejected. The phrase has no uncertain or ambiguous mean- - ing. The question simply is, does the written clause remain unaffected by the printed formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs of the appeal.</p>\n<author id=\"b404-9\">Bosworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aug\">\u2014An insurance upon articles declared by the policy to be \u201cfree from average,\u201d or which, by the terms of the policy, \u201c are warranted by the assured free from average,\u201d is, in effect, an insurance against their total loss only; according to the meaning of the words, \u201ctotal loss,\u201d as used in the law of insurance, applicable to memorandum articles. <em>(Maggrath </em>v. <em>Church, </em>1 Caines\u2019 Rep., 196; <em>Neilson </em>v. <em>Columbian Ins. Co., </em>3 id., 108; <em>Saltus v. Ocean Ins. Co., </em>14 J. R., 138; <em>Marcardier v. Chesapeake Ins. Co., </em>8 Crunch, 39; <em>Coster </em>v. <em>The Phoenix Ins. Co., </em>2 Wash. C. C. R., 51; <em>Morean </em>v. <em>United States Ins. Co., </em>1 Wheat., 219.)</p>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">By the terms of the printed part of the policy, the defendants would not have been liable for any partial loss, whether in the nature of a general average loss or otherwise, were it not for the qualifying words, \u201c unless general.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">These have the effect to make the insurance company liable for all general average losses chargeable upon the cargo insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-15\">The words \u201cfree from average,\u201d inserted in the policy, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>writing, should be so construed, if practicable, that effect maybe given to them, according to their meaning in such contracts, as settled by judicial exposition. When, giving them that meaning, they conflict with some customary provision in the printed part of the policy, the latter must be rejected and the written provision be allowed to prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">The insertion in writing of the words, \u201cfree from average,\u201d is equivalent to a declaration of the parties, embodied in and made part of their contract, to this effect: We agree, with respect to the com in question, that no claim shall be made upon the insurance company for, any loss or damage which is partial only, whether it be in the nature of a general .average loss, or a partial injury of the corn itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">We think therefore that, the Judge at the trial proceeded upon a correct view of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Independent of other objections to the evidence offered, to show the meaning of the words \u201c free from average,\u201d it is sufficient to say that evidenceof such a character is not admissible, for the purpose of attaching to those words, when forming part of a written contract, a meaning in conflict with, or variant from that given to them by adjudged cases; by which their meaning, in precisely such contracts has been determined and was a point in judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">No usage can exist or be proved by which the liabilities of parties to a written contract will be greater or less, than the settled law of the state has adjudged them to be, on a contract in the terms of the one-sought to=be affected by such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Judgment -affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
