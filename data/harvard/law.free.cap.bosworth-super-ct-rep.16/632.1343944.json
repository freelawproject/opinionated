J., and Woodruff, Pierrepont and Moncrief, J.J.)</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b640-8\">Submitted, February 12;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ARv\">decided, February 19, 1859.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AcJo\">This action comes before the Court, on an appeal by the defendant Ward, from an order made, <em>pro </em>forma, on the 15th of January, 1859, by Mr. Justice Pierrepont, which order declared that the defendant Ward is not entitled to costs, in this action, and directing that the adjustment of costs in his favor which the clerk had made, be disallowed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-11\"><em>Bobert K. Corbett; </em>the plaintiff, brought this action, against <em>John A. 'Davis </em>and <em>Charles H, </em>Ward, as defendants, to recover from them for services rendered, alleging in his complaint, that the services were rendered at the request of the defendants, .and on their promise to pay therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-12\">The defendants united in an answer in these words, viz.: \u201cThe defendants in this action, for answer to the complaint therein, severally deny each and every allegation contained in the complaint.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-14\">The referee, to whom the action was referred, decided that the plaintiff rendered services for Davis, on an employment by Ward who represented, that he and Davis were partners. That in truth Ward was but the agent of Davis, and although hable to the plaintiff, the latter could not recover against both in this action, but might elect the defendant, against whom he would take judgment. He elected to take judgment against Davis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b640-15\">The referee thereupon decided, that the plaintiff was entitled to a judgment against Davis for $800 and costs; and that the complaint should be dismissed as to Ward.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AAy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>The clerk having adjusted costs in favor of Ward, the plaintiff moved at Special Term to have the adjustment overruled, and costs to Ward disallowed. On that motion an order was made \u201c that the said taxation he disallowed and that the said Ward is not entitled to costs in this action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b641-4\">From that order the defendant Ward appealed to the General Term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b641-5\"><em>H. Sacie, </em>for defendant Ward, appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b641-6\"><em>Wm. Allen Butler, </em>for plaintiff and respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\">By the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"APP\">Bosworth, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aym\">\u2014In <em>Decker </em>v. <em>Gardiner &amp; Matthews, </em>(4 Seld., 29;) the defendants put in a single answer, in which each defendant stated \u201cseparately and not jointly\u201d the matters of defense on which he relied. The action was for \u201c the recovery of money.\u201d The jury found a verdict against Matthews which carried costs, and a verdict in favor of Gardiner. The Court of Appeals decided, Taggart, J., dissenting, \u201c that the defendant Gardiner was entitled to costs as a matter of course, under \u00a7 305, of the Code of Procedure,\u201d id., 30. That; it is true, was an action of tort, and this is an action on contract. But, in our view of the meaning of \u00a7 305; this difference is unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">The present action, being one \u201cfor the recovery of money,\u201d is controlled by the case cited. Whether the referee erred in deciding that the plaintiff could not recover in this action against both defendants, on the facts proved, is a question which does not arise on this appeal. The order appealed from must, therefore, be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">Order reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
