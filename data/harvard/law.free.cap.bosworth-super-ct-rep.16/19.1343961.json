In an action to recover the possession of personal property, brought by one who has been appointed, on proceedings supplementary to execution, a receiver of the property of a judgment debtor; and brought against such debtor and his wife on an allegation, that the property in question is the property of the plaintiff and is wrongfully detained from his possession by the defendants; the plaintiff cannot recover on merely proving that the property was demanded of the wife before suit brought, and that she made answer, that her husband <em>\u201c </em>did not own anything.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b27-7\">2.

K. </em>Hadley, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-7\">The only substantial question reserved for the opinion of the court in this action relates to the necessity and sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s demand from defendants, of the property in question, as to which we say:</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-8\">I. In relation to the wife, certainly no demand was necessary. Her possession, claiming as she did to hold the property adversely to her husband, as well as to the plaintiff, was a wrongful possession. (Cowen\u2019s Treatise, 302, and cases there cited.) And such possession has always been held to obviate the necessity of a demand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-10\">H. If the possession of the wife was not wrongful, then it was the possession of the husband. She acted as his. agent, and a demand from her, when in possession, was sufficient. The plaintiff\u2019s right to take possession of the property was absolute and immediate, wherever he might find it. He was under no obligation to demand from, or in any manner to communicate with, any person other than the party in actual possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-11\">The manner of the demand, stated by Eyan, was such as to warrant the inference that he disclosed the character in which he claimed. The answer was not, that <em>ayou </em>have no right to the property,\u201d but \u201cshe said <em>Mr. /Stcessel did not own any thing\u201d </em>and this was the real issue.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-12\">HI. But there was abundant evidence of a demand of, and refusal by, the defendant Stcessel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-13\">I. The receiver\u2019s report, which was read in evidence, and without objection <em>{i. </em>e., no objection was made after the complaint was amended), proves the demand and the refusal too\u2014 based not upon the ground, that the plaintiff showed no right to the property, but \u201calleging that he had no property, debts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>funds, securities, or equitable interests.\u201d The refusal was \u201cto deliver to the receiver,\u201d not to R. D. Livingston \u2014 from which the inference is authorized, that the plaintiff\u2019s character and right were disclosed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-5\">2. The mere demand and refusal is all the law requires, in cases where demand is necessary. It was never requisite for the party demanding to prove or demonstrate his right to demand, unless the refusal is based upon the absence of such right. The case is analogous to that of a tender of bank bills instead of specie\u2014which has always been held a competent tender\u2014where the refusal to accept has been placed upon other and distinct grounds. (22 Wend., 178; 1 John. Cases, 406; 1st Esp. R., 31; 6 Wend., 603; 8 J. R., 445.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-6\">IV\". It is only material to the question of costs, to inquire whether any demand whatever was ever made before action. Where a party is clearly entitled to the possession of property, or to the payment of money, the commencement of the action is a sufficient demand. The court has only to inquire, whether or not, at the time of action, the plaintiff had a right to the property or thing demanded; if he had, no preliminary demand was necessary, as he was under no obligation to ask for, before taking-possession of, the property he had a right to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-7\">This remark applies, of course, to the recovery of the thing itself, and not to damages for detention or costs of action. (1 Cow. T., 187, 188; Cro. Cas., 384; 3 Salk., 308.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-8\"><em>Charles A. May, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-9\">I. The Court erred in allowing the plaintiff to amend his complaint by alleging the appointment of the plaintiff ak receiver of the property of the defendant, Ferdinand Stcessel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-10\">1. Because it substantially changed the cause of action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-11\">2. Such allegation of fact constituted a new and distinct cause of action. <em>(Peck </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>3 Duer, 647.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-12\">II. The Court erred in not granting the defendants\u2019 'motion for judgment of nonsuit or dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-13\">1. Because the amendment as made is insufficient; the whole proceedings relating to the appointment of receiver, and also the permission to sue, ought to have been set out in the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>in full. (16 Wend., 410 ; <em>Beach </em>v. King, 17 Wend., 197; <em>Gillett </em>v. <em>Fairchild, </em>4 Denio, 80; <em>Chautaugue County Bank </em>v. <em>White, </em>2 Seld., 236; <em>White </em>v. Jay, 3 Kern., 83.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-4\">2. There is not sufficient evidence to prove the case on the part of plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-5\">3. There was no evidence of demand upon either of the defendants for the specific articles mentioned in the complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-6\">4. When plaintiff made the demand of the property of defendants, he failed to disclose the character in which he made the demand; for aught we know they might have given it up.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-7\">5. There is no evidence even to raise a presumption of ownership of the property in the defendant, Ferdinand Stcessel, nor was any possession thereof by or in him shown.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-8\">6. A refusal to deliver the property'cannot be inferred from the language of Mrs. St\u0153ssel. (4 Hill, 13 ; 1 Cowen, 322.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-9\">III. The verdict should be set aside, and the complaint dismissed, and judgment rendered for defendants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-10\">1. Because the verdict is clearly against the weight of evidence, and in fact there is no evidence whatever against said defendant, Mary Stcessel.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-11\">2. The only evidence tending in any manner to show a demand, is of a demand upon the wife, and this pretended demand as proved would certainly not charge the husband in this action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-12\">3. The demand, if proved, was not a legal demand, as the plaintiff did not disclose his character and authority when he made his demand.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b33-13\">IY. By the law of 1848, and amendments, a married woman may have and acquire separate property. In this case the property was bought by Mrs. Mary Stoessel out of her own resources and means, and thus became her separate property; it having been conclusively shown that the defendant, Ferdinand Stcessel, had no means by which to acquire the property; and her separate property is protected against seizure for debts of her husband. <em>(Merritt </em>v. <em>Lyon &amp; Tyler, </em>3 Barb., 110).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b33-14\">By the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"AfQ\">Bosworth, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF6\">The case submitted is so meagre in its details that its contents do not very clearly show what the evidence given at the trial fairly tended to prove. It is, perhaps, just to say that it appears F. Stcessel had been examined as to his property before the plaintiff was appointed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>a receiver of it. That examination was read, but it does not appear in the case, and its contents are unknown to us. The order of the 21st of Kov., 1855, states that it appears by such examination or \u201ctestimony,\u201d that \u201cthe wife of the said Ferdinand Stoessel claims to have some interest and title in and to the property of said Ferdinand Stoessel.\u201d The order, then, gives authority to the receiver to bring an action against F. Stoessel and make the wife of the latter a party to it, in order to recover the possession of personal property belonging to F. Stoessel at a time named in the order. The answer of Stoessel\u2019s wife alleges that the property described in the complaint was her separate property. The reply to that answer avers that the property belonged to F. Stoessel, and was in his possession when this action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">These circumstances, in connection with the proceedings at the trial, indicate that the only grounds arising upon undisputed facts, which were specially relied upon to defeat a. recovery were those on which a dismissal of the complaint was moved, when the testimony was closed. They were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIP\">First. That no legal demand was made of either defendant, because the plaintiff did not disclose his character and authority when he made it; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-8\">Second. That a demand upon the wife, and a refusal by her to deliver, is not sufficient to maintain an action against the husband for a wrongful detention of property so demanded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">So much of the charge to the jury as the case contains, states the first question as the one which would arise for subsequent consideration. This must be understood to mean that all questions upon which the judge was requested to rule, except that last named were disposed of at the trial. The charge, whatever it was, was not excepted to, and must be presumed to have been correct as to all questions affecting the merits, other than those as to which the charge, as made, is contained in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">Ferdinand Stcessel knew that the plaintiff in the action in which the receiver was appointed, was pursuing the property mentioned in the complaint as being the husband\u2019s. When demanded of his wife she did not inquire as to the authority or right to demand possession, but placed her refusal on the ground that \u201cMr. Stoessel did not own any\u201d of it. This indicates that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>she knew it was demanded as being his. The terms and grounds of the refusal import that she knew the receiver had a right to be allowed to take possession of the property provided it belonged to F. Stcessel. Had she refused on the ground that the plaintiff did not show any evidence of a right, or authority to demand it, that difficulty could have been obviated at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">Therefore, so far as the mere objection that such authority was not disclosed at the time the demand was made, stands in the way of a recovery, it is sufficient to say that it cannot be raised, for the first time, at the trial; the refusal to deliver (if there was such a refusal) having been placed on a totally different ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">But a dismissal of the complaint was also moved on the ground that a demand on the wife is not sufficient to charge the husband with liability in an action for a wrongful detention of the property so demanded in case she refuses to deliver it. The motion was denied, and the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted. The judge, in his charge, states as the truth of the transaction, that the property was demanded of the wife, who declared that it did not belong to her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">If the jury are to be deemed to have foiind that the property belonged to the husband, then it follows that it was in his possession when demanded. There can be no presumption that the wife had possession of it, and that it was out of the husband\u2019s possession. Being the husband\u2019s property the receiver might have taken it, and the wife could not rightfully have obstructed the receiver while properly reducing it to possession.</p>\n<p id=\"A2\">I know of no principle which makes the wife, merely as such, an agent of the husband to respond to demands that may be made on him to deliver property in his possession to one having a right to demand it, so as to make her refusal to give it up the husband\u2019s refusal, and such a refusal as will, subject either him or her to an action for a wrongful detention of the property. If the demand is made on her as being the husband\u2019s agent, her refusal to comply with it is not a wrong which will subject her to an action personally. It will not subject the husband to an action, because the mere fact that she was his wife does not give her authority to speak for him in such a case and make him responsible for her refusal to act as such agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>If the demand was made on her, because she claimed to be owner, or to have an interest in the property, then there is no ground for pretending that her answer to the demand was the husband\u2019s act; or that it would affect him as if the demand had been made of him, and he had refused to give possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">The property could have been taken arid sold on the execution, if it was the property of the husband. Instead of pursuing that course, the execution is returned and the return states that he had no leviable property. On proceedings supplementary to execution, the husband is examined, and, so far as we can infer from the evidence disclosed by the case, he stated that the property was not his, but that it belonged to his wife. A receiver is appointed, who brings an action against husband and wife, to recover possession, on the ground that both wrongfully detain it. Ho order directing the husband to deliver it to the receiver is shown, nor any demand of the property made by the receiver upon the husband is proved. He, therefore, does hot appear to have refused to allow the receiver to take possession, or to have interfered with the efforts of the latter to obtain possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">A demand of the property is made of the wife, who makes answer that \u201c Mr. Stoessel did not own any thing.\u201d On that this action is brought. Such evidence is insufficient to establish that either of the defendants \u201cwrongfully detained\u201d the property from the plaintiff, in such sense, as to subject them to \u201can action to recover the possession of personal property.\u201d Such an action is a substitute for the action of replevin. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 206, 253, 277, 289; sub. 4, and 305; sub. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">I think it would have been better to have stated more of the actual facts in the complaint, and to have prayed that the property be declared to belong to the husband, and that possession of it be given to the receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">But without intending to intimate that an action like the present cannot be maintained, on proof, of the necessary facts, it is sufficient to say that no such evidence of a' wrongful detention was given at the trial as entitled the plaintiff to a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">The verdict must be set aside and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
