In a suit by the wife\u2019s assignee of the balance claimed to be due to her in respect to such business; to recover such balance, it is error to disallow to the defendant upon a statement of accounts in relation to it, moneys advanced by the defendant to the husband in the course of the business; upon the ground that the power of attorney under which he acted did not authorize him to obtain such advances on her account.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b486-7\">(Before Hoffman, Slosson and Pierrepont, J.

Marsh, the plaintiff, sues as assignee of Frances Jackson. At the time the contract (hereinafter set forth) was made, under which the business was done out of which this controversy arose, Frances Jackson was a married woman; and the contract was made by her, by her husband Thomas Jackson as her attorney, of the one part, with the defendant of the other part.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-11\">The complaint avers, among other things, that from April, 1851, until some time in March, 1853, \u201cthe said Frances Jackson delivered or caused to be delivered to the said defendant, Ely Hoppock, for the purpose of sale, a large quantity of whiskey, known as Irish and Scotch whiskey, upon each and every gallon of which said whiskey so delivered as aforesaid,' the said defendant promised and agreed to advance and pay to the said Frances Jackson the sum of eighty-five cents, and upon the sale of said whiskey the said defendant promised and agreed to render to the said Frances Jackson a full and true account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>the sale and disposition of said whiskey, so that the said Frances Jackson might be able to judge of the result thereof, and pay to her what was due upon the balance of such accounts.\u201d It alleges that the defendant rendered accounts from time to time, describes them and avers that he rendered no other accounts, and that those rendered are not full or accurate.

That, during the period last mentioned, Frances Jackson was a married woman, viz.: the wife of Thomas Jackson, who was then living and residing with his said wife Frances Jackson in the city of New York. That the defendant knew Frances Jackson, and on March 27, 1851, the defendant entered into an agreement with Thomas Jackson, the husband of said Frances, which agreement was produced, and is in the words and figures following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-5\">\u201cTerms of agreement between Thomas Jackson and Ely Hoppock, both of the city and county of New York..

Judgment having been entered upon the report, the defendant appealed from it to the General Term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-7\"><em>Charles W. Sandford, </em>for the appellant, insisted that the business was, in law and in fact, the business of Thomas Jackson, the husband; that a married woman cannot carry on business through the agency of her husband. It must be considered his business and treated accordingly. Consequently the items charged to Mrs. Jackson and disallowed by the referee, were erroneously rejected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b490-8\">That the plaintiff, Marsh, if he has any ground of action, must assume all the transactions of Jackson in the business.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-9\"><em>Barrett &amp; Brinsmade, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-10\">Thomas Jackson acted as the agent and attorney of Frances Jackson, and every verbal and written agreement between him and the defendant, purports to have been made under and by virtue, of the power of attorney under the hand and seal of Frances Jackson.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-11\">The defendant must therefore account upon <em>the </em>basis of his contract, treating her as the principal, and Thomas as her agent. The report is right, rejecting such acts of the husband as the power of attorney did not authorize, and his principal has not sanctioned.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b490-12\">By the Court.</p>\n<author id=\"AMg\">Pierrepont, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOCr\">\u2014The referee evidently regards the relation of Thomas Jackson to Frances, so far as relates to this business, the same as though the two were strangers to any alliance, and one the mere agent of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"AvS\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Such is not our view of the meaning of the statutes relating to married women. The parties were husband and wife living together. It does not appear that the wife had a separate estate from which she derived an income; and it does appear that she advanced no money whatever in the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">The husband carried on the business, and it was his, and not that of his wife. Signing the contract of March, 1851,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">\u201cF. Jackson,\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-6\">\u201c Per Thos.
