The defendants insured the plaintiff against liability for loss imposed on him by law \u201cby reason of the ownership, maintenance and use\u201d of his automobile. The plaintiff was a partner in the firm of B. Steinfield Sons and used the machine in the partnership business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-12\">One of the partners while driving the machine, ran into one Dean, and he recovered a judgment against the firm, which the firm satisfied, and a deduction was made, from the interest of the plaintiff in the partnership business. The question whether the plaintiff can maintain this action was transferred from the May term, 1919, of the superior court by <em>Marble, </em>J., without a ruling.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-13\"><em>Hurd &amp; Kinney {Mr. Hurd </em>orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-14\"><em>Streeter, Demond, Woodworth &lt;&amp; Sulloway {Mr. Jonathan Piper </em>orally), for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A2p\">Young, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Al1\">If the language of the policy is given its ordinary meaning, the defendants are liable for any.loss the plaintiff sustains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>during the life of the policy because \u201cof the ownership, maintenance and use\u201d of his automobile, provided liability for the loss was imposed on him by law. In other words, the question whether the defendants are liable for the Dean judgment, does not depend on whether the plaintiff was using the machine on his own business where the accident happened, but on whether the law made him liable for Dean\u2019s loss. The test, therefore, to determine whether the plaintiff can maintain this action is to inquire whether Dean could have enforced the judgment against him; and that he might is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The fact a partner is individually liable for the debts of his firm distinguishes this case from those on which the defendants rely, for in <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Company, </em>97 Mo. App. 623, the partnership was suing to recover for the loss one of the partners sustained. And in <em>Rock Springs </em>&amp;c. <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Company, </em>160 Ky. 317, the corporation was suing to recover the loss one of its stockholders sustained, and while a partner is individually liable for the debts of his firm, a partnership is not liable for the debts of the individuals who compose it, neither is a corporation liable for the debts of its shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In other words, in these cases liability for the loss the plaintiffs were seeking to recover was not imposed on them by law, while in this case liability for the loss the plaintiff is seeking to recover was imposed on him by law. It follows from the fact Dean might have enforced his judgment against the plaintiff that the defendants are liable for all the loss that he sustained by reason of the Dean suit. For example, if he had paid the judgment and the expenses incident to defending the suit, he could recover the amount so paid from the defendants, and they could maintain an action under condition \u201cE\u201d of the policy, for an accounting against the members of B. Steinfield\u2019s Sons, or against the one who was driving the machine at the time the accident happened, if as between the partners he was liable for the loss the firm sustained by reason of the Dean suit. That, however, is not the case, for the firm paid the judgment and the expenses of defending the suit, consequently the plaintiff can only recover in this suit the amount with which he would be charged because of the Dean suit on an accounting, and if he succeeds in this suit and the defendants satisfy the judgment he recovers against them, they will be subrogated to his rights to proceed against the one who drove the machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b451-8\">Peaslee, J., was absent: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
