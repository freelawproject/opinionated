Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant had accepted the provisions of the employers\u2019 liability act and the case was tried at common law. The plaintiff was the defendant\u2019s servant, employed as a lineman, and was injured by the falling of a decayed pole, upon which he was working. The defect should have been discovered by the defendant\u2019s employee, Green, who inspected the pole some months before. The evidence as to inspection was that it was the defendant\u2019s custom to inspect once a year \u2014 in the spring if they \u201c got around to it.\u201d The foreman took a man from the crew to do the shoveling and probing the poles, while he himself made a record of the result reported. It was not the duty or the practice for the men who were about to climb poles to inspect them if they looked all right \u2014 as this one did. The defendant\u2019s motions for a nonsuit and for a directed verdict were denied, subject to 'exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-10\">The precept in the writ sets out the defendant as having a usual place of business in Bow, and the plaintiff as a resident of Concord. It appeared in evidence at the trial that both parties were residents of Hillsborough county; and it was admitted that the defendant had property and a place of business in Merrimack county. Thereupon the defendant moved that the case be transferred to Hillsborough county. The motion was denied, subject to exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b523-11\">Transferred from the October term, 1919, of the superior court by <em>Branch, </em>J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-12\"><em>Robert W.

If this had been done it is reasonable to conclude that more care would have been used by the foreman at the time of the accident, and the injury would have been avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The defendant\u2019s position is that the inspection had been turned over to the linemen generally, so that the case comes within the rule laid down in <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>76 N. H. 523. The evidence fails to sustain this contention. It appears that the practice was for the foreman to select a man and make an inspection, usually in the spring, and record the result in a book kept for that purpose. It was not the rule or the practice for linemen worldng upon the poles to inspect them if they \u201clooked all right,\u201d as this one did. In this respect the facts differ essentially from those in the <em>Sanborn </em>case. There the workman was supposed to ascertain the condition of the instrumentalities he was to deal with, and to do what was necessary to make them safe. Here he was to assume the safety of the pole unless its appearance indicated a different condition. That is, this pole line,, inspected each spring, was a place prepared for the linemen to work upon, and the case was for the jury under the rule as stated in <em>Haakensen </em>v. <em>Company, </em>76 N. H. 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the linemen were to reset the poles \u201cas occasion required\u201d omits the essential fact that their knowledge of occasion for such action was to be obtained from the report of the annual inspection. It was not their duty, as a part of their ordinary work upon the line, to ascertain whether a pole had decayed below the surface of the earth.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">The fact that the inspection, when made, was carried on by. a lineman does not alter the situation. When acting as inspector he was not performing a part of his everyday task, but a special duty to which he might be assigned from time to time. <em>Twombly </em>v. <em>Company, </em>98 Me. 353. It was not an incident of the routine work of the linemen. <em>Nord Deutscher &amp;c. Co. </em>v. <em>Ingebregsten, </em>57 N. J. L. 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The defendant\u2019s exception to the denial of its motion for a change of venue presents no substantial question of law. There was ample evidence upon which the motion could be denied as a matter of discretion. <em>Whitcher </em>v. <em>Association, </em>77 N. H. 405. The claim that the denial was the result of a ruling of law rather than of a finding o\u00ed fact is negatived by the refusal of the presiding justice to amend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>case by adding a statement to that effect. The argument that notwithstanding this refusal the record shows that the presiding justice acted as he says he did not, is not entitled to serious consideration. The defendant\u2019s contention rests wholly upon inference and surmise, and is contrary to the reasonable interpretation of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b525-4\">Walker, J., was absent: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
