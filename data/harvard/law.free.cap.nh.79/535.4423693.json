H. 600. The resolution which we have been informed has been adopted by you requiring our opinion upon the question \u201cwhether the governor can legally remove the adjutant-general of the state\u201d fails to make clear what action of your body is dependent upon the answer to that question. But upon the assumption that our opinion may be of use to you in the performance of the duties legally imposed upon you, we herewith respectfully answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">Our opinion is that the governor has not the power to remove the adjutant-general, a duly commissioned officer of the militia, except upon the address of both houses of the legislature. Constitution, Part II, <em>article </em>52 (53); 62 N. H. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">While the secretary of state is the recording officer of the council, the verity of the record is established by the signatures of the members of the council. Constitution, Part II, <em>articles </em>46 (47), 63 (64).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-15\">The informality by which information of your action has reached <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>us has not been permitted to prevent prompt consideration and reply.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b564-5\"><em>Drew, Shurtleff, Morris &amp; Oakes (Irving A.
