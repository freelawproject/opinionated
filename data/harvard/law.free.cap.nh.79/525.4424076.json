But the court also found from the facts that the error or misconduct of the jury in then assessment of the damages was so great, and the consideration they gave to the case was so brief, that they did not fairly consider the issue of liability. This finding presents no error and justified the order setting aside the verdict on both issues. It does not \u2018 \u2018 clearly appear that the effect of the error did not extend to all the issues tried.\u201d <em>McBride </em>v. <em>Huckins, </em>76 N.
