Transferred by <em>Allen, </em>J., from the October term, 1917, of the superior court on the plaintiff\u2019s exception to a nonsuit. The intestate was in the Newburyport station when the Portsmouth train arrived. It made the usual stop, and after it started and the vestibule doors had been elosed, the intestate stepped onto the lower step of a passing car and rapped on the vestibule door, but no one opened it, and he was thrown from the train and killed. Other facts sufficiently appear from the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-8\"><em>Ernest L. Guptill, Ralph C. Gray </em>and <em>Robert C. Burke </em>(of Massachusetts) <em>{Mr. Guptill </em>orally), for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b193-9\"><em>Hughes &amp; Doe </em>and <em>Albert R.

H. 151. The evidence on which he relies to prove that fact is the testimony of several witnesses who saw a trainman entering the car from the vestibule just as the intestate began to rap on the vestibule door. This is insufficient to prove that they actually knew of it in time to prevent the accident. It cannot be found, therefore, that the defendants were in fault, for there is no evidence which even tends to prove that the defendants ought to have anticipated that the intestate might attempt to board the train when and as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-12\">Plummer, J., was absent: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
