In December, 1914, he consulted a physician who was called as a witness by him and testified that his treatment of the plaintiff was based upon his injury and the history given by him. The question, \u201cWhat history did he give you?\u201d was excluded subject to exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-14\">The defendants offered evidence that the plaintiff was not employed by them before November 13, 1913. The plaintiff, recalled after the defendants rested, stated that after hearing the evidence and thinking the matter over to the best of his knowledge the accident happened the last of November or the first of December. The question by his counsel, \u201cPrior to this trial last Friday did you ever hear a,ny suggestion from any source of any different date for the accident than about the first of October?\u201d was then excluded subject to exception.

This is too plain for discussion. The only ground upon which the admissibility of the question is now urged is that the physician\u2019s information as to the cause of the injury is competent as explaining and giving weight to his conclusions. If the purpose of the inquiry was under the pretext of offering evidence of the foundation of the physician\u2019s opinion to violate the general rule excluding prior statements of the party, the evidence was properly excluded. Wig. Ev., <em>s. </em>1721. Whether, if the ground of admission now claimed was presented to the court, the evidence should be excluded because of lack of good faith in offering it, was necessarily for the trial court, as depending upon the determination of a question of fact. <em>St. Laurent </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>77 N. H. 460, 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">There was evidence to sustain a finding excluding the evidence, if the ground now urged was presented to the trial court. It does not appear this ground was presented to the court for a ruling and the question is not transferred by a general exception to the exclusion of the testimony. <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Flanders, </em>72 N. H. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The defendants having answered the plaintiff\u2019s claim that he was injured while in their employ by showing that he was not employed by them until after the date upon which he said he was injured, he was permitted to assign a later date after his employment by them and to give his reasons therefor. If the question, whether before he heard the defendants\u2019 testimony he heard any suggestion from any source of any different date for the accident than about the first of October, was intended to effect the introduction of hearsay testimony of some other as to the fact or date of the accident, such evidence would be incompetent as an elementary proposition. If the purpose of the question was to stimulate belief in the plaintiff\u2019s later testimony by showing that his former statement was honestly though mistakenly made, as now seems to be claimed, the evidence if in any way relevant so as to be admissible at all, could be found too remote to aid the jury and excluded upon that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>Nothing appearing to the contrary, it is assumed it was so excluded. In such case, no question of law is presented for decision by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b205-6\">Plummer, J., was absent: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
