This is the same case reported in 78 N. H. 456. After that opinion was handed down the defendant was permitted to file a cross-bill alleging that the agreement was procured by fraud. The court found for Rollins, and, upon Brock\u2019s disclaimer of an intention to redeem, ordered \"that his right be foreclosed. The defendant\u2019s bill of exceptions to this decree was allowed by <em>Marble, </em>J., at the May term, 1918, of the superior court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-10\"><em>Snow, Snow &amp; Cooper, </em>for Rollins and Abbott.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b359-11\"><em>Sewall W.

The question, therefore, raised by the defendant\u2019s exception is whether there is any evidence to warrant the court\u2019s finding that justice requires the decree be absolute. The defendant disclaimed any intention of redeeming the property, so instead of there being no evidence to sustain the court\u2019s finding, that is the only conclusion of which the evidence is fairly capable.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b359-15\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
