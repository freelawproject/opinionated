Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to prove that she scratched her finger on a wire protruding about half an inch from the side of the machine she was operating; that general infection of her body resulted from the accident; and that she has experienced very serious ailments by reason thereof. The defendants\u2019 motions for a nonsuit and directed verdict, and that the verdict be set aside as against the law and the evidence, were denied subject to the defendants\u2019 exceptions. Exceptions were also taken by the defendants to the admission and rejection of testimony. Transferred from the May term, 1918,. of the superior court by <em>Kivel, </em>C.

H. 614. There it was decided on the plaintiff\u2019s exception to a nonsuit, that the defendants might be held liable for the plaintiff\u2019s injury. The defendants in support of their motions, now being' considered, for a nonsuit and directed verdict, have not contended that they might not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>be found liable on the evidence for the plaintiff\u2019s injury resulting from the accident. The sole claim now appears to be that the damages for which compensation is sought by the plaintiff, are too remote and speculative to be attributed to the accident suffered by her. The question raised by the motions, however, is not whether the verdict returned could be found, but is whether on the evidence any verdict could be found for the plaintiff. The plaintiff received an injury while working upon the defendants\u2019 machine. It being conceded that the defendants might be held liable for the accident, a verdict could be rendered for the plaintiff. The exception to the refusal of the court to set aside the verdict as being against the law and the evidence presents no question of law. <em>Lyman </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>73 N.
