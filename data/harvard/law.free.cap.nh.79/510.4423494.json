At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence a non-suit was ordered subject to exception. The defendant died after the accident and before the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b538-13\">The plaintiff was injured while operating a dieing-out machine in the defendant\u2019s shoe shop. The plaintiff called a witness who testified that he was working near the plaintiff, heard his outcry when injured, and that the defendant was not anywhere near them. The plaintiff was then called as a witness in his own behalf. The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>fendant\u2019s counsel stated that the defendant executor elected not to testify, and objected to any testimony from the plaintiff covering anything that took place before the decedent died. This objection was sustained, and the plaintiff\u2019s offer of his own testimony how he got hurt was excluded, subject to exception.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-5\">Transferred from the January term, 1920, of the superior court by <em>Allen, </em>J.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b539-6\"><em>Thomas J.

Ordinarily this finding by the trial court would be conclusive, if supported by sufficient evidence. But by the provision of the statute applicable here the conclusion reached by the presiding justice may be excepted to and revised. P. S., c. 224, s. 17; <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Gafney, </em>66 N. H. 261. Such an exception brings to this court questions of fact as well as those of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">At the time the plaintiff was offered as a witness there was evidence in the case which appears to us to prove that the decedent was not present when the accident occurred. From this it follows that the plaintiff should have been allowed to testify to his own acts at and just before the time he was injured. As it does not appear that the decedent did not know the condition of the machine, the plaintiff was not a competent witness upon that question. <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>Follansbee, ante, </em>205, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">The defendant claims that the exception only raises the question of the general competency of the plaintiff under Public Statutes, chapter 224, section 16; and that there was no offer to bring his testimony within the exception provided by section 17. The record does not sustain this position. Upon the offer of the plaintiff as a witness the defendant objected to permitting the plaintiff to testify to \u201cAny thing that took place before the decedent died. This objection was sustained and the plaintiff\u2019s offer of his own testimony how he got hurt was excluded, subject to plaintiff\u2019s exception.\u201d Before this occurred the plaintiff had introduced the evidence which tended to show that Griffin was not an eye witness to the accident. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>If it was necessary for the plaintiff, when offering himself as a witness, to indicate that he proposed to testify to such facts only as were not within the knowledge of the decedent, his previous course in the trial was tantamount to such a limitation of the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">The defendant interposed his objection as soon as the plaintiff was called to the stand. The objection did not in terms refer to any statute, and was based upon the broad proposition that the plaintiff could not testify to \u201canything\u201d occurring in the decedent\u2019s lifetime. If for any reason, or by virtue of any statute, the plaintiff could testify to any fact of that class, the sweeping objection was so far unsound. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony having been rejected by the ruling sustaining the defendant\u2019s position, it was not incumbent upon the plaintiff to go further with his offer. His exception fairly raises the question whether he could testify to any fact occurring in Griffin's lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">As the plaintiff\u2019s testimony as to his own conduct may supply the deficiency now claimed to exist in the evidence, or may change the aspect of the case wherein the defendant claims fault of the plaintiff is conclusively shown, those questions have not been considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\n<em>New trial.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b540-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
