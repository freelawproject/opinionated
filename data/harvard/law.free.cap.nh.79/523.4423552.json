Verdict for the defendant. The court found that the trial was unfair and set the verdict aside. Transferred by <em>Sawyer, </em>J., from the April term, 1917, of the superior court \u2022on the defendant\u2019s exception to this finding.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b551-7\"><em>John M. Stark </em>and <em>Robert W. Upton, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b551-8\"><em>Martin &amp; Howe, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b551-9\">Young, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Au5\">The question raised by the defendant\u2019s exception is not whether the remarks excepted to were prejudicial, as a matter of law, but whether there is any evidence to warrant the court\u2019s finding that they rendered the trial unfair. Instead of there being no evidence to sustain the finding that they were prejudicial, that is the only conclusion of which the evidence is fairly capable. The question whether they produced the verdict is not now before this court, for the evidence relevant to that issue is not made a part of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b551-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
