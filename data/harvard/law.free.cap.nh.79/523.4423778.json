Transferred from the April term, 1918, of the superior court by <em>Marble, </em>J., upon the defendant\u2019s exceptions to the denial of his motions for a nonsuit and a directed verdict, and to the argument of plaintiff\u2019s counsel to the jury. The facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b551-16\"><em>Benton &amp; Pickard, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b551-17\"><em>John J.

As he approached the intersection of Cross street, he saw the defendant coming down to Court street in an automobile. There was apparently plenty of time for the plaintiff to cross ahead of the defendant and he did so. He was on the pight side of the street, going about ten miles an hour. The defendant turned the corner into Court street in the direction the plaintiff was traveling, gave no warning of his approach, and struck the plaintiff from the rear. Further recital of the facts is unnecessary. From those already stated it is apparent that the case was properly submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">The argument to which exception was taken merely asked the jury to draw a legitimate inference from the evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b552-6\">Plummer, J., was absent: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
