Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. The defendants excepted to certain statements made in the argument for the plaintiff, which are stated in the opinion.

If there was in the argument a misstatement of the evidence by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the error is not fatal to the verdict <em>(State </em>v. <em>Wren, </em>77 N. H. 361, 364; <em>Gosselin </em>v. <em>Company, </em>78 N. H. 149), especially in view of the finding of the presiding justice that \u201cI am of the opinion that the statements [of counsel in argument] produced no injury to the defence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">2. Statements that the defendants were engaged in a scheme to defeat justice and to bring discredit upon the courts, inferrible from the counsel\u2019s view of the testimony, are not open to exception as presenting an error of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dinagan, ante, </em>7; <em>Topore </em>v. <em>Railroad, ante, </em>169; <em>State </em>v. <em>Small, </em>78 N. H. 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">3. An assertion that when the police are \u201cdown on a person there is generally a reason,\u201d which introduces no new fact, is not objectionable. It would seem to be immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-17\">4. The question whether the defendants had been instructed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>the law of perjury, as counsel for the plaintiff stated, had no relevancy to any issue on trial. Nor is it clear how such a statement unexplained by other evidentiary facts would be prejudicial or induce in the minds of the jury a belief that the defendants were not to be believed. Ordinarily a knowledge of the law of perjury would cause witnesses to testify to what they believed to be true upon material points rather than what they believed to be false. The argument was not harmful to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">5. When counsel told the jury in effect that the fact the defendants did not testify in a former criminal proceeding against them, growing out of the same facts as exist in the present case, is an admission of their guilt, he was merely stating a rule of law; he was not introducing new facts as of his own knowledge. Such an error is correctible by the court in its charge to the jury; and it is the duty of the party against whom the erroneous rule operates to request the court to charge in accordance with the law; otherwise he is held to waive his objection. <em>Seeton </em>v. <em>Dunbarton, 73 </em>N. H. 134, 137; <em>Lane v. Manchester Mills, </em>75 N. H. 102, 106; <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Moody, ante, </em>87.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled: judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b437-7\">Peaslee, J., was absent: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
