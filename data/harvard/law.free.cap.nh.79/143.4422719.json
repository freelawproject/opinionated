Trial by jury and verdict for the plaintiff. After the verdict, the defendant moved (1) to dismiss the suit because it was begun by trustee-process, and (2) to arrest the judgment because the declaration does not state a cause of action. Transferred from the January term, 1918, of the superior court by <em>Marble, </em>J., on the defendant\u2019s exception to the denial of these motions, and (3) to remarks of counsel.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-13\"><em>George W.

If it were true that the court would have dismissed the suit on motion at any time before the trial, it would not follow that this motion should have been granted, for the court had jurisdiction of both the parties and the cause of action, consequently the defendant could legally do what the case finds he did do, waive his right, if he had such a right, to have the suit dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">2. When a cause has been tried without objection to the sufficiency of the pleadings, the court will not take the time necessary to invest\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>gate their technical accuracy. \u201cIf inaccurate, the error can be corrected by amendment.\u201d <em>Barrett </em>v. Cady, 78 N. H. 60, 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">3. So much of the remarks excepted to as charged the defendant with \u201cpeddling\u201d the slander over Lyman were immediately withdrawn, consequently the question raised by this exception is whether the evidence warranted counsel in asking the jury to find that the defendant was responsible for the slander being \u201cpeddled\u201d all over that town. A witness who heard the defendant make the slanderous statement wrote to a man in Lyman about it; and about that time the plaintiff\u2019s friends who lived in that town began to avoid her. As there was no other reason for their avoiding her shown, it can be found that they had heard of the slander and avoided her for that reason..</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b172-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
