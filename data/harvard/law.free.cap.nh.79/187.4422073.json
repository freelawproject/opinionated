The plaintiffs and the defendant own mills on the same stream. The dam turns the water from the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>stream into a canal which carries it to the defendant\u2019s mill and from there to the plaintiffs\u2019 mill. Both mills were owned by the same persons in 1891, who then, conveyed the lower mill to the plaintiffs, and by a later conveyance the upper mill passed to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-5\">Transferred by <em>Marble, </em>J., from the April term, 1918, of the superior court on an agreement that the bill is to be dismissed if the defendant is not bound to repair the dam.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b216-6\"><em>Charles H.

In other words, notwithstanding the plaintiffs\u2019 deed gives them the right to use the dam to draw water from the stream for the use of their mill, neither the deed nor the law imposes the duty of keeping the dam in repair on either of the parties for the benefit of the other. <em>Horne </em>v. <em>Hutchins, </em>71 N.
