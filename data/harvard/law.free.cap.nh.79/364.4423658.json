Trial by jury and verdict for the defendant. It appeared in evidence that prior to April 6, 1917, the defendant, through its manager, E. M. Slayton, had purchased Chilean beans, known as Bayos, from the plaintiffs and had insisted upon and received a high grade of goods. On that day he wrote them: \u201cIf you have No. 1 quality of Bayos to offer from the new crop, write or wire us.\u201d May 2, they replied that the old crop was exhausted but that they could offer him up to fifty tons from the May-June shipment. He replied May 3, \u201cBook twenty tons Bayos for us.\u201d \u25a0 There was further correspondence, relating to quantity and price. On June 25 the plaintiffs wrote that they were shipping the beans and mailing samples and' that the quality was \u201cvery fine.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-10\">The beans were not well cleaned, containing about seven per cent of waste, and were mixed with other beans. A witness who examined them testified that they were not merchantable. The defendant' wrote refusing to accept the beans because they were of poor quality, mixed with other beans, not like the sample and not salable for A No. 1 Bayos.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-11\">Chilean beans are not graded for market. That is, there is no quotation of No. 1, No. 2 etc. Bayo beans.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-12\">The plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a directed verdict was denied, subject to exception.

The authorities upon this question are conflicting. 23 R. C. L. 1435. It is not necessary however to consider the soundness of the legal proposition thus advanced, for the evidence shows the defendant\u2019s original objection to the goods to be couched in substantially the same language as the original offer to purchase, which was the basis of the contract of sale; and there was also evidence that the objection was well founded in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">In the defendant\u2019s letter of April 6, inquiry is made for \u201cNo. 1 quality of Bayos.\u201d Assuming that the trade do not grade Bayo beans, this letter calls for beans of good quality. There is nothing in the later correspondence to show an abandonment of this proposition. When the goods were offered for delivery they were refused because they were not No. 1 Bayo beans. This being the same description of the goods used in the original letter of inquiry, it states a sufficient reason for refusing to accept the beans, if the quality was as claimed by the defendant. As before suggested, if \u201cNo. 1 quality of Bayos\u201d has no trade meaning, in the sense that the goods are graded and sold as No. 1,, No. 2 etc., it plainly means that the purchaser under such a designation is at least entitled to a good merchantable product. Whatever the exact shade of meaning may be, it cannot be more favorable to the plaintiff than that the beans should be of merchantable quality. Benj. Sales, ss. 983, 989. There was evidence in this case that the beans were dirty and mixed with other beans, and one witness testified that they were not merchantable. If this evidence was believed, the defendant was entitled to reject the shipment, because it did not comply with the contract for \u201cNo. 1 quality of Bayos.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b393-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
