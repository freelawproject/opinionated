The cases were tried together by jury, a view was taken and verdicts were rendered for the plaintiffs.

Consequently the motions for non-suits and directed verdicts were properly denied. <em>Altman </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>75 N. H. 573; <em>Cavanaugh </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>76 N. H. 68; <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>76 N. H. 80; <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>77 N. H. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">Bean testified that after the collision he asked the engineer why he didn\u2019t stop, and that the engineer replied as above quoted: \u201cI thought you were far enough away so we would clear you all right.\u201d The defendants excepted to the introduction of this statement in evidence. The statement according to the testimony was made directly after the accident occurred, and its admission as a part of the <em>res gestae </em>presents no error of law. <em>Nawn </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>77 N. H. 299; <em>Dorr </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>76 N. H. 160; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Stahl, </em>74 N. H. 310; <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>72 N. H. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">The plaintiff\u2019s counsel in argument to the jury said: \u201cNow, gentlemen, there cannot be a man on this jury but what knows of his own knowledge and good common sense that a man can stop a locomotive in going thirty rods, if he tries to. Thirty rods is a good distance. If you don\u2019t believe it, walk it off sometime and see the distance. There was a locomotive coming down there light, didn\u2019t have anything attached to it; he had automatic brakes, air brakes that he could clutch right onto both sides of the wheels. It was an up-to-date locomotive, he says, the Pacific type of locomotive, and if he tried to stop that locomotive he certainly could have done it. . . . All of us have been in stations, perhaps larger than Newport, when a train has come in with a string of cars behind it, and come in full force, right into that station, going fast, when the engineer has stopped the train there, going a very few car lengths. It don\u2019t take thirty rods for a man to stop a locomotive, if he tries to.\u201d To this argument the defendants excepted. The evidence in the case did not justify these statements. There was no evidence to show in what distance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>a locomotive could be stopped except that of the engineer operating the engine. He testified that he made .an emergency application of the brakes and put on sand to stop the engine just south of the north end of the cross-over, which was less than thirty rods north of the crossing where the accident occurred, and stopped about twice the length of the engine south of the crossing, and that he made a good stop. The plaintiffs attempted to offer evidence as to the distance in which a locomotive going twenty-five miles an hour could be stopped, but the witness offered failed to qualify as an expert. No witness stated that it did not take thirty rods to stop a locomotive running twenty-five miles an hour, or gave any evidence from which such an inference could be drawn. It is claimed that it is a matter of common knowledge that an engine running twenty-five miles an hour on a down grade of one-fifth to one-half per cent can be stopped in less than thirty rods, and therefore that it was competent for counsel to make the statement objected to, without evidence. This contention cannot be sustained. The rule that allows counsel to argue and the jury to decide a question without evidence on the ground that it is a subject of common or general knowledge, \u201cis strictly limited to a few matters of elemental experience in human nature, commercial affairs, and everyday life.\u201d 4 Wig. Ev., <em>s. </em>2570. The distance in which a locomotive going at a certain rate of speed can be brought to a stop, is knowledge that the average man in the community does not possess. Information of this character is acquired by experience in operating engines, such as men in general do not have. \u201cIn estimating time, distance, and rapid motion, the mass of men are inexpert.\u201d <em>Huntress </em>v. Railroad, 66 N. H. 185, 190. We have seen only one case where the precise question under consideration has been passed upon. In <em>Union Pac. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Shannon, </em>33 Kan. 446, it was held that the distance in which a railroad engine running at a.certain speed can be stopped is not a matter of common knowledge. That the importance and necessity of furnishing proof upon this question was fully realized by counsel, is shown by his attempt to introduce testimony relative thereto. And upon his failure to do so, he did not content himself with , asking the jury to find the fact from their own knowledge <em>(Statev. Currier, ante, </em>171) but sought to supply the deficiency by his own statement of the fact. The argument went beyond the scope of legitimate advocacy. The defendants were entitled to have the cases tried and verdicts rendered wholly upon the evidence introduced at the trial, and, if the improper remarks had any weight with the jury, the defendants were deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>of that fair and impartial trial which was their right under the law. The facts stated of which there was no evidence, were not only material and pertinent, but related to a vital issue in these cases, and it cannot be said, as a matter of law, that the jury was not influenced by them in returning the verdicts. There being no retraction of the improper remarks nor finding by the court that the jury were not affected thereby, the verdicts must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\n<em>Exceptions to the denial of nonsuits and directed verdicts, and to the admission of evidence overruled: exception to argument sustained: verdicts set aside: new trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b263-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
