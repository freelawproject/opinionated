Jeremiah died after the will was made leaving two children as his heirs. The will was construed as giving Jeremiah\u2019s children one half of the remainder of money and Ellen\u2019s heirs the other half, and to such construction and decree adopting it, the heirs of Ellen excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-9\">Transferred by <em>Allen, </em>J., from the January term, 1918, of the superior court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-10\"><em>Chester T.

The phrase, \u201cTo be divided equally among them,\u201d though not expressed with verbal precision, refers to an equal division between the two classes, consisting on the one hand of Jeremiah and his heirs, and on the other of the heirs of Ellen. The use of the words \u201cor his heirs\u201d is of little importance. The legacy to Jeremiah was intended to be an absolute gift, as was the legacy to Ellen\u2019s heirs. If Jeremiah had survived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the testatrix it is not probable her intention would be carried out by a construction which would give one sixth of the money to him and five sixths to Ellen\u2019s heirs. If such' was not her intention, it follows it was not her intention that his two children surviving should only receive two sevenths of the legacy while Ellen\u2019s five surviving children should receive five sevenths of it. \u25a0 In the absence of explanatory evidence why the testatrix desired to dispose of her property in that peculiar way, it cannot be found that she had such an intention from language in the will that does not make such a construction necessary, or that is at least open to doubt and conjecture as to its precise meaning. The cases relied upon by Ellen\u2019s heirs <em>(Farmer </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>46 N. H. 435; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>64 N. H. 328; <em>Cuthbert </em>v. <em>Laing, </em>75 N. H. 304) are distinguishable from the present case and are not irreconcilable with the above finding of the fact of the testatrix\u2019s intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">The result arrived at renders it unnecessary to consider the admissibility of statements made by the testatrix as to why she made the present will.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b98-7\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
