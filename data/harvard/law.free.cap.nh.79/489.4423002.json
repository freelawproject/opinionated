Trial by jury and verdict for the defendant. The evidence tended to prove the following facts: As parts of a single transaction, the defendant\u2019s agent sold the plaintiff two carloads of flour, one for immediate delivery and the other to be \u201cordered out\u201d by the plaintiff within 60 days. The orders were sent to the defendant, and it returned to the plaintiff two written memoranda of the transaction. These were marked \u201cfirst car\u201d and \u201csecond car,\u201d and except as to time for delivery were otherwise identical. One condition stated was that the plaintiff should pay at a certain time. He did not so pay for the first car, and failed to order out the second one within the time limited. He later called for it, and the defendant refused to make delivery. In response to a letter from the plaintiff\u2019s attorney the defendant stated that its refusal was for the reason that the plaintiff did not pay for the first car as agreed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b517-13\">Subject to exception, the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was denie\u2019d by <em>Allen, </em>J., who transferred the case from the December term, 1919, of the superior court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-14\"><em>Ovide J.

He did not order out the second car within the agreed time. But it is insisted that the defence is not open here because the defendant is estopped to set it up. This claim is based upon a letter written by the defendant to counsel for the plaintiff in which another breach is stated as the cause for a refusal to deliver the second car. If this letter could be treated as the foundation for an estoppel which would bar all other defences and permit the plaintiff to repover as though they did not exist, there is no evidence in the case to show that either the plaintiff or his counsel took any action or changed any position in reliance upon the defendant\u2019s assertion. In this state of the evidence it is manifest that the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was properly denied. <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>Morrison, ante, </em>74. The burden was upon the plaintiff to prove the estoppel, and if his reliance upon the letter might be inferred from his subsequently bringing suit, that was not the only conclusion that could be reached, especially when the plaintiff failed to testify to that effect. <em>Mechanics Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>Feeney, ante, </em>267. At the most, he merely made a case for the jury upon this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b518-6\">Walker, J., was absent: the others concurred.
