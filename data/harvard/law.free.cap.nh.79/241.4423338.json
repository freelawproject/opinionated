The complaint charged that the respondent at Rochester on December 24, 1918, \u201cdid then and there unlawfully, knowingly and criminally, keep for sale spirituous and intoxicating liquors.\u201d A search warrant was issued and in executing the same the officer found Jamaica ginger upon the premises of the respondent1, but he did not sign the return of what he found until the respondent moved to quash the complaint for that reason, when the court permitted the return to be signed by the officer. To this the respondent excepted. The evidence tended to prove that the respondent kept Jamaica ginger for sale for beverage use and that it contained 92 per cent of alcohol. Trial by jury \u201eand verdict of guilty. The respondent filed a motion in arrest of judgment which was denied subject to exception.

It would seem that the court was authorized to allow the amendment by P. S., <em>c. 253, s. </em>13. But whether this is true or not, the failure of the officer to sign the return did not render the evidence furnished by the bottles seized inadmissible. The method by which they were obtained and produced before the court, even if illegal, did not affect their value as evidence of what they contained. State v. <em>Flynn, </em>36 N. H. 64; <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Trumbull, </em>45 N. H. 408, 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The complaint was evidently drawn under s. 19, c. 147, Laws of 1917, which provides that, \u201cIf any person, not being authorized by law to sell intoxicating liquor, shall sell; or keep for sale, any intoxicating liquor in any quantity, he shall be fined,\u201d &amp;c. The proof was that the respondent kept for sale as a beverage Jamaica ginger containing 92 per cent of alcohol. By <em>s. </em>60 intoxicating liquor includes \u201cany beverage by whatever name called, containing more than one per cent of alcohol, by volume, at sixty degrees Fahrenheit; and any .beverage any part of which is intoxicating.\u201d It follows that the Jamaica ginger which the respondent kept for sale, as a beverage, was intoxicating liquor within the legislative definition. The offence charged falls within the apparent prohibition of the statute quoted. But the respondent claims that the prosecution cannot be sustained under <em>s. </em>19, because <em>s. 21 </em>provides that, \u201cThe sale of Jamaica Ginger, or other compounds of alcohol, in such quantity, or with such frequency, as to indicate that it is intended for beverage use, shall be deemed unlawful selling of intoxicating liquor, within the provisions of this act; and the punishment shall be the same as in the case of selling or keeping for sale intoxicating liquor.\u201d The argument is that as the sale of Jamaica ginger, under certain conditions, is prohibited by <em>s. </em>21, the sale or the keeping of it for sale is not an offence under <em>s. </em>19. It must be admitted that the intention of the legislature in regard to the question thus presented is not clear, when both statutes are considered together. As aboye pointed out the language of <em>s. </em>19 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>broad enough to cover the keeping for sale as a beverage of the compound in question, and it is clear when both sections are read together that the purpose of <em>s. </em>21 was to make certain facts, \u2014 the quantity and frequency of the sale, \u2014 evidence upon the purpose with which the compound was kept. As the Jamaica ginger was kept for sale to be used as a beverage the respondent\u2019s motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled: judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b271-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
