Landry was a resident of St. Marie in the Province of Quebec in 1899, when he gave J. A. Morency, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>plaintiff\u2019s intestate, a note, which Morency discounted at the local bank. As the note was not paid at maturity, the bank sued both Landry and Morency and recovered judgment against them in 1900.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-5\">Morency paid the judgment in 1902 and his administratrix is now attempting to enforce it against Landry\u2019s estate. Landry subsequently emigrated to this state, filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy in 1906, received a discharge in due course and died in 1912. In the bankruptcy proceedings Landry included this claim in his schedule of liability stating the creditors under the claim to be F. Morency, F. Morency &amp; Co., and the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b334-6\">The court found on evidence that notices to these creditors were duly mailed, that both J. A.

That congress has the power to so provide, as far as future proceedings in this country are concerned, has not been questioned and is not open to doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">But it is argued that while congress might enact such a law it has not done so. The chief contention made in favor of this conclusion is that prior to the enactment of the present statute earlier bankruptcy acts containing provisions of similar purport had been construed as not affecting the right of the non-participating foreign creditor to thereafter maintain a suit in our courts. Hence it is said that congress intended to express a like purpose here.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>The claim that prior to 1898 similar provisions in earlier bankruptcy laws had been authoritatively construed favorably to the plaintiff\u2019s contention, is not borne out by the cases cited. The question has never been passed upon by the supreme court of the United States. The case in that court which is relied upon <em>(Ogden </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>12 Wheat. 213) raised questions as to the constitutional limitation upon the power of the several states to enact insolvency laws. No question of the meaning of any national bankruptcy law or of the power of congress to enact the same, was involved, and the subject was not considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"><em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Borland, </em>103 N. Y. 406, deals with the effect to be given here to a discharge of a foreign debtor in his own country. It does not involve the question now under consideration, and the matter is not referred to in the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">In <em>Lizardi </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>3 Gill (Md.) 430, the question was whether a discharged bankrupt was a competent witness as to a London contract. It was held that the contract was not discharged and that therefore the witness was interested and incompetent. The decision is put upon the ground stated by Judge Story (Confl. Laws, s. 342) \u201cthat a discharge of a contract by the law of a place where the contract was not made, or to be performed, will not be a discharge of it in any other country.\u201d It does not discharge the obligation so as to make the debtor disinterested. He is still liable in the \u201cother country.\u201d Whether the debt was discharged locally was a question not necessary to the decision and not discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">The only case cited holding that under the bankruptcy law of 1867 a discharge did not bar a subsequent suit here by a foreign creditor is <em>McDougall </em>v. <em>Page, 55 </em>Vt. 187, decided in 1882. But it was admitted in the opinion that the holding was contrary to the decisions in other states and that the question had not been passed upon by the supreme court of the United States. Add to this the facts that two judges dissented from the Vermont decision and that in 1884 still another decision opposed to it was announced <em>(Moore </em>v. <em>Horton, </em>32 Hun 393) and it becomes evident that there was not, in 1898, any authoritative interpretation of the act of 1867, such as is now claimed. The matter had not been passed upon by the court of last resort, and the views of others were conflicting.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">So far as the authorities go, their weight is against rather than for the plaintiff, upon the issue of how the earlier laws had been understood at the time the present law was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">The argument that a law making the discharge efficient locally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>as to a foreign creditor gives the domestic creditors undue advantages, compels the foreign creditor to pursue his debtor into other lands and undertakes to make a foreign discharge effective in another country where the creditor resides, is based upon a misconception of the effect of the discharge, so far as it relates to foreign creditors who do not participate in the bankruptcy proceedings. Such creditors are not thereby compelled to pursue their debtor into foreign lands. But if they do so pursue him they are bound by the limitation of remedy which applies to those resident there. Neither does the law undertake to make the discharge effective against the creditor in proceedings brought at his place of residence in Canada. It merely places him .on an equality with our own citizens in proceedings in our courts. It is manifest that such a law is not so devoid of just principle that it is always to be inferred that there was no intent to enact it.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">It has recently been declared that the object of the bankruptcy law is not merely to distribute the debtor\u2019s property equitably among the creditors \u201cbut as a main purpose of the act, intends to aid the unfortunate debtor by giving him a fresh start in life, free from debts. . . . Our decisions lay great stress upon this feature of the law. . . .\u201d <em>Stellwagen </em>v. <em>Clum, </em>245 U. S. 605, 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s argument is based upon an erroneous assumption as to the state of the law in 1898, and takes a narrow and mistaken view of the purposes intended to be effected by the legislation in question. The statute plainly applies to the case in hand, and the plaintiff\u2019s rights here are no greater than they would be if the creditor had resided in the United States. 2 Lov. Bank. s. 743; Bump Bank. <em>p. </em>713; Black Bank. <em>s. </em>723; <em>Ruiz </em>v. Eickerman, 5 Fed. Rep. 790; <em>Zarega\u2019s Case, </em>4 Law Reporter, 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">As the judgment recovered by the bank is a provable debt (s. 65 <em>d), </em>the right of the bank to recover on it is barred by the discharge. The plaintiff cannot recover on the note, or for money paid upon the judgment, because such claims are barred by the general six year limitation. She can recover only through the bank judgment. <em>Stavrelis </em>v. <em>Zadiarias, ante, </em>146.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">If it can be found that equitably the judgment belonged to J. A. Morency, and that he had the right to prosecute it in the bank's name, the plaintiff can answer the discharge only upon the ground that the bankrupt failed to name Morency as the creditor under the judgment. In order to impose that duty upon the bankrupt, it must appear that he knew of the change in the equitable title. -It is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>the bankrupt\u2019s duty to notify the assignee, until the assignee has performed his duty of notifying the bankrupt. \u201cUpon an assignment being made, it becomes the duty of the assignee to notify the debtor.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>27 N. H. 269, 272; <em>Relien </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>194 Mass. 579. While the mere fact of the surety\u2019s payment of the debt may be treated as constituting an equitable assignment of the rights incident to the original claim in the hands of the creditor, equity does not relieve the surety from the performance of his equitable duty to inform the debtor of the change in the situation. Until such notice is given, it is the debtor\u2019s right to treat the original creditor as the one to whom he owes a debtor\u2019s duties. And aside from this general common law rule, the provision of the bankruptcy act requiring the scheduling of the names of creditors \u201cif known\u201d plainly implies that one who has become a creditor without the knowledge of the bankrupt cannot complain because the claim is not scheduled as owing to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The cases \u201calmost -uniformly hold that where the bankrupt is sued on a debt existing at the time of filing the petition, the introduction of the order makes out a <em>prima facie </em>defence, the burden being then cast upon the plaintiff to show that, because of the nature of the claim, failure to give; notice or other statutory reason, the debt sued on was by law excepted from the operation of the discharge.\u201d <em>Kreitlein </em>v. <em>Ferger, </em>238 U. S. 21, 26. The same rule was announced in this state as applicable in proceedings under similar provisions contained in the national bankruptcy law of 1841. <em>Cutter </em>v. <em>Folsom, </em>17 N. H. 139; <em>Wiggins </em>v. <em>Shapleigh, </em>20 N. H. 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">This imposed on the plaintiff the burden of offering evidence tending to show that Landry, when he filed his petition, knew Morency\u2019s relation to him as a creditor through the bank judgment. No such evidence was offered and there was no error in the order dismissing the appeal. This conclusion renders it unnecessary to consider whether the mailing of notices to F. Morency and F. Morency &amp; Co. authorized the finding that J. A. Morency had actual knowledge of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\n<em>Exception (Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b337-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
