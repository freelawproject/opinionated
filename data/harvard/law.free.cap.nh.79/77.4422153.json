It was found by the master that the parties ultimately intended to return to Greece, and that they had in mind the performance of the contract in Greece more than in any other place. The marriage was solemnized, and the \u25a0 dowry contract was made conformably to \u201cthe divine and holy rites of the Orthodox' Eastern Church of Christ,\u201d and according to the laws of Greece under the rules and regulations of the Greek Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">It is contended by the defendant that by these laws, rules and regulations dowry given by the wife\u2019s father to his son-in-law is a gift for the purpose of alleviating the burdens of marriage, to be used dur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>ing the joint lives of the husband and wife, and to revert to the father in the event of the wife\u2019s death, without issue. Before' the bringing of this bill the plaintiff\u2019s wife died without issue. Hence it is claimed the dowry reverted to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The master found that dowry under these laws, rules and regulations was in accordance with the defendant\u2019s contention. The evidence in the case was sufficient to support such a finding, and the finding warranted the court in dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The plaintiff excepted to evidence offered by the defendant as to the meaning of the term \u201cdowery.\u201d The question for consideration in this case was what the parties understood when they used this word in the marriage contract. What did the term \u201cdowery\u201d mean to them? This was a Greek marriage contract, and evidence as to what was meant by \u201cdowery\u201d as used in such contract was competent. <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Green, </em>67 N.
