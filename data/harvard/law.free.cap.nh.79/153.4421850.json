October 22, 1914, the bank brought suit to foreclose the mortgage and were put in possession of the premises May 17, 1915, upon a writ duly issued in said suit, and while in possession May 17,1915, the bank by quitclaim deed conveyed all their right, title and interest in the premises to the plaintiff who thereupon took and has since retained open, notorious and exclusive possession thereunder. The writ of possession with the sheriff\u2019s return was duly recorded. There was no redemption from this foreclosure. The question what right if any the defendant creditors have in the premises under their attachment and levy was reserved by <em>Sawyer, </em>J., from the May term, 1918, of the superior court as an important question of law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b181-12\"><em>Owen &amp; Veazey </em>and <em>Charles B.

H. 563, 564. The only objection made to the sufficiency of the foreclosure is the claimed incapacity of the quitclaim deed to convey the bank\u2019s interest. The authorities are against the contention. <em>Hinds </em>v. <em>Ballou, </em>44 N. H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>619; <em>Lamprey </em>v. <em>Nudd, </em>29 N.
