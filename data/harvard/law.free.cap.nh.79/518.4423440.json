Trial by jury and verdict for the defendant. It was not alleged and there was no evidence tending to prove that the intestate left any relatives, and at the close of the evidence the defendant moved for a directed verdict on the ground it could not be found that the intestate left an heir-at-law, surviving him. Transferred by <em>Kivel, </em>C. J., from the September term, 1919, of the superior court on the defendant\u2019s exception to the denial of this motion and on the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the following statements of the defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201cWhether he [the intestate] had any relatives on the face of the earth, doesn\u2019t appear. If he [the plaintiff] should recover $20,000 which he asks for, where that money would go to, who would get it, except the administrator, is entirely a matter of conjecture.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-10\">\u201cIt is a little unusual to bring suit on a speculation of this kind. It may perhaps be a normal thing to you. We usually have a war widow, or children, or somebody claiming by reason of this man\u2019s death they have been deprived of assistance. That perhaps is the .way you have heard cases tried.\u201d Exception. \u201cBut in this case the attorneys say the administrator of some unknown man wishes you to ask the United States Government through the Director General of Railroads, to pay into the hand of this unseen man, John H. Hinman, that didn\u2019t take interest enough in the case to tell you anything about it, absolutely no interest in it.\u201d Exception. \u201cHe asks you to pay $20,000 of the funds of the United States Government. What is he going to do with it? They start out and ask for that sum to be paid over in the dark, and how do they ask you and on what do they base their claim?

S., c. 191, ss. 8-13 have been construed, the office of s. 8 is to repeal to the extent named in the five following sections, the rule of the common law that actions of tort for physical injuries do not survive. <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Laton, </em>78 N. H. 562; <em>Cogswell </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>78 N. H. 379, 386; <em>Guevin </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>78 N. H. 289, 298; <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Starr, </em>76 N. H. 538; <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>75 N. H. 435, 440; <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>72 N. H. 365, 376; <em>Poff </em>v. <em>Company, </em>72 N. H. 164. In other words, the cause of action the plaintiff is attempting to enforce is the one the intestate might enforce if he were alive. It follows that it was unnecessary for the plaintiff either to allege or prove that the intestate left relatives surviving him. The defendant\u2019s exception, therefore, must be overruled, but that comes to little if, in fact, the intestate left no heirs-at-law, for while the cause of action survives, it survives for the benefit of those only who are named, <em>s. </em>13. Consequently the plaintiff will not be permitted to go to trial unless he satisfies the court that the intestate left some of those named in that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The defendant, when he made the statements excepted to was asking the jury to find for him because the intestate was a woodsman and left no heirs-at-law; and the fact the court permitted him to repeat these statements again and again subject to exception was equivalent to a ruling that that was permissible. <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Wadsworth, </em>63 N. H. 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">The order therefore must be</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s exception overruled: plaintiff\u2019s exceptions sustained: new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-11\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
