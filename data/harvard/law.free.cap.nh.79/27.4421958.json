The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the action and the defendant excepted. Transferred from the September term, 1917, of the superior court by <em>Marble, </em>J.

This is the only question raised by the exception to the ruling denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the action. The result claimed by the defendant does not follow as a matter of law. The notice for an increase of the rent to begin at once, is not necessarily inconsistent with the notice to quit in thirty days; nor is it, unassented to by the tenant, a waiver of the first notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b56-6\">All concurred.,</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
