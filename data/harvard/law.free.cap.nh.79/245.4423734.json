Weston, administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>with the will annexed, of Sarah A. Brown and executor of Webster C. Brown. Sarah A. Brown died January 10, 1902. Web- 1 ster C. Brown, her husband, was appointed executor and filed an inventory but did not. settle an account, and an account was filed for him by Weston. The court approved the decree of the probate court and the plaintiff excepted. Both parties excepted to sundry findings of the court. The controversy was before the court in <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Society, </em>77 N. H. 576. After that decision the probate court charged Weston with a balance of $2,861.99 as administrator of Sarah and charged the estate of Webster C. Brown with certain securities as the property of the estate of Sarah. The questions were considered as though the appeal was taken by Weston both as administrator of Sarah and executor of Webster.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-15\">Brown received rent from premises formerly owned by Sarah and made new leases of the same. He received dividends from banks in liquidation. He surrendered certificates of stock and took new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>certificates in his own name. He sold a government bond and used the money as hereinafter stated.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-5\">After Sarah\u2019s death one of the corporations, of which the stock w\u00e1s inventoried as part of her estate, increased its capital' stock, and issued new stock to which each stockholder was given the right to subscribe in proportion to his holdings. Webster C. Brown, in the exercise of his right to the shares of this stock which he had transferred as executor of his wife\u2019s will to his own name, subscribed to and paid for certain shares of the stock at the price named in the above offer to the stockholders. Thereupon the certificate was issued to' him in his name and remained without change until his death, he receiving the dividends therefor. The payment was made with funds obtained from the sale of the government bond which had been inventoried as part of Sarah\u2019s estate, and with other moneys derived by him therefrom.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">Upon all the evidence bearing upon the question whether Brown\u2019s transactions in regard to the stocks and their transfer to his own name was a disposal under the power conferred by Sarah\u2019s will, the court affirmed the finding of the probate court that there was no such disposal and decreed that the stocks should be transferred to the appellee, the residuary legatee under the will of Sarah Brown.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\">Transferred by <em>Branch, </em>J., from the May term, 1918, of the superior court.</headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-8\"><em>George W.

H. 90, and may recover such balance in a suit upon the probate bond. <em>Judge of Probate </em>v. <em>Heydock, </em>8 N.

H. 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>It was the duty of Weston executor of Webster to file an account of Webster\u2019s administration of his wife\u2019s estate. The plaintiff questions the jurisdiction of the probate court to determine the controversy, claiming that the questions must be determined in a suit by Sarah\u2019s estate against Webster\u2019s. But a . suit by Weston administrator against Weston executor is of course unimaginable. The controversy has already been adjudicated. Weston as the representative of the two estates, finding himself in doubt as to \u2019yhich estate property held by him in his representative capacity belonged, brought his petition to the court for a construction of Sarah\u2019s will and advice as to his duties in administration. The residuary legatees were made parties so that the petition for advice was in effect a bill of inter-pleader. Upon an agreed statement of facts it was then adjudicated that the rents of the real estate collected by Weston after the death of Webster belonged to the society and that the property for which Webster should be adjudged' chargeable upon settlement of his account should be accounted for by Weston administrator of Sarah, it being admitted that Weston as executor had in his hands the property for which it was claimed Webster executor should be charged. The jurisdiction of the probate court to pass upon the account of Webster\u2019s administration and to determine what remained with which he should be charged is too clear for discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Upon the account filed by Weston executor for Webster executor, as allowed, Webster is charged with money collected from savings banks and proceeds of a bond sold; and credited with moneys paid out in the course of administration and disposed of by Brown legatee in an amount equal to the charges, so that of these items no balance remains against the executor. It is difficult to see how this accounting can be objectionable to Brown\u2019s estate. It is claimed, however, that the proceeds of the bond should in their entirety be credited as disposed of by Brown under the power in the will. But Brown\u2019s right as legatee attached only to the residue of the estate after payment of debts, expenses and special legacies. Whatever disposing power Brown had he could not exercise it until as executor he had administered the estate. So much of the proceeds of the bond as are required to meet the payments necessary to due administration are properly applied thereto, leaving the balance only to pass to Brown as residuary legatee. By doubtless a clerical error, Weston administrator is allowed $16 for Brown\u2019s expenses of administration and $150 for Brown\u2019s services as executor. Both these items should be taken from the fund Brown had for those purposes. The $16 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>taken out by the court in Brown\u2019s account and the $150 should be. The correction does not change Brown\u2019s account but reduces Weston\u2019s credits by $166. This adjustment will dispose of the society\u2019s ' exception to the allowance of the $150.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The main controversy relates to the ownership of eighteen shares of corporate stock which, inventoried as of the estate of Sarah Brown, Webster soon after his .appointment as executor had transferred from certificates in Sarah\u2019s name into certificates in his own name, which certificates were found among his papers after his decease. The questions supposed to be involved in this controversy have been voluminously argued in numerous briefs by both parties. As to the greater part of this argument it is sufficient to say (1) the question of fact is not before this court, (2) the exception to the finding of fact made by the trial court raises only the question whether there was any evidence upon which the finding could be made, (3) Mrs. Brown\u2019s will has heretofore been construed in <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Society, supra. </em>Mr. Brown\u2019s power in addition to his life estate was to dispose of the property, not merely to take it. Whether the taking shown by the transfer was understood to be a disposition of the property, an exercise of the power of appointment under the will, was the question supposed to be left open in <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Society.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">It is now claimed that Webster as tenant for life under the will was entitled to the possession of the stock and hence that proof of the delivery of the same to him shown by the transfer discharges him as executor. The appellant so makes up the account in his brief. If \u25a0 this be so, Webster being entitled to such a transfer as he had without reference to his power of disposing of the property, the transfer is no evidence of disposition, and as there is no evidence of any disposition of .the property by Webster except the transfer to himself, the court instead of advising Weston that the transfer did not as matter of law \u25a0 establish Brown\u2019s ownership of the property should have advised him that it was no evidence of it and have advised Weston to deliver the stock at once to the society. But Mrs. Brown\u2019s will after the gift to her husband continues: \u201cAs soon as may be after his decease I direct, and it is my will, that all the remainder of my real and personal estate be given to\u201d the society. This implies an understanding that after her husband\u2019s death further administration of her estate would be required and an intention that the property be kept in such shape that it could be turned over to the society by a \u25a0 representative of Sarah. In this situation it was thought, Webster being both executor and legatee, it might be argued the transfer was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>intended to take the property out of Sarah\u2019s estate. What was intended is a question of fact, and Webster\u2019s estate certainly cannot complain of opportunity to show that the property does not belong to Sarah\u2019s estate because by what was done it was intended to dispose of the property for Webster\u2019s benefit by making it his own. This question has been tried and upon sufficient evidence it has been found it was not intended to take the property out of Mrs. Brown\u2019s estate. Mr. Brown\u2019s title, therefore, though clear upon the corporate record was in fact that of trustee. Holding the property as trustee to carry out the purposes of Mrs. Brown\u2019s will, he is chargeable therefor in his administration account until discharged by a probate decree. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>48 N. H. 219, 229. Being held chargeable, perhaps strictly the decree should be that Weston executor transfer the stock to Weston administrator, and that Weston administrator being charged with the stock in his account be discharged by transfer to the society. This would strictly and technically carry out Mrs. Brown\u2019s purpose, but such circuity is unnecessary and no objection appears to be taken to the decree directing the transfer direct from Weston executor to the society, if the society is entitled to the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The appellant contends, citing <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>45 N. H. 540, that the executor after the termination of a life estate cannot recover personal property that has been in the possession of the tenant for life, and that the society must assert its title in a direct proceeding against the party in possession. The absence of right in the administrator to recover the specific chattels in controversy is placed upon the ground in <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>Jewett </em>that the executor was discharged by the delivery of articles of that description to the tenant for life, there being no evidence a trust was intended. The consequences of such a conclusion and the reasons for an opposite view have already been discussed. The society has already asserted its title in answer to the petition by Weston executor and administrator, and if the position taken by the plaintiff were adopted, relief would be given by advice and order in the original proceeding. The contention in the appellant\u2019s last brief that the procedure and limitations as to the prosecution against an administrator of causes of action against the deceased are applicable is disposed of by the fact that the society had no right to the possession of the stock until Webster died and consequently no right of action against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Although Weston charged himself with the rents collected in his administration account, it is now objected that that matter is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>within the jurisdiction of the probate court. The objection is well taken. <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>Holton, </em>74 N. H. 417, 422; <em>Ayers </em>v. <em>Laighton, </em>73 N. H. 487; <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>58 N. H. 405; <em>Lucy </em>v. <em>Lucy, </em>55 N. H. 9. As the collection of rents is no part of the duty of the administrator of a solvent estate he cannot be required to account for them as part of his administration. As to require him to do so would make his bondsmen liable beyond their bond, the administrator\u2019s submission of his collections in his account does not estop him from objecting to the decree made, if he could confer jurisdiction by consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">If the right to subscribe for additional stock which accrued to certain of the stock during Webster\u2019s life tenancy and which he exercised was a division of profits accrued after the life tenancy began, the right belonged to him as life tenant. If, however, the right represented to some extent profits that had accrued during Mrs. Brown's life, so that as between life tenant and remainderman the giving of the right was a distribution of capital, the taking of it by Brown and his use of it to buy new stock in his own name might be evidence of a disposition of so much of the fund for his own benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u25a0 If the objection is insisted upon, all items relating to the real estate upon both sides of the account will be stricken out and the account corrected as hereinbefore directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\n<em>Case discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b278-8\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
