In this case the executor refuses to testify, consequently the plaintiff cannot put on Mr. Butler [the plaintiff] to tell his story. The rule works both ways, and in this case I submit to you that you would have a better understanding of all the facts and circumstances if Mr. Butler could talk to you as man to man and tell you his story exactly as it occurred. But, unfortunately, we have to depend upon outside evidence.\u201d The jury was instructed as stated in the opinion.

This prevented the plaintiff from testifying. P. S., c. 224, s. 16. In commenting upon this situation the plaintiff\u2019s counsel made the remarks to which exception was taken. It was the legal right and perhaps the duty of the executor not to elect to testify, and no inference of any kind could legally be drawn from that act. The reference of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to the failure of the executor to elect to testify, and the consequent exclusion of his client as a witness was doubtless for the purpose of inducing the jury to draw or to refrain from drawing certain inferences from the failure of the parties to testify. So far as appears, counsel did not inform the jury what inference, if any, he claimed should be drawn from the facts. What inference can be drawn is a question of law. <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>68 N. H. 96, 117; <em>Seely </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>73 N. H. 339, 343; <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Moody, ante, </em>87. Upon this proposition the jury were fully instructed that no inference should be drawn against either party because of his failure to testify, and it is presumed, in the absence of evidence, that the jury followed the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>75 N. H. 467, 470; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Company, 75 </em>N. H. 521, 522; <em>Janvrin </em>v. <em>Powers, ante, </em>44.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\n<em>Exception overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b154-6\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
