Criminal law\u2014deduction for good time\u2014comment of State\u2019s attorney. On the trial of one charged, with a criminal offense, counsel for the People, in his argument to the jury, called their attention to what is generally known as the \u201cgood time\" statute, and insisted that it should be taken into consideration in fixing the term, of imprisonment. To this the defendant objected, but the objection was overruled: Held, that the ruling was erroneous, as that statute has no application to criminal trials, but relates solely to prison government.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b245-5\" pgmap=\"245\">2. Same\u2014accused omitting to testify\u2014instruction on that subject. On the trial of two upon a criminal charge, one of the defendants only testified in his own behalf, and the court, at the request of the prosecution, gave an instruction as to the weight to be given to such defendant\u2019s testimony. The other defendant asked an instruction, to the effect that no presumption of guilt should be indulged against him because he had not testified in his own behalf, which was refused: Held, that the instruction should have been given, especially after the instruction of the People directing the attention of the jury to the statute making defendants in criminal cases competent witnesses in their own behalf.</syllabus><summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b245-6\" pgmap=\"245\">Writ of Error to the Criminal Court of Cook county; the Hon.

Presumably this was in response to some argument concerning the length of time, advanced by counsel for defendant.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-7\" pgmap=\"246\">The authorities cited by plaintiff in error do not all relate to the argument of the case, but chiefly to the statement of the facts to be given to the jury prior to the introduction of the testimony.

They were convicted, and their terms of imprisonment in the penitentiary fixed at four years and ten months. Motions for new trial and in arrest of judgment being overruled, and the sentence pronounced on the yerdiet, Farrell prosecutes this writ of error.</p> <p id=\"b246-11\" pgmap=\"246\">Of the several errors assigned, and urged as grounds of reversal, it will be sufficient to notice two.</p> <p id=\"b246-12\" pgmap=\"246(22) 247(108)\">Counsel for the People, in his argument to the jury, called their attention to what is generally known as the \u201cgood time\u201d statute, and insisted that it should be taken into consideration in fixing the .defendants\u2019 terms of. imprisonment, if they were found guilty. To this, defendants\u2019 counsel interposed an objection, but it was overruled, and an exception taken. This was error. That statute has no application whatever to criminal trials. It relates purely to prison government and discipline. Whether a convict shall receive a reduction of time for good conduct during his imprisonment, is a question between him and the prison officials. To permit a jury to be in any way influenced by it in fixing a prisoner\u2019s punishment, would tend to defeat its object.</p> <p id=\"b247-5\" pgmap=\"247\">Plaintiff in error did not testify on the trial, but his co-defendant, Norton, did. An instruction was asked, on behalf of plaintiff in error, to the effect that no presumption of guilt should be indulged against him because he had not \"testified in his own behalf, but it was refused. Section 426, chapter 38, of the Revised Statutes, expressly provides that the neglect of a defendant on trial, charged with a crime, to testify, shall not create any presumption against him. No reason whatever is suggested for the refusal of the instruction asked. The giving of it became doubly important to the plaintiff in error by the giving of one, on behalf of the People, as to the weight to be given to Norton\u2019s testimony, by which the attention of the jury was directed to the statute making defendants in criminal trials competent to testify in their own behalf. The instruction should have been given.</p> <p id=\"b247-6\" pgmap=\"247\">For the errors indicated, the judgment of the Criminal Court will be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b247-7\" pgmap=\"247\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
