The state legislature had announced, through Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 37-l-2(p) (1985 cum. supp.), \u201c[t]hat the teachers of this state, to the extent possible, receive salaries received by teachers in the Southeastern United States.\u201d In demonstrating this commitment, the legislature emphasized, through \u00a7 8, Ch. 10, Laws of 1984, 1st Ex. Session, that it \u201chereby reaffirms its commitment to fully and timely fund the provisions of the ... [Act].\u201d Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 37-1-2 (editor\u2019s note).</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-11\">Nevertheless, the salary increase failed to materialize and the teachers went on strike in February 1985. Two state court injunctions, now expired, were issued against the strike. Several of the state\u2019s top executive officers, in addition to the state court judge who issued the injunctions, were named as defendants in the instant action, which was brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The teachers complained that the executive officers failed to execute Mississippi's \u201cpay-raise\u201d statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-12\">In their prayer for relief, the teachers asked the district court to \u201crequir[e] the State of Mississippi to ... increas[e] [the teachers\u2019] pay scale in the amount of ... $3500.00 [for the years 1985 and 1986].\u201d The appellants also sought class certification, an injunction against the state judge who issued the injunctions against them, dissolution of the state court\u2019s injunctions, and other relief. In an amendment to the complaint, appellants alleged that the newly-added defendant state treasurer had received certain revenues earmarked for appellants\u2019 salaries but had failed to disburse them to the teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-13\">The original complaint and the amendment fail completely to comply with the \u201cshort and plain statement\u201d requirement of Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a). They both constitute what can best be called an overt political petition directed toward Mississippi public officials and the legislature. The allegations appear to be that: (1) the state statutory provisions created a property right vesting in the teachers, and (2) \u201cthey have been denied their property right under the protection of 42 USCA, Section . 1983.\u201d Elsewhere in the pleadings are appellants\u2019 allusions to possible \u201cequal protection,\u201d and \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d claims, as well as complaints of appellants\u2019 demotion to \u201csecond rate citizens of this state.\u201d But again these allegations fall far short of the \u201cshort and plain statement\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-14\">Appellees\u2019 motion to strike those portions of the complaint which failed to conform to Rule 8(a) was never addressed, but upon appellees\u2019 Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) motion the district court dismissed the action on sovereign immunity grounds under the Eleventh Amendment. The appeal is timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-15\">Appellants have failed to allege clearly the necessary elements to state \u201cequal protection\u201d and \u201cprivileges and immunities\u201d claims. The complaint at best contains unformed ideas about such claims. They totally lack the requisite specificity. Regarding appellants\u2019 claim for their purported pay raises, a minimal perusal of the case law would have informed appellants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1293\">*1293</page-number>attorney that this entire action is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. As this Court stated in <em>Papasan v. United States, </em>756 F.2d 1087 (5th Cir.1985),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-5\">[t]he Eleventh Amendment is a jurisdictional bar to federal court suit by private citizens against a state____ In the absence of express consent, the Eleventh Amendment proscribes suits in federal court against the state and its agencies, regardless of the type of relief sought____ The district court thus correctly dismissed the complaint insofar as it sought relief directly from the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4TO\"><em>Id. </em>at 1092-93 (citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-8\">The instant action is both in form and in substance a suit against the state. It seeks equitable relief requiring the state to pay money from its treasury to its teachers. Even the treasurer of the state was named as a defendant to be subjected to such an injunction. In that regard,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1399-9\">the Eleventh Amendment disables a federal court from awarding retroactive \u201cmonetary relief from the state in the form of compensatory damages, punitive damages, or <em>monetary awards in the nature of equitable </em>restitution____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1399-11\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-12\">The immunity extends to suits against a state by all private citizens, including a state\u2019s own citizens. <em>Chiz\u2019s Motel and Restaurant, Inc. v. Mississippi State Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>750 F.2d 1305, 1307 (5th Cir.1985). Both the <em>Chiz\u2019s Motel </em>and <em>Papasan </em>Courts emphasized that Eleventh Amendment immunity applies where, as here, state officers \u201care nominal defendants and the state is \u2018the real substantial party in interest,\u2019 ... when the relief sought would operate against the sovereign by expending itself on state coffers.\u201d <em>Papasan, </em>756 F.2d at 1093.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-13\"><em>Chiz\u2019s Motel </em>recognized certain exceptions to the Eleventh Amendment bar: (1) where a federally created right is at issue, (2) the state has consented to suit in federal court, or (3) where the state, by its actions, has waived its immunity. 750 F.2d at 1307. None of these exceptions apply here. However realistic or lofty are the aims of the Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 37-1-2, it has not and cannot be interpreted as creating a constitutionally protected property interest vesting in Mississippi teachers. It may be argued that through this statute and other enactments the state has announced its intention to pay 'appellants more money, but appellants have pointed to no contract or other valid action' by which there has been created a property interest now threatened by state action and thus falling under the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-15\">Nor have the appellants pointed to a valid statutory enactment or to official action by the state constituting consent to suit in federal court or waiver of its immunity. <em>See also McKay v. Boyd Construction Co., Inc., </em>769 F.2d 1084, 1086 (5th Cir.1985). Therefore, no exception to the Eleventh Amendment bar applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-16\">The appellants also appear to demand prospective relief (pay raise for both 1985 <em>and </em>1986). But no constitutional claims have been stated. The complaint instead is obviously based upon state law, and the alleged failure of Mississippi officials to carry out the dictates of state law. When only state law is involved, \u201cthe eleventh amendment immunity jurisdictional bar applies to state agencies and officials acting in their official capacity <em>regardless </em>of the relief the plaintiff[s] seek[ ].\u201d <em>Chiz\u2019s Motel, </em>750 F.2d at 1307 <em>(citing Pennhurst State School &amp; Hospital v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 909, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-17\">As to the relief sought against the state judge who issued restraining orders against the appellants, we must note that the challenged orders by their terms expired the day before this action was filed. Mootness is obvious, and this particular claim is frivolous. <em>Krempp v. Dobbs, </em>715 F.2d 1319 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-18\">Finally, as to the claim against the judge, appellants maintain on appeal that the only relief they seek \u201cis ... against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>State of Mississippi, as well as all the named Defendants ... and that the individually named Defendants not violate any of the [appellants\u2019 constitutional rights] ... <em>by failing and refusing to enforce the provisions of the Educational Reform Act.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Since it is not alleged that the defendant judge is charged with the responsibility of enforcing the pay-raise statute, appellants at this time do not even advance their state law claim against him. The complaint at best only speculated that further state injunctions might issue against the appellants. Even assuming that such speculation were valid, appellants failed to allege that the state judge was enforcing an unconstitutional state statute or otherwise engaging in unlawful conduct which violated their constitutional rights, as opposed to their \u201cstate law rights\u201d and their collective goal of enforcing their pay raise. We emphasize that \u201creview [of the state judge\u2019s orders] may not be secured by the filing of a federal civil rights suit. Federal courts do not sit as appellate courts to review state court judgments.\u201d <em>Krempp v. Dobbs, </em>715 F.2d at 1321.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-4\">All of the contentions raised in appellants\u2019 brief are as meritless as the complaint itself. Whether the state has already allocated funds for disbursement to the teachers does not change the fact that the relief sought would entail a judgment impacting on the state\u2019s treasury. The argument that the Mississippi legislature, by enacting \u00a7 37-1-2, thus has already consented to a monetary award against the state is wholly unsupported by legal authority or recognized principles. Were this theory accepted as valid, every state enactment containing legislative goals and purposes could be construed as an Eleventh Amendment waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-5\">Finally, the exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity embodied in <em>Ex Parte Young, </em>209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), is not applicable here, because appellants do not seek to enjoin a state official from enforcing an unconstitutional statute. Rather, they seek to compel state officials to enforce state law, which appellants obviously otherwise interpret as constitutional and under which they claim expected benefits \u2014 not even recognizable property rights. Thus, there is alleged no \u201cunconstitutional conduct [by state officials] constitut[ing] state action under the Fourteenth Amendment but not the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d <em>Pennhurst, </em>104 S.Ct. at 910.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-7\">Since there is no property right endangered by official state action, we must conclude that no federal court jurisdiction is established to vindicate federal rights by finding that certain state officials are responsible to \u201cthe supreme authority of the United States.\u201d <em>Ex Parte Young, </em>209 U.S. at 160, 28 S.Ct. at 454. Indeed, \u201cit is difficult to think of a greater intrusion on state sovereignty than when ... a federal court instructs state officials on how to conform their conduct to state law. Such a result conflicts directly with the principles of federalism that underlie the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d <em>Pennhurst, </em>104 S.Ct. at 911. Yet that is exactly what appellants ask this Court to do in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-8\">We find appellants\u2019 suit barred by sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment. The decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1400-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
