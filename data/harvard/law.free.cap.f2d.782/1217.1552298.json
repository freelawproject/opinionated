The judgment of the district court is affirmed in all respects. 602 F.Supp. 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-15\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-16\">On December 14,1977, while working for Strachan Shipping Company (\u201cStrachan\u201d), Francis Lauzon was injured. On June 13, 1980, Strachan\u2019s insurance carrier, Texas Employers\u2019, entered into a $25,000.00 lump-sum settlement with Lauzon pursuant to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950. The settlement was approved by and filed in the office of a deputy commissioner of the Department of Labor on June 13, 1980. Lauzon received payment on June 26, 1980, the thirteenth day after the order was filed. On that same day, Lauzon filed an application for a twenty percent penalty under 914(f)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, asserting that he was entitled to the penalty allowed by that statutory provision because the award had not been paid within ten days of filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-17\">The deputy commissioner conducted an investigation, determined that no hearing was necessary, and declared that the compensation award of $25,000.00 had been in default at the time it was paid. The deputy commissioner assessed against Strachan and Texas Employers\u2019 a penalty of twenty percent of the original amount as additional compensation for late payment. Strachan and Texas Employers\u2019 appealed to the Benefits Review Board of the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>Labor which reversed the deputy commissioner\u2019s order. In January 1984, this Court vacated the Review Board\u2019s order and reinstated the award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the same month, Lauzon filed a complaint in federal district court to enforce the order awarding additional compensation. Lauzon subsequently moved for summary judgment and the motion was granted. Texas Employers\u2019 motion for a new trial was denied. Texas Employers\u2019 then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-6\">Texas Employers\u2019 first alleges that the district court erred in holding that its payment of the original award was untimely. Second, Texas Employers\u2019 asserts that the grant of summary judgment was improper because a factual issue was presented which raised equitable reasons for not assessing the penalty against it. Finally, Texas Employers\u2019 argues that the original award of the deputy commissioner was improper because it was made without a formal hearing before an administrative law judge. After careful consideration of Texas Employers\u2019 arguments, this Court is convinced that the district court correctly decided this case. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-7\">A. <em>Timeliness of Payment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1325-8\">Texas Employers\u2019 makes two arguments in support of its contention that payment was made timely. First, Texas Employers\u2019 argues that Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(e) applies to this factual situation and that it gave Texas Employers\u2019 three extra days to pay the original compensation award. Second, Texas Employers\u2019 asserts that either because of the course of dealings between it and Lauzon, or by express agreement of Lauzon\u2019s wife, payment was made when the check became available to Lauzon at Texas Employers\u2019 place of business. This Court addresses these contentions in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-10\">(1) <em>Application of Rule 6(e)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1325-11\">Texas Employers\u2019 argues that it actually had thirteen days in which to pay the award. This thirteen day period is calculated by taking the ten days permitted by the LHWCA and adding three days as provided by Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(e). According to Texas Employers\u2019, \u201cRule 6(e) extends by three days the ten day period that is otherwise allowed by section [9]14(f) to satisfy ... the award.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 30. Since it is undisputed that payment was made within thirteen days, payment would be timely under Texas Employers\u2019 theory, and the twenty percent assessment would then be improper.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-12\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(e) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-13\">Additional Time After Service by Mail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-14\">Whenever a party has the right or is required to <em>do some act </em>or take some proceedings <em>within a prescribed period after the service of a notice </em>or other paper upon him and the notice or paper is served upon him by mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1325-15\">(emphasis added). Texas Employers\u2019 asserts that it was entitled to three extra days because the LHWCA provides that the employer is to be notified by mail of an award. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7. 919(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-16\">The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201capply to proceedings for enforcement or review of compensation orders under ... U.S.C., Title 33, \u00a7\u00a7 <em>918, </em>921, except to the extent that matters of procedure are provided for in that Act.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 81(a)(6) (emphasis added). Although section 914 is not mentioned specifically in rule 81(a)(6), this Court has held that \u201ca \u2018Section [9]14(f) assessment,\u2019 ... [is] a \u2018supplementary order declaring the amount of the default\u2019 within the meaning of section [9]18(a) of the LHWCA.\u201d <em>Tidelands Marine Service v. Patterson, </em>719 F.2d 126, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>128 n. 3 (5th Cir.1983). Thus, Texas Employers\u2019 presents a strong argument that the Rules apply to the instant penalty assessment. Nevertheless, this Court need not decide that issue and we expressly re-\u2019 serve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">The general applicability of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to section 914(f) assessments need not be determined because even if the Rules of Civil Procedure apply in this context, Rule 6(e) does not afford Texas Employers\u2019 the relief it seeks. Rule 6(e) grants three additional days to a party \u201crequired to do some act or take some proceedings <em>within a prescribed </em>period <em>after the service </em>of a notice or other paper upon him\u201d when service is by mail. Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(e). Because section 914 requires action within ten days of filing, as opposed to service, Rule 6(e) is inapplicable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-5\">First, this Court has stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-6\">Section [914(f) ] is self-executing; the 20 percent additional compensation automatically becomes due immediately upon the expiration of the ten-day period following the <em>filing </em>of the compensation order with the deputy commissioner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1326-7\"><em>Tidelands, </em>719 F.2d at 128 n. 2 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-8\">Second, this approach is consistent with the rationale of <em>Welsh v. Elevating Boats, Inc., </em>698 F.2d 230 (5th Cir.1983), and that rationale applies equally to the instant case. According to <em>Welsh, </em>the fact that notice is to be served by mail is not dispositive. The correct inquiry is whether the required actions must be performed within a prescribed period of <em>filing </em>or of <em>service. </em>If the act is to be taken after filing, the time for action begins to run from that date. If the act is to be taken after service, the three day extension of either Fed. R.App.P. 26(c) or Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(e) applies. <em>Welsh </em>involved a notice of appeal issue, but it also cited for the stated proposition a case involving payment of costs. <em>See Clements v. Florida East Coast Railway Co., </em>473 F.2d 668 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-12\">The statute involved in this case is clear. According to section 914(f), an award must be \u201cpaid within ten days <em>after it becomes due,\" </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(f) (emphasis added). An award becomes \u201ceffective\u201d when <em>\u201cfiled </em>in the office of the deputy commissioner----\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a) (emphasis added). This Court has stated that \u201c[t]he term \u2018effective\u2019 in \u00a7 921(a) is equivalent to the terms \u2018due\u2019 and \u2018due and payable\u2019 in \u00a7\u00a7 914(f) and 918(a), respectively.\u201d <em>Tidelands, </em>719 F.2d at 127 n. 1. Consequently, in the instant case, the time for payment started running when the award was <em>filed, </em>and not when Texas Employers\u2019 was <em>served. </em>Rule 6(e) does not provide Texas Employers\u2019 with relief in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-14\">(2) <em>Arrangement with Plaintiff</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1326-15\">Texas Employers\u2019 next argues that payment was not late in this case because \u201cpayment should be considered to have been made at the time the check was made available to claimant.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 18. Texas Employers\u2019 asserts that payment was made in this case for two alternate reasons. First, Texas Employers\u2019 asserts that because of its prior course of dealings with Lauzon, it justifiably relied on its assumption that Lauzon would come to Texas Employers\u2019 office and pick up the check. Second, Texas Employers\u2019 argues that it had an express agreement with Lauzon\u2019s wife that Lauzon would pick up the check at Texas Employers\u2019 office.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>This Court holds that a course of conduct such as the one alleged here is insufficient as a matter of law to constitute \u201cpayment\u201d for purposes of the LHWCA. Moreover, an express agreement with some third person other than the claimant is also insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">First, the language of the LHWCA requires that compensation \u201cbe paid ... <em>directly to the person </em>entitled thereto____\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(a) (emphasis added). This Court is hard put to understand how issuing and holding a check in the office of the insurer is payment <em>directly to </em>the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">Second, section 915 states that no agreement by an employee to waive the employee\u2019s right to compensation shall be valid. The District of Columbia Circuit applied this provision to an alleged waiver of the section 914(e) penalty. That court stated, \u201cit is well established that the \u2018right to additional compensation under section [9]14(e) cannot be waived.\u2019 \u201d <em>Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs v. Cooper Associates, </em>607 F.2d 1385, 1387 (D.C.Cir.1979) (brackets, citation and footnote omitted). Likewise, this Court does not believe that additional compensation under section 914(f) can be waived by an implied agreement. To imply an agreement from a previous course of dealings is tantamount to holding that a claimant can waive the penalty by his or her prior actions. This Court hesitates to go so far.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, this Court refuses to hold that an express agreement with some third party, even the claimant\u2019s spouse, is sufficient to constitute \u201cpayment.\u201d It is not unreasonable, given section 914(a), to require the employer or its insurer to deal <em>directly </em>with the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-12\">Finally, this Court has stated that section 914(f) coupled with section 918(a) \u201cprovides a quick and inexpensive mechanism for the prompt enforcement of unpaid compensation awards, a theme central to the spirit, intent, and purposes of the LHWCA.\u201d <em>Tidelands, </em>719 F.2d at 129. It would be inconsistent with that intent to adopt an amorphous definition of \u201cpayment.\u201d The definition sought by Texas Employers\u2019 would indicate that payment is made merely because a spouse agreed that the claimant would pick up the check or that payment is made because the claimant \u201cagreed\u201d to pick up the check only because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>he or she had done so in the past. Such a holding would spawn litigation over whether, under innumerable sets of facts, a claimant has been \u201cpaid.\u201d Such a rule undermines the intent of the statute as well as the statutory system that this Court has termed \u201cself-executing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-4\">B. <em>Equitable Considerations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-5\">Texas Employers\u2019 also argues that its evidence of a course of dealing with Lauzon and its evidence of an agreement with Lauzon\u2019s wife made the delay in payment reasonable. Texas Employers\u2019 argues that this evidence raises an issue of fact as to whether enforcement of the section 914 penalty provision is equitable in this instance. On this basis, Texas Employers\u2019 argues that summary judgment was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-6\">This Court holds that section 914(f) does not admit to an exception for late payment for equitable reasons. Texas Employers\u2019 argument fundamentally misconstrues section 914(f). Section 914(f) provides that if compensation \u201cis not paid within ten days after it becomes due, there <em>shall </em>be added to such unpaid compensation\u201d the twenty percent penalty. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(f) (emphasis added). \u201cThis section is self-executing; the 20 percent additional compensation <em>automatically </em>becomes due <em>immediately </em>upon the expiration of the ten-day period____\u201d <em>Tidelands, </em>719 F.2d at 128 n. 2 (emphasis added). Section 914(f) is a penalty provision that applies \u201cin. every instance\u201d where payment is late, leaving the deputy commissioner without \u201cany discretion\u201d whether to assess the penalty. <em>Providence Washington Insurance Co. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>765 F.2d 1381, 1385 (9th Cir.1985) (relying on <em>Tidelands ).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-8\"><em>Providence Washington Insurance </em>held that the only relevant facts in determining whether to grant a section 914(f) award are (1) the date the payment has become due, (2) whether ten days have elapsed from that date without the employer making payment, or obtaining a stay, and (3) the amount due and the calculation of the 20 percent penalty. <em>Id. </em>The first and last facts are undisputed, and the second fact is resolved as a matter of law in this case. The additional facts Texas Employers\u2019 discusses at length are simply not material. Because summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine issues as to any <em>material </em>fact,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) (emphasis added), the district court properly entered summary judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-12\">C. <em>Hearing Requirement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1328-13\">Texas Employers\u2019 asserts that the deputy commissioner was obligated to set a hearing before an administrative law judge to determine the validity of its defenses to the late payment. This Court holds that the alleged course of dealings and agreement, even if true, do not constitute payment in this case as a matter of law. Consequently, there was nothing to be decided at a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-14\">Texas\" Employers\u2019 argument that a formal hearing was required is based on statutory language indicating that a finding of default must be based on an investigation, notice, and a <em>hearing. </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 918(a). Such a hearing is to be held in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 554. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 919(d). However, a disposition of an application for supplementary compensation can be made without a hearing where there is agreement regarding the issue of late payment. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.372(a). Similarly, the deputy commissioner can issue an order \u201c[fjollowing an informal conference at which agreement is reached on all issues.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.315(a). As discussed above, the <em>material </em>facts in this case were undisputed. Although the legal ramifications of those facts were disputed, this Court has resolved that dispute as a matter of law. Consequently, the deputy commissioner properly entered the order without a formal hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-15\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-16\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1324-12\">. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(f) provides in pertinent part: If any compensation, payable under the terms of an award, is not paid within ten days after it becomes due, there shall be added to such unpaid compensation an amount equal to 20 per centum thereof, which shall be paid at the same time as, but in addition to, such compensation, unless review of the compensation order making such award is had \u00e1s provided in section 921 of this title and an order staying payment has been issued by the Board or court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1325-9\">. In <em>Lauzon v. Strachan Shipping Co., </em>724 F.2d 128, slip op. at 2 (5th Cir.1984) (per curiam) (unpublished), this Court held that the Benefits Review Board lacked jurisdiction over supplementary default orders issued pursuant to section 914(f). <em>Lauzon </em>followed <em>Tidelands Marine Service </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>719 F.2d 126, 129 (5th Cir. 1983), which held that \"review of the [deputy commissioner\u2019s supplemental default] order is available only in an enforcement proceeding\u201d in federal district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1326-9\">. This Court quotes Texas Employers\u2019 representations regarding these agreements. For purposes of this appeal, we accept them as true.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1326-10\">On June 20, 1980, the Carrier issued its draft in the amount of the settlement and waited for the Claimant to pick up the draft. The reason the draft was not mailed to the Claimant on that date is that <em>the Claimant, </em>when he came by the Carrier\u2019s office in Galveston on May 30, 1980, to sign the settlement papers, <em>was told that once the settlement was approved the check would be available in the Carrier\u2019s office for him to pick up. This was in keeping with a longstanding arrangement between the Claimant and the Carrier </em>that was requested by the Claimant and designed solely for the Claimant\u2019s convenience. The Claimant worked in Galveston but lived in Alta Loma, and when his working hours did not preclude his doing so, he often personally pick [sic] up his bi-weekly compensation checks. When his working hours conflicted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>or when the Claimant was not working and would have had to make a special trip to pick up his check, the Carrier, at the Claimant\u2019s request, mailed the check to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1327-9\">Appellant\u2019s Brief at 4-5 (emphasis added). This Court reads these assertions to mean that Texas Employers\u2019 alleges that because of the prior dealings between the parties, Texas Employers\u2019 was entitled to imply an agreement with Lauzon that Lauzon would also pick up the check this time. Texas Employers\u2019 makes no assertion that there was an <em>express </em>agreement between it and Lauzon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-10\">Texas Employers\u2019 also asserts that an express agreement existed between it and Lauzon's wife:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIXI\">Finally, on Sunday, June 22, 1980, Mrs. Celeste [Texas Employers\u2019 representative] reached the Claimant\u2019s wife by telephone and informed her that the draft was available in the Carrier\u2019s office. The Claimant was not home at that time. When Mrs. Celeste told the Claimant\u2019s wife the check was available, the Claimant\u2019s wife said she would notify the Claimant to stop by and pick up the draft the following day, Monday, June 23, 1980. Apparently, the Claimant\u2019s wife was having complications with a pregnancy and was under medication at the time of the June 22, 1980, conversation with Mrs. Celeste, although Mrs. Celeste was unaware of that at the time. When the Claimant did not pick up the check on either Monday or Tuesday, Mrs. Celeste, on Wednesday, June 25, 1980, again telephoned the Claimant\u2019s residence and again reached the Claimant\u2019s wife. \u2022 The Claimant\u2019s wife explained to Mrs. Celeste the problem with the pregnancy and the fact that she was under medication, and stated that due to her medicated condition, she had forgotten to tell her husband about the check. Mrs. Celeste then offered to hand deliver the check to the Claimant, but by that time the Claimant had instructed his wife not to accept the check.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArK\">Appellant\u2019s Brief at <em>6.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1327-14\">. Texas Employers\u2019 asserts that this holding means that if the employee expressly agrees to pick up the check, the employee, in bad faith, may simply breach the agreement and make the employer liable for the penalty. This Court holds in the instant case only that we will not imply such an express agreement from a prior course of dealings. We leave for another day the question of whether an express agreement to pick up the check, coupled with the employer making the check available to the claimant, constitutes \"payment.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
