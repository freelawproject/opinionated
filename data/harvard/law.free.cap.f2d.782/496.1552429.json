HIGGINBOTHAM, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b602-27\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b602-28\">The defendant Bethlehem Steel repaired the thrust block of M/Y SERENA\u2019s engine some time before the SERENA, which was under a charter to the plaintiff Cargill, experienced engine failure while transporting <em>Cargill\u2019s </em>grain. Cargill conceded <em>that </em>no foreign objects were thrown into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>cargo hold and that the mechanical malfunction was confined to the engine room. The vessel was disabled by the engine failure, and Cargill eventually elected to remove the perishable grain from the ship rather than leave it to deteriorate while the engine was being repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">In a tort action against several parties, Cargill charged Bethlehem with negligence in repairing the SERENA\u2019s engine. In order to meet the physical injury requirement of <em>Robins Dry Dock &amp; Repair Co. v. Flint, 275 </em>U.S. 303, 48 S.Ct. 134, 72 L.Ed. 290 (1927), and <em>Louisiana ex rel. Guste v. M/V TESTBANK, 752 </em>F.2d 1019 (5th Cir.1985) (en banc), Cargill asserted that some of its grain had rotted because of moisture that accumulated while the SERENA was disabled, that some of the grain was inevitably damaged by the shovels or buckets used in removing it from the ship, and that some loss of cargo necessarily accompanies any discharge of a bulk cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The district court concluded that any damage that Cargill suffered was due solely to the delay that accompanied the need to repair the vessel\u2019s engine: \u201cCargill did not contract with the ship repairer [i.e. Bethlehem] and the action of the ship repairer did not cause any direct immediate damage to Cargill\u2019s grain. That grain was in the same condition before and after the engine failure.\u201d Relying primarily on <em>Robins Dry Dock </em>and on its progeny in our circuit, the court granted summary judgment in Bethlehem\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">On appeal, Cargill argues that <em>Robins Dry Dock </em>and <em>TESTBANK </em>require no more than that a plaintiff show that the defendant\u2019s negligence was a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the plaintiff\u2019s physical damages. Because such \u201cbut for\u201d causation was indisputably present in this case, Cargill argues that the district court in effect decided that Bethlehem\u2019s negligence, if any, could not have been a legal or proximate cause of Cargill\u2019s losses. Cargill asserts that this decision was erroneous because there were unresolved issues of material fact that bore on the question of proximate causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">This case falls squarely under <em>Robins Dry Dock. </em>In <em>Robins, </em>the time charterers of a steamship sought to recover from a dry dock and repair company the value of two weeks\u2019 use of the steamer. 275 U.S. at 307, 48 S.Ct. at 135. The loss of use was occasioned by damage to the ship\u2019s propeller; the damage to the propeller, in turn, was inflicted while the ship was being repaired by the dry dock company. Frustrated in their attempt to recover as a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the ship\u2019s owner and the repairer, <em>see </em>275 U.S. at 307-08, 48 S.Ct. at 135, the charterers pointed to the \u201ctortious damage to a chattel [and] sought to connect [their] claim with that in some way,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 308, 48 S.Ct. at 135. The Supreme Court held that the charterers could not recover in tort against the ship repairer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">The damage [to the propeller] was material to [the charterers] only as it caused the delay in making the repairs, and that delay would be a wrong to no one except for the [repair company\u2019s] contract with the owners [of the vessel]. The injury to the propeller was no wrong to the [charterers] but only to those to whom it belonged. But suppose that the [charterers\u2019] loss flowed directly from that source. Their loss arose only through their contract with the owners \u2014 and ... a tort to the person or property of one man does not make the tortfeasor liable to another merely because the injured person was under a contract with that other, unknown to the doer of the wrong. The law does not spread its protection so far.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">275 U.S. at 308-09, 48 S.Ct. at 135 (Holmes, J.) (citations omitted). The only relevant difference between this case and the case at bar is that Cargill seeks to extend the protection of the law even further. Whereas the <em>Robins Dry Dock </em>charterers sought only to recover the market value of the vessel\u2019s use while she was delayed, 275 U.S. at 305, 48 S.Ct. at 134, Cargill seeks to recover for <em>all </em>its losses that were in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>manner associated with the delay that was caused by the malfunction of the SERENA\u2019s engine. Because the charterers in <em>Robins Dry Dock </em>were prohibited from recovering in tort against the repair company that caused the delay, Cargill is <em>a fortiori </em>prohibited from recovering against Bethlehem.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Cargill tries to escape the application of <em>Robins Dry Dock </em>by pointing to our en banc decision in <em>TESTBANK, </em>which reaffirmed \u201cthe prevailing rule [that denies] a plaintiff recovery for economic loss if that loss resulted from physical damage to property in which he had no interest.\u201d 752 F.2d at 1022 (citations omitted). In <em>TEST-BANK, </em>we focused on the importance of physical injury as a necessary condition of recovery for economic losses, but we never intimated that physical injury was sufficient to take a plaintiff outside the scope of <em>Robins Dry Dock. </em>Such an interpretation would turn <em>Robins Dry Dock </em>on . its head and convert it from \u201ca pragmatic limitation ... upon the tort doctrine of foreseeability,\u201d <em>TESTBANK, </em>752 F.2d at 1023, into a decision that would allow a plaintiff to recover from a tortfeasor merely because the injured person was under a contract with the plaintiff. <em>Cf. Robins Dry Dock, </em>275 U.S. at 309, 48 S.Ct. at 135. <em>TESTBANK </em>stands for the proposition that physical injury to one\u2019s own property is ordinarily <em>a </em>prerequisite to recovery in <em>tort </em>\u2014 TEST-<em>BANK </em>does not say or imply that <em>Robins Dry Dock </em>is inapplicable to every case in which the plaintiff has suffered a physical injury that is somehow a consequence of the defendant\u2019s tortious act or omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Cargill also seeks comfort in <em>Consolidated Aluminum Corp. v. C.F. Bean Corp., </em>772 F.2d 1217 (5th Cir.1985). In <em>Consolidated, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s aluminum reduction plant was damaged when the plant\u2019s supply of natural gas was suddenly cut off. The interruption occurred when the defendant inadvertently severed a gas pipeline owned and operated by Texaco, with whom the plaintiff had a contract to supply natural gas to the reduction plant. A panel of our court vacated the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The plaintiff in <em>Consolidated </em>had suffered substantial physical injury to its property as a result of the defendant\u2019s allegedly negligent severance of the gas pipeline. The panel emphasized the \u201climited nature of this appeal,\u201d 772 F.2d at 1218 n. 2, and stressed that the district court expressly omitted to review the issue of foreseeability, <em>id. </em>at 1221. In response to a petition for rehearing, the panel re-emphasized that summary judgment for the defendant might well be appropriate on the facts of the case and that it was leaving \u201cthe application of traditional tort principles, including foreseeability and the related concept of legal duty, for the trial court to determine on remand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\"><em>Consolidated </em>does not support Cargill\u2019s position. Among the \u201ctraditional tort principles\u201d untouched by that decision was the principle, stated and relied on in <em>Robins Dry Dock, </em>that \u201ca tort to the person or property of one man does not make the tortfeasor liable to another merely because the injured person was under a contract with that other, unknown to the doer of the wrong.\u201d 275 U.S. at 309, 48 S.Ct. at 135. Justice Holmes\u2019 formulation was delivered in different language than we ordinarily use today, but his meaning has not become outdated. There can be no recovery in tort unless the defendant has breached a legal duty owed to the plaintiff. This threshold requirement was not met in the case at bar. If Bethlehem caused or contributed to the malfunction of the SERENA\u2019s engine, it did not thereby breach any legal duty owed to Cargill. Whatever rights the SERENA\u2019s owner might have against Bethlehem, Cargill could not add itself to the list of proper plaintiffs by showing that its property was physically damaged as a result of the ship\u2019s inability to sail. The same idea can be expressed by saying that Cargill\u2019s injury and Bethlehem\u2019s allegedly wrongful acts were related only in that these acts prevented the SERENA or her owner from performing a contract with Cargill; that the breach of this contract may have arisen directly from Bethlehem\u2019s negligent repair of the SERENA\u2019s engine could not give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Cargill any right to recovery in tort against Bethlehem. To hold otherwise would be to effect exactly what the <em>Consolidated </em>panel expressly sought to avoid: reading <em>TEST-BANK </em>to hold that if there is physical damage a claim is necessarily stated, a reading that would create \u201ca brand new theory of recovery for negligent interference with a contract where physical damage occurs solely from the loss of anticipated contract benefits.\u201d 772 F.2d at 1224.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">In the case at bar, any injury to Cargill\u2019s property, physical or otherwise, resulted from the SERENA\u2019s being disabled at a time when Cargill expected her to be able to transport Cargill\u2019s grain. Any such expectations, however, would have been justified solely because of the contract between Cargill and the owner of the SERENA. To allow Cargill to recover against Bethlehem would therefore violate the rule stated in <em>Robins Dry Dock; </em>in modern parlance it would find a breach of duty when no breach had occurred. It follows that the district court properly rendered summary judgment in Bethlehem\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
