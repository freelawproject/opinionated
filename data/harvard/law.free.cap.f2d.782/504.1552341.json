Richards (Richards) appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment dismissing his personal injury negligence suit against defendant-appellee J.A. Jones Construction Company (Jones) on the basis that Richards was the statutory employee of Jones under the Louisiana Worker\u2019s Compensation Law and was hence relegated to the exclusive remedies provided by the Worker\u2019s Compensation Law. Broadly stated, the sole question presented is whether an employee of a subcontractor performing work included within the work covered by the general contractor\u2019s contract with the owner or developer is the general contractor\u2019s statutory employee, notwithstanding that the subcontractor\u2019s work is of a specialized kind usually subcontracted by this general contractor and most others in the business. Agreeing with the district court that in such an instance the general contractor is the statutory employer of the subcontractor\u2019s employee, we accordingly affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-19\">Facts and Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b610-20\">Richards was injured August 4, 1983, when a floor support rod fell and struck him during construction of the Canal Place Two building in New Orleans. He was then employed by Ceco Corporation (Ceco) and was working within the scope of his employment. Jones is a commercial construction company and was the general contractor for the construction of the Canal Place Two. Jones retained Ceco as its subcontractor to perform the installation of \u201chorizontal formwork,\u201d which was a portion of the work covered by Jones\u2019 general construction contract with the developer. Richards was injured while performing work called for by Ceco\u2019s subcontract with Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Richards filed this negligence suit against Jones in Louisiana state court on March 28, 1984. Jones removed the suit to federal court based on diversity of citizenship.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jones subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment claiming that it was Richards\u2019 statutory employer at the time of the accident and that therefore Richards was limited to his benefits under the Louisiana Worker\u2019s Compensation statute. The summary judgment evidence established without dispute that Richards was injured in the course of his employment for Ceco while performing work on the Canal Place Two job which was covered by Ceco\u2019s subcontract with Jones, that this work was a part of the work covered by Jones\u2019 general contract with the Canal Place Two developer, and that under the general contract the performance of the work in which Ceco was engaged was the responsibility of Jones and was work which Jones had contracted to perform by its general contract. Ceco had no contractual relationship with the developer. While Jones\u2019 general contract did not prevent Jones\u2019 use of subcontractors, neither did it require such use. However, there was evidence arguably tending to show that the work covered by Ceco subcontract \u2014 on-site installing of metal pans to act as forms for the pouring of concrete floors in the building under construction, here Canal Place Two \u2014 was of a rather specialized nature and was usually subcontracted out because Jones, like most other general contractors for commercial buildings, normally lacked the expertise and equipment to perform that kind of work. Jones\u2019 direct employees performed the less specialized aspects of this operation, the bracing of the pans after they were installed. Richards alleged that he was injured when struck by a falling pan support rod which he claimed had been negligently installed by a Jones direct employee. The district court granted summary judgment on the motion filed by Jones holding that Richards was the statutory employee of Jones and was limited to his worker\u2019s compensation remedy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The only question on appeal is whether Jones is the statutory employer of Richards.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">The Louisiana Worker\u2019s Compensation statute sets forth when a \u201cprincipal\u201d is a statutory employer of another party\u2019s employee. The situation exists</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-10\">\u201c[wjhere any person (in this section referred to as principal) undertakes to execute any work, [1] which is a part of his trade, business, or occupation <em>or </em>[2] <em>which he had contracted to perform, </em>and contracts with any person (in this section referred to as contractor) for the execution by or under the contractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by the principal, the principal shall be liable to pay to any employee employed in the execution of the work or to his dependent, any compensation under this Chapter which he would have been liable to pay if the employee had been immediately employed by him;____\u201d La. Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 23:1061 (West 1985) (emphasis and bracketed material supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-13\">Likewise, La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 23:1032 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-14\"><em>\u201cThe rights and remedies herein granted to an employee </em>or his dependent on account of an injury, or compensable sickness or disease <em>for which he is entitled to compensation under this Chapter, shall be exclusive of all other rights and remedies of such employee, </em>his personal representatives, dependents, or relations, <em>against his employer, or any principal </em>or any officer, director, stockholder, partner or employee of such employer or principal, for said injury, or compensable sickness or disease. For purposes of this Section, the word <em>\u2018principal\u2019 shall be defined as any person who undertakes to execute any work </em>[1] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>which is a part of his trade, business or occupation in which he was engaged at the time of the injury, or </em>[2] <em>which he had contracted to perform and contracts with any person for the execution thereof\u201d </em>(Emphasis and bracketed material supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Jones argues that the provisions in the statute are disjunctive: a principal is a statutory employer, if (1) the work being performed by the person claimed to be a statutory employee is a part of the principal\u2019s trade, business or occupation, <em>or </em>(2) if the principal contracted to perform the work for another. Richards contends that the work performed by the alleged statutory employee must be part of the principal\u2019s trade, business or occupation before the statutory employer provision applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The Louisiana Supreme Court has held that if a principal hires an independent contractor to perform work, the statutory employer provision applies if the work that the contractor performs is customarily performed by the principal\u2019s own employees or if similar employers customarily have their own employees perform the work. <em>Lewis v. Exxon Corp., </em>441 So.2d 192, 198 (La. 1983) (on reh\u2019g); <em>Barnes v. Sun Oil Co., </em>362 So.2d 761 (La.1978); <em>accord Blanchard v. Engine &amp; Gas Compressor Services, Inc., </em>613 F.2d 65, 71 (5th Cir.1980). The district court\u2019s holding that the \u201ccustomarily performed\u201d criteria applies only to the first provision of the statute, and not the second, does not conflict with the Louisiana Supreme Court\u2019s holdings since the second provision is alternative to the first. The Louisiana Supreme Court indicated approval of this disjunctive construction in dicta in <em>Lewis v. Exxon, supra, </em>and <em>Duvalle v. Lake Kenilworth, Inc., </em>396 So.2d 1268, 1269 (La.1981). In <em>Lewis </em>the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4G\">\u201cA principal can, however, be a statutory employer even if the project, during which an employee is injured, is not one of regularity or custom for the principal. Whenever a principal contracts to perform work for another \u2014 even if it is the first and only time that the principal plans to engage in such a project \u2014 he is, for the purposes of injuries resulting from that project, engaged in that trade, business or occupation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In <em>Duvalle </em>the court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">\u201cTo meet this test [statutory employer] it must appear certain that the work undertaken by plaintiff\u2019s actual employer, ... was [the putative statutory employer's] trade, business or occupation <em>or </em>was work which it had contracted to perform.\u201d <em>Duvalle, supra </em>at 1269 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">Louisiana appellate courts have likewise read the statute as disjunctive in this respect. <em>Richard v. Weill Construction Co., </em>446 So.2d 943, 945 (La.App. 3d Cir.) (principal is immune in tort and liable in worker\u2019s compensation any time the principal contracts to do any work and then subcontracts with another party for the performance of that work), <em>writ denied, </em>449 So.2d 1356 (La.1984); <em>Accord McCorkle v. Gulf States Utilities Co., </em>457 So.2d 682, 685 (La.App. 1st Cir.1984); <em>Duvalle v. Lake Kenilworth, Inc., </em>467 So.2d 850, 853 (La. App. 4th Cir.1984); <em>Barnhill v. American Well Service &amp; Salvage, Inc., </em>432 So.2d 917, 920 (La.App. 3d Cir.1983); <em>Fultz v. McDowell, </em>344 So.2d 410, 412 (La.App. 1st Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">The present situation is one in which the second provision of the statute applies. Jones contracted to perform a job, build Canal Place Two, and then subcontracted with another, Ceco, to perform part of that work so undertaken by Jones. According to the statute, Jones is the statutory employer of Ceco\u2019s employee Richards in Richards\u2019 performance of the construction work covered by the Jones general contract and subcontracted by Jones to Ceco; and Richards is accordingly limited to his worker\u2019s compensation remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">Richards claims that this Court\u2019s holding in <em>LeBlanc v. Goldking Production Co., </em>706 F.2d 149 (5th Cir.1983), is controlling in his favor. In <em>Goldking, </em>LeBlanc was an employee of Travis Rental Company, Inc. (Travis) who was injured while engaged in work which Travis had contracted to perform for Goldking Production Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>(Goldking). Goldking operated and produced oil leases and as part of its lease agreement was required to remove all of its property and facilities at the end of the lease period. Goldking contracted with Travis to restore the leased land after it abandoned the lease. LeBlanc was injured during the restoration, and sued Goldking. \u201cHolding that the work so contracted was an integral part of Goldking\u2019s trade, business, or occupation, the district court granted summary judgment\u201d for Goldking on the ground that it was \u201cLeBlane\u2019s \u2018statutory employer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149. We reversed and remanded holding that summary judgment was inappropriate because \u201cthe factual showing reveals dispute as to whether this work was customarily performed in the industry by the principal\u2019s own employees or instead by those of independent contractors. If by the latter, then the work in question was not part of the principal\u2019s \u2018trade, business, or occupation\u2019 for purposes of the Louisiana workmen\u2019s compensation statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The factual setting of <em>Goldking </em>is distinct from that of the present case, as there the obligation of the putative statutory employer appears to have been a contingent and incidental duty arising out of the mineral lessor-lessee relationship. It is at the least arguable that that sort of situation is inapposite, for purposes of the second statutory employer definition, to the more typical general construction contractor-subcontractor setting with which we are presently concerned. In any event, it is apparent that in <em>Goldking </em>both this Court and the district court considered only the first of the alternative definitions of statutory employer, namely, that relating to work which is part of the principal\u2019s \u201ctrade, business, or occupation,\u201d and did not address the statutory language respecting work which the principal \u201chad contracted to perform\u201d or consider whether or not such language provided an alternative, disjunctive test for statutory employer status. Accordingly, we do not consider <em>Goldking </em>as controlling on these latter questions to which it did not speak.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Moreover, since the <em>Goldking </em>opinion, we have received further guidance from the Louisiana courts regarding the interpretation of the second section of the statute. <em>Cf. Farnham v. Bristow Helicopters, Inc., </em>776 F.2d 535, 537 (5th Cir.1985); <em>Broussard v. Southern Pacific Transportation Co., </em>665 F.2d 1387, 1389 (5th Cir. 1982) (en banc). At the time of the <em>Goldking </em>decision, the Louisiana Supreme Court had stated in dicta, and two Louisiana appellate courts had held, that a disjunctive reading of the statute was appropriate. Since <em>Goldking, </em>the Louisiana Supreme Court again has approved a disjunctive reading in dicta in <em>Lewis v. Exxon, supra, </em>and- the Louisiana appellate courts for the first, second, third, and fourth circuits have followed the disjunctive reading of the statute. <em>McCorkle v. Gulf States Utilities Co., supra; Wells v. State, </em>450 So.2d 1027 (La.App. 1st Cir.1984); <em>Juris v. Lama Drilling Co., </em>457 So.2d 135 (La.App. 2d Cir.1984); <em>Richard v. Weill Construction, supra; Duvalle v. Lake Kenilworth, Inc., supra. </em>Although the presently relevant language in some of these decisions may express an alternative holding or even be regarded as dicta, nevertheless taken together they show that the Louisiana courts read the statute as disjunctive, so that the principal is a statutory employer if the work is part of that which the principal \u201chad contracted to perform,\u201d even though it is not otherwise part of the principal\u2019s \u201ctrade, business, or occupation.\u201d We are bound to follow.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We are strengthened in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>this understanding of Louisiana law by the well-reasoned opinion in <em>Dozier v. J.A. Jones Construction Company, Inc., </em>587 F.Supp. 289, 291-92 (E.D.La.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Under the undisputed facts, Jones is the statutory employer of Richards within the meaning of the Louisiana statute. The granting of summary judgment is proper since, as a matter of law, Richards\u2019 recovery is. limited to worker\u2019s compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-5\">. Jones is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in North Carolina.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b611-6\">. The hearing on Jones\u2019 motion for summary judgment was delayed by the district court pending the appeal of a similar matter in <em>Dozier </em>v. <em>J.A. Jones Construction Company, Inc., </em>587 F.Supp. 289 (E.D.La.1984). The <em>Dozier </em>case was appealed but settled before a decision by this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b613-6\">. Richards also argues that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Engine &amp; Gas Compressor Services, Inc., </em>613 F.2d 65 (5th Cir.1980), is controlling. We disagree. The <em>Blanchard </em>Court did not consider the \"had contracted to perform\u201d alternative or whether the statute was disjunctive. Nor did the <em>Blanchard </em>facts present those questions, as the work there involved was not work which the alleged statutory employer had contracted to perform for a third party. Richards contends that since the Louisiana Supreme Court did not mention <em>Fultz v. McDowell, supra, </em>in its reply to this Court\u2019s certification of the statutory employer question in <em>Blanchard, </em>the Louisiana Supreme Court did not approve of the disjunctive reading of the statute set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>Fultz. </em>However, there was no reason for the Louisiana court to consider the second provision of the statute since <em>Blanchard </em>did not involve a fact situation presenting it. Moreover, the Louisiana decisions cited in the text, rendered subsequent to <em>Blanchard, </em>are in any event controlling.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
