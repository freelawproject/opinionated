The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Roncone, holding that Selective was legally obligated to provide him coverage under his homeowners\u2019 policy, in connection with a survival and wrongful death action brought against him by the parents of decedent Chentele Stenger, in their individual capacities and as administrators ad prosequendum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">This appeal requires us to address two principal legal questions: (1) whether decedent was an \u201cinsured\u201d within the meaning of the Selective policy, and thus excluded from the class of potential claimants; and (2) whether coverage for the independent wrongful death claim brought by decedent\u2019s parents is barred by the policy\u2019s intentional wrongs exclusion. The trial court answered \u201cno\u201d to both of these questions. We disagree as to question (1) and reverse. As to question (2), we remand for an evidentiary hearing for the trial court to determine whether Roncone\u2019s criminal act triggers the policy\u2019s intentional wrongs exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">The core facts necessary to address the intra-family exclusion issue are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Roncone and Christine Priest began a two-year relationship that culminated in the birth of their daughter Lauren in April 1993. The couple had an apparent committed and monogamous relationship, at times representing themselves as \u201cmarried.\u201d After Lauren\u2019s birth, Priest moved from her parents\u2019 home to Roncone\u2019s newly-built home in Sewell, with Chentele, her four-year-old daughter from an earlier relationship with Donald Stenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Chentele had her own bedroom in Roncone\u2019s house. Priest described the relationship between Roneone and Chentele as \u201caffectionate,\u201d with Roneone acting like a \u201cfather figure.\u201d He cared for both Chentele and Lauren on the evenings and weekends while Priest worked.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Priest worked the morning of Saturday, December 11, 1993, leaving Chentele and Lauren in Roncone\u2019s care. At approximately 10:45 a.m., Priest received a call from Roneone requesting her to come home because Chentele had fallen down the stairs and was immobile. Roneone explained that he instructed Chentele to go downstairs while he fed the baby. He subsequently heard a noise and found Chentele lying at the bottom of the steps. Roneone adamantly denied causing Chentele\u2019s injuries, but admitted to shaking her in an attempt to wake her from her stupor.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Chentele was removed from life support on Monday, December 13, 1993. An autopsy indicated that she died from brain injuries. Roneone was indicted for murder, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-3. After a jury trial, he was convicted of second-degree manslaughter. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4b(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">Under Roneone\u2019s homeowners\u2019 policy, the term \u201cinsured\u201d is defined as \u201cyou and residents of your household who are: (a) your relatives; or (b) <em>other persons under the age of 21 and in the care of any person named above.\u201d </em>The policy defines an \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident, including exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy period, in: (a) bodily injury; or (b) property damage.\u201d The Personal Liability provision extends coverage in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>connection with a claim or suit brought \u201cagainst an insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence.\u201d The policy excludes from coverage (1) bodily injury \u201cwhich is expected or intended by the insured;\u201d and (2) bodily injury to an \u201cinsured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">With respect to decedent\u2019s survival claim under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-3, Selective disclaimed liability because Chentele was (1) a resident in the Roncone household; (2) under the age of twenty-one; and (3) in his care at the time of her death. The first two definitional elements are not in contention.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Chentele was a four-year-old child residing in Roncone\u2019s house with her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In its decision directing Selective to provide coverage, the trial court focused on the phrase \u201cin the care of.\u201d The court found this phrase to be reasonably susceptible to different meanings. To resolve this alleged ambiguity, the court inserted the word \u201cprimary\u201d into the phrase \u201cin the care of,\u201d thus creating the phrase \u201cin the <em>primary </em>care of.\u201d Armed with this judicially-crafted language, the court concluded that decedent was not in Roncone\u2019s \u201cprimary\u201d care at the time he recklessly caused her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">We are unable to find any factual or legal support for this material alteration of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">We will start our analysis by reaffirming certain basic principles of insurance law. As contracts of adhesion, insurance policies are subject to special rules of interpretation. <em>Araya v. Farm Family Cas. Ins. Co., </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>203, 206, 801 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>1194 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>77, 812 A.2d 1109 (2002). Insurance policies must be construed liberally and in favor of the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations of coverage. <em>Gibson v. Callaghan, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>662, 671, 730 A.2d 1278 (1999); <em>United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Turck, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>480, 492-93, 721 A.2d 1 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">However, in interpreting a policy of insurance, words should be given their ordinary meaning. <em>Zacarias v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>590, 595, 775 A.2d 1262 (2001). \u201cIn the absence of any ambiguity, courts \u2018should not write for the insured a better policy of insurance than the one purchased.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gibson v. Callaghan, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 670, 730 A.2d 1278 (citation omitted). If the express language of the policy is clear and unambiguous, \u201c \u2018the court is bound to enforce the policy as it is written.\u2019 \u201d <em>Royal Ins. Co. v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>409, 416, 638 A.2d 924 (App.Div.1994) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">A word or phrase is not automatically rendered ambiguous simply because the policy fails to define it. <em>See Boddy v. Cigna Prop. &amp; Cas. Cos., </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>649, 656-57, 760 A.2d 823 (App.Div.2000). Where, as here, the policy fails to define a term or phrase, \u201cthe words must be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary, plain and usual meaning.\u201d <em>Daus v. Marble, </em>270 <em>N.J.Super. </em>241, 251, 636 A.2d 1091 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">In construing the phrase \u201cin the care of,\u201d we will utilize an approach rooted in common sense and based on the words\u2019 ordinary meaning, without inserting legalisms in an attempt to obfuscate their meaning, thereby creating a judicially-contrived ambiguity where none exists. There is nothing ambiguous about the phrase \u201cin the care of.\u201d We expect a reasonable insured reading this phrase to give it a plain, ordinary meaning. <em>Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary </em>168 (2001), defines \u201ccare\u201d as \u201cthe function of watching, guarding or overseeing.\u201d The word \u201ccare\u201d is typically associated with the supervision of children and other physically vulnerable or dependent individuals such as the elderly or infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>We are satisfied that the phrase \u201cin the care of\u2019 does not require the existence of a formal, judicially-sanctioned custodial or guardianship relationship. It is sufficient for the individual to temporarily assume the responsibility for the supervision, well-being and safety of a child. Our conclusion is bolstered by similar conclusions reached in other jurisdictions that have examined this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In <em>Henderson v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>460 <em>Mich. </em>348, 596 N.W.2d 190 (1999), the Michigan Supreme Court addressed this precise issue. There, the eighteen-year-old girlfriend of the homeowners\u2019 son was temporarily residing with the homeowners when an altercation occurred, resulting in the injury of plaintiff. Plaintiff sued the girlfriend for negligence and the insurer disputed coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In finding the phrase unambiguous, the <em>Henderson </em>Court noted the lower court\u2019s [failure] to recognize that this phrase is a colloquial or idiomatic phrase that is peculiar to itself and readily understood as a phrase by speakers and readers of our language. <em>Id. </em>at 194. Courts in other jurisdictions have followed <em>Henderson </em>in finding the phrase \u201cin the care of\u2019 unambiguous; the New Hampshire Supreme Court in <em>Oliva v. Vermont Mut. Ins. Co., </em>150 <em>N.H. </em>563, 842 A.2d 92, 95 (2004), and the Wisconsin Appellate Division in <em>Cierzan ex rel. Weis v. Kriegel, </em>259 <em>Wis.2d </em>264, 655 <em>N.W.2d </em>217, 221 (App.2002), <em>review denied, </em>260 Wis.2d 754, 661 N.W.2d 102 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The <em>Henderson </em>Court listed the following factors that a court may look to in ascertaining whether a person is in the care of the insured. Those factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">(1) is there a legal responsibility to care for the person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">(2) is there some form of dependency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-10\">(3) is there a supervisory or disciplinary responsibility;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-11\">(4) is the person providing the care providing substantial essential financial support;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-13\">(5) is the living arrangement temporary or permanent, including how long it has been in existence and is expected to continue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>(6) what is the age of the person alleged to be \u201cin the care of\u2019 another (generally, the younger a person the more likely they are to be \u201cin the care\u201d of another);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGF\">(7) what is the physical or mental health status of the person alleged to be \u201cin the care of\u2019 another (a person with health problems is more likely to be \u201cin the care\u201d of another); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">(8) is the person allegedly \u201cin the care of\u2019 another gainfully employed (a person so employed is less likely to be truly dependent on another)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 195-96.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">We agree with this commonsense approach and adopt the <em>Henderson </em>factors as analytical tools for determining whether decedent here was in the care of Roneone at the time of her death. These factors are not intended to provide an exhaustive list of relevant considerations. They are meant only to provide a reviewing court with an analytical starting point on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Applying the <em>Henderson </em>factors to the facts here, we note that factors (3), (5) and (6) apply because: (a) Chentele was left in the physical care of Roneone on the day of her death; (b) as the only adult in the house Roneone was responsible for her supervision, nourishment and general well-being; (c) the living arrangement was permanent and long-standing, with the child having her own room in the house for a period of months before her death; and (d) Chentele was four years old. Under these circumstances, Chentele was an \u201cinsured\u201d within the meaning of the Selective policy and excluded from the class of individuals legally capable of bringing a claim thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-11\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">Resolution of the intra-family exclusion issue does not end the discussion. As decedent\u2019s parents, Priest and Stenger have a legally independent right to bring a wrongful death action. <em>Gershon v. Regency Diving Ctr., Inc., </em>368 <em>N.J.Super. </em>237, 246, 845 A.2d 720 (App.Div.2004). They are also clearly not \u201cinsureds\u201d under the policy. Selective contends, however, that their claim for coverage is barred by the section excluding bodily injury \u201cwhich is expected or intended by the insured.\u201d The record here is insufficient to determine this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>We begin our analysis of this issue by emphasizing that exclusions based on intentional wrongful acts are common, legally acceptable and consistent with public policy. <em>Figueroa v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>578, 582, 575 A.2d 888 (App.Div. 1990). Although a criminal conviction is not a mandatory precursor to coverage determinations, Mroz <em>v. Smith, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>133, 137, 617 A.2d 1259 (App.Div.1992), a criminal conviction can bring the act within the exclusion. <em>Princeton Ins. Co. v. Chunmuang, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>80, 96, 698 A.2d 9 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Generally, a court must examine the actor\u2019s subjective intent. <em>Harleysville Ins. Cos. v. Garitta, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>223, 234, 785 A.2d 913 (2001). Where the actions are \u2018particularly reprehensible\u2019 [however,] an intent to injure can be presumed from the act without an inquiry into the actor\u2019s subjective intent. <em>Mroz v. Smith, supra, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 138, 617 A.2d 1259 (quoting <em>Voorhees v. Preferred Mut. Ins. Co., </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>165, 184, 607 A.2d 1255 (1992)). Thus, we have denied coverage in suits based on the insured\u2019s failure to advise his sexual partner of his HIV-positive status, <em>F.S. v. L.D., </em>362 <em>N.J.Super. </em>161, 827 A.2d 335 (App.Div. 2003); based on violations of the Domestic Violence Act, <em>Bittner v. Harleysville Ins. Co., </em>338 <em>N.J.Super. </em>447, 769 A.2d 1085 (App.Div. 2001); to individuals sued for spousal abuse, <em>Merrimack Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Coppola, </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>219, 690 A.2d 1059 (App.Div. 1997); and in eases involving the sexual molestation of children, <em>Atlantic Employers Ins. Co. v. Tots &amp; Toddlers Pre-School Day Care Ctr., Inc., </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 571 A.2d 300 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>147, 584 A.2d 218 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In all of these cases, the record permitted a rational inference that the insured\u2019s actions were intentional or substantially likely to cause the resulting injury. Here, the jury convicted Roneone of the crime of second-degree reckless manslaughter as a lesser included offense of murder. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:11-4 defines reckless manslaughter as a criminal homicide that is committed \u201crecklessly.\u201d Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:2-2b(3), a person acts recklessly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and purpose of the actor\u2019s conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\u2019s situation. \u201cRecklessness,\u201d \u201cwith recklessness\u201d or equivalent terms have the same meaning,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">In this civil action, the only version of how Chentele suffered the injuries that caused her death come from Roneone himself. He claims that the child accidentally fell down the stairs while he was attending eight-month-old Lauren. When he rushed to investigate the noise caused by her fall, he found Chentele at the bottom of the stairs in a semiconscious state. He shook the child only as an attempt to bring her to consciousness. We conclude from the guilty verdict that the criminal jury rejected this version of events. However, without more, we cannot conclude that Roncone\u2019s actions fall within the policy\u2019s intentional wrongs exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Although causing the death of a four-year-old child is inherently a \u201cparticularly reprehensible\u201d act, the jury\u2019s verdict does not provide a rational basis from which to presume that Roneone acted in such a manner that Chentele\u2019s death was an intended or expected consequence of his actions. Compare <em>Harleysville Ins. Cos. v. Garitta, supra, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>at 228, 785 A.2d 913, where the insured stabbed the victim twice in the torso area, puncturing his heart and stomach. Under these circumstances, the Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[t]he insurer has demonstrated that the insured intended to cause some injury, and that the actual injury that led to [the victim\u2019s] death was an inherently probable consequence of the insured\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235, 785 A.2d 913.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Here, what is missing from the record before us is the State\u2019s version of how this child died. We presume that, at the very least, the State\u2019s evidence in the criminal trial consisted of the testimony and findings of the medical examiner. This evidence should have included a forensic analysis of the injuries and how they caused Chentele\u2019s death. This medical evidence may provide insight into Roncone\u2019s state of mind. Depending on this and other evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>that may be revealed in the course of an evidentiary hearing, the trial court may be capable of inferring whether Roncone\u2019s actions fall within the scope of the policy\u2019s intentional wrongs exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">We reverse the trial court\u2019s determination that decedent was not an \u201cinsured\u201d under the policy\u2019s intra-family exclusion. We remand for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the insured\u2019s actions fall within the intentional wrongs exclusion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b569-11\"> The parties entered into a consent judgment against Roncone in the amount of $300,000. By stipulation, they also agreed to limit Selective's liability to $100,000, in the event we were to affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b571-11\"> In the course of arguing the summary judgment motion before the Law Division, counsel for Roncone claimed that Priest held a New Jersey driver\u2019s license indicating that she resided with her parents. Thus, by implication, Chentele's residence may appear to be in dispute. There is no competent evidence in the record before us to support this contention. All of the evidence indicates that Chentele resided with her mother at Roncone's house up to the time of her death.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
