Defendant cross-appeals from the denial of his pretrial motion to dismiss the informed consent claim on which the jury found liability.- The jury found no negligence or \u201cdeviation] from accepted standards of medical practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>Plaintiff argues that she is entitled to a new trial on damages and on the <em>Scafidi </em>allocation issue, <em>see Scafidi v. Seiler, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>93, 574 A.2d 398 (1990), while contending that \u201cthe liability issues should not be retried.\u201d On his cross-appeal, defendant seeks a reversal of the judgment and dismissal of the complaint because there is no basis for a verdict premised on lack of informed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">We reverse the judgment based on lack of informed consent, but order a new trial on all issues on the negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">In her complaint, plaintiff alleged that defendant, a urologist, deviated from the standard of care in his treatment of her husband (decedent) for bladder cancer, thereby contributing to his death. Plaintiff asserted claims for survivorship, wrongful death and loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">At trial, plaintiff pursued two theories of liability: (1) a negligent diagnosis/treatment theory \u2014 that defendant deviated from the standard of care when he failed to diagnose the recurrence of decedent\u2019s bladder cancer in April 1997; and (2) an informed consent theory \u2014 that in April 1997 defendant failed to inform decedent of all information a reasonable person would expect a doctor to disclose, thereby depriving him of his ability to make an informed decision about whether to pursue additional diagnostic testing or courses of treatment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-10\">The jury concluded that defendant was not negligent in failing to diagnose and treat the cancer. However, the jury also concluded that defendant failed to obtain decedent\u2019s informed consent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>regarding additional diagnostic testing which could have been performed, and that this failure \u201cincrease[d] the risk of harm posed by the [decedent\u2019s] preexisting condition.\u201d As already noted, the jury attributed ten percent of the \u201cultimate injuries or damages\u201d to defendant\u2019s failure to obtain decedent\u2019s informed consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">In assessing damages, the jury awarded $12,000 to decedent\u2019s estate for his \u201cpain, suffering, disability, impairment and loss of enjoyment,\u201d $13,000 to his survivors for wrongful death, and $15,000 to plaintiff on her loss of consortium. Defendant also stipulated to $20,000 in unreimbursed medical and funeral expenses. On April 4, 2003, the trial judge entered final judgment, molding the jury\u2019s verdict and reducing the damage awards in accordance with the percentage of liability assessed by the jury. The court awarded plaintiff damages in the amount of $7,285 ($6,000 in damages, that is 10% of the aggregate $60,000 damage award, plus $1,285 in prejudgment interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Decedent first visited defendant on January 26, 1996. At that time, decedent was a seventy-four-year-old retiree. He complained of \u201curinary hesitation\u201d (\u201ca urinary stream that is [slow or] hesitant to start\u201d), frequent urination, burning and discomfort when urinating, and erectile dysfunction. Defendant performed a physical examination and found a mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, as well as a nodular and firm prostate, which are signs of prostate cancer. Defendant discussed his findings with decedent and ordered a variety of tests to determine the cause of the symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">According to the proofs, there are several tests used to detect bladder cancer. They include cytology, which involves taking urine samples which are tested by a pathologist. If malignant cells are discovered, additional testing must be performed to discover the location of the cells within the urinary tract. Cytolo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>gy is successful in detecting between eighty and ninety percent of high-grade or \u201caggressive\u201d cancers.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Cystoscopy involves a visual examination of the bladder through the use of a cystoscope, an instrument containing a light and a camera lens, which is inserted through the urethra into the bladder, allowing visual examination of the interior surface of the bladder. Cystoscopy provides only \u201ca one-dimensional view\u201d of the bladder and, therefore, cannot detect cancer that is not visible on the surface of the bladder. However, bladder cancers are \u201ctransitional cell cancers\u201d; they originate from the transitional cells which are unique to the lining of the urinary tract, and then spread into the bladder wall. Therefore, virtually all bladder cancers would be visible on the surface of the bladder. As a result, even plaintiffs expert urologist admitted that it would be \u201crare\u201d for a bladder cancer not to be visible by cystoscope.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">A third diagnostic technique involves a biopsy or removal of tissue from the bladder and having it tested for cancer by a pathologist. Finally, a CT scan can be taken to x-ray and examine the lower pelvis. However, CT scans are typically used to \u201cstage\u201d the progress of bladder cancer which has already been diagnosed based on other tests and to determine the extent to which the cancer has spread beyond the bladder. The CT scan is \u201cthree-dimensional\u201d and can detect cancer \u201cwhich does not appear on the inner surface of the bladder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Among the tests defendant performed on decedent in February 1996 was a cystoscopy. The cystoscopy revealed a lesion or tumor on the right side of the bladder, which defendant believed was positive for cancer. Defendant discussed these findings with decedent and one week later performed surgery to remove the tumor as well as some surrounding tissue.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Post-surgical biopsies revealed that the tumor was cancerous. The cancer had been located on the surface of decedent\u2019s bladder, with some invasion into the submucosa and lymph channels of the bladder wall, but with no invasion into the muscular wall of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>bladder. The bladder cancer was an aggressive form which recurs in approximately seventy percent of its victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Defendant treated decedent with six courses of BCG therapy over a six-week period. BCG is a tuberculosis vaccine used as a form of chemotherapy to prevent the recurrence of bladder cancer. It is injected into the bladder through a catheter.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Thereafter, decedent returned to defendant for follow-up testing every three months. In June 1996, defendant performed a cytology and a cystoscopy, and took tissue samples from suspicious-looking areas of the bladder for biopsy. These tests showed no evidence of cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">At decedent\u2019s September 1996 visit, defendant performed a cytology and a cystoscopy, neither of which revealed any evidence of cancer. Defendant also gave decedent another three courses of BCG therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">In December 1996, decedent reported discomfort in his right groin and testes, and defendant also noted weight loss. Defendant performed a cytology, a cystoscopy, and a physical examination of decedent\u2019s groin, testes and rectum. None of these tests revealed any cancer. Defendant also gave decedent another three courses of BCG therapy, which continued into early January 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">In March 1997, decedent visited his general practitioner, Dr. Arnold Leibowitz, who ordered a pelvic CT scan. The scan was performed on March 29, 1997, and the radiologist\u2019s report was generated on March 31, 1997. The radiologist reported a \u201cthickening measuring just over 2 cm,\u201d of the right lateral wall of the bladder (the area from which the original tumor had been removed) which was \u201csuspicious for a primary neoplasm of the bladder or focal cystitis\u201d (primary neoplasm meaning tumor, and focal cystitis meaning bladder irritation or inflammation). The radiologist found \u201c[n]o pathological nodes ... within the pelvis,\u201d but \u201crecommended\u201d that the CT scan results be \u201ccorrelat[ed] with [a] cystoscopy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Shortly after the CT scan, on April 3, 1997, decedent visited defendant for his regularly scheduled tri-monthly follow-up exam. Defendant reviewed a copy of the radiologist\u2019s report on the date of the appointment, but could not recall whether he did so before or after he saw decedent. Defendant also could not recall whether he looked at the CT scan films in addition to the written report. However, it was his practice to review the films of all his patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">During the April 3, 1997 appointment, defendant performed a physical examination, a urinalysis, a cystoscopy, and an IVP. An \u201cIVP\u201d is an intravenous pyelogram, a diagnostic test that images the body after the injection of a dye. IVPs are used to detect, among other things, the functioning of the urinary tract, from the kidneys to the bladder. They can also be used to detect cancer in the urinary tract. The examination and testing of April 3, 1997, revealed no evidence of cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Based upon the combination of negative test results, defendant determined, and wrote to Dr. Leibowitz on April 7, 1997, that the CT scan had \u201clikely\u201d revealed \u201cscar [tissue] from the resection site\u201d of the 1996 surgical procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Defendant testified that CT scans are not as useful at detecting bladder cancer as a cystoscopy. CT scans often reveal thickening of the bladder wall which is a nonspecific finding that does not necessarily indicate the recurrence of cancer. If, during the cystoscopy, defendant had seen any suspicious areas in decedent\u2019s bladder, he would have immediately scheduled a resection or a biopsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Defendant did not recall telling decedent that there was a suspicious finding on his CT scan. However, defendant admitted he did not discuss with decedent the possibility of additional diagnostic testing to rule out the recurrence of cancer, because he did not believe any further tests were necessary at that time. Rather, defendant scheduled decedent for another follow-up visit in July 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Decedent returned to defendant\u2019s office on June 16, 1997, complaining of blood in his urine, pain in the lower right portion of his abdomen, and sensitivity in his right testicle. Defendant performed a cystoscopy and discovered a tumor in the bladder. Approximately one week later defendant removed the tumor at the Hackensack Medical Center. Subsequent pathology testing revealed that the tumor was cancerous and that the cancer had spread to the surrounding muscle tissue and lymphatic system.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Thereafter, defendant performed additional tests, including a CT scan and a bone scan, to determine the \u201cstage\u201d of decedent\u2019s cancer. The July 1997 CT scan did not indicate the presence of pathological lymph nodes. Defendant also discussed treatment options with decedent, recommending removal of the bladder and prostate followed by chemotherapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Decedent obtained a second opinion and pursued treatment with Dr. Carl Olsson, a urologist in New York City. Decedent thereafter pursued an aggressive course of treatment, including surgery to remove his bladder by Olsson at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, followed by chemotherapy. However, by the time the bladder was removed, the cancer had already spread extensively to his lymph nodes. Accordingly, decedent had very little chance of survival. The cancer recurred, and a second surgery was performed. Decedent ultimately died in May 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">The medical experts disagreed on two main points. First, they disagreed as to whether defendant deviated from the appropriate standard of care when he faded to diagnose decedent with recurrent cancer in April 1997. Second, the experts disagreed as to whether decedent\u2019s life expectancy was altered by the failure to diagnose the recurrent cancer at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">As to the negligence issue, plaintiffs expert urologist, Dr. Aaron Katz, opined that defendant deviated from the standard of care by not diagnosing recurrent cancer from the CT scan alone. Katz further opined that, given the results of the CT scan, in addition to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the tests defendant performed in April 1997 (urinalysis, cystoscopy and IVP), defendant also should have performed a cytology, or taken a tissue sample for a biopsy. Katz admitted, however, that if the CT scan had not been ordered by decedent\u2019s primary care physician, defendant would not have been obligated to order one in order to meet the standard of care of a urologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Defendant\u2019s expert urologist, Dr. Elliot Cohen, disagreed with Katz\u2019s analysis. Cohen opined that defendant had not deviated from the standard of care when he diagnosed the March 1997 bladder wall thickening as scar tissue or inflammation, as opposed to recurrent cancer. Cohen opined that bladder wall thickening was not \u201can unexpected finding\u201d given the surgical procedures and treatments decedent had endured in the previous year. According to Cohen, the thickening alone, combined with negative cystoscopy, IVP, and urinalysis test results, did not warrant a diagnosis of recurrent cancer or any additional treatment or testing at the time. He concluded there was \u201cabsolutely no deviation from the standard of care\u201d provided from a urological point of view.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Similarly, defendant\u2019s expert radiologist, Dr. Glenn Krinsky, opined that CT scans are not typically used to diagnose bladder cancer. He testified that physicians generally refer their patients to radiologists only after bladder cancer has been diagnosed and \u201cis already known.\u201d The CT scan is then used only to \u201cstage\u201d the cancer \u2014 to determine the extent to which the cancer has metastasized or \u201cspread outside the bladder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Dr. Krinsky further opined that the bladder wall thickening shown in the March 1997 CT scan films was a \u201cnonspecific finding.\u201d It could have been caused by the previous resections and biopsies, the previous BCG treatments, or by an inflammatory condition known as cystitis. Therefore, it was not proof of recurrent cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">As to the life expectancy issue, both of plaintiffs experts \u2014 Katz, the urologist, and Dr. Barry Singer, an oncologist \u2014 opined that, because the diagnosis of recurrent cancer was delayed until June 1997, decedent\u2019s chances of survival or prolongation of life were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>decreased. They reached this conclusion because, between April and June 1997, the tumor significantly increased in size and volume, and the cancer had spread beyond the bladder wall and into the lymph nodes. Singer opined that, had the cancer been diagnosed in April 1997, decedent would have had \u201ca 50 percent probability of cure.\u201d As of June 1997, however, when the diagnosis was made, \u201che had a zero prognosis\u201d or chance of survival.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Dr. Katz admitted that it was possible the cancer had spread beyond the bladder as of March 1997, even though it did not show up on the March 1997 CT scan. He nevertheless thought there was a \u201c50/50 shot ... it may have been confined to the bladder at that point,\u201d and, therefore, treatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">On the other hand, defendant\u2019s experts \u2014 Cohen, the urologist, and Dr. Charles Farber, an oncologist \u2014 opined that decedent\u2019s life expectancy was not diminished due to the delay in diagnosing recurrent cancer between the April 3, 1997, and June 16, 1997 appointments. Farber opined that, even if the cancer had been detected in April 1997, \u201cthere was no significant difference,\u201d his chances of survival were \u201czero percent,\u201d or close to zero percent, given the aggressive nature of the cancer from which he suffered, and the extent to which the cancer had spread beyond the bladder. In this regard, both Cohen and Farber opined that, given the lymphatic involvement at the time of the initial diagnosis in 1996, as well as the \u201cmassive [lymph node] involvement\u201d in July 1997, it was very likely that as of April 1997 the cancer had already spread to the lymph nodes.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">The jury found that defendant \u201cfail[ed] to inform Arthur Linquito of all the information that a reasonable person in the plaintiffs position would expect a doctor to disclose so that Arthur Linquito might make an informed decision about other diagnostic procedures and a course of treatment.\u201d Defendant argues that the informed consent theory, on which the jury found for plaintiff, is not applicable under the facts presented because the patient\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>allegation is essentially that the physician failed to perform adequate diagnostic testing. Defendant further contends that his motion to dismiss the case on that basis should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">We agree that the doctrine does not apply and is limited to advice which must be given premised on a proper diagnosis. Stated differently, while the issue is close and there is a viable contention that once a patient is diagnosed with cancer, he must be told of all possible diagnostic techniques he may undergo to evaluate subsequent test results, we decline to extend the doctrine to this situation. <em>Cf. Sinclair v. Roth, </em>356 <em>N.J.Super. </em>4, 14, 811 A.2d 460 (App.Div.2002), <em>certif. denied, </em>176 <em>N.J. </em>72, 819 A.2d 1188 (2003) (role of intermediate appellate court in medical malpractice case). Where a doctor makes an improper diagnosis that there is no cancer or similar health problem, he cannot be expected to give his patient information necessary to determine whether the additional diagnostic testing should be conducted so that the patient can elect to test for a condition he is told does not exist. The misdiagnosis is subject to recovery on the malpractice or negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The informed consent theory recognizes that \u201c[c]hoosing among medically reasonable treatment alternatives is a shared responsibility of physicians and patients.\u201d <em>Matthies v. Mastromonaco, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>26, 34, 733 A.2d 456 (1999). <em>Accord, Canterbury v. Spence, </em>464 <em>F.2d </em>772, 780 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 <em>U.S. </em>1064, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>560, 34 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>518 (1972). To meet their obligation of obtaining informed consent from their patients, physicians must \u201cevaluate the relevant information and disclose all courses of treatment that are medically reasonable under the circumstances,\u201d so that patients may make informed decisions as to which treatment option, including the option of non-treatment, to choose. <em>Matthies, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 34, 36-39, 733 A.2d 456. In determining the level of disclosure required, a \u201creasonable patient\u201d standard is applied. Physicians must disclose that information material to a reasonable patient\u2019s informed decision. <em>Id. </em>at 36, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>733 A.2d 456 (citing <em>Largey v. Rothman, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>204, 211-12, 540 A.2d 504 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Our Supreme Court\u2019s informed consent jurisprudence has addressed the question of whether, after the physician diagnosed the patient, the physician presented the patient with all treatment options that were medically reasonable under the circumstances, and the risks associated with them. <em>See, e.g., Howard v. Univ. of Med. and Dentistry of New Jersey, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>537, 554-59, 800 A.2d 73 (2002); <em>Sgro v. Ross, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>338, 339, 765 A.2d 745 (2001); <em>Matthies, supra, </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>at 29, 733 A.2d 456; <em>Baird, supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 70-71, 713 A.2d 1019; <em>Largey v. Rothman, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>204, 211-15, 540 A.2d 504 (1988); <em>Perna v. Pirozzi, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>446, 459-65, 457 A.2d 431 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">In this case, defendant reported that decedent had no recurrence of his bladder cancer. If that diagnosis was accurate (something plaintiff challenged in the negligent diagnosis/treatment claim), no further testing or treatment would have been necessary, and there would have been no medically reasonable treatment alternatives for defendant to have discussed with his patient. As intermediate appellate judges, we decline to expand the doctrine of informed consent, <em>Sinclair v. Roth, supra, </em>and the medical costs associated with the possibility a patient will decide to undergo further testing, particularly because plaintiff had a viable malpractice claim that defendant deviated from the standard of care by failing to diagnose the recurring bladder cancer, and by failing to order additional diagnostic tests to ascertain the condition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">We have previously held that the informed consent theory of liability does not apply where the patient\u2019s claim is that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>physician erred in diagnosing the patient\u2019s condition, either through an alleged failure to obtain an adequate medical history or through an alleged failure to perform a sufficient number or type of diagnostic tests. <em>Farina v. Kraus, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>165, 178-79, 754 A.2d 1215 (App.Div.1999) (holding that alleged failure to perform sufficient diagnostic testing); <em>Eagel v. Newman, </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 474-75, 739 A.2d 986 (App.Div.1999) (alleged failure to take adequate medical history or to attend to the matter, Judge Pressler stating that \u201cthe informed-consent basis of malpractice, as opposed to deviation from the applicable standard of care, rests not upon the physician having erred in diagnosis or administration of treatment but rather in the failure to have provided the patient with adequate information regarding the risks of a given treatment or with adequate information regarding the availability of alternative treatments and the comparative risks of each\u201d). We adhere to those cases. <em>Compare Gilmartin v. Weinreb, </em>324 <em>N.J.Super. </em>367, 390, 735 A.2d 620 (App.Div.1999) (citing out-of-state cases holding that informed consent doctrine does not require doctor to advise of alternative diagnoses, but noting it might apply where a specific diagnosis was considered possible by physician but not pursued).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\"><em>Farina </em>concerned whether a urologist negligently diagnosed and treated bladder cancer. In holding that the doctrine of \u201cinformed consent\u201d was not applicable, Judge King wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">This case before us is not about options for a course of treatment or for surgery but about suitable diagnostic testing. If the doctor wrongly failed to use the cytology test and this led to a diagnostic mistake which adversely affected the outcome, the doctor can be liable. If the standard of reasonable care did not require using the cytology test to aid a diagnosis, then there is no liability here. There is either a deviation, or there is not. A malpractice defendant does not have a duty to discuss every possible non-invasive risk-free diagnostic or laboratory test with a patient and secure a consent to or waiver thereof. The doctor must, of course, use reasonable care and skill in choosing the diagnostic tests and interpreting the results. If he does not, he is vulnerable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\"><em>[Farina, supra, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 179-80, 754 A.2d 1215.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">In <em>Farina </em>we also concluded that the trial court\u2019s submission of the case on a proper theory of liability (negligent diagnosis/treatment), and an improper theory of liability (informed consent), had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>\u201cirremediably tainted the jury\u2019s special verdicts\u201d for plaintiff on the informed consent theory only. <em>Id. </em>at 177-78, 180, 754 A.2d 1215 (quoting <em>Ahn v. Kim, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>511, 534, 658 A.2d 1286 (App.Div.1995), <em>aff'd, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>423, 678 A.2d 1073 (1996)). We found the verdict rejecting the negligent diagnosis/treatment theory \u201cwas not trustworthy where the balance of the verdict, on the \u2018informed consent\u2019 theory, [suggested that the jury determined] the defendant somehow failed his patient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 180, 754 A.2d 1215. We expressed concern that the jury\u2019s answers to the questions on the verdict sheet, including the percentage apportionment of damages answers, \u201csmack[ed] of a possible compromise verdict.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">As in <em>Farina, </em>defendant in the present case seeks reversal of the judgment and entry of judgment in his favor, notwithstanding the verdict, based on his unsuccessful motion to dismiss the informed consent theory in the trial court. He asserts the jury properly found for him on the negligence claim and the other theory should not have been presented. In <em>Farina, </em>however, we held that the appropriate result was a reversal of the judgment and remand for a new trial on all issues regarding the negligent diagnosis/treatment claim only. 333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 180, 754 A.2d 1215.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Here, plaintiff who was successful on the informed consent, but not the negligence, theory wants a retrial on damages and apportionment only, because her recovery was too low, evidencing a \u201cmanifest injustice.\u201d As she was unsuccessful on the negligence theory, and the \u201cinformed consent\u201d should not have been presented, we believe the <em>Farina </em>approach is the appropriate one to follow, irrespective of whether we deal with a \u201ccompromise verdict.\u201d In any event, the verdict reveals that the jury believed decedent was wronged and entitled to recovery, and may have considered the interrogatories differently had the case been properly presented only on the negligence-malpractice claim. In these circumstances, we should not speculate on how the jury would have viewed the case if properly presented. Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>reverse the judgment in favor of plaintiff on the informed consent theory of liability and remand the case for retrial on all issues relating to the negligent diagnosis/treatment theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Plaintiff attacks evidentiary rulings<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which she asserts resulted in an inadequate monetary award. The need for a new trial, for the reasons already stated, renders these contentions moot, with one exception. We address the exception because it may arise during the new trial on negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in not submitting a separate question to the jury regarding one aspect of decedent\u2019s emotional distress damages \u2014 the emotional distress he allegedly suffered when he learned that defendant had not informed him of the March 1997 CT scan report or its result. Plaintiff contends that a separate question was necessary because this discrete aspect of decedent\u2019s emotional distress damages should not have been subject to the <em>Scafidi </em>/\u201dlost chance\u201d reduction, as the other aspect of his damages were. We reject the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">The emotional distress decedent suffered upon learning that defendant had been negligent cannot logically be separated from the emotional distress he suffered as a result of his \u201clost chance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>for recovery,\u201d which was subject to reduction by the <em>Scafidi </em>allocation. Therefore, the trial court did not err in refusing to submit a separate interrogatory to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Over plaintiffs objections, the trial court submitted only one subdivided interrogatory to the jury regarding damages. In relevant part, it asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">7. What amount of money would fairly and reasonably compensate the estate of Arthur Linquito for the losses sustained by the defendant in damages, as a result of the negligence of Dr. Siegel and/or failure to obtain informed consent by Dr. Siegel:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">A. Pain, <em>suffering </em>disability, impairment and loss of enjoyment of life during his lifetime____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Thereafter, as previously noted, in the final judgment, the entire damages award was reduced by the jury\u2019s <em>Scafidi </em>allocation, with no exception for the emotional distress aspect of decedent\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">In <em>Scafidi, </em>the Supreme Court reduced the burden of proving proximate cause in certain medical malpractice cases. The Court held that, in medical malpractice cases where the physician\u2019s negligence combined with the patient\u2019s preexisting condition to cause the patient harm, the patient is required to show only that the physician\u2019s negligence increased the risk of harm from the preexisting condition, and that the physician\u2019s negligence was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in causing the patient\u2019s injuries. <em>Scafidi, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 101-09, 574 A.2d 398. The Court also held, however, that the plaintiffs damages in such cases must be apportioned between the preexisting condition and physician\u2019s negligence, and reduced by the percentage the jury allocates to the plaintiffs preexisting condition. <em>Scafidi, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 109-14, 574 A.2d 398. <em>See also Verdicchio v. Ricca, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>1, 37-38, 843 A.2d 1042 (2004) (defendant doctor did not satisfy apportionment burden when he failed to diagnose cancer; allocation between negligence and preexisting condition upheld).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>the plaintiff may recover damages only for the \u201clost chance for recovery\u201d caused by the physician\u2019s negligence, <em>id. </em>at 112-13, 843 A.2d 1042, and defendant bears the burden of proving that portion of a plaintiffs damages which was the result of the plaintiffs preexisting condition. <em>Id. </em>at 110-13, 843 A.2d 1042. <em>See also Verdicchio, supra,, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 37, 843 A.2d 1042 (burden on doctor \u201cto establish that the damages could be reasonably apportioned and what those apportioned damages were\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Here, plaintiff attempts to limit the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Scafidi. </em>Plaintiff wishes to carve out one aspect of a medical malpractice plaintiffs emotional distress damage award \u2014 the emotional distress the plaintiff suffered as a result of learning that the physician was negligent \u2014 and remove it from reduction by virtue of the <em>Scafidi </em>allocation. The argument has some appeal given the concept that apportionment is premised on the increased physical risk which is a concept separate from the emotional reaction. <em>See Scafidi, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 110-13, 574 A.2d 398. Moreover, but for the physician\u2019s negligence, a medical malpractice plaintiff would not have suffered emotional distress attributable only to the consequences of the physician\u2019s negligence. Nonetheless, there was no expert testimony, if there can be any, that emotional distress can be so isolated and was attributable in this case exclusively to the negligence and lost opportunity for recovery, as opposed to learning of the cancer itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The record presents no practical or logical way of separating this aspect of a plaintiffs emotional distress damages from the other aspects of a plaintiffs emotional distress damages stemming from the misdiagnosis and \u201clost chance for recovery.\u201d As the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>judge concluded, the emotional distress the patient suffered from learning of the physician\u2019s negligence is \u201cinextricably bound\u201d with the emotional distress the patient suffered from his diagnosis, illness, treatment, and lost chance of recovery, which are subject to apportionment under <em>Scafidi </em>because of his preexisting cancer. Accordingly, any recovery of emotional distress damages will be subject to apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">We remand for a new trial on the negligence-malpractice claim only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-11\"> In <em>Baird v. American Medical Optics, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>54, 70, 713 A.2d 1019 (1998), the Supreme Court distinguished between a \u201cmalpractice claim\u201d and an \u201cinformed consent\u201d claim.

Therein, Justice Pollock said \"[T]he extent to which the reasonable patient standard obligates physicians to disclose the details of alternative diagnoses, as distinguished from treatment alternatives, is not before us.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b65-10\"> Plaintiff contends the Law Division committed reversible error when it denied her motion for a mistrial, and her motion for a new trial, based upon the erroneous admission of unexpected testimony from defendant\u2019s expert radiologist, Krinsky, inconsistent with the other witnesses, to the effect that the March 1997 CAT scan showed a cancerous lymph node. The trial judge sustained her objection to Krinsky's testimony, struck the offensive testimony, immediately issued a curative instruction regarding the testimony, and offered to issue a second curative instruction during its jury charge (an option plaintiff rejected). Plaintiff contends these remedies were insufficient to overcome the prejudice caused. Plaintiff requests a new trial on damages and on the <em>Scafidi </em>allocation based on these errors. Given our order granting a new trial for the reasons stated, we need not address whether the alleged errors addressed to the negligence claims, either alone or in the aggregate, warrant a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b66-11\"> The claim of negligence in this case was premised on the theory that defendant's failure to diagnose and properly treat decedent, or to perform tests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>to obtain the proper diagnosis, \"increased the risk\u201d of his death and \"was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm that occurred.\" <em>Verdicchio, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 24, 843 A.2d 1042.
