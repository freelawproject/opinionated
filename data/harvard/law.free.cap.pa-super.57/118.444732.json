Fuller, J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-3\">This action of assumpsit was brought to recover the price of certain labor, materials, and appliances furnished in repairing an automobile, as set forth in a book account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-4\">There is no question whatever that the automobile in question was in the exclusive use and possession of the defendant, that it was badly damaged in an accident, that he directed the plaintiff to make all necessary repairs, that the plaintiff in making the repairs furnished a considerable amount of labor, materials, and appliances, for which the defendant rendered bill and received payment on that account of $715.35 from the insurance company in which he held a policy against such an accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-5\">He made defense and bases the present motion upon the ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-6\">1. That the action being founded upon a book account and the plaintiff\u2019s offer to prove the same having been excluded, the bottom ipso facto fell out of the case, leaving a fatal variance between allegata and probata.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-7\">The language of the statement is, \u201cThe plaintiff on the 2nd day of April, 1910, and at divers times thereafter, sold and delivered to the defendant, at his request, goods and merchandise, and also performed for defendant, at his request, certain work and labor, all of the value of $840.16, as set forth in plaintiff\u2019s book of original entry, a true and correct copy of which is hereto attached and made part hereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-8\">We cannot assent to the proposition that the action is founded upon a book account, except in a colloquial sense of the expression.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-9\">It was founded upon the implied contract to pay a reasonable price for plaintiff\u2019s services, of which the book account would be evidence, but not the only evidence, and, therefore, when we rejected the offer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>prove the book account because it appeared that the entries were made at the end of the month in a loose leaved ledger, from daily memorandum slips, and not contemporaneously, it was clearly competent for the plaintiff to prove its cguse by any other proper evidence in its possession.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-4\">It is correct, of course, to contend that the other evidence should substantially establish the services specified in the entries as set forth in the copy annexed to the statement, because that specification constitutes the plaintiff\u2019s bill of particulars, but that is a very different proposition from the contention that the book account as such must be proven.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-5\">. The other evidence produced by the plaintiff was legally sufficient, if the jury believed it, and the jury did believe it, to substantially establish those services.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-6\">It was given by plaintiff\u2019s employees, who were immediately connected with the work and its supervision, and whose recollection was largely aided by the daily memorandum slips above mentioned; and we place particular emphasis upon the circumstance, as one furnishing most persuasive support to' the nature and amount of the services in question, that the defendant based thereon his claim under the insurance policy, for which he received full satisfaction from the insurance company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-7\">This conduct operated as an admission, being the plain equivalent of saying to the insurance company, \u201cPay me what I owe the plaintiff for repairing the damage caused by the accident,\u201d and in light of this circumstance it is extremely difficult to explain his present repudiation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-8\">Defendant further urges as supporting the charge of variance, that the memorandum slips and certain dunning letters offered in evidence show a credit given to the Hanover Brewing Company instead of himself, but we are unable to impute to this circumstance any such conclusive effect, although, of course, it had important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>bearing upon the question whether defendant contracted for himself or for the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-3\">This brings us to another defense, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-4\">2. That the automobile belonged not to the defendant at all but to the Hanover Brewing Company, for whom he was manager, and for whom as' agent he made the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-5\">This contention is set forth in the affidavit of defense as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-6\">\u201cFirst. That he did not contract, neither in his own name or in his own behalf, with the plaintiff, as set forth and claimed by the plaintiff in the declaration filed in this case; Second. That the automobile which plaintiff avers is repaired, and for which it furnished parts and materials, was the property of the Hanover Brewing Company, a corporation-duly organized under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania; Third that as the agent of said company he did take said machine to the plaintiff to be repaired and informed plaintiff to whom the machine belonged.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-7\">The fact of ownership, of course, could not be regarded as conclusive but only as a collateral circumstance assisting determination of the main inquiry, whether the defendant or the brewing company should be held, liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-8\">Defendant\u2019s ownership would naturally enhance almost to the point of demonstration, the probability of the inference that he was contracting for himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-9\">It was clearly a question of fact for the jury on a conflict of evidence, and in our judgment was properly decided.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-10\">The personality of the defendant was the outward, visible sign of the brewing company\u2019s existence. He bought the automobile, paid for it with his own money, took out in his own name the license as well as the insurance, and apparently had' exclusive private enjoyment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-11\">All this, of course, was capable of being reconciled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>with the opposite theory of the company\u2019s ownership, but it was for the jury and not for the court to effect the reconciliation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-4\">On the other hand, the circumstance of the slip and the letters above mentioned had a persuasive bearing in favor of tie defendant, but not such conclusive bearing as would remove the necessity of submitting the question on all the evidence in the case to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-5\">Bringing to a summary conclusion this' opinion, without further elaboration of details, we say that the question of agency, the question of ownership, the question of services rendered, the question of performance, and all the connected questions in the case, were questions of fact for the jury on a conflict of evidence, which questions, as we believe, were decided in conformity with the law and the equities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-6\">It should be observed that no exception was taken to the charge by either party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-7\">Accordingly the motion for a new trial and for judgment non obstante veredicto are denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was order refusing judgment for defendant n. o. v.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-9\"><em>W.
