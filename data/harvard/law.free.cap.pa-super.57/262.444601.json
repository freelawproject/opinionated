Lambert and J. Dickinson Sergeant and the survivor of them, for life, and upon the death of either to pay $15,000 to William Sergeant Kendall; upon the death of Mary E. Lambert to deliver certain specific articles together with the sum of $10,000 to the Abington Library at Jenkintown, and upon .the death of both life tenants to pay $45,000 to Mary E.

Lambert and J. Dickinson Sergeant having died, the executors filed their account of this particular trust, which was duly audited and an adjudication filed thereupon October 11, 1911, and distribution made to the parties thereunto entitled in remainder, including Mary E. Lowell, and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts; and as at this time some of the securities were not worth as much on the market as they were at the time the trustees invested in them, a revaluation was had and the securities were awarded in kind at values based upon the new appraisement; with the result that the respective legatees received less than the amounts bequeathed them; and some of them are now before the present auditing judge claiming that the difference be paid to them out of the present fund for distribution, which is residuary estate and arises from the sale of real estate and personal securities. The auditing judge is of the opinion that this contention cannot be sustained. If this were the case of a fund having been set aside as security for the payment of certain specified amounts upon the death of the life tenants, or if the legacies had abated by reason of insufficient assets, it might well be argued that the intention of the testator, that the legacies should be paid in full, was controlling; but these legacies did not abate; on the contrary, the judge who audited the first account awarded the full amount of the legacies to the accountants, his language in this respect, as set forth in the adjudication being, \u201cthe fact that in this residuary clause he gives legacies in remainder to the amount of $186,000 shows that the residuary estate must have amounted to that sum after the payment of the collateral tax. There will be set aside therefore for this trust after the payment of the tax, the sum of $186,000 together with the appraised value of the specific bequests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>mentioned in the residuary clause. The balance of the estate will be awarded pro rata on account of the legacies given in the codicil;\u201d and in the schedule of distribution annexed to the adjudication credit is taken for the amounts of the residuary bequests, including the appraised value of the books, etc., given to the Abington Library, the award with respect to the same being as follows, \u201cwhich sum of $187,025 is to be held in trust by the executors and the income thereof to be paid one-half to Mary E. Lambert and the other one-half to J. Dickinson Sergeant in accordance with the terms of the will.\u201d The trustees invested this award for the purposes of the trust, and it is to be presumed that the investments which they made were satisfactory to the legatees in remainder, as otherwise they would have criticised the character of the investments at the audit of the trustees\u2019 account, confirmed nisi October 11, 1911. If, at the time of distribution, the stocks and bonds held for the trust estate had shown an advancement in market values, can it be seriously contended that the legatees would not be entitled to the benefit thereof? And, conversely, they should now bear the loss, although in this connection it should be said that the alleged loss is not a liquidated one but arises through a reappraisement, the securities themselves which were awarded to the respective legatees having been retained by them, and it was stated at the audit that they are still unsold. Neither in the view of the auditing judge is the question affected by the fact that in receipting for their awards the legatees stipulated that doing so should be without prejudice to their right \u201cto make a claim for any deficiency at any \u201csubsequent audit of the estate of John Lambert, deceased, if legally entitled thereto,\u201d as this was but a wise precaution on their part in order that they might not be estopped from having the question which they now raise, judicially determined. The claim is not allowed.

He afterwards unexpectedly acquired a large additional estate, and by a codicil bequeathed other legacies, adding, that if his estate should prove insufficient to pay in full all the legacies given by both, will and codicil they should abate in this order, first the legacies given in the codicil, second, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the legacies given in the residuary clause of the will, and, third, the legacies in the will other than those in the residuary clause. This established the priority of payment of the legacies as follows: First, the legacies given in the will other than those in the residuary' clause; second, the legacies given in the residuary clause of the will, and third and lastly, the legacies given in the codicil.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b309-5\">At the audit of the executors\u2019 account the estate as it then existed was not sufficient to pay all the legacies in full, and the auditing judge awarded in full'of those legacies bequeathed in the will other than those in the residuary clause, and then awarded securities appraised at $187,025, in trust under the residuary clause, the balance being distributed pro rata on account of the legacies bequeathed by the codicil. In doing this, the auditing judge was clearly right. The bequests in the residuary clause of the will became under the provisions of the codicil equivalent to the bequest of a definite sum in trust for certain life tenants with remainder at their deaths to the legatees in different proportions or amounts. No exceptions were filed to the adjudication and no request was made by anyone concerned to have an additional sum reserved to protect the legatees in remainder from a possible depreciation' of the assets during the life tenancy, as was ordered in the similar but not identical case of Lathrop\u2019s Est., 3 Pa. Dist. Rep. 100. Perhaps if such request had been made, it might have been granted, but the auditing judge was not called upon to do this of his own motion, nor was the accountant bound to ask the judge to do so, when the legatees whose interests were concerned did not think it necessary or worth while to make the request. After the death of the life tenants, the trustees filed their account of the assets in their hands and the same were awarded to the legatees without objection on their part. It is now too late at the audit of the second account of the executors when another fund is brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>'before the court, for these legatees to claim that a deficit should be made good therefrom, which is stated to be caused by a depreciation in the value of the securities embraced in the trust. We are of opinion that this cannot be done.
