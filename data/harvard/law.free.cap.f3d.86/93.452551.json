The suit was eventually settled for $2.6 million and Hamlin turned around and brought the present suit, a diversity suit governed by Wisconsin common law, against two of its liability insurers (actually three, but two are affiliates and need not be distinguished), to recover the $2.6 million. Hamlin charges that the two insurers breached their duty to defend it against DICKEY-john\u2019s suit. The district court granted Hamlin\u2019s motion for summary judgment, awarding it the entire $2.6 million (plus interest and attorneys\u2019 fees) even though it is plain that no part of Hamlin\u2019s liability to DICKEY-john is within the scope of the insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Most liability insurance policies provide that if the insured is sued and asks its insurer to defend the suit, the insurer must do so; and it must do so, the courts interpreting such policies hold, unless it is plain from the complaint that the plaintiffs claims of liability are not covered by the policy. Unless that condition is satisfied, the insurer will be deemed to have breached its duty to defend even if it should later be determined that the claims were indeed outside the coverage of the policy. Thus the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify (that is, to pay the insurance claim) are not coextensive, and the former, being triggered by arguable as distinct from actual coverage and determined by what the complaint says rather than by the actual facts underlying the claim of liability, is broader. <em>City of Edgerton v. General Casualty Co., </em>184 Wis.2d 750, 517 N.W.2d 463, 470 (1994); <em>Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co. v. Badger Medical Supply Co., </em>191 Wis.2d 229, 528 N.W.2d 486, 489 (App. 1995); <em>United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Good Humor Corp., </em>173 Wis.2d 804, 496 N.W.2d 730, 734 (App. 1993); <em>Curtis-Universal, Inc. v. Sheboygan Emergency Medical Services, Inc., </em>43 F.3d 1119, 1122 (7th Cir. 1994) (applying Wisconsin law).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">An insurance company that refuses a tender of defense by its insured takes the risk not only that it may eventually be forced to pay the insured\u2019s legal expenses but also that it may end up having to pay for a loss that it did not insure against. If the lack of a defender causes the insured to throw in the towel in the suit against it, the insurer may find itself obligated to pay the entire resulting judgment or settlement even if it can prove lack of coverage. That is what happened in <em>Newhouse by Skow v. Citizens Security Mutual Ins. Co., </em>176 Wis.2d 824, 501 N.W.2d 1 (1993), and is the reason why an insurance company that wants to avoid liability for breach of the duty to defend will often seek a declaratory judgment of noneoverage, to negate any inference of arguable coverage and hence of a duty to defend, before the company has to decide whether to accept the tender of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">The district judge inferred from <em>New-house </em>that an obligation to pay the entire settlement or judgment is the <em>automatic </em>consequence of a finding of a breach of the duty to defend. Dicta in <em>Newhouse </em>and other cases interpreting the Wisconsin common law of insurance-contract interpretation, such as <em>Grube v. Daun, </em>173 Wis.2d 30, 496 N.W.2d 106, 123 (App. 1992), and our own <em>Carney v. Village of Darien, </em>60 F.3d 1273, 1277 (7th Cir. 1995), are consistent with this harsh view. And holdings to this effect can be found in two Wisconsin cases. <em>United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Good Humor Corp., supra, </em>496 N.W.2d at 734-39, and <em>Professional Office Buildings, Inc. v. Royal Indemnity Co., </em>145 Wis.2d 573, 427 N.W.2d 427, 431 (App. 1988). But there is a contrary dictum in <em>Grube v. Daun, supra, </em>496 N.W.2d at 123, while <em>Production Stamping Corp. v. Maryland Casualty Co., </em>544 N.W.2d 584, 586 (Wis. App. 1996), holds that a wrongful failure to defend will not estop the insurer to plead lack of coverage unless coverage is at least \u201cfairly debatable.\u201d Only <em>Newhouse </em>is a ease from Wisconsin\u2019s highest court, moreover\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>and <em>Newhouse </em>is explicit that the insured must show that he was made worse off by the breach than he would have been had the breach not occurred. 501 N.W.2d at 7. This is also the majority view, 1 Allan D. Windt, <em>Insurance Claims &amp; Disputes: Representation of Insurance Companies and Insureds </em>\u00a7 4.37, pp. 267-68 (3d ed. 1995), and it is inconsistent with a rule of <em>always </em>forbidding the insurer that has wrongfully refused to defend the insured\u2019s ease to deny coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In the present case \u2014 a ease of <em>multiple </em>insurers, to which the dicta we have referred, which assume that the insured is defending himself, <em>id., </em>\u00a7 4.33, p. 256, do not speak \u2014 another of Hamlin\u2019s insurers, not one of the defendants, accepted the tender of the defense. This insurer did not pay the entire bill for Hamlin\u2019s defense. But neither is Hamlin some hapless individual who could not afford a good defense unless his insurer or insurers picked up the full tab. Hamlin was defended by Foley &amp; Lardner, one of the best law firms in the United States. Had the insurance companies that are the present defendants helped pay Foley &amp; Lardner\u2019s bills, Hamlin would have benefited to the extent that the insurer which did accept the tender of defense did not cover those bills in their entirety. But it would not have been better off to the tune of $2.6 million. That would imply that if only the defendants had contributed to the cost of the defense DICKEY-john would have been sent packing without a cent, though as far as we can tell its claims against Hamlin were entirely valid. Valid or not, Hamlin couldn\u2019t have expected to do better than with Foley &amp; Lardner \u2014 the firm that was in fact its own choice, and not a coerced choice, that is, not a choice to which it turned only because the obstinacy of the defendants made it unable to \u201cafford\u201d an even better firm (if there is one).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">To award Hamlin $2.6 million would thus be to give it a windfall, and windfall damages are punitive in nature. Insurance companies that refuse in bad faith to honor their undertakings are liable for punitive damages. <em>Weiss v. United Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>541 N.W.2d 753, 765 (Wis. 1995); <em>Marsh v. Farm Bureau Mutual Ins. Co., </em>179 Wis.2d 42, 505 N.W.2d 162, 170 (App. 1993). As there is no basis for an inference of bad faith in this ease, the judgment awarded by the district court is inconsistent with Wisconsin\u2019s policy on punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Indeed, there never was even arguable coverage of Hamlin\u2019s liability to DICKEY-john, and the insurance companies were therefore within their rights in declining to defend Hamlin. To see this, we need to compare DICKEY-john\u2019s complaint with the terms of the insurance policies. According to the complaint, Hamlin manufactured and sold to DICKEY-john liquid crystal displays that DICKEY-john incorporated into instrument panels which it then sold to manufacturers of agricultural machinery. The manufacturers in turn sold tractors incorporating the panels to farmers. A number of the liquid crystal displays were defective, and as a result the instrument panels did not work properly. This was not discovered until the tractors containing the panels had been in use for some time. The farmers filed warranty claims against the tractor manufacturers, who in turn filed claims against DICKEY-john, resulting in warranty and repair costs that DICKEY-john sought to shift to Hamlin by means of its suit. The suit charged breach of contract and breach of express and implied warranties of merchantability. Hamlin was thus alleged to have sold defective goods, causing its buyer to incur warranty and repair costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Is such liability within the arguable scope of either defendant\u2019s insurance policies? Home\u2019s policy, a standard Commercial General Liability policy, covers liability for \u201cproperty damage.\u201d This is defined as either \u201cphysical injury to tangible property\u201d or \u201closs of use of tangible property that is not physically injured.\u201d But there is an exclusion for \u201cyour [that is, the insured\u2019s] product\u201d \u2014 and the only physical injury <em>was </em>to Hamlin\u2019s product, the liquid crystal displays themselves. When the displays were mounted in the instrument panels manufactured by DICKEY-john, the panels would not work. But there is no hint in the complaint that the panels were somehow physically injured by containing a nonfunctioning part.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>The policy also excludes liability for damage to \u201cimpaired property,\u201d that is, property that has <em>not </em>been physically injured, resulting from a \u201cdefect\u201d in the insured\u2019s product \u2014 -which is an exact description of DICKEY-john\u2019s claim. DICKEY-john claimed that the defect in Hamlin\u2019s product had impaired its own product, not by physically injuring it but by impairing its performance. The defective liquid crystal displays were like a defective clock in an automobile. The defect impairs the performance (broadly conceived) of the automobile. It does not physically injure the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">There is an exclusion from the second of these exclusions (\u201cimpaired property\u201d) for the case in which the insured\u2019s property is damaged in an accident. If en route to DICKEY-john, Hamlin\u2019s liquid crystal displays had been damaged in a traffic accident and as a result had become defective, Hamlin\u2019s liability to DICKEY-john would have been covered by Home\u2019s insurance policy after all. But the complaint alleges that over a period of two years \u201ca great number of the LCD units provided by Hamlin to DICKEY-john were defective,\u201d and this allegation is inconsistent with an inference that the defective units became defective as the result of an accident to otherwise sound units.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Complaints are not always accurate, so no one reading DICKEY-john\u2019s complaint could have been certain that Hamlin\u2019s liability would not turn out to be of a sort covered by the insurance policy. But certainty is not the test. The test is whether the complaint arguably asserts a form of liability covered by the policy. DICKEY-john\u2019s does not. Neither the district court nor the insured is able to offer a <em>plausible </em>interpretation of the complaint that would bring its allegations within the scope of the liabilities that Home insured Hamlin against.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The same is true with regard to Hartford\u2019s policy, though its wording is slightly different. There is an exclusion for \u201cproperty damage to the named insured\u2019s product arising out of such products or any part of such products,\u201d and this is the equivalent of the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion in Home\u2019s policy. The damage to the liquid crystal displays came from a defect in the product itself and was thus squarely within the exclusion. There is also an \u201cimpaired property\u201d exclusion: no coverage for \u201closs of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed resulting from ... the failure of the named insured\u2019s products ... to meet the level of performance, quality, fitness or durability warranted ... by the named insured.\u201d This again is an exact description of the loss that gave rise to DICKEY-john\u2019s suit against Hamlin. DICKEY-john\u2019s instrument panels became unusable as a consequence of a defect, constituting a breach of warranty, in Hamlin\u2019s product.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Other issues are raised but need not be discussed. The judgment for Hamlin is reversed with instructions to enter judgment for the defendant\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b186-10\">RIPPLE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq3\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">I join the judgment of the court. There is no plausible interpretation of the complaint that would bring its allegations within the scope of the liabilities against which Home insured Hamlin. This basis is quite adequate to support the decision of the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
