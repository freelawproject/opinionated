The question before us is whether those words amount to an \u201cexpress threat of death\u201d within the meaning of section 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) of the Sentencing Guidelines. Holding that they do, we affirm the district court\u2019s two-level enhancement of appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-21\">Section 2B3.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines governs sentences for robbery. Subsection (a) establishes the base offense level; subsection (b) provides several grounds for raising the offense level. Subsection (b)(2)(F) states that \u201cif an express threat of death was made, increase [the offense level] by two levels.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F). The commentary to the guideline states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1278-22\">An \u201cexpress threat of death,\u201d as used in subsection (b)(2)(F), may be in the form of an oral or written statement, act, gesture, or combination thereof. For example, an oral or written demand using words such as \u201cGive me the money or I will kill you\u201d, \u201cGive me the money or I will pull the pin on the grenade I have in my pocket\u201d, \u201cGive me the money or I will shoot you\u201d, \u201cGive me your money or else (where the defendant draws his hand across his throat in a slashing motion)\u201d, or \u201cGive me the money or you are dead\u201d would constitute an express threat of death. The court should consider that the intent of the underlying provision is to provide an increased offense level for cases in which the offender(s) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>engaged in conduct that would instill in a reasonable person, who is a -victim of the offense, significantly greater fear than that necessary to constitute an element of the offense of robbery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F), comment, (n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">Appellant, Robert Robinson, pled guilty to robbing five banks in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), which makes it a crime to take money from any bank \u201cby force and violence, or by intimidation.\u201d Robinson used a different note in each robbery. He used the note we mention above \u2014 \u201cGive me one pack of 20s or I will shoot somebody in here now\u201d\u2014 during a March 15th robbery. In two other robberies, he used virtually identical notes: \u201cI have a gun. Give me a pack of 20s or I will shoot somebody out here now\u201d; and \u201cI have a gun. Give me one pack of 20\u2019s or I will shoot somebody out here now.\u201d During the fourth robbery, he used a note demanding two packs of twenty dollar bills; during the final robbery, his note read simply, \u201cI have a gun.\u201d Robinson never actually had a gun during the robberies, but no one else was aware of that at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\">Finding that Robinson had made an \u201cexpress threat of death\u201d in all five robberies, the probation office recommended enhancing Robinson\u2019s offense level by two points under section 2B3.1(b)(2)(F). Robinson\u2019s counsel objected, arguing that the commentary\u2019s final sentence and all of its examples indicated that, in order to make an express threat of death, a robber had to \u201cinstill fear of death in the victim teller.\u201d His counsel argued that because Robinson\u2019s notes at most threatened only \u201csomebody out here\u201d or \u201csomebody in here,\u201d his statements did not meet this requirement. Apparently concluding that at least one of Robinson\u2019s notes constituted an express threat of death, the district court applied the two-level enhancement and sentenced Robinson to 57 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-9\">Robinson urges us to disregard the commentary as inconsistent with the guideline and, applying the plain language of the guideline to the statements he made during the robberies, to conclude that none of them was an \u201cexpress threat of death.\u201d He claims that the guideline\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cexpress threat of death\u201d requires that the robber \u201cdirectly, plainly, and unmistakably indicate that the victim was going to die.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8. According to Robinson, a threat of death is not \u201cexpress\u201d if the victim must draw inferences in order to conclude that the robber is threatening death. He thus argues that the guideline conflicts with two portions of the commentary: the commentary\u2019s final sentence, because that sentence suggests that courts should examine the inferences that a reasonable victim would make; and the example, \u201cGive me the money or I will shoot you,\u201d because the threat to \u201cshoot\u201d explicitly threatens only injury, requiring a victim to infer that the robber was threatening death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-11\">Because Robinson did not make this argument before the district court \u2014 indeed, counsel never even hinted at any inconsistency between the guideline and the commentary \u2014 we review his argument under a plain error analysis. <em>See United States v. Saro, </em>24 F.3d 283, 286-88 (D.C.Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Dawson, </em>990 F.2d 1314, 1316-17 (D.C.Cir.1993). In interpreting a guideline and its commentary, we are bound by a set of familiar principles. Courts must consider commentary \u201cthat interprets or explains a guideline [to be] authoritative unless [the commentary] violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly erroneous reading of, that guideline.\u201d <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1915, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993); <em>see also id. </em>at 44\u201445, 113 S.Ct. at 1918-19. If commentary is inconsistent with a guideline, courts should disregard the conflicting portions of the commentary and rely upon the guideline itself. <em>Id. </em>at 43, 113 S.Ct. at 1918. Commentary is not \u201cinconsistent\u201d with a guideline simply because it adopts what we might regard as one of the less likely interpretations of a guideline. <em>See United States v. Smaw, </em>22 F.3d 330, 333 (D.C.Cir.1994). Rather, since we must treat commentary interpreting a guideline as we would an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations, <em>Stinson, </em>508 U.S. at 44-45, 113 S.Ct. at 1918-19, commentary is inconsistent only if \u201can \u2018alternative reading is <em>compelled </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>by the [guidelinejs plain language or by other indications of the [Sentencing Commission\u2019s] intent at the time of the [guidelinejs promulgation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,---, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 2386-87, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994) (quoting <em>Gardebring v. Jenkins, </em>485 U.S. 415, 430, 108 S.Ct. 1306, 1314, 99 L.Ed.2d 515 (1988)) (emphasis added); <em>see also Stinson, </em>508 U.S. at 43, 113 S.Ct. at 1918 (requiring \u201cflat inconsistency\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">Applying these principles, we find no error, let alone plain error, in the district court\u2019s failure to detect the alleged inconsistencies. Indeed, we perceive no inconsistency at all between the robbery guideline and its commentary. While \u201cexpress\u201d may usually mean \u201c[m]ade known distinctly and explicitly, and not left to inference,\u201d it may also simply mean \u201cclear.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 580 (6th ed.1990); <em>see also </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 803 (1993). The Sentencing Commission could thus reasonably interpret \u201cexpress\u201d to mean \u201cclear\u201d; having done so, it could determine that a robber \u201cclearly\u201d threatens another person with death even if a person on the receiving end of the threat had to draw some inferences in order to conclude that the robber was threatening to kill. Thus, to the extent the final sentence in the commentary suggests that the court should evaluate a robber\u2019s statement from the perspective of \u201ca reasonable ... victim\u201d to determine if it clearly threatens death, no irreconcilable conflict exists. Nor is there a conflict with the example, \u201cGive me the money or I will shoot you.\u201d Admittedly, \u201cI will shoot you\u201d does not threaten death as unambiguously as \u201cI will kill you.\u201d Yet the Sentencing Commission could reasonably determine that when a bank robber hands a note to a teller stating, \u201cGive me the money or I will shoot you,\u201d the teller would clearly understand these words to be a threat to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">To support his argument that the guideline and commentary are inconsistent, Robinson cites two Ninth Circuit eases. In <em>United States v. Martinez-Cano, </em>6 F.3d 1400, 1401-03 (9th Cir.1993), the court found a guideline requiring higher sentences for offenders trafficking in six or more \u201c \u2018sets\u2019 \u201d of documents inconsistent with its commentary, instructing courts to \u201c\u2018treat [a] set [of documents] as one document.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1402 (quoting USSG \u00a7 2L2.1(b)(2), comment, (n.2)). The Ninth Circuit reasoned that if a court were to follow the commentary, it could never achieve the six \u201csets\u201d required to enhance a sentence under the guideline, because \u201cas soon as one thought one had a set it would metamorphose into a single document only.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1403. The court thus concluded that the commentary and guideline were \u201cin inexora-r ble conflict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we indicate above, no such conflict exists here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-9\"><em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>50 F.3d 751 (9th Cir.1995), the other case cited by Robinson, does not support his position either. The <em>O\u2019Brien </em>court found no inherent conflict between the guideline and the commentary, but merely between the guideline and another circuit\u2019s interpretation of the commentary. <em>See id. </em>at 754-56. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>therefore stands for the rather uncontroversial principle that courts should not construe the commentary as to create a conflict with the guideline, but should read the commentary, if possible, in a way that harmonizes with the guideline\u2019s plain language. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>942 F.2d 606, 612 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-10\">Robinson also relies on a series of cases from the Eleventh Circuit, beginning with <em>United States v. Tuck, </em>964 F.2d 1079, 1080-81 (1992), as well as dissenting opinions in cases from the Seventh and Eighth Circuits, finding various statements insufficiently clear to be express threats of death. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>6 F.3d 715, 721 (11th Cir. 1993); <em>United States v. Canzater, </em>994 F.2d 773, 774\u201475 (11th Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Cadotte, </em>57 F.3d 661, 662 (8th Cir. 1995) (Arnold, M.S., J., dissenting), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 783, 133 L.Ed.2d 733 (1996); <em>United States v. Hunn, </em>24 F.3d 994, 999 (7th Cir.1994) (Easterbrook, J., dissenting). None of these opinions, however, suggests ignoring the commentary because it is inconsistent with the guideline. Moreover, to the extent that the Eleventh Circuit decided not to rely on the commentary, it did so for a reason since rejected by the Supreme Court. In <em>Tuck, </em>the Eleventh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>Circuit declined to rely on the commentary because it thought that it should treat the commentary like legislative history, resorting to it only if the guideline itself is ambiguous. <em>Tuck, </em>964 F.2d at 1081 (citing <em>United States v. Stinson, </em>957 F.2d 813, 814 (11th Cir.1992), <em>vacated by Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993)). The Supreme Court rejected that premise in <em>Stinson, </em>holding that commentary should be treated not like legislative history, but like an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations. <em>Stinson, </em>508 U.S. at 42-45, 113 S.Ct. at 1917-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">We are equally unpersuaded by Robinson\u2019s additional argument that we must ignore the robbery guideline\u2019s commentary because it is inconsistent with the extortion guideline and its commentary. Robinson contends that courts may enhance sentences under the robbery commentary in the same broad range of circumstances as they may enhance sentences under the extortion commentary. Because the robbery guideline authorizes a sentence enhancement only for an \u201cexpress threat,\u201d while the extortion guideline permits an enhancement for either \u201can express or <em>implied </em>threat,\u201d USSG \u00a7 2B3.2(b)(l) (emphasis added), Robinson argues that we must ignore the robbery commentary in order to preserve the distinction between the two guidelines. We disagree with the premise of Robinson\u2019s argument. Even an expansive interpretation of the robbery commentary would permit enhancements in a far narrower range of circumstances than those meriting enhancement under the extortion commentary. Nothing in the robbery commentary even remotely suggests that courts could enhance sentences for robbery, as they may for extortion, based on no more than an inference that \u201creasonably could be\u201d drawn from the offender\u2019s conduct, including inferences drawn from the \u201creputation\u201d of the offender. USSG \u00a7 2B3.2(b)(l) comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">We now turn to Robinson\u2019s alternative argument, advanced before the district court, that his statements were not express threats of death because he did not threaten the life of the immediate victims of the robbery\u2014 that is, the tellers he asked to hand over the money. According to Robinson, the guideline requires that a robber must put a victim of the robbery in fear for his or her own life. Since the tellers in this case were the only ones who read the notes, Robinson argues that to satisfy the guideline he must have threatened their lives. He claims that, because the notes at most threatened to shoot \u201csomebody,\u201d they did not threaten any teller\u2019s life with sufficient clarity to qualify for a sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-9\">We determine the meaning of a guideline <em>de novo, </em>giving \u201cdue deference\u201d to the district court\u2019s application of a guideline to the facts. <em>United States v. Montague, </em>40 F.3d 1251, 1252-53 (D.C.Cir.1994) (quoting <em>United States v. Kim, </em>23 F.3d 513, 517 (D.C.Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks omitted)). To the extent possible, we read the commentary and its guideline together, giving meaning to each term and treating the commentary as authoritative. <em>See Anderson, </em>942 F.2d at 612-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-10\">The guideline establishes the irreducible requirements that the robber must make a \u201cthreat,\u201d that the threat must be \u201cof death,\u201d and that such a threat must be \u201cexpress.\u201d Because we understand \u201cexpress\u201d to mean \u201cclear,\u201d to receive an enhanced sentence a defendant must clearly make a threat, and that threat must clearly be to kill. While the commentary\u2019s final sentence indicates that we must evaluate the robber\u2019s words and actions from the perspective of a reasonable person, neither the guideline nor the commentary declares how clear a threat must be. To us, however, the word \u201cexpress\u201d suggests that the robber must leave little room for doubt. Indeed, in all of the commentary\u2019s examples, a victim would very likely, not just probably, understand that the robber was making a threat and that the threat was to kill. Threats to slash a throat, pull a pin on a grenade, and even to \u201cshoot you,\u201d leave some room for hope that the robber might intend only to wound, but not much: The target would very likely believe that the robber had threatened death. The guideline thus requires that a reasonable person in the position of a victim would be highly likely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>view the robber\u2019s words or actions as a threat to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">Reminding courts of the guideline\u2019s purpose, the final sentence of the commentary imposes another requirement: that the robber\u2019s conduct be such that it \u201cwould instill in a reasonable person ... significantly greater fear than necessary to constitute the offense of robbery.\u201d This final sentence, however, leaves two issues unresolved. First, the commentary does not specify how much fear is necessary, particularly whether fear for someone <em>else\u2019s </em>life would suffice, such as the fear that could exist if a robber passes a note to a bank teller stating, \u201cIf you don\u2019t give me the money, I will shoot the young child standing by the door.\u201d The examples in the commentary do establish, however, that fear for one\u2019s <em>own </em>life is enough to trigger an enhancement. Second, the commentary does not indicate how likely it must be that a reasonable victim would feel the requisite amount of fear. The final sentence requires only that the robber\u2019s conduct must be such that it \u201cwould\u201d instill the necessary quantum of fear in a victim. Unlike \u201cexpress,\u201d the word \u201cwould\u201d only obliges courts to predict a reasonable victim\u2019s reaction; it does not specify a degree of probability. In this context, we think the most natural interpretation of the word \u201cwould\u201d is that it must be more likely than not that a reasonable victim experience the necessary level of fear.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-5\">We therefore hold that a robber makes an \u201cexpress threat of death\u201d if a reasonable person in the position of the immediate victim of the robbery would have (1) very likely believed that the robber made a threat and that the threat was to kill and (2) likely thought that his or her life was in peril, thereby experiencing \u201csignificantly greater fear\u201d than the intimidation required to commit robbery. Applying this standard to the facts of this ease, we must uphold Robinson\u2019s sentence if just one of the notes satisfies these requirements. <em>See Hunn, </em>24 F.3d at 999 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-6\">We find that Robinson\u2019s March 15th note, stating \u201cGive me one pack of 20s or I\u2019ll shoot somebody in here now,\u201d meets these criteria. As the commentary establishes, a reasonable person during a bank robbery would be highly likely to interpret a threat to \u201cshoot\u201d as a threat to \u201ckill.\u201d Robinson\u2019s note thus effectively read, \u201cGive me one pack of 20s or I\u2019ll kill somebody in here now,\u201d an unmistakable threat of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-8\">As for the level of fear, because Robinson has failed to offer any other reasons why a teller would have felt immune from harm, we consider only Robinson\u2019s argument that he failed to threaten the teller\u2019s life with sufficient clarity to put a reasonable person in those circumstances in fear for his or her life. While Robinson\u2019s statement did not threaten a teller\u2019s life as unambiguously as the example in the commentary, \u201cGive me the money or I will shoot <em>you,\u201d </em>we have little doubt that a person in the position of the teller during the March 15th robbery would have believed that Robinson had threatened him with death. Just as a reasonable teller receiving a note from a bank robber would very likely infer that \u201cshoot\u201d means \u201ckill,\u201d a reasonable teller would also probably infer that a threat to kill \u201csomebody in here\u201d referred to him. Indeed, in the highly-charged circumstances of - a robbery, we think that the threat to \u201cshoot somebody in here\u201d is practically indistinguishable from the threat to \u201cshoot you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-9\">In reaching this conclusion, we have not addressed several issues that may well arise given the commentary\u2019s lack of clarity. Because Robinson handed his March 15th note to the immediate victim of a robbery, we need not consider whether a statement conveyed to others \u2014 for example, a statement to bystanders, such as \u201cGet out of my way or I will kill you\u201d \u2014 could be an express threat of death under the guideline. <em>See United States v. Ashburn, </em>20 F.3d 1336 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 115 S.Ct. 1969, 131 L.Ed.2d 858 (1995). Nor, as we mentioned above, have we considered whether a statement threatening the life of an individual other than the person receiving the message could create the requisite fear to satisfy the commentary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-12\">We also do not decide whether the statements Robinson made during the other four robberies were express threats of death. In our view, however, each of Robinson\u2019s other notes was less likely to satisfy the require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>ments set forth above. We doubt, for example, that Robinson\u2019s mere demand to hand over a package of twenty dollar bills could qualify as an express threat of death. A reasonable person reading that statement would be unlikely to interpret it as a threat, let alone a threat to kill. We also find it difficult to imagine how such a statement would likely instill significantly greater fear than the level of intimidation required to commit a robbery. Similarly, the statement, \u201cI have a gun,\u201d does not threaten death as clearly as the March 15th note \u2014 indeed, on its face, it is not a \u201cthreat\u201d at all. Finally, we think that Robinson\u2019s two remaining notes, threatening to shoot \u201csomebody <em>out </em>here\u201d rather than \u201csomebody <em>in </em>here,\u201d would be less likely to put a teller in fear for his or her own life.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">In interpreting the robbery guideline, we recognize that we add yet one more interpretation of section 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) to the conflicting views adopted by our sister circuits. The Eleventh Circuit appears to have adopted the narrowest interpretation, defining an express threat of death as one that is \u201cdirectly or distinctly stated, and not ... implied or left to inference.\u201d <em>Canzater, </em>994 F.2d at 775; <em>see also Tuck, </em>964 F.2d at 1081. While agreeing that threats must be clear, we have concluded that express threats of death can be based on inferences. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the Eighth and Ninth Circuits have effectively replaced the \u201cexpress threat of death\u201d requirement with the commentary\u2019s final sentence, permitting enhancement whenever the robber \u201cinstill[s] in a reasonable victim \u2018significantly greater fear than that necessary to constitute an element of the offense of robbery.\u2019\u201d <em>Cadotte, </em>57 F.3d at 662 (quoting USSG \u00a7 2B3.1, comment, (n.6)); <em>see also United States v. Strandberg, </em>952 F.2d 1149, 1151 (9th Cir. 1991). In contrast, our approach requires that a robber clearly threaten death in addition to instilling a significantly greater quantum of fear than the \u201cintimidation\u201d required for a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) \u2014 a view we think is faithful to our obligation to give meaning to both the guideline and the commentary. Our analysis is closer to the approaches of the Seventh and Fourth Circuits. Like the Seventh Circuit, we require a robber to threaten death clearly, although one may do so by implication, <em>see Hunn, </em>24 F.3d at 998 (allowing enhancement when \u201ca reasonable victim could understand [the offender]^ message loud and clear as a death-threat\u201d). And, like the Fourth Circuit, we permit enhancement if a robber\u2019s conduct \u201cwould place an ordinary person in the victim\u2019s position in reasonable apprehension for his or her life,\u201d <em>see United States v. Murray, </em>65 F.3d 1161, 1167 (4th Cir.1995), although we leave open the possibility that a court may enhance a sentence even if an ordinary person would be placed in fear for someone else\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-8\">Because we reject Robinson\u2019s arguments that the guideline and its commentary are inconsistent, and because Robinson\u2019s March 15th note clearly threatened death and would have led a reasonable person receiving the note to believe that his or her life was in danger, we conclude that Robinson made an express threat of death within the meaning of section 2B3.1(b)(2)(F). We thus affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
