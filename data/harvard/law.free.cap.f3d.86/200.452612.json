The government argues that the district court did not have jurisdiction to grant Calderon\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal because it was filed several months after the seven-day filing deadline imposed by Rule 29(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-25\">The United States Supreme Court has just ruled adversely to Calderon\u2019s position, holding that district courts do not have jurisdiction to consider an untimely motion for a judgment of acquittal. <em>Carlisle v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 1460, 134 L.Ed.2d 613 (1996). Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s order granting Calderon\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal, and remand for the entry of a judgment of conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-28\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-30\">. Calderon alternatively argues in her brief that the evidence presented at tried was insufficient to support her conviction. This is an argument that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>is appropriately made on appeal after judgment and sentence are entered on the criminal docket.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
