This case involves the question of what factors a district court may consider in determining the extent of a Rule 35(b) sentence reduction. The factors considered by the district court in this case were appropriate under the rule. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-26\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b291-27\">Manella and two others were named in an indictment that included four counts charging narcotics offenses and two forfeiture counts. Manella agreed to enter a guilty plea to Count One, which charged conspiracy to import 6,000 pounds of hashish into the United States in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963 (1994). Pursuant to the plea agreement, Manella promised to cooperate with the Government in connection with the matters made the subject of the remaining charges in the indictment and other investigations. In return, the Government agreed to consider fil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>ing motions pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5K1.1 and Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Manella was sentenced in April 1992. The sentencing court adopted the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), which concluded that Manella\u2019s base offense level was 36, and that he was entitled to a two-level downward departure for acceptance of responsibility. On the Government\u2019s motion, the sentencing court also granted a three-level downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 for substantial assistance that Manella had provided prior to sentencing. The court concluded that Manella\u2019s guideline range was 108 to 135 months, and sentenced him to 120 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">After sentencing, Manella continued to help the Government with several investigations of drug trafficking and other illegal activities. The Government filed a Rule 35(b) motion in January 1993 to make the motion timely, advising the court that Manella continued to assist the Government, and requesting that an evidentiary hearing not be held until the completion of his assistance. The court denied the motion, stating that it was familiar with Manella\u2019s assistance, and that no further reduction would be granted. Manella appealed. We held that the denial of the motion was a breach of Manella\u2019s plea agreement, and remanded for a hearing before a different district judge. <em>United States v. Manella, </em>37 F.3d 635 (11th Cir.1994) (citing <em>United States v. Yesil (\u201cYesil I\u201d), </em>991 F.2d 1527 (11th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">At the Rule 35(b) hearing, a second judge heard evidence of Manella\u2019s post-sentencing cooperation, and found that Manella\u2019s eooperation was \u201csignificant, useful, truthful, reliable, timely, extensive, at risk of danger or injury to himself and his family, and of substantial benefit to the Government.\u201d (R. 1-205 at 4.) The Government recommended that Manella\u2019s sentence be reduced by sixty months. The court granted a reduction of seven months.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In determining the extent of the reduction granted, the court considered factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) and (2) (1994), including \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense of conviction and the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment.\u201d (R. 1-205 at 5.) The court also considered the leniency of the original sentence imposed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">On appeal, Manella challenges the order granting a reduction in his sentence, arguing that the court misapplied Rule 35(b) when it considered factors other than his substantial assistance. In its brief, the Government concedes, based on an unpublished opinion of this court, that the district court misapplied Rule 35(b). At oral argument, the Government invited the court to reject the opinion as unpersuasive. <em>See </em>11th Cir.R. 36-2 (unpublished opinions are not binding authority, but are persuasive). .</p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AS1\">A. Appealability</p>\n<p id=\"b292-13\">We must first determine whether we have jurisdiction over Manella\u2019s appeal, which is taken from an order granting him Rule 35(b) relief. Because we view a district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 35(b) motion as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>falling within the common sense meaning of an \u201cotherwise final sentence,\u201d this court has held that appeals from such rulings are governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (1994). <em>United States v. Chavarria-Herrara, </em>15 F.3d 1033, 1034-36 (11th Cir.1994); <em>Yesil I, </em>991 F.2d at 1531 n. 4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This statute provides for limited review of federal sentences; review is only available for certain claims by the defendant, and certain claims by the Government. A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a Rule 35(b) motion is a discretionary one from which an appeal generally will not lie under \u00a7 3742. <em>Yesil I, </em>991 F.2d at 1531. But Manella does not challenge the merits of the district court\u2019s Rule 35(b) determination. Instead, Manella claims that the court misapplied Rule 35(b) by considering factors other than his substantial assistance. Thus, Manella\u2019s claim is that his sentence was imposed in violation of law. The sentence is appeal-able under \u00a7 3742(a)(1). <em>See Chavarria-Herrara, </em>15 F.3d at 1034-35, 1037 (11th Cir. 1994) (holding that the Government could appeal a Rule 35(b) determination under \u00a7 3742(b) where the Government\u2019s claim was that the district court misapplied Rule 35(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">B. Rule 35(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Because our exercise of jurisdiction is proper, we may address the issue presented by this appeal: whether the district court properly considered factors that militated against granting a Rule 35(b) reduction in weighing the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance. The application of law to sentencing issues is subject to de novo review. <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>935 F.2d 201, 205 (11th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 1037, 112 S.Ct. 885, 116 L.Ed.2d 789 (1992).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">Rule 35(b) is the mechanism by which a district court may, on the Government\u2019s motion, reduce a sentence to reflect substantial assistance provided by the defendant to the Government after sentencing. Our interpretation of Rule 35(b) begins with the relevant portion of its text:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-16\">Reduction of Sentence for Changed Circumstances. The court, on motion of the Government made within one year after the imposition of the sentence, may reduce a sentence to reflect a defendant\u2019s subsequent, substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense, in accordance with the guidelines and policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to section 994 of title 28, United States Code____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-17\"><em>See Boca Ciega Hotel Inc. v. Bouchard Transp. Co., </em>51 F.3d 235, 237 (11th Cir.1995) (stating that the interpretation of a statute begins with its text).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>In <em>Chavarria-Herrara, </em>we held that the district court misapplied Rule 35(b) when it granted a reduction that was based in part on factors other than the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance, including the defendant\u2019s first-time offender status, relative culpability, and good prison behavior. 15 F.3d at 1037; <em>see United States v. Aponte, </em>36 F.3d 1050, 1051 (11th Cir.1994) (applying the rule from <em>Chavarria-Herrara </em>in the context of a downward departure pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e)). Our decision in <em>Chavarria-Herrara </em>was grounded in the language of the rule: \u201cThe plain language of Rule 35(b) indicates that the reduction shall reflect the assistance of the defendant; it does not mention any other factor that may be considered.\u201d 15 F.3d at 1037.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Manella argues that, under <em>Chavarria-Herrara, </em>the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance is the sole factor that the district court may consider on a Rule 35(b) motion. He contends that the court erred when it considered other factors that militated against a reduction in his case. But the facts in <em>Chavarria-Herrara </em>are distinguishable from this case. In <em>Chavarria-Herrara, </em>the district court\u2019s <em>reduction </em>of a sentence was based on factors other than cooperation. In Manella\u2019s case, the district court\u2019s <em>refusal to reduce </em>a sentence by the requested amount was based on factors other than cooperation. While relevant to our reading of Rule 35(b), <em>Chavarria-Herrara </em>does not control the issue presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Manella also cites an unpublished opinion of this court in support of his reading of Rule 35(b). This court is not bound by its unpublished opinions, but they are persuasive authority. 11th Cir.R. 36-2. In <em>United States v. Yesil (\u201cYesil II\u201d), </em>as in Manella\u2019s case, the case was remanded to a second district judge for a Rule 35(b) evidentiary hearing. No. 93-2499, unpublished at 2-3, 48 F.3d 534 (11th Cir. Feb. 8, 1995). At the Rule 35(b) hearing, the second judge concluded that the defendants\u2019 sentences were \u201cexceedingly lenient,\u201d and took this factor into account in determining the extent of the substantial assistance reduction granted. On appeal, we reversed and remanded with instructions for the district court to consider only the defendants\u2019 substantial assistance in making the Rule 35(b) determination. <em>Id. </em>at 4 (citing <em>Chavarridr-Herrara, </em>15 F.3d at 1037).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Manella is correct that he prevails if we adopt the holding in <em>Yesil II, </em>but we decline to do so. A careful reading of Rule 35(b) reveals that the text does not prohibit the consideration of any factor other than the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance. The rule states that \u201c[t]he court ... may reduce a sentence to reflect a defendant\u2019s subsequent, substantial assistance____\u201d Under this language, the only factor that may militate <em>in favor of </em>a Rule 35(b) reduction is the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance. Nothing in the text of the rule purports to limit what factors may militate <em>against </em>granting a Rule 35(b) reduction. Similarly, the rule does not limit the factors that may militate in favor of granting a smaller reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">The reading of Rule 35(b) urged by Manella is inconsistent with the principle that the district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a Rule 35(b) motion is discretionary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is true that under the current rule, the exercise of that discretion is limited by the requirement that the defendant be rewarded, if at all, only for substantial assistance. <em>Chavarria-Herrara, </em>15 F.3d at 1037. But a reading of the rule that requires the district court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>consider substantial assistance in isolation from any other factor leaves too little discretion for the court to exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">In this case, the district court weighed several factors against Manella\u2019s substantial assistance, including the seriousness of the offense and the need for the sentence imposed to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment. The district court\u2019s consideration of these factors was based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, which lists factors that the court is required to consider when imposing a sentence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rule 35(b) does not prohibit the consideration of these factors in deciding to what extent a defendant\u2019s sentence should be reduced for substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">. United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 (Nov.1987). Substantial assistance that is provided by the defendant prior to sentencing may serve as the basis for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 at sentencing. Substantial assistance provided after sentencing may serve as the basis for a sentence reduction under Rule 35(b). <em>United States v.

The second judge noted that the first judge considered Manella's sentence to be lenient. The second judge pointed to the first judge's statement that Manella was \"one of the most culpable people involved in this case, and because you did come forward, I want you to realize that you're getting a real break, that under normal circumstances you\u2019d be spending probably the rest of your life in jail for your culpability in this case.

No. 98-473 \u00a7 215(b), 98 Stat. 1837, 2015. Under former Rule 35(b), the district court enjoyed great discretion in deciding whether to reduce a sentence. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>711 F.2d 159, 160 (11th Cir.1983). In some respects, the district cotut has less discretion under the revised rule. For example, the former rule allowed the district court to reduce a sentence within 120 days of its imposition, even in the absence of motion from either party. Under the revised rule, the district court may only reduce a sentence on the Govemment's motion. <em>Howard, </em>902 F.2d at 897. Still, even after the 1986 amendment, the district court retains a great degree of discretion in deciding whether to grant or deny the Government's Rule 35(b) motion. <em>Compare Aponte, </em>36 F.3d at 1052 (11th Cir.1994) (according the same interpretation to Rule 35(b) and the statute authorizing substantial assistance departures at sentencing) <em>with United States v.
