(the \u201cAgency\u201d). Extensive litigation has ensued. In this ease, the individual purchasers, the Bank, and the Agency (collectively, the \u201cPurchasers\u201d) sued the Jubies, asserting contract claims and common law and statutory fraud claims arising out of allegedly undisclosed bad loans, insider loans, and other financial problems that have plagued the Bank since its purchase. The Jubies counterclaimed for breach of Jerry Jubie\u2019s Retirement Agreement with the Bank. Following a lengthy trial, the jury returned a special verdict awarding the Purchasers $106,218 on some of their claims, awarding them no damages on their claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961 <em>el seq. </em>(\u201cRICO\u201d), rejecting their remaining claims, and awarding the Jubies $292,947 on their Retirement Agreement counterclaim. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entered judgment on the jury verdict, denied the Purchasers\u2019 post-trial motions, and awarded them $45,000 in attorney\u2019s fees under state law. The Purchasers appeal the damage and fee awards. We modify the Retirement Agreement award and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-20\">I. Background.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-21\">Jerry Jubie was President and Chairman of the Board of the Bank for nearly twenty years. His wife Irene served as Secretary. They owned all the Agency\u2019s stock, thereby controlling some 95% of the Bank\u2019s outstanding stock. By early 1987, the Bank was in trouble and Jerry Jubie was in poor health. The Bank\u2019s federal regulator, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), was investigating its financial soundness and management quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-22\">In March 1987, the Bank\u2019s board of directors rewarded Jerry Jubie\u2019s long tenure with a Retirement Agreement, promising retirement payments of $1500 per month for life commencing October 1987, plus continuing group life and health insurance benefits. The Agreement was intended to pave the way for a management change and sale of the Bank. On October 9, 1987, Jerry and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Irene Jubie as sellers and Schilling and Gravelle as buyers entered into a Purchase Agreement providing that, at the end of that month, buyers would purchase the Agency\u2019s stock at a price equal to 95% of the book value of the Bank\u2019s stock, subject to regulatory approvals. The Purchase Agreement granted buyers \u201caccess to all bank records.\u201d It provided that the Retirement Agreement \u201cshall remain in full force and binding on the bank,\u201d subject to specific modifications, such as a provision that, after the sale, Jubie would reimburse the Bank for the cost of his group life and health insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Regulatory approvals proved to be a problem. On November 30, Jerry Jubie agreed to entry of an FDIC order prohibiting him from serving as a director or officer of any bank without FDIC approval. The FDIC issued this order on February 4, 1988, effective ten days later. More significantly, on February 1,1988, the FDIC issued a fifteen-page cease and desist Order against the Bank, imposing onerous management, equity capital, loan collection, and bad loan charge-off restrictions. At this time, the Jubies still owned the Bank, but the buyers held two positions on its board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">On July 28, 1988, an Addendum to the Purchase Agreement was signed by the Jubies and by all four individual purchasers fixing the purchase price at $528,582, based upon 95% of the book value of the Bank\u2019s stock at closing. The Jubies now guaranteed portions of four troubled loans to outsiders, and made specific guarantees regarding numerous outstanding loans to members of the Jubie family. All of these guarantees were secured by the payments owed Jubie under the Retirement Agreement. With this Addendum in place, the Purchase Agreement closed on August 9,1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Some months after the purchase, the buyers commenced an internal investigation at the Bank and allegedly discovered many bad loans, concealed losses, and other irregular transactions. Shortly thereafter, the Bank ceased making payments under the Retirement Agreement. The Purchasers then commenced this action, alleging, in essence, that the Jubies had criminally mismanaged the Bank and then had \u201ccooked\u201d the Bank\u2019s books at closing, concealing numerous insider and other bad loans. Claiming some $350,-000 in damages, the Purchasers asserted causes of action for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, common law fraud, state and federal statutory fraud, and violations of RICO. The Jubies counterclaimed for breach of the Retirement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">The ease was submitted to the jury with an extensive special verdict form. The jury found that the Jubies breached fiduciary duties to the Bank, breached the Purchase Agreement, and violated two Minnesota statutes, Minn.Stat. \u00a7 80A.01 (fraud in connection with the sale of securities) and Minn. Stat. \u00a7 325F.69 (consumer fraud). It awarded damages of $106,218 on these claims. The jury also found RICO .violations but awarded no damages on the RICO claims. It found that the Jubies had not violated S.E.C. Rule 10b-5 nor committed common law fraud. Finally, the jury awarded the Jubies $292,947 in present and future damages on their Retirement Agreement counterclaim. The district court then awarded the Purchasers $45,000 in attorney\u2019s fees under the Minnesota fraud statutes, denied all other post-trial motions, and entered judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict. Only the Purchasers appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">II. The Purchasers\u2019 Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">The Purchasers first argue that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law or a new trial on the issue of RICO damages. They rely upon <em>Rosario v. Livaditis, </em>963 F.2d 1013, 1020-21 (7th Cir.1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 1051, 113 S.Ct. 972, 122 L.Ed.2d 127 (1993). In that case, a jury awarded $600,000 damages for violations of the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act but zero damages for RICO violations that were \u201csupported by identical facts,\u201d 963 F.2d at 1021. Because of the complete factual overlap, the Seventh Circuit reversed the verdict as contrary to law and remanded for a new trial on RICO damages. <em>Accord Video Int\u2019l Prod., Inc. v. Warner-Amex Cable Commun., Inc., </em>858 F.2d 1075, 1085-86 (5th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1047, 109 S.Ct. 1955, 104 L.Ed.2d 424, <em>and </em>491 U.S. 906, 109 S.Ct. 3189, 105 L.Ed.2d 697 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>This case is very different. The Purchasers presented a multitude of claims covering a wide variety of transactions. The jury made specific findings that the Jubies\u2019 RICO violations did not proximately cause the Purchasers damage. Our standard of review is clear: \u201cWhere there is a view of the case that makes the jury\u2019s answers to special interrogatories consistent, they must be resolved that way.\u201d <em>Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Ellerman Lines, Ltd., </em>369 U.S. 355, 364, 82 S.Ct. 780, 786, 7 L.Ed.2d 798 (1962). <em>See also Transport Ins. Co. v. Chrysler Corp., </em>71 F.3d 720, 722-23 (8th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Like the district court, we have no difficulty reconciling the jury\u2019s verdict on RICO damages with the evidence and its other findings. The jury found that the Jubies breached fiduciary duties and violated RICO while they were in control of the Bank. Indeed, the FDIC\u2019s regulatoiy findings strongly suggested that Jerry Jubie had seriously mismanaged the Bank. But the jury also rejected the Purchasers\u2019 common law fraud and 10b-5 claims, which required a finding of reasonable reliance by the Bank\u2019s subsequent purchasers. Consistent with these findings, the jurors doubtless concluded that pre-purchase RICO violations did not proximately cause damage to those who purchased the Bank because, with many months of prepurchase access to the Bank\u2019s books and records and knowledge of the FDIC cease and desist Order, they should have known of this misconduct and adjusted the purchase price accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The Purchasers next argue that they deserve a new trial because the jury\u2019s damage award was grossly inadequate. \u201cInadequacy of a verdict is a matter for the trial court, and we will not reverse a verdict on these grounds unless there has been plain injustice or a monstrous or shocking result.\u201d <em>Ford v. El Dorado &amp; Wesson R.R., </em>848 F.2d 911, 914 (8th Cir.1988). After careful review of the record, we conclude that the Purchasers cannot meet this rigorous standard. Virtually every aspect of this complex case was hotly contested at trial, particularly the Purchasers\u2019 damage claims that the Jubies successfully concealed numerous fraudulent or otherwise unsound pre-purchase transactions. The jury accepted some of these contentions and rejected others, as the conflicting evidence permitted. We agree with the district court that substantial evidence supports the verdict and a new trial is not required to prevent a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">III. The Jubies\u2019 Counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">The Purchasers launch many attacks on the Jubies\u2019 substantial recovery under the Retirement Agreement. One is sound; the rest require little discussion. They first argue that the district court erred in refusing to void the Retirement Agreement because of the Jubies\u2019 statutory fraud and RICO violations. The district court rejected this contention because the Purchasers did not seek to rescind the Purchase Agreement. Instead, they affirmed the transaction, including the Bank\u2019s obligations under the Retirement Agreement, and sued to recover the benefit of their bargain. We agree. <em>See, e.g., </em>Restatement of Contracts 2d \u00a7 380(2) (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">The Purchasers alternatively argue that their performance under the Retirement Agreement is excused by the jury\u2019s findings that the Jubies breached the Purchase Agreement. The district court rejected this \u201cnovel theory\u201d on the ground that the Purchasers, having affirmed the contract, \u201care in no better position than the [Jubies] to be excused from the performance of their remaining contractual obligations.\u201d Again, we agree. Though specifically ratified in the Purchase Agreement, the Retirement Agreement was an independent covenant which the Jubies may enforce at the same time the Purchasers obtain the full benefit of their bargain under the Purchase Agreement. <em>See </em>17A C.J.S. <em>Contracts </em>\u00a7\u00a7 344, 453 at 331-33, 571-72; <em>McNeal-Edwards Co. v. Frank L. Young Co., </em>51 F.2d 699, 701 (1st Cir.1931). The Purchasers\u2019 further contention that they did not breach the Retirement Agreement by ceasing to make monthly retirement payments flies in the face of the trial evidence construed in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">That brings us to the most difficult issue in the case, whether the Jubies may recover lump-sum future damages under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Retirement Agreement that contains no acceleration clause. Historically, contracts for installment payments of money have been excluded from, the general rule that anticipatory repudiation of a contract permits the aggrieved party to sue for damages resulting from future as well as past non-performance. As the Supreme Court said in <em>Roehm v. Horst, </em>178 U.S. 1, 17-18, 20 S.Ct. 780, 786-87, 44 L.Ed. 953 (1900):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-4\">In the case of an ordinary money contract, such as a promissory note, or a bond, the consideration has passed; there are no mutual obligations; and cases of that sort do not fall within the reason of the [anticipatory repudiation] rule---- [M]oney contracts, pure and simple, stand on a different footing from executory contracts for the purchase and sale of goods----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">This principle is recognized in the Restatement of Contracts 2d \u00a7 243(3). While some jurisdictions may have abandoned it, Minnesota has not. In <em>Palmer v. Watson Constr. Co., </em>265 Minn. 195, 121 N.W.2d 62, 67 (1963), the Minnesota Supreme Court declared, \u201cWe are committed in this state ... to the rule that nonpayment of installment obligations is not in and of itself such prevention of performance as will make possible suit for loss of profits.\u201d In <em>Sheet Metal Workers Local No. 76 Credit Union v. Hufnagle, </em>295 N.W.2d 259, 263 (Minn.1980), after quoting the above portion of <em>Palmer, </em>the Court said that perhaps \u201cthe exclusion of installment payment obligations from the anticipatory breach doctrine should be reconsidered,\u201d but it declined to reach that issue because there had been no unequivocal repudiation of the promissory note in question, and because Minnesota law, including Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7 1-208, allows a creditor to solve \u201cthe problem created by the exclusion of installment payment contracts\u201d from the anticipatory repudiation doctrine by including an acceleration clause in the installment payment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">In meeting our obligation under <em>Erie </em>to predict the development of Minnesota law, the temptation is to approach this issue in formulaic terms \u2014 would the Minnesota Supreme Court now apply the anticipatory repudiation doctrine to all types of contracts, or would it continue to recognize an exception for installment payment contracts. However, we think that greater light is shed on the issue by taking Justice Cardozo\u2019s rather different approach in the <em>pre-Erie </em>ease of <em>New York Life Ins. Co. v. Viglas, </em>297 U.S. 672, 679-81, 56 S.Ct. 615, 617-19, 80 L.Ed. 971 (1936):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-10\">There may be times when justice requires that irrespective of repudiation or abandonment the sufferer from the breach shall be relieved of a duty to treat the contract as subsisting or to hold himself in readiness to perform it in the future. Generally this is so where the contract is a bilateral one with continuing obligations, as where a manufacturer has undertaken to deliver merchandise in instalments____ On the other hand, a party to a contract who has no longer any obligation of performance on his side but is in the position of an annuitant or a creditor exacting payment from a debtor, may be compelled to wait for the instalments as they severally mature, just as a landlord may not accelerate the rent for the residue of the term because the rent is in default for a month or for a year____ The root of any valid distinction is not in the difference between money and merchandise or ... services. What counts decisively is the relation between the maintenance of the contract and the frustration of the ends it was expected to subserve. The ascertainment of this relation calls for something more than the mechanical application of a uniform formula.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">(citations omitted). We read the Minnesota Supreme Court\u2019s discussion in <em>Hufnagle </em>as signaling that it would follow this more discriminating approach to the future damages issue in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-16\">Under this approach, we conclude that the award of future damages cannot stand. The Retirement Agreement granted Jerry Jubie monthly payments for life as a mechanism to induce his retirement from active management and to promote sale of the Bank, as the FDIC was no doubt urging. The Bank stopped making monthly payments not because of insolvency or other impossibility, but because the Purchasers believed that Jubie\u2019s misconduct disentitled him to further retirement benefits. The Purchasers were wrong, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>and the Bank therefore owes Jubie all unpaid installments, with prejudgment interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the Bank is not disabled from meeting its future Retirement Agreement obligations. And replacing fixed monthly future obligations with a large lump-sum judgment \u25a0will adversely impact a struggling financial institution and seems entirely contrary to the original purposes of the Retirement Agreement. Finally, any risk of multiple lawsuits can be reduced, if not eliminated, by a judgment that declares valid, or even specifically enforces, future installment obligations. <em>See </em>4 <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 969, at 893; Restatement of Contracts 2d \u00a7\u00a7 243 comment d, 359(2) &amp; comment b.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">IV. Attorney\u2019s Fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Finally, the Purchasers argue that the district court\u2019s $45,000 attorney\u2019s fee award for the Minnesota statutory violations is inadequate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Based upon specific findings, the court awarded only a portion of the requested $159,820.25 in fees and $13,888.69 in costs because: 1) the Purchasers enjoyed only limited success; 2) they submitted inadequate billing records that did not break out time spent defending the Jubies\u2019 counterclaim; and 3) there was unnecessary and redundant billing.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">In awarding fees under these statutes, Minnesota courts consider the results obtained critical to the award, particularly where a party has prevailed only on some claims or has been awarded only a fraction of the desired relief. <em>Specialized Tours, Inc. v. Hagen, </em>392 N.W.2d 520, 542 (Minn.1986), citing <em>Hensley v. Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 434-36, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1940-41, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). Fee requests are also reduced for \u201chours not reasonably expended.\u201d <em>Specialized Tours, </em>392 N.W.2d at 542, citing <em>Hensley. </em>Having carefully reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s detailed reasons for reducing the fee award in light of the Purchasers\u2019 limited success, we conclude that the fee award was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-16\">V. Conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-17\">The portion of the district court\u2019s judgment awarding damages on the Retirement Agreement counterclaim is reversed and the case is remanded with directions to enter an amended judgment awarding compensatory damages (including interest) for all past-due installments plus an appropriate decree regarding future retirement installment obligations. The judgment of the district court is in all other respects affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-23\">. The Honorable RAYMOND L.

The Purchasers also argue that any award under the Retirement Agreement is subject to offsets under the Jubies\u2019 bad loan guarantees in the Purchase Agreement. We disagree.
