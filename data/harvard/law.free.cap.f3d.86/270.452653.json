We retained jurisdiction of this appeal pending determination of the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-24\">We certified this question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Does a showing that a plaintiff, who was the victim of childhood sexual abuse, suffered repressed memory as a result of a defendant\u2019s threats of violence and generally violent nature, her witnessing acts of violence by the defendant, and her fear of the defendant, provide a basis for the application of equitable estoppel so as effectively to toll the statute of limitations during the period that the plaintiffs memories remain repressed?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine of April 8, 1996, has answered this question in the negative, stating that if Kathleen suffered repressed memory as a result of the previously imposed violent conduct, as she claims, this does not at this time equitably estop Luke from invoking the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Accordingly, we <em>affirm </em>the order granting summary judgment in favor of Luke Nuccio on the basis that the Maine statute of limitations barred Kathleen Nuccio\u2019s suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
