The principal issue on appeal is whether the district court (Jose A. Cabranes, <em>then-Chief </em>Judge) should have suppressed Poindexter\u2019s post-arrest inculpatory statements in light of the government\u2019s delay in presenting him before a magistrate judge or other judicial officer. Poindexter also contends that Judge Cabranes erred in denying his motion to suppress his pre-arrest statement. Poindexter claims that Judge Burns, to whom this case was transferred, erred in denying his pre-trial motion to produce an original audio tape; admitting into evidence at trial a copy of the court\u2019s order extending authorization for the interception of wire communications; and precluding him from offering the testimony of a trial witness at sentencing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">During the late summer and early fall of 1993, the New Haven Drug Gang Task Force (the \u201cTask Force\u201d), a joint federal and state law enforcement task force comprised of local police officers and federal special agents, investigated a major cocaine distribution ring operated by the defendants in the western sections of New Haven, Connecticut. As part of the investigation, on October 29,1993, Special Agent Michael Wardrop, Detective John Bashta, and Sergeant William White of the New Haven Police Department executed a search warrant at Poindexter\u2019s home at 73 Orchard Place, New Haven. During the search, Poindexter was handcuffed and kept in the kitchen for between fifteen and twenty minutes. The agents then took him to an upstairs bedroom where the handcuffs were removed. After being given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings, Poindexter waived in writing his right to remain silent and to consult with an attorney. Poindexter then gave a taped statement in which he admitted involvement with the cocaine distribution scheme. Poindexter was released from custody without being charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">On March 2, 1994, a federal grand juiy returned an indictment charging Poindexter and several others in various counts with conspiracy and substantive cocaine possession and distribution violations. Although most of the defendants named in the indictment were arrested promptly, Poindexter could not be located. On the afternoon of Saturday, March 19, 1994, four members of the Task Force arrested Poindexter pursuant to a federal arrest warrant based on the indictment. None of the officers questioned Poindexter at the time of his arrest. Poindexter was taken to the State of Connecticut Department of Correction lockup at the New Haven Police Department. Later that day, Special Agent Williams informed an Assistant United States Attorney of Poindexter\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">Despite the availability of a magistrate judge during the weekend, Poindexter was not brought before a judicial officer until 10:30 a.m. on Monday, March 21, 1994. The previous morning, Sunday, March 20, 1994, Poindexter contacted corrections staff and asked to speak with members of the Task Force. Two hours later, Poindexter met with Detective Bashta, Detective David Kendall, and Special Agent Wardrop. Poindexter was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and signed a waiver of rights form. During this interview, Poindexter made several statements implicating himself and several co-defendants in the drug conspiracy scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">On Januaiy 18, 1995, following a five-day trial at which Poindexter\u2019s statements from October 29, 1993 and March 20, 1994 were received in evidence, the jury returned a guilty verdict. On April 13,1995, Poindexter was sentenced principally to a term of 360 months of incarceration, to be served consecutive to a state sentence that he was serving at the time. Judgment was entered accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aa1\">I. <em>Motion to Suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-11\">Findings of fact by the district court are reviewed on appeal for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cropper, </em>42 F.3d 755, 758 (2d Cir.1994). In reviewing rulings on motions to suppress, the evidence before the district court is viewed in the light most favorable to the government, <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>5 F.3d 628, 633 (2d Cir.1993), and factual findings of the court are to be disturbed only where they are clearly erroneous, <em>id. </em>at 632; <em>United States v. Brown, </em>52 F.3d 415, 420 (2d Cir.1995), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 754, 133 L.Ed.2d 701 (1996). We review questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>968 F.2d 216, 221 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 980, 113 S.Ct. 480, 121 L.Ed.2d 385 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">A. <em>October 29, 1993 statement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-16\">Poindexter contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress his pre-arrest statement of October 29, 1993. We reject Poindexter\u2019s.claim that the statement was the fruit of an illegal seizure of his person by officers of the Task Force. As the officers arrived to execute the warrant, Poindexter was outside the residence and was entering a vehicle. It was permissible for the officers to require Poin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>dexter to reenter Ms home and to detain him while they conducted a search of the premises pursuant to a valid search warrant. <em>See Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 705, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 2595-96, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981); <em>Rivera v. United States, </em>928 F.2d 592, 606 (2d Cir.1991). It was also prudent for the officers <em>to </em>handcuff Poindexter until they could be certain that the situation was safe. Once the residence had been secured, the officers removed the handcuffs. We find that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Poindexter\u2019s subsequent statement, given after he had been advised of Ms <em>Miranda </em>rights, was knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Caba, </em>955 F.2d 182, 185 (2d Cir.) (waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights valid only if product of knowing and voluntary choice), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 843, 113 S.Ct. 130, 121 L.Ed.2d 84 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">B. <em>March 20, 199k Statement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Poindexter\u2019s strongest claim is that the district court should have suppressed Ms post-arrest statement of March 20, 1994. Poindexter argues that tMs statement was obtained by the government during an unreasonable delay between Ms March 19 arrest and his March 21 presentment before a magistrate judge for arraignment. Although we are troubled by the delay in Poindexter\u2019s arraignment, we affirm because Ms statement was wholly voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">At the suppression hearing, the district court learned that the arresting officers had believed Poindexter was in state custody. Their reasoning was that Poindexter\u2019s arrest on a federal warrant was also a violation of Ms state supervised home release status on a prior state conviction, wMch would have authorized Ms detention by the state. In particular, one officer testified that because a \u201cDo Not Release\u201d sticker was put on Poindexter\u2019s file so that he would be held without bond pending the next state hearing for the violation, the Task Force believed that there was no duty to arraign him promptly. At the conclusion of the hearing, the district court found that the government did not purposefully delay bringing Poindexter before a judicial officer. The district court additionally found that Poindexter knowingly and voluntarily waived Ms <em>Miranda </em>rights and that his statements were made knowingly and voluntarily and were not the product of \u201ccoercive interrogation.\u201d Ultimately,' the district court demed the motion to suppress on the ground that Poindexter\u2019s arrest and detention were reasonable \u201cbased on the defendant\u2019s status as a state prisoner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Poindexter maintains that the government\u2019s failure promptly to present him for arraignment violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 5(a), wMch states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">[A]n officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint or any person making an arrest without a warrant shall take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge or, if a federal magistrate judge is not reasonably available, before a state or local judicial officer authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3041.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">However, Rule 5(a) is inapplicable because it applies only where the arrest was made either without a warrant or under a warrant issued upon a complaint, and Poindexter\u2019s arrest was made under a federal warrant issued upon indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Although not cited by either party, Fed. R.Crim.P. 9(c)(1) applies to the present case. TMs provision, applicable to persons arrested pursuant to an arrest warrant, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-12\">The officer executing the warrant shall bring the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available federal magistrate judge or, in the event that a federal magistrate judge is not reasonably available, before a state or local judicial officer authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3041.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-13\">Nevertheless, the standards governing \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d are identical under Rules 9(c)(1) and 5(a). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 9, advisory committee\u2019s note (1982 amendment) (\u201cThe amendment of subdivision (e) conforms Rule 9 to the comparable provisions in Rules 4(d)(4) and 5(a) concerning return of the warrant.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Iribe, </em>11 F.3d 1553, 1558 (10th Cir.1993) (applying the same standard for Rule 9(c)(1) and Rule 5(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The admissibility of confessions in federal criminal prosecutions is governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3501. Under \u00a7 3501(c), discussed at length by the parties, a district court has the discretion to suppress a confession if the delay between arrest and presentment is greater than six hours and is found by the court to be unreasonable under the circumstances. <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>733 F.2d 1026, 1030 (2d Cir.1984). Section 3501(c) provides that a confession shall not be inadmissible solely because of delay in bringing the defendant before a judicial officer if \u201csuch confession was made or given by such person within six hours immediately following his arrest or other detention.\u201d The government is relieved from the six-hour time limitation only if the pre-arraignment delay is \u201creasonable considering the means of transportation and the distance to be traveled to the nearest available [judicial officer].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">The requirements of \u00a7 3501 are implicated only in the case of a prisoner who is arrested or detained for a federal crime and, thus, is in federal detention at the time the challenged statement is made. <em>United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 114 S.Ct. 1599, 1604, 128 L.Ed.2d 319 (1994). In this case, the district court held that \u00a7 3501(e) did not apply on the basis of its conclusion that Poindexter was in \u201cstate custody.\u201d However, the district court\u2019s conclusion was mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">In <em>Alvarez-Sanchez, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 3501(e) does not apply to statements made by a person who is being held solely on state charges, but it did not consider the possibility of a defendant being held simultaneously on both state and federal charges. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court stated: \u201cIf a person is arrested and held on a federal charge by \u2018any\u2019 law enforcement officer \u2014 federal, state, or local \u2014 that person is under \u2018arrest or other detention\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 3501(c) and its 6-hour safe harbor period.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The touchstone of determining the applicability of \u00a7 3501(c), therefore, is the governmental source of the charge underlying the arrest, not the law enforcement agency involved. Here, there is no dispute that Poindexter was initially arrested on federal narcotics charges. Federal officials were consequently under a duty to present him before a federal magistrate judge, and the district court\u2019s factual finding that the government was relieved of its duty under \u00a7 3501(c) because he was held in \u201cstate custody\u201d was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">We conclude, however, that \u00a7 3501(c) is inapplicable for a different reason. Section 3501(d) states that \u201c[n]othing contained in [\u00a7 3501] shall bar the admission in evidence of any confession made or given voluntarily by any person to any other person without interrogation.\u201d We have held that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 3501(c) that might bar confessions based on arraignment delay do not apply to voluntary inculpatory statements. We are guided by our decision in <em>United States v. Colon, </em>835 F.2d 27 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>485 U.S. 980, 108 S.Ct. 1279, 99 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988), in which the defendant similarly was arrested on federal charges on Saturday at 1:30 a.m. but not taken to the federal courthouse until 10:30 a.m. on Monday. During the ride to the courthouse, the defendant made an inculpatory statement in response to an agent\u2019s question. The district court admitted the defendant\u2019s statement on the ground that the weekend delay was reasonable. We affirmed the district court on the ground that, whatever the reasonableness of the delay, inculpatory statements that are voluntarily made and that are not the subject of interrogation are exempted from the procedural requirements of \u00a7 3501(c) by \u00a7 3501(d). <em>Id. </em>at 30. So, too, in this case, even if the delay in arraignment was unreasonable, Poindexter\u2019s statement is not ex-cludable under \u00a7 3501(c) if it was voluntarily given without interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">That Poindexter\u2019s March 20 statements were voluntarily given without interrogation is incontrovertible. He initiated contact with the agents by asking the correction officers to contact the New Haven Police because he wished to speak with the law enforcement officers. During the interview, Poindexter waived his rights and made the inculpatory statements. It is plain to us that the inculpatory statements were made at Poindexter\u2019s behest and were not the product of interrogation in the sense that they were solicited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>from an unwilling participant. Therefore, because the requirements of \u00a7 3501(d) were satisfied, \u00a7 3501(c) is inapplicable and the district court\u2019s denial of Poindexter\u2019s motion to suppress this post-arrest statement was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">We conclude on a note of caution, however. In <em>Colon </em>we specifically warned the government about its continuing practice of unnecessarily delaying arraignments, stating that \u201cit [is] inevitable that if the indifference to Rule 5(a) displayed in this case is routine practice, it will lead to the future exclusion of evidence.\u201d <em>Colon, </em>835 F.2d at 31. Nearly ten years later, it appears the government has not fully heeded our warning. We take this opportunity to reiterate our concern as to the apparent indifference on the part of some in the government to taking arrested persons before a magistrate judge \u201cwithout unnecessary delay.\u201d Under the circumstances of the present ease, had the defendant confessed as a result of interrogation more than six hours after he was arrested, it would have been within the district court\u2019s discretion to exclude the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">II. <em>Remaining Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">Poindexter contends that the district court improperly admitted into evidence a copy of its order authorizing the continuation of a government wiretap because the order noted that there was probable cause to believe Poindexter was committing violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the order\u2019s probative value in laying a foundation for the wiretap evidence outweighed any prejudicial effect the order might have had. <em>See United States v. Gelzer, </em>50 F.3d 1133, 1139 (2d Cir.1995); Fed.R.Evid. 403. Moreover, any error in admitting the exhibit was harmless given the balance of the evidence. <em>See Ianniello v. United States, </em>10 F.3d 59, 64 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">Poindexter also claims that the district court erroneously denied his request for production of the original audio tape of Poindexter\u2019s October 29 statements. Poindexter made his request less than one month before jury selection was to begin, more than thirteen months after the taped statements were made, and approximately five months after a suppression hearing at which the authenticity of the tapes was established. Given the timing of Poindexter\u2019s request, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Poindexter\u2019s motion for production. <em>See United States v. Beverly, </em>5 F.3d 633, 641 (2d Cir. 1993). Furthermore, even assuming error, the denial of the motion did not cause Poindexter substantial prejudice. See <em>United States v. Thai, </em>29 F.3d 785, 804 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 115 S.Ct. 456, 130 L.Ed.2d 364 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">Finally, Poindexter challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to allow him to call Special Agent Michael Wardrop as a witness at Poindexter\u2019s sentencing hearing for the purpose of establishing that Wardrop\u2019s trial testimony was \u201cmaterially untrue.\u201d A defendant has no absolute right to present witnesses or to receive a full evidentiary hearing at sentencing. <em>United States v. Prescott, </em>920 F.2d 139, 143 (2d Cir.1990). In any event, Poindexter cross-examined Wardrop at trial, and the jury chose to credit Wardrop\u2019s testimony. A sentencing hearing is not the proper forum to re-litigate factual issues resolved at trial. Accordingly, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">We affirm Poindexter\u2019s judgment of conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
