FCC, </em>990 F.2d 1351 (D.C.Cir.1993) <em>(\u201cMcElroy F), </em>the court ordered the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) to reinstate <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appellants\u2019 applications for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>licenses to provide cellular telephone service in Los Angeles and Minneapolis. Two years later, the Commission decided that the reinstated applicants would have to enter a lottery with as many as 500 other applicants for the same licenses. Because the record demonstrates that other applicants had fair notice of a sixty-day deadline for filing competing applications, yet did not apply until more than four years after appellants did, we conclude that the Commission erred and we again remand the case to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Appellants seek so-called \u201cunserved-area\u201d licenses. When the Commission first established rules for licensing cellular radiotelephone services, it divided the nation into separate geographic markets, known as metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and rural service areas (RSAs), and established two frequency blocks for each market (block A for wireline services and block B for nonwireline services). An applicant could designate a cellular geographic service area (CGSA), encompassing at least 75% of the geographic market, and was required to serve at least 75% of its designated CGSA. The Commission adopted a streamlined comparative-hearing process for the thirty largest MSAs and a lottery process for the other markets. <em>Cellular Communications Systems, </em>86 F.C.C.2d 469 (1981), <em>order on reconsideration, </em>89 F.C.C.2d 58, <em>order on further reconsideration, </em>90 F.C.C.2d 571 (1982); <em>Cellular Lottery Rulemaking, </em>98 F.C.C.2d 175 (1984), <em>order on reconsideration, </em>101 F.C.C.2d 577, <em>order on further reconsideration, </em>59 Rad.

In 1987, the Commission adopted a rule providing that each initial licensee could \u201cfill in\u201d unserved areas within its CGSA without being subject to competing applications for five years from the date of the first authorization in that market (changed in 1989 to the date of the particular licensee\u2019s authorization). <em>Rural Cellular Service, </em>Second Report and Order, 2 F.C.C.

Public Notice, Report No. CL-88-154 (Aug. 29,1988). The first page of the notice bore a preprinted letterhead entitled \u201cPublic Notice\u201d and the Commission\u2019s address. The typewritten heading read: \u201cCOMMON CARRIER PUBLIC CELLULAR RADIO SERVICE INFORMATION.\u201d Below that were the date and a report number, followed by the underlined word \u201cInformative.\u201d Then came a series of short announcements regarding various applications, each preceded by a file number. MeElroy\u2019s notice appeared on the fourth page:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">File No. 01758-CL-MP-88</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4L\">MeElroy Electronics Corporation Station NEW</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">Market 2B \u2014 Los Angeles MSA</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFq_\">An application for a Construction Permit for a new Station for McElroy Electronics Corporation for the Los Angeles M.S.A. \u00a7 has been filed with the Commission. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The application, File No. 01758-CL-MP-88 proposes to serve unserved areas in the Los Angeles M.S.A. \u00a7 on the block B frequencies under Section 22.31(a)(l)(i) of the rules.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">(underlining in original). After the last listing, the notice stated: \u201cInterested persons will have thirty (30) days from the date of this notice to submit Comments. Replies may be filed within fifteen (15) days. No further pleadings will be accepted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Within sixty days of the notice of McElroy\u2019s Los Angeles application, appellants Los Angeles SMSA Limited Partnership (\u201cL.A Partnership\u201d) (the incumbent Block B licensee) and JAJ Cellular also applied to serve the unserved areas in Los Angeles. Public Notice, Report No. CL-89-14, at 2 (Oct. 27, 1988); Public Notice, Report No. CL-89-33, at 1 (Nov. 25, 1988). In a notice of December 23,1988, the Commission listed a total of seven competing applications for Los Angeles Block B that it identified as possibly \u201cmutually exclusive.\u201d Public Notice, Report No. CL-89-57, at 12 (Dec. 23, 1988). Appellant Price Communications Cellular filed another competing application more than sixty days after the public notice of McElroy\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">McElroy filed a similar application following the expiration of the five-year fill-in period for the Minneapolis Block A license, and the Commission published a similar notice of McElroy\u2019s application on February 6, 1989. Public Notice, Report No. CL-89-80, at 2 (Feb. 6, 1989). In Minneapolis, the incumbent licensee filed for an unserved-area license just before McElroy\u2019s application. Public Notice, Report No.CL-89-75, at 3 (Jan. 31,1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">In a series of proceedings, the Commission dismissed all the applications, including the appellants\u2019, as premature. <em>Cellular Applications for Unserved Areas in MSAs/NECMAs, 4 </em>F.C.C. Red. 3636 (Common Carrier Bureau 1989), <em>petitions for reconsideration denied, Amendment of Part 22 of the Commission\u2019s Rules, </em>First Report and Order, 6 F.C.C. Red. 6185 (1991). The Commission ruled that, under the <em>Second Report and Order </em>in its 1987 rulemaking, once the five-year fill-in period expired, no one could apply for an unserved-area license until the Commission had published a notice of a date certain for filing such applications. <em>First Report and Order, </em>6 F.C.C. Rcd. at 6189-92. Under the rules the Commission adopted for unserved-area applications, it established a one-day \u201cfiling window\u201d for each market. <em>Id. </em>at 6196-97. For both the Los Angeles and Minneapolis MSAs, the filing window was March 10, 1993. Public Notice, Report No. CL-93-36, at 5 (Dec. 23, 1992). On that date, 517 applicants applied to serve the unserved Los Angeles areas and 494 applicants applied to serve the unserved Minneapolis areas (\u201cthe March 10 filers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">One month later, the court decided <em>McElroy I. </em>The court concluded that McElroy and the other early applicants had reasonably understood the <em>Second Report and Order </em>to mean that unserved area applications would be permitted after the five-year fill-in period had expired without any further action by the Commission. 990 F.2d at 1363. Such applications could be filed according to ordinary Commission practice, in which an applicant can file at any time and other parties may then file competing applications or petition the Commission to deny the first application. While the Commission contended that it had meant to require potential applicants to wait for the Commission to establish a different set of procedures and filing dates, the court held that the <em>Second Report and Order </em>had not given adequate notice of that requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 1363-64.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">By operation of law and by the Commission\u2019s established notice and cut-off procedures, the date certain for filing an unserved area application in an M.S.A. \u00a7 is the first day after the expiration of the protected fill-in period. Since the order did not prescribe specific procedures, such as filing windows, for these applications, petitioners appropriately filed pursuant to the Commission\u2019s regular notice and cutoff rules, under which there is no single date for the filing of the first mutually exclusive application. Under this regime, the \u201cdate certain\u201d for filing is, therefore, merely an opening date, the date <em>from, which </em>applications <em>may </em>be received, not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>particular date <em>on which </em>they <em>must </em>be received.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1363 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted). The court remanded the case to the Commission with instructions to reinstate the McElroy, L.A. Partnership, and JAJ applications <em>nunc pro tunc. Id. </em>at 1364. With respect to Price\u2019s application, which came more than 60 days after McElroy\u2019s and was therefore possibly time-barred under Commission rules, the court left it to the Commission to determine its fate on remand. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Before the Commission acted on remand, McElroy, L.A. Partnership, JAJ, and Price all reached a settlement in which they formed a partnership, appellant Desert Telecommunications Limited Partnership, to serve the unserved areas in Los Angeles, and they petitioned the Commission to accept this settlement and grant the partnership the license. McElroy reached a separate agreement with the incumbent Minneapolis licensee that would reduce interference between the licensee\u2019s existing cells and McElroy\u2019s proposed cells to acceptable levels, and McElroy moved the Commission for leave to amend its application to reflect the agreement. In considering the remand and the motion to accept the Los Angeles settlement, the Commission first considered whether the public notices announcing McElroy\u2019s Los Angeles and Minneapolis applications had commenced a sixty-day cut-off period pursuant to 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 22.31(b)(2)\u00ae (1988). <em>In re McElroy Electronics Corp., </em>10 F.C.C. Rcd. 6762 (1995) <em>(Remand Order). </em>If so, then the March 10 filers, whose applications had been filed four years after the notices were published, would not be entitled to compete with appellants for the Los Angeles or Minneapolis unserved-area licenses. The Commission ruled, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">[n] either the public notice announcing the applications of the three reinstated Appellants [McElroy, L.A. Partnership, and JAJ] nor the public notice announcing Price\u2019s application established a deadline for competing applications. The 1988 and 1989 public notices did not meet the standards articulated in our Rules for establishing a valid \u201ccut-off\u201d date because the public notices did not specify that the applications had been \u201caccepted for filing,\u201d as required by both the Act and the Rules. <em>See </em>[47] U.S.C. \u00a7 309(b)(1) and 47 C.F.R. [\u00a7] 22.26(b). Thus, the public notices did not establish cut-off dates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 6765-66. The Commission therefore decided to conduct a lottery in accordance with the rules established in the <em>First Report and Order, </em>with the successful <em>McElroy I </em>appellants in the same pool as the March 10 filers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 6766. In other respects, the Commission decided not to apply retroactively to the appellants rules developed after they filed their applications.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This appealfollowed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">When two parties apply for mutually exclusive licenses, the Commission must hold a comparative hearing before granting either application.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Ashbacker Radio Corp. v. FCC, </em>326 U.S. 327, 333, 66 S.Ct. 148, 151, 90 L.Ed. 108 (1945). The Commission has promulgated various \u201ccut-off\u2019 rules that establish deadlines by which applications must be filed in order to be considered for <em>Ash-backer </em>hearings. \u201cThe purpose of these rules is to attract all competitive applications for a particular [frequency] within a fixed and reasonably short time frame, allowing the Commission to satisfy its <em>Ashbacker </em>obligations with a single, fairly prompt comparative hearing.\u201d <em>Florida Inst. of Tech. v. FCC, </em>952 F.2d 549, 550 (D.C.Cir.1992). Pursuant to the notice and cut-off procedure under which the applications at issue in the instant case were filed, competing applicants were entitled to participate in a comparative hearing or lottery only if they filed their applications within \u201c[s]ixty (60) days after the date of the public notice listing the first of the conflicting applications as accepted for filing.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 22.31(b)(2)(i) (1988).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellants contend that the Commission improperly permitted the March 10 filers to participate in lotteries for the unserved-area licenses even though they did not file their applications within 60 days of the public notices announcing the filing of McElroy\u2019s applications. <em>See Florida Inst. of Tech., </em>952 F.2d at 554 (noting that timely filers \u201chave a legitimate expectation that the cut-off rules will be enforced\u201d); <em>City of Angels Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, </em>745 F.2d 656, 663 &amp; n. 7 (D.C.Cir.1984) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">The Commission\u2019s position is difficult to determine in light of the terse discussion of the issue in the <em>Remand Order. </em>There is no dispute that the Commission staff did in fact accept the appellants\u2019 applications for filing;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the issue is whether the public notices gave sufficient notice of that fact to cut off third parties\u2019 rights. The Commission\u2019s order suggests that the public notices at issue must have fallen into one of two categories: notices of an \u201cacceptance for filing\u201d that started a cut-off period; or instead purely informational notices that \u201cd[id] not create any rights in an applicant or any other person.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 22.27(a)(1), (3) (1988).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>brief, however, the Commission has clarified its view that it does not matter whether the notices technically fell into the informational category defined by 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 22.27(a)(3), but rather whether they clearly advised potential competitors that a cut-off date had been established. Even if the staff intended to publish \u00a7 22.27(a)(1) notices, in other words, the notices as published did not meet that subsection\u2019s requirements. The Commission\u2019s order maintained that publication of the notices could not meet the definition of notice of an \u201cacceptance for filing\u201d because \u201cthe public notices did not specify that the applications had been \u2018accepted for filing,\u2019 as required by both the Act and the Rules.\u201d <em>Remand Order, </em>10 F.C.C. Red. at 6765 (citing 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(b)(1), 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 22.26(b) (1988)). Because in the Commission\u2019s view the 1988-1989 notices were not \u201cpublic notice[s] listing the first of the conflicting applications as accepted for filing,\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 22.31(b)(2) (1988), they \u201cdid not establish cut-off dates\u201d by which conflicting applications must be received. <em>Remand Order, </em>10 F.C.C. Red. at 6766.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Before turning to these arguments, we address appellants\u2019 suggestion that the Commission\u2019s ruling on remand was barred by the <em>McElroy I </em>mandate. In <em>McElroy I, </em>the court carefully limited its holding, however, preserving the Commission\u2019s authority to decide in the first instance how to treat the applications. \u201cAt this juncture, we determine only the threshold question of reinstating the petitions, not the proper means of processing those applications.\u201d 990 F.2d at 1358. The court declined to reach the very issue pressed again in the instant appeal. In <em>McElroy I, </em>McElroy and JAJ argued that Price\u2019s application, which had been filed more than sixty days after the public notice of McElroy\u2019s Los Angeles application, must be barred. Reply Brief of Appellants McElroy Electronics Corp. <em>&amp; </em>JAJ Cellular at 10-13, <em>McElroy I </em>(No. 91-1545). Price contended that the notice had been inadequate to trigger a cut-off period, Brief of Petitioner Price Communications Cellular, Inc. at 11-14, <em>McElroy I </em>(No. 91-1545), and the Commission in its brief declined to address the issue, Brief of Appellee/Respondent Federal Communications Commission at 20 n.19, <em>McElroy I </em>(No. 91-1545). The court noted the issue, but left it \u201cto the Commission to determine on remand the timeliness of Price\u2019s application within the context of our discussion as to the comprehensible meaning of the <em>Second Report and Order.\u201d </em>990 F.2d at 1364. Even more specifically, the court mentioned the absence of the words \u201caccepted for filing\u201d from the public notice and stated: \u201cOn remand, the Commission will have the opportunity to consider the pertinence of that fact in this context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1364 n. 13. Thus, the Commission was not prohibited by the <em>McElroy I </em>mandate from deciding that the cut-off period never started.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">The Commission held in its <em>Remand Order </em>that the public notices at issue did not cut off third parties\u2019 rights because they \u201cdid not specify that the applications had been \u2018accepted for filing,\u2019 as required by both the Act and the Rules. <em>See </em>[47] U.S.C. \u00a7 309(b)(1) and 47 C.F.R. [\u00a7] 22.26(b).\u201d 10 F.C.C. Red. at 6765. We will defer to the Commission\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation. <em>Omnipoint Corp. v. FCC, </em>78 F.3d 620, 631 (D.C.Cir. 1996). Even in view of the Commission\u2019s broad discretion to interpret its regulations, however, we conclude that its interpretation is impermissible. First, it is unclear whether the Commission intended to rely on \u00a7 22.26(b), which sets forth the procedures for acceptance of an application for filing,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>rather than on \u00a7 22.31(b), which establishes a cut-off period that begins with the publication of a \u201cpublic notice listing the first of the conflicting applications as accepted for filing.\u201d Yet this oversight is not fatal, given that the Commission did cite \u00a7 22.31(b) when it first mentioned the cut-off rule. <em>Remand Order, </em>10 F.C.C. Red. at 6765.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Assuming that the order was directed toward the relevant regulation, the Commission\u2019s reasoning under the circumstances of this case is nevertheless flawed. The relevant language in \u00a7 22.31 is virtually identical to that in \u00a7 309(b) of the Act; the former refers to a notice \u201clisting the first of the conflicting applications as accepted for filing,\u201d while the latter refers to \u201cissuance of public notice by the Commission of the acceptance for filing of such application.\u201d The thirty-day period in \u00a7 309(b) is not directly relevant to the instant case, given that it simply requires the Commission to wait thirty days before granting appellants\u2019 applications. Yet the Commission\u2019s statement in the <em>Remand Order </em>that \u00a7 309(b) requires inclusion of the phrase \u201caccepted for filing\u201d is belied by the Commission\u2019s prior practice. As appellants point out, the Commission routinely used public notices essentially identical to the public notices at issue to announce applications by incumbent licensees during the five-year fill-in period.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For example, in the same public notice that contained JAJ\u2019s Los Angeles application, the Commission gave notice of a fill-in application by the Phoenix M.S.A. \u00a7 Block B licensee, Public Notice, Report No. CL-89-33, at 2 (Nov. 25, 1988) ; when no objections were filed, the Commission granted the application, Public Notice, Report No. CL-89-80, at 4 (Feb. 6, 1989) . All parties agree that the Commission was not authorized to grant such an application until thirty days after publishing the notice required in \u00a7 309(b). Because the record shows that the Commission regularly granted fill-in applications after publishing notices that did not contain the magic phrase \u201caccepted for filing,\u201d its interpretation of the Act in the contested order is plainly inconsistent with its established practice.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Thus, the statute does not require that the notice contain the phrase \u201caccepted for filing.\u201d The question in the instant case is whether the regulations differ from the statute by adding such a requirement. The Commission has supplied no reason to interpret the public-notice requirement in \u00a7 22.31(b) differently from that in \u00a7 309(b); nor can we see any reason to construe the regulation differently from the statute. Because the Commission\u2019s interpretation conflicts with its interpretation of similar language in the Act and is unsupported by any analysis, we cannot defer to it. The fact that the public notices did not contain the phrase \u201caccepted for filing\u201d does not prevent the cut-off period from commencing by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">The Commission has presented in its brief a line of analysis that harmonizes the Commission\u2019s order with its prior practice. What both the rules and the Act require, according to the brief, is a notice containing <em>either </em>the phrase \u201caccepted for filing\u201d <em>or </em>an express notification of what deadlines are being established by the notice. The purpose of the notice requirement is to afford interested parties adequate notice that their rights are implicated. This can be done either by expressly listing a cut-off date or by using a term of art like \u201caccepted for filing\u201d that will lead such parties to the text of the relevant statutes and rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The attraction of this analysis is that it explains away the apparent conflict between the interpretation of \u00a7 309(b) that the Commission asserted in its order and its routine practice of granting incumbent fill-in applications after publishing notices that do not contain the magic words. These notices, while not stating that a fill-in application has been \u201caccepted for filing,\u201d do state that comments must be filed within 30 days of the notice. According to the argument, this satisfies \u00a7 309(b)\u2019s prohibition against granting an application until 30 days after publication of a notice that the application has been accepted for filing. The purpose of that prohibition is to give other parties a period in which to file petitions to deny the application. <em>In re Palm Bay Pub. Radio, Inc., </em>6 F.C.C. Rcd. 1772, 1773 (1991), <em>aff'd sub nom. Florida Inst. of Tech. v. FCC, </em>952 F.2d 549 (D.C.Cir.1992). Thus, by expressly warning that \u201ccomments\u201d must be submitted within 30 days, the Commission contends, the fill-in notices fulfill the function required by \u00a7 309(b). Because no other party may file a competing application during the fill-in period, the Commission is not required to give a separate warning that a cut-off period for <em>Ashbacker </em>purposes is being established. By contrast, says the Commission, appellants\u2019 unserved-area applications were subject to mutually exclusive filings, so potential competitors could not be cut off without receiving explicit notice that the sixty-day cut-off period was starting.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Appellants dispute the factual basis for the Commission\u2019s position, claiming that there have been instances in which the Commission enforced cut-off periods based on public notices that neither contained the phrase \u201caccepted for filing\u201d nor expressly announced a filing deadline for competing applications. This is not as clear as appellants suggest. The public notice at issue in <em>Reuters Ltd. v. FCC, </em>781 F.2d 946 (D.C.Cir.1986), did state that the listed applications had been \u201caccepted for filing.\u201d Public Notice, Report No. 1182, at 1, 4 \u2014 5 (Aug. 12, 1983). In <em>Maxcell, </em>in which the public notice did not list a cutoff date, Public Notice, Report No. CL-23 (Aug. 17, 1983), the Commission did not cut off a competing applicant for filing after the sixty-day period; instead, the court required the Commission to reinstate the application of a competing applicant who had filed within the sixty-day period. 815 F.2d at 1560. In <em>In re Metro Mobile CTS, Inc., </em>8 F.C.C. Rcd. 8675, 8676 (1993), <em>aff'd sub nom. JAJ Cellular v. FCC, </em>54 F.3d 834 (D.C.Cir.1995), the Commission entertained McElroy\u2019s petition to deny when it had published a notice similar to the ones at issue here for an unservedarea application by the incumbent licensee in Phoenix M.S.A. \u00a7 Block A, Public Notice, Report No. CL-89-66, at 2 (Jan. 23, 1989), and McElroy had filed a competing application, Public Notice, Report No. CL-89-80, at 2 (Feb. 6, 1989). Yet the <em>Metro Mobile </em>public notice contained a statement of the statutory thirty-day period for petitions to deny, and the Commission later determined that the five-year fill-in period had in fact not ended, so that the incumbent licensee\u2019s application was treated as a fill-in application not subject to competing applications. <em>Remand Order, </em>10 F.C.C. Red. at 6762.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Nevertheless, it is clear that the Commission\u2019s analysis in its brief bears little resemblance to the rationale of the Commission in the appealed order. <em>See SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 87-88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 459-60, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943). Only a most charitable reading of the <em>Remand Order </em>could reveal this meaning. The Commission framed the issue as whether the public notices \u201cestablished a valid deadline or \u2018cut-off\u2019 date for the filing of competing applications.\u201d 10 F.C.C. Red. at 6765. Then the Commission reasoned that the notices did not \u201cestablish[ ] a deadline for competing applications\u201d and \u201cdid not meet the standards articulated in our Rules for establishing a valid \u2018cut-off\u2019 date because the public notices did not specify that the applications had been \u2018accepted for filing.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>Perhaps the Commission intended to convey, however obliquely, that there were two possible ways for the notices to be effective: <em>either </em>they could have expressly listed a deadline for competing applications <em>or </em>they could have invoked the cut-off period in \u00a7 22.31(b) by including the phrase \u201caccepted for filing.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Even if the Commission\u2019s order could be read to include the rationale now advanced by its counsel, that rationale is inconsistent with this circuit\u2019s case law. The notice and cut-off procedure serves the public\u2019s interest in administrative finality and prompt issuance of licenses. Furthermore, as against latecomers, timely filers who have diligently complied with the Commission\u2019s requirements have an equitable interest in enforcement of the cut-off rules. <em>Florida Inst. of Tech., </em>952 F.2d at 554; <em>City of Angels, </em>745 F.2d at 663. To serve these purposes, the court has frequently affirmed the Commission\u2019s strict enforcement of its rules. <em>See Florida Inst. of Tech., </em>952 F.2d at 550 (citing <em>Salzer v. FCC, </em>778 F.2d 869, 875 (D.C.Cir.1985)). Moreover, the Commission may not decline to enforce its deadlines so long as the rules themselves are clear and the public notice apprises potential competitors of a mutually exclusive application. <em>Reuters, </em>781 F.2d at 949-51 &amp; n. 5. In light of these precedents, the public notices of McElroy\u2019s applications should have put a reasonably diligent interested party on notice that its rights were at stake.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">As the Commission\u2019s counsel noted at oral argument, the Commission was caught between two groups of applicants with legitimate interests. The issue is who should lose on account of what the Commission now considers to have been an error by its staff in giving less than perfect notice of its acceptance for filing of the unserved-area applications. The Commission\u2019s analysis \u2014 at least as refined in its argument to the court \u2014 pays admirable attention to the right of the March 10 filers to have adequate notice before their rights were cut off, but fails to recognize that that right would be \u2014 and was \u2014 satisfied so long as the Commission\u2019s actions gave them notice of the cut-off date that was \u201creasonably comprehensible to people of good faith.\u201d <em>McElroy I, </em>990 F.2d at 1358; <em>see also Hispanic Info. &amp; Telecommunications Network, Inc. v. FCC, 865 </em>F.2d 1289, 1295-96 (D.C.Cir. 1989); <em>Maxcell, </em>815 F.2d at 1559-60; <em>Radio Athens, Inc. v. FCC, </em>401 F.2d 398, 404 (D.C.Cir.1968). Several features of the McElroy notices, in conjunction with \u00a7 22.31(b) of the Commission\u2019s rules, show that interested parties acting in good faith should have understood that a deadline had been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">Most important, the notice could not have been reasonably understood as announcing anything other than an application by a non-incumbent licensee for an unserved-area license in Los Angeles on Block B. The notice stated, in underlined words no less, that McElroy \u201cproposes to serve unserved areas in the Los Angeles M.S.A. \u00a7 on the block B frequencies under Section 22.31(a)(l)(i) of the rules.\u201d Public Notice, Report No. Cl-88-154, at 4. If the words were not clear enough, the interested reader could have referred to the cited regulation, which applies only to \u201capplications by other than licensees or permittees for a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) to serve unserved areas outside the presently authorized CGSA but within the MSA.\u201d If the reader happened to be interested in serving the Los Angeles MSA, the reader could also be expected to know from prior public notice, <em>see In re Advanced Mobile Phone Serv., Inc., </em>93 F.C.C.2d 683 (1983), that L.A. Partnership\u2019s five-year exclusive fill-in period as the Los Angeles M.SA. \u00a7 Block B incumbent had ended in late April 1988. Interest surely piqued by now, the potential competitor would continue to read the notice and discover that the Commission would accept comments on the application for only thirty days. Nor would the reader have to go to the trouble of checking the Act to learn what might happen when those thirty days elapsed, for the notice went on to list no fewer than three other applications, previously placed on public notice, that had been granted because \u201c[t]he Commission has not received any objection to the application.\u201d Public Notice, Report No. CL-88-154, at 6. Of course, were McElroy\u2019s application granted, the reader\u2019s dream of constructing cells in Los Angeles\u2019s unserved areas on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>same frequency block would be dashed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is difficult to escape the conclusion that a minimally diligent competitor would have recognized the need to take action in response to the notice. <em>Cf. Hispanic Info. &amp; Telecommunications Network, </em>865 F.2d at 1295-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The Commission and intervenors contend, however, that a competitor familiar with the <em>Second Report and Order </em>might reasonably have believed that the Commission was not yet accepting unserved-area applications, and might therefore have discounted the clear import of the notice. Recall that the Commission itself interpreted the <em>Second Report and Order </em>to bar unserved-area applications, even after the five-year fill-in period had expired, until the Commission had established procedures and announced a filing date. The intervenors say that they interpreted the order as the Commission had intended, and that their \u201ccareful reading of the <em>Second, Report and Order </em>led them to await further instruction by the Commission, rather than file premature applications\u201d after the McElroy notice appeared. Brief for Intervenors at 6. The intervenors rely on <em>McElroy I\u2019s </em>purported holding that the <em>Second Report and Order </em>was ambiguous and contend that they should not be punished for the Commission\u2019s poor drafting any more than should the appellants. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">First, the assertion that <em>McElroy I </em>found the <em>Second Report and Order </em>ambiguous is at best debatable. The court did not state that appellants\u2019 reading was one among several reasonable interpretations of the order; it stated that it was the most reasonable interpretation. The court agreed with appellants that \u201cthe most logical way to read\u201d the <em>Second Report and Order </em>was \u201cthat, once the five-year moratorium elapsed, the established notice and cut-off procedures would operate.\u201d 990 F.2d at 1360. In fact, the only portion of the <em>Second Report and Order </em>that the court deemed \u201cambiguous\u201d was footnote 17, the very part that the intervenors now claim most clearly supports their interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 1361, 1363 n. 12. The irony of the intervenors\u2019 position is manifest: they seek vindication of their claimed understanding of the <em>Second Report and Order </em>at the expense of that of appellants. Yet appellants necessarily have the better of this argument after <em>McElroy I. </em>The premise of the intervenors\u2019 argument is thus shaky at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">Even accepting that premise, however, the public notices still should have alerted a diligent competitor that an immediate response was required. <em>See Florida Inst. of Tech., </em>952 F.2d at 553-54 (finding tardy competitor\u2019s lack of diligence tipped equities in favor of early filer). As discussed previously, there is no way to understand the McElroy notices as referring to anything other than unservedarea applications. Even a competitor who had been patiently biding its time, awaiting an invitation from the Commission to apply, would have realized that the call to arms had come. This would be true enough if only one notice had been published, but as more appeared in the regular public notices over the succeeding weeks, no reasonable person interested in competing for the Los Angeles or Minneapolis unserved-area licenses could have clung to a belief that the proper approach was to keep quiet and wait.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>requirement to act promptly should have been easily comprehensible to people of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">For these reasons we conclude that the public notices at issue started a sixty-day cut-off period, and that the March 10 filers are not entitled to compete against their more timely rivals.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must remand the case once more to the Commission with instructions to dismiss the applications of the March 10 filers. The Commission must decide in the first instance how to resolve the proposed full-market settlement for the Los Angeles M.S.A \u00a7 and McElroy\u2019s agreement with the Minneapolis M.S A. \u00a7 incumbent.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because the applications have been pending for almost eight years, due to no apparent fault of appellants, it is to be hoped that the matter will be resolved forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\">. Throughout this opinion, we cite the Commission's rules for cellular licensing in effect when the public notices at issue were published in late 1988 and early 1989. The Commission has since recodified these rules. <em>Revision of Part 22 of the Commission\u2019s Rules Governing Public Mobile Services, </em>9 F.C.C. Rcd. 6513 (1994).

On April 15, 1996, the Commission announced its intention to conduct lotteries for Los Angeles Block B and Minneapolis Block A on June 11, 1996, but expressly stated in the \"Lottery Notice\" that \u201c[a]ny license granted in either of these markets following the lottery will be conditioned on the outcome\u201d of the instant appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b342-7\">. The <em>McElroy I </em>cotut ordered the Commission to consider on remand whether to apply retroactively the changes made to its rules for unservedarea license applications since appellants\u2019 applications were accepted for filing. 990 F.2d at 1365. The most important such changes were that the five-year fill-in period runs from the date of authorization for the particular licensee (rather than for the first licensee in the market), <em>see </em>47 C.F.R. \u00a7 22.31(a)(l)(i) (1993), and that the method of determining the boundaries of a licensee's CGSA was altered in a way that tends to enlarge incumbents\u2019 territories, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 22.903 (1993). The Commission found in its <em>Remand Order </em>that the change in measuring the fill-in period had no effect in the Los Angeles or Minneapolis MSAs, 10 F.C.C. Rcd. at 6768, and decided that it would not apply the new CGSA definition retroactively to the appellants\u2019 applications, <em>id. </em>at 6773-74.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b342-13\">.
