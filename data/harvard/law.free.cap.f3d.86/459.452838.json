For the reasons assigned, we find no preemption and therefore vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-25\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-26\">Dempty Manuel, Sr., became permanently disabled in June or July of 1990. At the time of his injury Manuel was a salaried employee earning $45,500 a year. The injury occurred on the job and Manuel began to receive workers\u2019 compensation payments from Mart-co,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> his employer, in the amount of $1,222.00 per month. In September of 1991 Manuel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>also began receiving social security disability benefits of $994.80 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">On February 24, 1992, Manuel applied for long term disability benefits from Lincoln National Life Insurance Company. The policy which Manuel invoked provided such coverage to Martco employees; 100% of the policy premiums had been funded by Martco. At the time of Manuel\u2019s injuries, the disability policy was issued by UNUM Life Insurance Company of America.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This policy provides that the disability payments are to equal 661% of Manuel\u2019s \u201cbasic monthly earnings,\u201d less \u201cother income benefits.\u201d The policy includes this definition of \u201cother income benefits\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Other income benefits means those benefits as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">1. The amount for which the insured is eligible under:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">a. Workers\u2019 or Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">b. occupational disease law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">c. any other act of law of like intent,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-11\">5. The amount of disability or retirement benefits under the United States Social Security Act ... or any similar plan or act, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-12\">a. disability plans for which:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-13\">i. the insured is eligible; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-14\">ii. his spouse, child or children are eligible because of his disability____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-16\">Based upon this language, Lincoln began paying Manuel $311.10 per month, crediting the $1,222.00 in workers\u2019 compensation payments and the $994.80 in social security payments towards its obligation to Manuel of $2,527.90 a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-22\">On October 4, 1993, Martco petitioned the Louisiana Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation to have its workers\u2019 compensation payments lowered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This petition was based in part upon La.R.S. 23:1225(C)(l)(c), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-23\">\u00a7 1225. Reductions when other benefits payable</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-24\">s}: <em>% </em>:{\u00ab</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-25\">C. (1) If an employee receives remuneration from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-26\">\u2018 * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-27\">(c) Benefits under disability benefit plans in the proportion funded by an employer ... then compensation benefits under this Chapter shall be reduced, unless there is an agreement to the contrary between the employee and the employer liable for payment of the workers\u2019 compensation benefit, so that the aggregate remuneration from subparagraphs (a) through (d) of this subsection shall not exceed sixty-six and two-thirds percent of his average weekly wage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-28\">In addition to this offset, Martco also claimed a reduction under La.R.S. 23:1225(A) for the amount of Social Security disability payments Manuel was receiving.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-29\">Lincoln, served with notice of the state proceeding, removed the case to federal court asserting federal jurisdiction under ERISA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Both parties filed cross motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>for summary judgment, each seeking an offset for the other party\u2019s obligation to Manuel. The district court granted Lincoln\u2019s motion, finding that Martco was obligated to pay the full amount of workers\u2019 compensation payments without a reduction for the amount of disability payments paid by Lincoln or the Social Security Administration. The trial court found that to the extent the offset provisions of the Louisiana workers\u2019 compensation scheme compete with the ERISA plan, state law is preempted, and Lincoln is free to apply an offset to its payments for the full, unreduced compensation payment owed by Martco plus social security payments. Mart-co timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">We begin our analysis with a review of the ERISA plan established by the UNUM policy. We had occasion to consider the terms of this particular policy in <em>Nesom v. Brown and Root, U.S.A., Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> Nesom </em>involved a situation in which a state court had already determined the amount of the employer\u2019s compensation payments; the federal district court\u2019s role was merely to determine the disability payments owed under the policy to the plan beneficiary. Interpreting the language of the UNUM policy we held that \u201cthe state court judgment established Nesom\u2019s eligibility under workers\u2019 compensation law.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In other words, \u201cthe policy envisions that once the amount of workers\u2019 compensation is determined under state law, that amount will be setoff under the policy.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">Although this interpretation defines the formula to be applied in determining payments under the UNUM policy involved in this ease, it does not answer the key question presented, <em>i.e. </em>whether the offset provisions of La.R.S. 23:1225(A) and (C)(1)(e) are preempted because their application indirectly increases the expenses of the ERISA plan.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the state offset provisions are preempted, then Martco may not claim those offsets and its principal, unreduced, compensation obligation accrues in Lincoln\u2019s favor under the UNUM policy. If not, then the amount of workers\u2019 compensation must be computed in accordance with state law, including La.R.S. 23:1225\u2019s offset provisions, with the resulting amount to be used in determining Lincoln\u2019s coordinate offset.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">Section 514(a) of ERISA<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provides that its provisions \u201csupersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.\u201d \u201cThe words \u2018relate to\u2019 are to be given their broad common-sense meaning and a state law will be preempted if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, \u201c[preemption does not occur ... if the state law has only a tenuous, remote, or peripheral connection with covered plans, as is the case with many laws of general applicability.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">We find this case to be controlled by our decision in <em>Hook v. Morrison Milling Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>involving, <em>inter alia, </em>a waiver of the employee plaintiffs right to bring a common law negligence claim against her employer. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>rejecting the employer\u2019s submission that the inclusion of this waiver provision in the ERISA plan created a relationship between the Texas negligence action and the ERISA plan sufficient to invoke Section 514(a) preemption, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">By focusing on the waiver, MMC turns ERISA preemption analysis on its head; it argues that Hook\u2019s cause of action is preempted because the waiver, as part of the plan, relates to Hook\u2019s claim. Instead, the appropriate question in any ERISA preemption case is whether the state law relates to an ERISA plan. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a)____ MMC\u2019s analysis would enable employers to avoid <em>any </em>state law simply by referring to that law in its ERISA plan. Congress clearly did not intend to vest employers with such authority.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Applying the principles propounded in <em>Hook </em>to the instant case, we conclude that the offset provisions of La.R.S. 23:1225(A) and (C)(1)(c) do not \u201crelate\u201d to the ERISA plan within the meaning of Section 514(a). The offset provisions of the state statute do not modify or regulate the ERISA plan, addressing only the means by which the <em>employer\u2019s </em>obligation to Manuel is to be determined and not the amounts owed by Lincoln under the policy.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> While we recognize that the language of the UNUM policy dictates that application of the state law offset provisions ultimately will determine the amount of the disability payments under the plan, \u201ca law or claim is preempted when <em>it </em>relates to an ERISA plan, and not the reverse.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Simply put, Lincoln cannot \u201cdon the mantle of ERISA preemption simply by including workers\u2019 compensation benefits in its [disability] benefits plan.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">We reach this decision based upon the position of the various parties before us and the equities thus brought into play.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It cannot be gainsaid that the interpretation of an integration-of-benefits or setoff provision in an ERISA plan is a matter of federal law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As we recognized in <em>Nesom, </em>Congress has left the parameters of such setoff provisions \u201cto the discretion of the plan designers.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In <em>Nesom </em>we concluded that the plan designers had incorporated into the UNUM policy references to otherwise unrelated provisions of state law. We see no reason, under the circumstances presented by this case, to second guess that interpretation, and thus reject Lincoln\u2019s attempt to amend <em>post hoc, </em>via the mechanism of ERISA preemption, the express terms of its plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-15\">Accordingly, we conclude that the district court committed reversible error by determining that the inclusion of a reference to state workers\u2019 compensation law in the UNUM policy necessitates preemption of that state law. Upon remand the district court should calculate, in accordance with our opinion in <em>Nesom, </em>Marteo\u2019s state compensation obligation to Manuel before applying the offset provisions of the UNUM policy. We express no opinion regarding the application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>of the offset provisions of La.R.S. 23:1225 to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-14\">. Manuel's actual employer was Martin Home Center, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Martco. Martco assumed responsibility for compensation payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-17\">. All parties agree that the language of this UNUM policy controls the calculation of the LTD benefits owed by Lincoln and that the policy falls within the confines of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>etseq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b551-18\">.

Although federal question jurisdiction seems to have been proper, <em>see Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>481 U.S. 58, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 95 L.Ed.2d 55 (1987), removal of this case may have been inconsistent with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(c), which prohibits the removal of worker\u2019s compensation cases from state court. <em>Humphrey v. Sequentia, Inc., </em>58 F.3d 1238 (8th Cir.1995); <em>Jones v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>931 F.2d 1086 (5th Cir. 1991). <em>See, however, Cedillo v. Valcar Enterprises &amp; Darling Delaware Co., </em>773 F.Supp. 932 (N.D.Tex.1991) (finding remand improper when basis of jurisdiction was federal question, with compensation claim entertained under supplemental jurisdiction, and not diversity). Martco did not move for a remand in the district court and the issue has not been raised on appeal; any challenge to removal jurisdiction is therefore waived. <em>Williams v.
