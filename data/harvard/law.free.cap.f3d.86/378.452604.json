Adler appeals a decision of the United States Tax Court upholding a determination by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that a distribution he received in 1990 from the Maryland Employees\u2019 Retirement System should have been reported as taxable income for that year.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the Tax Court erred in holding that the distribution was not made \u201con account of the employee\u2019s separation from the service\u201d within the meaning of 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(e)(4)(A)(iii) (West 1988), we vacate and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">Maryland created the Retirement System in 1941 to provide retirement benefits to state employees. After actuarial projections made in the late 1970s indicated that the Retirement System was underfunded, it was closed to new participants effective January 1, 1980, and the Maryland Employees\u2019 Pension System was created. Although no 'longer accepting new members, the Retirement System was maintained in effect for all participants who had entered into service prior to 1980. Pursuant to state pension reform legislation in 1984, participants in the Retirement System were offered several options relating to their retirement benefits, one- of which was the right to transfer to the Pension System. Under state law, if a Retirement System member chose to transfer to the Pension System, that person would receive a distribution of employer and employee contributions that had been made to the Retirement System plus the earnings on those contributions (the Transfer Refund). The employee\u2019s service credits, salary level, and other informational data then would be used to compute the monthly retirement benefit payable under the Pension System. This monthly benefit, however, was significantly less than the amount the employee would have received if the employee had retired as a member of the Retirement System. Although not obligated to retire in order to elect to transfer, a participant in the Retirement System forfeited the right to obtain the Transfer Refund and to retire under the Pension System if the election was not made prior to retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">Adler, who began state employment in 1965, participated in the Retirement System. On May 24, 1990, in preparation for his impending retirement, he submitted an application to transfer to the Pension System. On that same day, Alder applied for retirement under the Pension System, effective July 1, 1990. Soon afterward, he received a Transfer Refund totalling $169,352.98 and within 60 days deposited $143,705.04 into an individual retirement account (IRA). On his income tax return for 1990, Adler reported no part of the Transfer Refund as taxable income. As a result of a subsequent audit, the Commissioner determined that $144,165 of the Transfer Refund \u2014 the amount by which the distribution exceeded Adler\u2019s previously-taxed employee contributions \u2014 should have been reported as taxable income for that year. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(a)(1) (West 1988). In addition, the Commissioner determined that Adler was liable for the excise tax imposed on excess contributions to an IRA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number><em>See </em>26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4973 (West 1989). He assessed Adler\u2019s total tax deficiency for 1990 to be $54,356.99 plus interest. The United States Tax Court upheld the Commissioner\u2019s determination,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Adler appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Under the version of the Internal Revenue Code in effect in 1990, distributions from qualified retirement plans were, as a general rule, taxable to the beneficiary in the year of receipt. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(a)(1). Some distributions from qualified plans, however, were entitled to more favorable tax treatment. Of relevance to our decision, a partial distribution was eligible for rollover treatment, <em>i.e., </em>the distribution would \u201cnot be inelud[ed] in gross income for the taxable year in which paid,\u201d if (1) the distribution was made payable to the employee \u201con account of the employee\u2019s separation from the service;\u201d (2) the employee transferred the distribution to an IRA; and (3) the deposit was made within 60 days of receipt. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(a)(5), (e)(4)(A)(iii) (West 1988). Because the parties agree that the Transfer Refund is a partial distribution from a qualified plan, that Adler made his deposit to an IRA within 60 days of receiving the payment, and that his retirement qualifies as a \u201cseparation from the service,\u201d the sole issue on appeal is whether the Tax Court properly determined that the distribution was not made to Adler \u201con account of\u2019 his retirement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We review de novo determinations of law made by the Tax Court. <em>See Estate of Waters v. Commissioner, </em>48 F.3d 838, 841-42 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The phrase \u201con account of\u2019 is not defined in the Internal Revenue Code or in the accompanying regulations. Obviously, the phrase requires that there be a causal connection between the employee\u2019s separation from service and the distribution from the qualified plan. <em>See Commissioner v. Miller, </em>914 F.2d 586, 589 (4th Cir.1990). Merely because the phrase suggests some degree of causation, however, does not specify what level of causation is required; the phrase, therefore, is inherently ambiguous. <em>Id. </em>at 589-90; <em>see also O\u2019Gilvie v. United States, </em>66 F.3d 1550, 1556 (10th Cir.1995), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 1316, 134 L.Ed.2d 469 (1996); <em>Wesson v. United States, </em>48 F.3d 894, 898 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Hawkins v. United States, </em>30 F.3d 1077, 1080 (9th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 2576, 132 L.Ed.2d 827 (1995); <em>Reese v. United States, </em>24 F.3d 228, 230 (Fed.Cir. 1994). Indeed, the phrase has several possible meanings, including \u201cincident to,\u201d <em>Gittens v. Commissioner, </em>49 T.C. 419, 423, 1968 WL 1396 (1968), \u201c \u2018by reason of,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018because of,\u2019 \u201d \u201c\u2018as a result of, or as a consequence of,\u201d\u2019 <em>Osterman v. Commissioner, </em>50 T.C. 970, 974, 1968 WL 1455 (1968) (quoting <em>Funkhouser v. Commissioner, </em>44 T.C. 178, 184, 1965 WL 1322 (1965), <em>aff'd, </em>375 F.2d 1 (4th Cir.1967)). Accordingly, we conclude that although the plain language of \u00a7 402 mandates a causal link between the two events in order for the distribution to be eligible for rollover treatment, the degree of causation required is not specified in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-16\">The inherent ambiguity in the phrase \u201con account of\u2019 requires that we examine other sources to determine whether Congress intended that \u00a7 402 should be given the narrow interpretation advocated by the Government and adopted by the Tax Court, <em>i.e., </em>that there be a direct causal link between the separation from service and the distribution, or whether some lesser causal relationship will satisfy the statutory language. This search requires an examination of the legislative history of the statute to determine its underlying purpose, recognizing that we best implement the intent of Congress by construing the statute in a way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>that gives effect to its purpose. <em>See O\u2019Gilvie, </em>66 F.3d at 1558. <em>See generally United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019n, </em>310 U.S. 534, 543-44, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 1063-64, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"A4B\">The legislative history of this provision indicates that the congressional purpose was to confer favorable tax treatment on a distribution if it was received when the employee retired or otherwise separated from service. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 1631, 77th Cong., 2d Sess. 138 (1942); <em>see also Smith v. United States, </em>460 F.2d 1005, 1007 (6th Cir.1972); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>331 F.2d 943, 945 (5th Cir.1964). Moreover, Congress intended that such treatment be unavailable for distributions that were not received in connection with a true separation from service because preretirement distributions could result in the depletion of an employee\u2019s retirement savings, a result it sought to discourage. <em>See Burton v. Commissioner, </em>99 T.C. 622, 632, 1992 WL 370601 (1992); <em>Reinhardt v. Commissioner, </em>85 T.C. 511, 525, 1985 WL 15395 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"AWS\">As the purpose of the statute is to protect and encourage retirement savings, it is plain that a distribution to an employee that occurs incident to his retirement should be entitled to rollover treatment. Applying this standard, we conclude that the Transfer Refund was a partial distribution made to Adler \u201con account of\u2019 his retirement and, therefore, was eligible for rollover treatment under \u00a7 402 as it existed in 1990. Furthermore, in order to exercise his legal right to retire under the Pension System, Adler was required to make the election to transfer from the Retirement System prior to his retirement. If he had failed to so elect, he would have relinquished forever his right to retire under the Pension System. Thus, although Adler\u2019s retirement and the distribution were not causally connected in the sense that Adler\u2019s legal right to the distribution was triggered by his retirement, Adler\u2019s retirement clearly resulted in the election. Consequently, the resulting distribution occurred on account of Adler\u2019s retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"AEf\">Finally, we note that to sanction the interpretation of the phrase \u201con account of\u2019 adopted by the Tax Court and its result\u2014 that the Transfer Refund received by Adler was not eligible for rollover treatment\u2014 would not further the goal Congress sought to advance by enacting the legislation itself. Allowing Adler to deposit the taxable portion of the distribution into an IRA does not infringe upon this goal because he did not receive an early, preretirement distribution. Moreover, if denied favorable tax treatment in this situation, Adler will face retirement without a large portion of his retirement savings, thus creating the very situation that Congress sought to avoid by adding the limitation in the first place.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AbU\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"AjI\">In conclusion, we hold that the distribution Adler received from the Retirement System was made payable to him \u201con account of\u2019 his retirement. Accordingly, it was eligible for rollover treatment under the version of \u00a7 402 in effect in 1990. The decision of the Tax Court is vacated and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6F\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-12\">. His wife, Jacquelyn L. Adler, is also a party because the Adlers filed a joint tax return for 1990.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b470-9\">. The Tax Court did reduce the amount of the deficiency assessed by the Commissioner by $120 to reflect a miscalculation relating to the amount of the excise tax.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b470-10\">. The requirement that this specific type of distribution be received \"on account of\u201d a separation from service before it would be eligible for rollover treatment was deleted by 1992 amendments to \u00a7 402. <em>See </em>Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992, Pub.L. No. 102-318, \u00a7 521(a), 106 Stat. 290, 300-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AHO\">. We also note that this is not a situation in which the taxpayer seeks to avoid the taxation of a distribution. Adler will pay income tax on payments from his IRA as each payment is received. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 72, 408(d) (West Supp. 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"Anf\">. The record before us indicates that Adler did not deposit the entire previously-untaxed portion of the Transfer Refund into the IRA. And, only that part of the distribution that he transferred to the IRA is eligible for rollover treatment. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(a)(5)(A). Because the record is unclear concerning the tax treatment to be accorded the remaining amount, we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
