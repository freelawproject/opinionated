We affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Heilman was originally prosecuted pursuant to a seventy-eight count, twenty-four defendant indictment of an organized crime group known as the DeMeo crew of the Gambino organized crime family. This indictment charged the defendants with substantive and conspiracy violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(e) and (d), which violations included numerous predicate acts of mail and wire fraud. The defendants were also charged with myriad other violations of federal laws. Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy severed non-RICO counts involving auto theft and exportation, <em>see United States v. DiNome, </em>954 F.2d 839, 842 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 830, 113 S.Ct. 94, 121 L.Ed.2d 56 (1992), none of which charged Heilman, to be tried first. The remaining charges were reassigned to Judge Vincent L. Broderick, and the trial of these charges commenced on February 22,1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-14\">Ten defendants were tried for RICO offenses and the remaining substantive charges. Wayne Heilman and his wife, Judith Heilman, were charged with substantive and conspiracy RICO violations involving predicate acts of accepting bribes and mail and wire fraud, and separate charges of mail and wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 1343. Wayne Heilman was also charged with extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C.' \u00a7 1951. Near the close of the trial, the Heilmans moved pursuant to Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for a judgment of acquittal on the RICO charges, and for a mistrial on the remaining charges on the basis of spillover prejudice. <em>DiNome, </em>954 F.2d at 844. Judge Broderick granted the Rule 29 motion, but denied the motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">The jury found the Heilmans guilty of mail and wire fraud, and Wayne Heilman guilty of extortion. All codefendants were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>also found guilty on all charges. Judge Broderick thereafter acquitted Wayne Heilman on the extortion charge pursuant to Rule 29(c), and sentenced him to three years imprisonment, five years probation, and fines totalling $4,000. This Court then reversed the Heilmans\u2019 mail and wire fraud convictions because we concluded that they had been prejudiced by the introduction of evidence concerning the RICO charges against them and their codefendants before the RICO counts against them were dismissed. <em>See DiNome, </em>954 F.2d at 844-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">On remand, the case was reassigned to Judge Cedarbaum, and the Heilmans were each retried on one count of mail fraud and one count of wire fraud in connection with a scheme to defraud a savings and loan institution by making false statements on a residential loan application. The facts, as established at trial and viewed in the light most favorable to the government, <em>see United States v. D\u2019Amato, </em>39 F.3d 1249, 1256 (2d Cir.1994), are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In 1980, Wayne and Judith Heilman negotiated the purchase of a home in Marlboro Township, New Jersey, for $82,000. To finance this purchase, the Heilmans sought a mortgage from Freehold Savings &amp; Loan Association (\u201cFreehold Savings\u201d) in the amount of $50,000. Susan Tarnoff, their real estate broker, assisted the Heilmans in making out this loan application. Tarnoff told them that Freehold Savings required that monthly mortgage payments not exceed twenty-eight percent of an applicant\u2019s gross monthly income. It was also required that the applicant make a down payment in the amount of twenty percent of the purchase price. Wayne Heilman assured Tarnoff that he could verify any income that was needed to qualify for the loan. He indicated on the loan application that he received $3,683 per month from his employment at Jersey Seafood. However, the employment verification form received from Jersey Seafood indicated that Heilman earned only $300 per week. This amount failed to satisfy Freehold Savings\u2019 income requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">William Conklin, a loan officer at Freehold Savings, then instructed Tarnoff to contact Heilman to ascertain whether he had any additional income. Tarnoff called Heilman about the matter, and he reported that he did have additional income from his employment at Glenwood Flea Market (\u201cGlen-wood\u201d), where he claimed to have been a manager for three years. After Tarnoff verified by telephone that Heilman worked at Glenwood, Freehold Savings received a letter from Glenwood which stated that Heilman was employed as a manager at Glenwood and that his yearly salary was $28,600. At trial, Heilman stipulated that this information was false; i.e., that he had never worked at Glen-wood. However, Freehold Savings accepted the information without further inquiry and granted the mortgage loan, which closed on January 28,1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">At trial, Heilman sought to create a reasonable doubt as to whether he had intended to cause Freehold Savings any legally cognizable harm by misrepresenting his financial status. In this regard, Conklin acknowledged on cross-examination that the Hell-mans\u2019 $32,000 downpayment constituted forty percent of the residence\u2019s purchase price, that the house was appraised at over $80,000, and that Freehold Savings\u2019 first lien on the property would protect it against any loss in the event of default.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Heilman also blamed Tarnoff for the submission of false information about his income. He testified, <em>inter alia, </em>that his wife was not present when he filled out the loan application with Tarnoff. He claimed that he had told Tarnoff that he earned $850 per week, but she had mistakenly recorded this amount as his monthly income. In addition, Heilman asserted that when his application was initially rejected, Tarnoff suggested to Heilman that his father, who owned Glenwood, \u201cput him on the books\u201d at Glenwood, and that she would verify his employment at Glenwood and inform Freehold Savings accordingly. These claims contradicted Tarnoffs trial testimony. On cross-examination, Heilman admitted that at the time he had applied for the loan he only expected to earn $15,000 per year, not $850 per week, which would have amounted to approximately $44,000 per year. He also conceded that he had listed Glen-wood as an employer on an entirely separate credit application in 1981, thereby discredit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>ing his claim that submitting false information about his purported employment at Glenwood to Freehold Savings was Tarnoffs idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The Heilmans submitted a joint request to charge the jury on the elements of mail and wire fraud in accordance with the instructions in 1A Leonard B. Sand <em>et al., Modem Federal Jury Instructions, </em>with several additions. First, the defendants requested the following instruction on the scheme to defraud element:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">You must distinguish here between a scheme to defraud and a scheme to deceive. A scheme to defraud must have as its goal a financial loss to the victim. A scheme to deceive is one in which false statements are made to induce a party to enter a transaction but the result is, for example, the delivery of goods of appropriate value for the price paid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The district court rejected this proposal, and instead instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">The fraudulent representation must relate to a material fact. A material fact is one which would reasonably be expected to be of concern to a prudent person in making a decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-8\">This means that if you find a particular representation to have been false, you must determine whether that representation was one that a reasonable person might have considered important in making a decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">The government must prove that the defendant you are considering contemplated harm in order to establish a scheme to defraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Second, the Heilmans requested the following instruction regarding good faith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-11\">In considering whether a defendant acted in good faith you may consider proof of repayment made prior to any charges being brought. You may also consider any testimony to the effect that the alleged victim was satisfied as to the outcome of the transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-12\">The court declined to give this instruction to the jury, instead charging that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-13\">In considering whether or not the defendant you are considering acted in good faith, you are instructed that a belief by that defendant, if such a belief existed, that ultimately everything would work out so that no one would lose any money does not require a finding by you that the defendant acted in good faith. No amount of honest belief on the part of the defendant you are considering that no one will lose any money will excuse fraudulent actions or false representations to obtain money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-15\">The Heilmans also requested a charge concerning their theory of defense that included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-16\">[B]oth Judith May Heilman and Wayne Heilman argue that since they put up thirty two thousand dollars of their own money, and since they made good faith efforts to make payments on the mortgage and since the bank was secured by both an existing insurance policy and any loss due to its superior lien on the property, they could not have possibly intended any harm to the Freehold Savings Bank.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-17\">The district court did not adopt this instruction, but instead charged the jury as follows with respect to intent to defraud:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-18\">\u201cIntent to defraud\u201d means to act knowingly and with the specific intent to deceive for the purpose of causing some financial or property loss to another. The government is not required to prove that anyone was actually defrauded to establish a violation by the defendant you are considering. No actual pecuniary injury need result to the victim of the fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-19\">Under the mail fraud statute, the definition of property includes intangible property interests such as the right to control the use of one\u2019s own assets. This interest is injured when a person is deprived of information he would consider valuable in deciding how to use his assets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-20\">At the charging conference, defense counsel never took specific exception to any of the instructions that the court proposed to, and subsequently did, deliver to the jury. However, Judith Heilman\u2019s counsel, David Cooper, contended in general terms that Freehold Savings \u201cnever lost ... control of their money.... The control of the money never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>was with the Heilmans and the bank never lost it.\u201d The Mowing colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoB\">The Court: They\u2019re not in control because unless there was a default on the mortgage, the bank did not have that money available. It couldn\u2019t lend it to someone else, for example, who was in truth, who actually had met its [loan] standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACI\">Mr. Cooper: What I\u2019m suggesting is that loss of control \u2014 I still believe that no matter what the cases may say, that even if we have to accept a loss of control is the harm contemplated, it must be a loss of control that must have some sort of meaning. And I can understand that when a depositor gives money to a bank and then runs off with that money and do whatever they want with it, they\u2019ve really lost control of that money. When a contract is given by the government, that contract is gone. They\u2019ve lost control over it. The contract is disappeared once and forever.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5P\">That\u2019s just not true here. The loss of control here is of a very different order and I would submit that it\u2019s of such a different order that it doesn\u2019t really constitute the loss of control that is the harm that any case has ever contemplated because the money is not gone. And the Heilmans don\u2019t have control over it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOP\">The Court: I think you\u2019ve argued that. I think you\u2019ve argued that and I think th\u00e1t you agree that under <em>Wedtech </em>this is the harm contemplated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apop\">Mr. Cooper: I understand that the cases say that loss of control is the harm contemplated. I\u2019m not aware of any case that\u2019s reached this far out in the limit of a harmless harm. And I think it\u2019s still distinguishable from all the cases, including Wedtech____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alq\">The Court: I think we\u2019re rearguing a point that\u2019s been argued and argued and argued. I don\u2019t want to cut you short because it\u2019s a worth while point. And I am going to deny your Rule 29 motion on that basis and you may renew it if necessary. Now, if there is specific language\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AES\">Mr. Cooper: It\u2019s not the language.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVE\">The Court: Well, you have clearly reserved your position that the theory of inducing a bank to lend you money by making a representation when you know if the bank had known the truth it would not have made the loan is not sufficient to make out fraudulent intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP4\">Mr. Cooper: Exactly so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASn\">The district court thereafter read to the jury the instructions described above.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab2\">On December 17, 1992, the jury found Wayne Heilman guilty on both counts, and acquitted Judith Heilman. Heilman was sentenced on August 16, 1994 to three years\u2019 probation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"ACX\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"ASW\">Heilman advances two arguments on this appeal. First, he contends that the district court improperly instructed the jury on the \u201cright to control\u201d theory of mail and wire fraud. He claims that, in violation of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Mittelstaedt, </em>31 F.3d 1208 (2d Cir.1994), <em>cert. de</em>nied, \u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 738, 130 L.Ed.2d 640 (1995), the district court\u2019s instruction permitted the jury to convict him if it found that he intended to induce Freehold Savings to make a loan that it would not otherwise have made, irrespective of whether he intended to inflict any economic loss upon Freehold Savings.</p>\n<p id=\"Au0\">Second, Heilman submits that the evidence presented at his trial was insufficient as a matter of law to convict him for mail or wire fraud. Consistent with his objection to the language of the \u201cright to control\u201d instruction, Heilman argues that submitting false information to a bank in order to obtain a loan does not constitute mail or wire fraud when \u201cthat information had no impact on the ultimate value of the transaction to the bank.\u201d He contends that since the government offered nothing to demonstrate that Heilman\u2019s misrepresentation was material \u2014 i.e., that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>had sought to inflict an economic injury upon the bank \u2014 the evidence was legally insufficient to support his conviction for mail and wire fraud. We address these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">A. <em>Instructional Error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">We confront at the outset the government\u2019s contention that Heilman did not preserve his claim of instructional error, with the result that we may rule in his favor only if we find plain error in the court\u2019s instructions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b) (\u201cPlain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the [district] court.\u201d); <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1778, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (\u201cNormally, although perhaps not in every case, the defendant must make a specific showing of prejudice to satisfy the \u2018affecting substantial rights\u2019 prong of Rule 52(b).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Heilman argues that his codefendant\u2019s comments at the charging conference preserved his claim of instructional error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The government asserts that these comments were inadequate to satisfy the requirements of Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Apf\">No party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which that party objects and the grounds of the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Were it necessary to decide the issue, we would probably resolve it in Heilman\u2019s favor. Judge Cedarbaum explicitly stated at the charging conference: \u201c[Y]ou have clearly reserved your position that the theory of inducing a bank to lend you money by making a representation when you know if the bank had known the truth it would not have made the loan is not sufficient to make out fraudulent intent.\u201d We read counsel\u2019s immediately preceding comment that \u201cthe language\u201d of the district court\u2019s instruction was not at issue as simply acknowledging that the district court\u2019s proposed instruction fairly reflected the court\u2019s view of the necessary intent \u201cto defraud\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 1343. <em>See supra </em>notes 1 and 2. Counsel had made explicitly clear his disagreement with the court\u2019s view of the law, and proposed alternative instructions that the court rejected. It would have been superfluous, in our view, for counsel to have specified the particulars in which the court\u2019s instructions diverged from counsel\u2019s view of the governing law. <em>See Anderson v. Branen, </em>17 F.3d 552, 556-57 (2d Cir.1994) (\u201cThis Court ... will disregard the failure to object [to jury instructions] ... where the party\u2019s position has previously been made clear to the trial court and it was apparent that further efforts to object would be unavailing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">In any event, the issue need not be decided. As will appear, we believe that there was no error in the district court\u2019s instructions. Thus, we need not decide whether plain error review is applicable on this appeal. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1777 (\u201cThe first limitation on appellate authority under Rule 52(b) is that there indeed be an \u2018error.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Crowley v. Courville, </em>76 F.3d 47, 51 (2d Cir.1996) (when decision under review would be affirmed under any standard of review, no standard need be selected).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">\u201c \u2018A jury instruction is erroneous if it misleads the jury as to the correct legal standard or does not adequately inform the jury on the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Masotto, </em>73 F.3d 1233, 1238 (2d Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Anderson, </em>17 F.3d at 556), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>64 U.S.L.W. 3765 (U.S. May 1, 1996) (No. 95-1794). If such an error exists, \u201cwe will only reverse on this basis if [Heilman] can show that the charge given, when read as a whole, caused [him] prejudice.\u201d <em>United States v. Locascio, </em>6 F.3d 924, 939 (2d Cir. 1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 114 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>S.Ct. 1645, 1646, 128 L.Ed.2d 365 (1994); <em>see also Masotto, </em>73 F.3d at 1238 (\u201cAn erroneous instruction requires a new trial unless the error is harmless.\u201d); Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a) (\u201cAny error, defect, irregularity or variance which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The mail and wire fraud statutes make it a crime to use the mail or wires in furtherance of a \u201cscheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 1343, <em>supra </em>notes 1 and 2. Thus, \u201c\u2018[t]he essential elements of a mail [or wire] fraud violation are (1) a scheme to defraud, (2) money or property \u2022 [as the object of the scheme], and (3) use of the mails [or wires] to further the scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Miller, </em>997 F.2d 1010, 1017 (2d Cir.1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Wallach, </em>935 F.2d 445, 461 (2d Cir.1991) (some alterations added in <em>Miller)).</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">With respect to the second element of these offenses, the government need not prove that .the scheme successfully defrauded the intended victim. <em>Mittelstaedt, </em>31 F.3d at 1216. \u201cHowever, the government must show \u2018that some actual harm or injury was <em>contemplated </em>by the schemer.\u2019 \u201d <em>D'Amato, </em>39 F.3d at 1257 (quoting <em>United States v. Regent Office Supply Co., </em>421 F.2d 1174, 1180 (2d Cir.1970) (emphasis in <em>Regent Office Supply )). </em>Thus, fraudulent intent is \u201c[e]ssential to a scheme to defraud.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">In this case, the government sought to prove Heilman\u2019s, fraudulent intent based upon the theory that Heilman deprived Freehold Savings of information relevant to its decision whether it would extend him a loan; i.e., that he lied in order to deprive Freehold Savings of control over its own assets. This right to control \u201c \u2018theory is predicated on a showing that some person or entity has been deprived of potentially valuable economic information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Wallach, </em>935 F.2d at 462-63). Heilman contends that the jury instruction explicating the \u201cright to control\u201d theory in this case failed to comport with our decision in <em>Mittelstaedt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">In <em>Mittelstaedt, </em>the defendants were a consulting engineer to a village in Long Island, New York and his confederates. 31 F.3d at 1210. The engineer misappropriated information from the village concerning public works projects and then bid on the projects with his confederates, concealing from the village his economic interest in the transactions. <em>Id. </em>at 1211. On appeal, the engineer challenged his convictions for mail fraud with respect to one of these transactions. Reversing those convictions, we stated that \u201cthe information withheld either must be of some independent value or must bear on the ultimate value of the transaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1217. We ruled that the jury instructions \u201ceffectively permitted the jury to convict [the engineer] for nothing other than a breach of fiduciary duty,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1218,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and concluded that \u201clack of information that might have an impact on the decision regarding where [the defrauded party\u2019s] money is spent, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>more, is not a tangible harm and therefore does not constitute a deprivation of section 1341 \u2018property,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Heilman argues that the \u201cright to control\u201d instruction in this case contravenes our holding in <em>Mittelstaedt </em>because it permitted the jury to convict him in the absence of any evidence that he intended to inflict an economic injury upon Freehold Savings. As previously noted, the key portion of the challenged jury instruction states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">\u201cIntent to defraud\u201d means to act knowingly and with the specific intent to deceive <em>for the purpose of causing some financial or property loss to another. </em>The government is not required to prove that anyone was actually defrauded to establish a violation by the defendant you are considering. No actual pecuniary injury need result to the victim of the fraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">Under the mail fraud statute, the definition of property includes intangible property interests such as the right to control the use of one\u2019s own assets. This interest is injured when a person is deprived of <em>information he would consider valuable in deciding how to use his assets.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The first paragraph of the quoted instruction is clearly consistent with both <em>Mittelstaedt </em>and the other Second Circuit precedents that we have summarized in this opinion. The second paragraph, on the other hand, might be deemed facially at odds with the <em>Mittelstaedt </em>formulation that \u201clack of information that might have an impact on the decision regarding where [the defrauded party\u2019s] money is spent, without more, is not a tangible harm and therefore does not constitute a deprivation of section 1341 \u2018property.\u2019\u201d 31 F.3d at 1217. There is, however, a clear factual distinction between <em>Mittelstaedt </em>and this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">The jury instructions in <em>Mittelstaedt </em>left open the possibility of a conviction premised solely upon the disinclination of the municipal authorities \u201con general principles\u201d to deal with an insider who had abused his fiduciary position. <em>See </em>31 F.3d at 1218. In this case, by contrast, Conklin testified twice that Freehold Savings would not make a loan to <em>any </em>applicant whose income did not constitute twenty-eight percent of the debt service on the mortgage. Especially in view of the instruction that Heilman had to intend to cause the bank \u201csome financial or property loss,\u201d we find no basis upon which to conclude that Judge Cedarbaum\u2019s instruction regarding \u201cinformation [the bank] would consider valuable in deciding how to use [its] assets\u201d could have led the jury to find Hellman guilty for deceiving the bank in an immaterial way. \u201cTo be material, the information withheld either must be of some independent value or must bear on the ultimate value of the transaction.\u201d <em>Mittelstaedt, </em>31 F.3d at 1217 (citing <em>Carpenter, </em>484 U.S. at 27, 108 S.Ct. at 321). The information withheld in this case significantly diminished \u201cthe ultimate value of the [mortgage] transaction\u201d to the bank as defined by its standard lending practices, whether or not a subsequent default ensued.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, we believe that the instruction, \u201cwhen read as a whole,\u201d did not prejudice Hellman. <em>Locascio, </em>6 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">We note that there is some tension between <em>Mittelstaedt </em>and Judge Learned Hand\u2019s statement in <em>United States v. Rowe, </em>56 F.2d 747 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>286 U.S. 554, 52 S.Ct. 579, 76 L.Ed. 1289 (1932), that the mail fraud statute is designed to protect a defrauded party\u2019s right \u201cto bargain with the facts before him,\u201d whether or not there is proof of damage or of an unequal bargain. <em>Id. </em>at 749. In <em>Regent Office Supply, </em>however, we specified that <em>Rowe </em>would not \u201csupport the conclusion that no definable harm need be contemplated by the accused to find him guilty of mail fraud.\u201d 421 F.2d at 1181; <em>see also In re the Seizure of All Funds in Accounts in the Names Registry Publishing, Inc., </em>68 F.3d 577, 581-82 (2d Cir.1995) (construing <em>Regent Office Supply </em>as requiring that undisclosed facts be \u201cmaterial to the bargain\u201d that the defrauded party is induced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>to enter). The pertinent <em>Rowe </em>language was quoted with approval in <em>Wallach, </em>935 F.2d at 463, but <em>Wallach </em>is clearly a ease in which the withheld information was material; corporate insiders withheld information of improper dealings from the corporation\u2019s shareholders, and the effect of those dealings was to generate widespread federal investigations of the corporation and drive it into bankruptcy. <em>See </em>935 F.2d at 453; <em>see also Litwin v. American Express Co., </em>838 F.Supp. 855, 859 (S.D.N.Y.1993) (interpreting <em>Wallach </em>to require that \u201can. unlawful scheme to defraud must include at a minimum the potential for actual harm or injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">B. <em>The Sufficiency of the Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Heilman also relies primarily upon <em>Mittelstaedt </em>to contest the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his mail and wire fraud convictions. As with his claim of instructional error, Heilman argues that the government presented no evidence that he intended to cause any economic harm to Freehold Savings by misrepresenting his income. For the reasons discussed above, we reject this contention. The district court correctly instructed the jury on the \u201cright to control\u201d theory of ma\u00f1 and wire fraud, and the government presented sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to convict Heilman based upon that theory. <em>See D'Amato, </em>39 F.3d at 1256 (If the evidence \u201cviewed in the light most favorable to the government ... suffice[s] to convince any rational trier of fact that the crime charged has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, then the conviction must stand.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-10\">. As applicable to the conduct charged in this case, \u00a7 1341 stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7e\">Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, ... for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service, or takes or receives therefrom, any such matter or thing, or knowingly causes to be delivered by mail according to the direction thereon, or at the place at which it is directed to be delivered by the person to whom it is addressed, any such matter or thing, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b368-17\">. As applicable to the conduct charged in this case, \u00a7 1343 stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-18\">Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AYA\">. Because the conduct with which Heilman is charged took place prior to November 1, 1987, he is not subject to the provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines with respect to that conduct. <em>See United States v. Metallo, </em>908 F.2d 795, 800 (11th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 940, 112 S.Ct. 1483, 117 L.Ed.2d 625 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\">. The government asserts that Heilman cannot avail himself of an objection made by his codefendant\u2019s counsel because Heilman's counsel did not join in the objection. This argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Lefkowitz, </em>284 F.2d 310, 313 n. 1 (2d Cir.1960) (\u201cWe do not regard the failure of [defendant\u2019s] counsel to except [to the jury instruction] as barring [that defendant] from seeking reversal for error in the charge; [codefendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s] exception called the matter to the judge\u2019s attention and further exception would have been fruitless.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\">. Because both \u00a7 1341 and \u00a7 1343 are phrased in the disjunctive (\"[wjhoever, having devised ... any scheme or artifice to defraud, <em>or </em>for obtaining money or property [emphasis added]\u201d), it may appear odd that our cases require both a scheme or artifice to defraud <em>and </em>money or property as the object of the scheme. <em>Cf. United States v. Kennedy, </em>64 F.3d 1465, 1475 (10th Cir. 1995) (\"To prove a violation of the mail fraud statute, the government must prove ... the devising of a scheme or artifice either (a) to defraud or (b) for obtaining money by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises ----\u201d). Our formulation results from the Supreme Court\u2019s determination in <em>McNally v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 350, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987), and <em>Carpenter v. United States, </em>484 U.S. 19, 108 S.Ct. 316, 98 L.Ed.2d 275 (1987), that \u00a7 1341 \u201cis \u2018limited in scope to the protection of property rights.'\" <em>Carpenter, </em>484 U.S. at 25, 108 S.Ct. at 320 (quoting <em>McNally, </em>483 U.S. at 360, 107 S.Ct. at 2881-82); <em>see also Miller, </em>997 F.2d at 1016-17. The <em>McNally/Carpenter </em>rule has been limited by statute. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 (\"For the purposes of this chapter [which includes \u00a7\u00a7 1341 and 1343], the term \u2018scheme or artifice to defraud' includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\u201d). This case, however, does not present an \"honest services\u201d issue, and in any event, \u00a7 1346, whose effective date is November 18, 1988, <em>see Mittelstaedt, </em>31 F.3d at 1216, is inapplicable to the 1980-1981 transaction at issue on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b373-12\">. The events at issue predated the effective date of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346. <em>See supra </em>note 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b374-10\">. These practices are not arbitrary. A mortgage loan that is more exposed to default because of an inadequate income stream to fund the required periodic payments is reduced in value as an asset, and mortgages are often conveyed as assets in the secondary mortgage market. Further, an increased likelihood of default, and the resulting necessity for foreclosure, is in any event a less appealing prospect to a lender than an uninterrupted flow of periodic payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b375-9\">OAKES, Senior Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AUF\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">I concur in the judgment of the court. I agree that, in accordance with <em>United States v. Mittelstaedt, </em>31 F.3d 1208 (2d Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 115 S.Ct. 738, 130 L.Ed.2d 640 (1995), the income information withheld by Heilman can be viewed as material information depriving Freehold Savings of the right to control its decision regarding the grant of Heilman\u2019s loan application.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">I write separately only to point out that this case has an inherent inequity. Heilman was originally charged in a seventy-eight count, twenty-four defendant indictment of an organized crime group. For various reasons recited by the majority, nearly all of the counts against Heilman were eventually resolved in his favor. On a remand by this court of a few of those counts, the Government prosecuted Heilman solely for the fraudulent residential loan application. The Government chose to do so despite the fact that Freehold Savings\u2019s monetary interests were well secured at all times, <em>see supra </em>at 279, and the loan was repaid in full. That Freehold Savings was an innocent party is somewhat in doubt: after Heilman\u2019s income initially proved too small to support the loan, Freehold Savings asked whether he had any sources of income not previously disclosed. Heilman then told Freehold Savings of a $28,600 a year job as a flea market manager that he claimed to have held for three years. Freehold Savings accepted this sizable \u201coversight\u201d without further investigation, despite the fact that Heilman\u2019s income had previously proven to be too small. It seems to me that the parties to the loan probably knew exactly what was going on \u2014 despite Hellman\u2019s lack of provable income, Freehold Savings felt the loan was a good risk. Given these facts, I believe that the Government is very close to overreaching by prosecuting Heilman for this so-called scheme to defraud.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
