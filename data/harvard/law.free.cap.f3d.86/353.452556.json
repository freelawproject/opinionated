At sentencing the district court dismissed the \u00a7 924(c) count as to both defendants on double jeopardy grounds. The government appeals the dismissal of the gun count, and the defendants cross-appeal their sentences on the ACA count. Both defendants claim that the district court erred in applying the \u201cAggravated Assault\u201d guideline, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2(a), and Terry further claims that the court erred in failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>accord him \u201cminor participant\u201d status, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">We reverse the dismissal of the \u00a7 924(c) count, and we order that the defendants\u2019 convictions on that count be reinstated. We affirm the district court\u2019s sentencing determinations on the ACA count, except for one matter. Because reinstatement of the convictions on the \u00a7 924(c) count will affect how the sentence for the ACA count is calculated, we vacate the sentences and remand for re-sentencing on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Drunk after a successful day of turkey hunting, Terry and Bishop drove along Wildlife Road in the Jefferson National Forest, a federal reserve located in Virginia. They were in Bishop\u2019s full sized station wagon. Terry was driving and Bishop was riding in the passenger\u2019s seat. Two shotguns and one dead turkey were in the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Raymond Ellis drove up behind Terry and Bishop in his pickup truck. Because Wildlife Road is very narrow, Terry pulled over to let Ellis pass. As Ellis passed, Terry noticed that Ellis is black. Terry and Bishop are white. Terry said to Bishop, \u201cLet\u2019s Mil this son of a bitching nigger.\u201d Bishop reached into the back of the station wagon for his twelve-gauge shotgun. As Terry drove, Bishop loaded his gun and shot at Ellis\u2019 truck. After Bishop began shooting, Ellis accelerated in an effort to get away, but Terry sped up as well, allowing Bishop to continue to reload and shoot. Bishop admitted that he fired several times, but he was not sure of the exact number of shots. Ellis eventually escaped unharmed, but his truck required $2,869.89 worth of repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">A federal grand jury in the Western District of Virginia indicted Bishop and Terry on two counts. The first count charged that they \u201cdid unlawfully and maliciously shoot at an occupied veMcle, putting in peril the life of the occupant therein,\u201d in violation of Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-154, assimilated as a federal charge under the ACA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(a). The second count charged that Bishop and Terry used or carried a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Each man was convicted of both counts, Bishop upon a guilty plea and Terry after a jury trial. At the defendants\u2019 sentencing the district court (on its own motion) dismissed the \u00a7 924(c) count, holding that to convict for both counts would violate the Fifth Amendment\u2019s proMbition against double jeopardy. On the remaining ACA count, Terry was sentenced to 62 months of imprisonment and Bishop to 25 months.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">We agree with the government that conviction on both the ACA count and the gun count is not double jeopardy. Each offense contains one statutorily-mandated element that the other does not, and Congress has not expressed a clear intention that multiple punishment not be imposed. Accordingly, the district court erred in dismissing the \u00a7 924(c) count.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">If Congress clearly authorizes multiple punishments for the same act or transaction, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not offended when the multiple punishments are imposed after a single trial. <em>Albernaz v. United States, </em>450 U.S. 333, 344, 101 S.Ct. 1137, 1145, 67 L.Ed.2d 275 (1981). The task, then, is to determine whether Congress intended multiple punishment to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-17\">Our inquiry into Congressional intent is guided by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). We first examine whether proof of each crime \u201crequires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182. If the statutorily-defined elements of the crimes charged overlap (for example, where one crime is a lesser-included offense of the other), then a court must presume that Congress did not intend multiple punishment. <em>Rutledge v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -&amp; n. 6, 116 S.Ct. 1241, 1245 &amp; n. 6, 134 L.Ed.2d 419 (1996). TMs presumption may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>be overcome only if Congress has otherwise clearly indicated its desire to authorize multiple punishment. <em>Id. </em>at---, 116 S.Ct. at 1247-49; <em>Albernaz, </em>450 U.S. at 338-40, 101 S.Ct. at 1141-43; <em>Whalen v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 684, 692, 100 S.Ct. 1432, 1438, 63 L.Ed.2d 715 (1980). If, however, the statutory elements of the two crimes do not overlap, then multiple punishments are presumed to be authorized absent a clear showing of contrary Congressional intent. <em>Albernaz, </em>450 U.S. at 340, 101 S.Ct. at 1142-43; <em>United States v. Allen, </em>13 F.3d 105, 108-09 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The district court found that the elements of the two crimes charged overlap, saying \u201cyou have to actually pick up the weapon and fire into the vehicle to be guilty of\u2019 violating the Virginia statute. But a careful examination of the statutes at issue here reveals that the district court erred in its application of <em>Bloekburger, </em>and thereby misread Congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The ACA provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9_\">Whoever within [the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States] is guilty of any act or omission which, although not made punishable by any enactment of Congress, would be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the State, Territory, Possession or District in which such place is situated, by the laws thereof in force at the time of such act or omission, shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to a like punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(a). In this case the federalized offense was the Virginia crime of shooting or throwing a missile at an occupied vehicle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">Any person who maliciously shoots at, or maliciously throws any missile at or against, any ... motor vehicle or other vehicles when occupied by one or more persons, whereby the life of any person ... in such motor vehicle or other vehicle, may be put in peril, shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-154 (1995 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">The second count charged was a violation of 18 U.S:C. \u00a7 924(c), which provides that a person who, \u201cduring and in relation to any crime of violence [or drug-trafficking offense] for which he may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, shall\u201d be sentenced to five years imprisonment, such sentence to run consecutively to any other sentence imposed under any other count of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">In fact, the elements of the two crimes do not overlap. Section 924(c) does not require the involvement of a motor vehicle, nor does it require that any person\u2019s life \u201cbe put in peril,\u201d as the Virginia statute requires. Contrary to what the district court believed, the Virginia statute does not <em>require </em>the involvement of a firearm, as \u00a7 924(c) requires. By its terms, the Virginia statute prohibits the shooting or throwing of \u201cany missile\u201d at or against an occupied vehicle. Thus, a person may violate the Virginia statute by standing on an overpass and throwing a rock at a ear passing beneath. <em>See Willis v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 430, 393 S.E.2d 405, 412-13 (1990); <em>see also Highway Violence a Gratuitous Death, </em>Virginian-Pilot &amp; Ledger Star (Norfolk, Va.), Apr. 11, 1995, at A12 (rock); <em>Suffolk Crime Report, </em>Virginian-Pilot &amp; Ledger Star (Norfolk, Va.), Nov. 10, 1994, at 22 (pumpkin); <em>Rock-Throwing on 1-66, </em>Washington Post, Sept. 3, 1993, at B4 (rocks and bottles). Even though in this case the missile of choice was fired irom a gun, for purposes of double jeopardy analysis we examine only the statutory elements to determine if the elements of the two crimes charged <em>necessarily </em>overlap. <em>Block-burger, </em>284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182; <em>Allen, </em>13 F.3d at 109 n. 4. Because each crime charged contains an element that the other does not, the statutes pass the <em>Block-burger </em>test. Accordingly, we presume that Congress intended \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s mandatory five-year consecutive sentence to be imposed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">The burden thus falls on the defendants to overcome this presumption, a burden they have failed to carry. Section 924(c) by its terms applies to <em>\u201cany </em>crime of violence ... which [ ] may be prosecuted in a court of the United States\u201d (emphasis supplied). Furthermore, the section also says, <em>\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>court shall not place on probation or suspend the sentence of any person convicted of a violation of this subsection, nor shall the term of imprisonment imposed under this subsection run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment\u201d (emphasis supplied). We have held that \u00a7 924(c) authorizes enhanced punishment for all federal crimes in which a gun is used or' carried. <em>United States v. Camps, </em>32 F.3d 102, 108 (4th Cir. 1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 115 S.Ct. 1118, 130 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1995); <em>United States v. Shavers, </em>820 F.2d 1375, 1378 (4th Cir. 1987); see <em>also United States v. Handford, </em>39 F.3d 731, 733-34 (7th Cir.1994). And it is a federal crime to violate the ACA. <em>See United States v. Sharpnack, </em>355 U.S. 286, 289-92, 78 S.Ct. 291, 293-95, 2 L.Ed.2d 282 (1958); <em>United States v. Press Publishing Co., </em>219 U.S. 1, 10, 31 S.Ct. 212, 214, 55 L.Ed. 65 (1911); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>27 F.3d 111, 115 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The defendants argue that \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s legislative history supports their claim that Congress clearly intended to prohibit punishment under both the ACA and \u00a7 924(c). We need not examine the legislative history, however, because the text of \u00a7 924(c) plainly authorizes consecutive punishment. \u201c[W]hen a statute speaks with clarity to an issue, judicial inquiry into the statute\u2019s meaning, in all but the most extraordinary circumstance, is finished.\u201d <em>Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 115 S.Ct. 2144, 2147, 132 L.Ed.2d 226 (1995) (quoting <em>Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., </em>505 U.S. 469, 475, 112 S.Ct. 2589, 2594, 120 L.Ed.2d 379 (1992)); <em>see also Albernaz, </em>450 U.S. at 340-41, 101 S.Ct. at 1141-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">The defendants rely on <em>United States v. King, </em>824 F.2d 313 (4th Cir.1987), but that ease does not suggest the existence of any textual ambiguity here. In <em>King </em>we examined a statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3013, imposing a mandatory special assessment on any person \u201cconvicted of an offense against the United States.\u201d We held that the special assessment may be imposed for assimilated crimes only where state law authorizes \u201clike punishment.\u201d <em>King, </em>824 F.2d at 317-18. Virginia provides a penalty of two to ten years in prison for the crime of maliciously shooting at an occupied vehicle. <em>See </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-10(d) (1995 Supp.). Therefore, so long as enhancing the defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) does not result in a total sentence greater than ten years, \u00a7 924(c) and the ACA are completely consistent with one another. <em>United States v. Young, </em>916 F.2d 147, 150 (4th Cir.1990). The parties agree that on resentencing neither defendant will face a sentence in excess of ten years. Thus, in this case \u00a7 924(c) authorizes punishment like that authorized by Virginia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Because punishment (and therefore conviction) on both counts was proper, the district court erred in dismissing the \u00a7 924(c) count. The convictions on that count must be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">The defendants cross-appealed their sentences on the ACA count (count one), claiming that the district court improperly calculated their respective offense levels under the sentencing guidelines. We believe the district court applied the guidelines correctly with respect to count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-16\">The district court applied the guideline for \u201cAggravated Assault\u201d and assigned the defendants a base offense level of fifteen. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2(a). The defendants argue that the court instead should have applied the guideline for \u201cProperty Damage or Destruction\u201d and assigned a base offense level of four. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.3(a). We believe the district court applied the correct guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-17\">No guideline expressly covers the crime of shooting at an occupied vehicle. When no guideline expressly covers the crime of conviction, the sentencing court must \u201capply the most analogous offense guideline.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X5.1. In determining which guideline is most analogous, the sentencing court must, as the district court did here, look to \u201cthe offense conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>The indictment in this case charged that the defendants \u201cdid unlawfully and <em>maliciously </em>shoot at an occupied vehicle, <em>putting in peril </em>the life of the occupant therein\u201d (emphasis supplied). According to the Guidelines, \u2018\u201cAggravated assault\u2019 means a felonious assault that involved (a) a dangerous weapon with intent to do bodily harm <em>(i.e., </em>not merely to frighten), or (b) serious bodily injury, or (c) an intent to commit another felony.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2, Commentary (n. 1). The Guidelines do not define the term, \u201cProperty Damage or Destruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The defendants argue that <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>994 F.2d 1088 (4th Cir.1993), requires that the more lenient property damage guideline be applied. There the defendant was charged with \u201cattempting to damage and disable a motor vehicle with reckless disregard for human life while the vehicle was operated and employed in interstate commerce.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1090. We held that the property damage guideline was more analogous to the charged conduct than was the guideline actually applied, former U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E1.5 (extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s primary error in <em>Lambert </em>was that, in an effort to determine the true nature and gravity of the defendant\u2019s crime, it looked outside the conduct described in the indictment. <em>Lambert, </em>994 F.2d at 1091-92. The district court here committed no such error.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In any event, we believe the indictment in this case describes conduct much more serious than simple property damage and more serious than that charged in <em>Lambert. </em>Here the indictment charges that the defendants acted with malice and that they actually imperiled the life of another person. We recognize that the conduct described in the indictment does not match the Guidelines\u2019 definition of aggravated assault perfectly, but a perfect match is not required. The defendants\u2019 argument fails because the conduct charged in the indictment is more like aggravated assault than like property damage or destruction. <em>Lambert, </em>994 F.2d at 1092 &amp; n. 3; <em>see also United States v. Daniels, </em>948 F.2d 1033, 1036 (6th Cir.1991) (per curiam) (shooting into an occupied bus properly classified as \u201caggravated assault\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 912, 112 S.Ct. 1279, 117 L.Ed.2d 504 (1992). The district court did not err in determining the defendants\u2019 base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Terry claims the district court erred by refusing to grant him a two-point decrease in his offense level for being a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the crime. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). He claims he is entitled to an offense level decrease because he merely drove and never fired a shot. We affirm the district court\u2019s refusal to adjust Terry\u2019s offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">\u201cFor purposes of \u00a7 3B1.2(b), a minor participant means any participant who is less culpable than most other participants.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, Commentary (n. 3). A denial of a decrease in offense level on the basis of the defendant\u2019s \u201cminor participant\u201d status will be upheld unless the district court\u2019s decision was clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Madera-Gallegos, </em>945 F.2d 264, 269 (9th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Palinkas, </em>938 F.2d 456, 460 (4th Cir.1991). The district court\u2019s finding that Terry was not a minor participant is supported in the record. Bishop testified at Terry\u2019s trial that it was Terry\u2019s idea to chase Ellis, and Terry\u2019s decision to keep driving allowed Bishop to continue to shoot. Furthermore, we have held that it is not clearly erroneous to refuse a \u201cminor participant\u201d adjustment for a defendant whose only involvement in the criminal activity charged was to drive his confederates to and from the scene of the crime while knowing of their plans. <em>United States v. Sharp, </em>927 F.2d 170, 176 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 844, 112 S.Ct. 139, 116 L.Ed.2d 106 (1991). We do not believe the district court clearly erred in finding that Terry\u2019s role was not minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">The district court increased the defendants\u2019 offense levels by five pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2(b)(2)(A) (discharge of a firearm in connection with aggravated as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>sault). Given our ruling in part I that the firearms count must be reinstated, the five-level enhancement may not be applied to the ACA count. When a consecutive five-year sentence is imposed pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) \u201cin conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, any specific offense characteristic for the possession, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm ... is not to be applied in respect to the guideline for the underlying offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, Commentary (n. 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The order of the district court dismissing count two of the indictment is reversed, and the convictions on that count will be reinstated. The defendants\u2019 sentences on count one of the indictment are vacated, and the case is remanded for resentencing on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\n<em>REVERSED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-10\">.
