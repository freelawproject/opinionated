Wilbur (\u201cWilbur\u201d) appeals from an order entered on March 27, 1995, by the United States District Court for the District of Vermont, Franklin S. Billings, Jr., <em>Senior Judge, </em>granting summary judgment to Appellee Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (\u201cToyota\u201d). Wilbur sued Toyota for violating the Magnuson-Moss Warranty \u2014 Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2301-2312 (1994) (\u201cMMWA\u201d), and the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act, Vt.Stat.Ann. tit. 9, \u00a7\u00a7 2451-2480(g) (1993) (\u201cVCFA\u201d), by refusing to hon- or its new car warranty on her Toyota Camry. On appeal, Wilbur argues that the district court erred in finding as a matter of law that the warranty excluded damage done to the car before it was purchased. We agree with Wilbur that the damage occurring prior to the date the dealer listed the car as \u201cin service\u201d was not excluded from warranty coverage. Accordingly, we reverse the summary judgment in favor of Toyota and remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b114-16\">As this appeal requires us to review a grant of summary judgment, we must examine the facts in the light most favorable to Wilbur, the non-moving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2514, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-18\">On May 18, 1992, Wilbur bought a 1992 Toyota Camry for $18,600 from Tri-Nordic Toyota (\u201cTri-Nordic\u201d) in White River Junction, Vermont. The car had been used as a demonstrator by the dealership and had roughly 5,800 miles on the odometer. Wilbur\u2019s Bill of Sale identified the ear as a \u201cNew Camry Demo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-19\">Before Wilbur bought the car, Tri-Nordic informed her that the ear had been in an accident requiring almost $4,000 in repairs. The accident, a rear-end collision, occurred in October 1991 when one of Tri-Nordic\u2019s employees was using the car to look at New Hampshire\u2019s fall foliage with his relatives. Tri-Nordic told Wilbur that the car had been fully repaired and had sustained no structural damage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-20\">At the time of purchase, Wilbur received a copy of Toyota\u2019s \u201cNew Vehicle Limited Warranty\u201d which stated that the warranty went into effect \u201con the date the vehicle is first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>delivered or put into use (in-serviee date).\u201d Tri-Nordic filled in the in-service date as 5/18/92, the date Wilbur bought the car. The warranty further stated that \u201crepairs and adjustments required as a result of ... accident ... are not covered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">In June 1992, Wilbur drove the Camry to California for the summer. On the way, she discovered that the car\u2019s ABS braking system did not work, that the trunk had a major leak, and that the rear of the car made a creaking noise. When she brought the car to a Toyota dealer in California for repairs, the dealer told her that the repairs were excluded from warranty coverage because the vehicle had sustained structural damage in an accident. After making visits to several other dealerships, all of which refused to honor her Toyota warranty, Wilbur obtained an estimate of approximately $9,500 for the repairs. She also had the car appraised and learned that a potential buyer who knew of its condition would not have paid more than $10,000 for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Wilbur reported the repair estimate to Tri-Nordic, which offered to make the repairs if Wilbur agreed to split the cost of transporting the car back to Vermont. After refusing to do so, Wilbur made numerous complaints about the denial of warranty coverage to Toyota, Tri-Nordic, and the Attorney General of Vermont.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Wilbur brought suit in Vermont state court against Tri-Nordic and Toyota in February 1994, alleging that Toyota had violated the MMWA, that Tri-Nordic had violated the Vermont Motor Vehicle Manufactures, Distributors and Dealers Franchising Practices Act, Vt.Stat.Ann. tit. 9, \u00a7\u00a7 4083-4100 (1993), and that both parties had violated the VCFA. After removing the case to federal court, Toyota moved for summary judgment on both claims against it in February 1995. The district court granted the motion, holding that because the damage from the accident was excluded from coverage under the warranty as a matter of law, Toyota did not violate the MMWA or the VCFA when it refused to repair Wilbur\u2019s car.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">Wilbur raises two issues before us: (1) whether Toyota violated the MMWA by refusing to honor Wilbur\u2019s new car warranty and (2) whether Toyota\u2019s violation of the MMWA constitutes a deceptive practice under the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act. Wilbur argues that her warranty commenced in May 1992 and did not exclude the damage done to the ear in an accident seven months before. She therefore claims it was error for the district court to grant summary judgment to Toyota.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Anderson, 477 </em>U.S. at 251-52, 106 S.Ct. at 2511-12; <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2549-52, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and because \u201cno genuine issues of material fact are in dispute, we need only decide whether the law was correctly applied by the trial court.\u201d <em>Greene v. United States, </em>79 F.3d 1348, 1351 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-13\">Before discussing the merits, it will be helpful to explain how the parties refer to certain aspects of Toyota\u2019s warranty. When referencing the date on which the warranty commenced, the parties mean the date that starts the period in which exclusions spelled out in the warranty apply. Though they sometimes speak as if the warranty is not even applicable to the period before it commenced, they do not mean this literally: if a defect resulted from damage that occurred while the vehicle was being manufactured, for example, the warranty would apply to such a defect. Thus, when Toyota contends that the accident occurred during the warranty period and Wilbur says it did not, Toyota means that the accident exclusion in the warranty applied and relieved Toyota of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>liability, while Wilbur means that the accident exclusion did not apply and that therefore the warranty entitled her to compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">In this case, both sides agree that the warranty would cover a defect resulting from an accident that occurred before delivery to Tri-Nordic and would not cover a defect resulting from an accident that occurred after Wilbur bought the car. They dispute whether the warranty covers an accident that occurred during the period the ear was used by Tri-Nordic as a demo.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">The district court found that the warranty, with its accident exclusion, went into effect at the start of the demo period, that Wilbur \u201cassumed the remainder of the limited factory warranty\u201d when she bought the Camry and that the accident in October \u201coccurred during the course of the warranty,\u201d <em>i.e. </em>at a time when the warranty\u2019s accident exclusion was applicable. Because the warranty specifically excluded repairs resulting from accidents, the district court concluded that the damage to Wilbur\u2019s car was not covered. The MMWA mandated this conclusion, the district court reasoned, because the accident exclusion was clearly and conspicuously disclosed in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The central issue in this case is whether the warranty, with its accident exclusion, applied to the period before the in-service date when the car was being used as a demo. The district court found, and Toyota argues on appeal, that the warranty had already begun to run when the accident happened, over seven months before Wilbur purchased the car. A review of the warranty in light of the requirements of the MMWA, however, leads us to a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">The Toyota New Vehicle Limited Warranty issued to Wilbur at the time of purchase stated that \u201c[t]he warranty period begins on the date the vehicle is first delivered or put into use (in-service date).\u201d The in-service date was filled in by Tri-Nordic as May 18, 1992 \u2014 the day Wilbur bought the car. It seems evident, then, that the warranty had not commenced when the accident occurred and that therefore the repairs were not excluded from warranty coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Despite these facts, Toyota claims that a later section of the warranty book entitled \u201cCalifornia Emission Control Warranty\u201d makes clear that the warranty period begins</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-9\">on the date the vehicle is first delivered to the ultimate purchaser; or, if the vehicle is first placed into service as \u201cdemonstrator\u201d or \u201ccompany car\u201d prior to delivery, on the date it is first placed into service.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-10\">Toyota urges us to treat this isolated language, appearing ten pages later in the warranty book as part of a wholly separate warranty, as a clear indication to Wilbur that the New Vehicle Limited Warranty had commenced at the time of the accident. We are unwilling to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-11\">The MMWA grants relief to a consumer \u201cwho is damaged by the failure of a ... warrantor ... to comply with any obligation ... under a written warranty.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(d)(1) (1994). When drafting a written warranty, Toyota must \u201cfully and conspicuously disclose in simple and readily understood language [its] terms and conditions.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(a) (1994); <em>see also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of U.S., Inc. v. Abrams, </em>899 F.2d 1315, 1317 (2d Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>499 U.S. 912, 111 S.Ct. 1122, 113 L.Ed.2d <em>230 (1991). The </em>accompanying regulations define one such term as \u201c[t]he point in time or event on which the warranty term commences, if different from the purchase date.\u201d 16 C.F.R. \u00a7 701.3(a)(4) (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-12\">Facially, Toyota\u2019s New Vehicle Limited Warranty appears to fulfill the MMWA\u2019s clarity requirements: the warranty commences on the in-service date, which is filled in by the dealer when the car is sold. Failure to repair damage sustained before the in-service date therefore puts Toyota in violation of MMWA for breach of warranty. Moreover, Toyota\u2019s suggested addition of the California Emission Control Warranty\u2019s language renders the time of the warranty\u2019s commencement ambiguous at best: Is the \u201cin-service date\u201d the date the car is put into use by the buyer or by the dealer? Under Toyota\u2019s own construction, then, the warranty would violate the MMWA because it would not \u201cfully and conspicuously disclose\u201d its commencement date.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Toyota is thus placed in a somewhat uncomfortable position. If it subscribes to a straight reading of its New Vehicle Limited Warranty, it must concede that Wilbur\u2019s warranty had not commenced when the accident occurred and that its refusal to repair her car is a breach of warranty. If Toyota stands by the warranty construction it has pressed upon us here, its warranty must be deemed cryptic and unclear. In either case, Wilbur may recover damages under the MMWA 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(d)(1) (1994). <em>See Gochey v. Bombardier, Inc., </em>153 Vt. 607, 613, 572 A.2d 921, 924 (1990) (listing remedies available to consumer under the MMWA when manufacturer warrants defective goods).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Concededly, it was the actions of TriNordic, not Toyota, which resulted in the damage to the car that in turn led to this lawsuit. But Toyota provided Wilbur with a new car warranty and gave its dealer the authority to fill in the in-service date. The MMWA, by requiring any warrantor to draft clear warranty terms and conditions, simply incorporates the well-established contract principle of <em>contra proferentum </em>by which a drafting party must be prepared to have ambiguities construed against it. <em>Westchester Resco Co. v. New England Reins. Corp., </em>818 F.2d 2, 3 (2d Cir.1987); <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 206 (1981). We therefore find that Wilbur\u2019s claim under the MMWA cannot be defeated on Toyota\u2019s motion for summary judgment and must be allowed to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Because the district court based its decision in this case on the warranty\u2019s accident exclusion and did not address the warranty\u2019s commencement date, the court erred in granting summary judgment to Toyota on the MMWA claim. Thus, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Wilbur\u2019s state claim, based on its finding that the absence of liability under the MMWA removed any basis for recovery under the VCFA, was also in error. We reverse and remand both claims for reconsideration by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">We reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of Toyota and remand for further proceedings consistent with our reasoning above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-12\">. Wilbur\u2019s flane\u00e9, who was helping her look for a new car, asked to see the repair bills but TriNordic told him that the bills were lost.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b115-7\">. Wilbur and Tri-Nordic settled before trial and the claims against Tri-Nordic were dismissed with prejudice on July 28, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
