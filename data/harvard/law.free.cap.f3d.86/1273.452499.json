CABRANES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1355-5\">Petitioner Adriano Vargas appeals from a December 19, 1994, judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Michael B. Mukasey, Judge) dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. On appeal, Vargas contends that (1) the district court erred in concluding that the trial court\u2019s reasonable doubt instruction was not constitutionally deficient; and (2) the district court improperly deemed his challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s summation procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-6\">We conclude that the challenged instruction, when taken as a whole, neither overstated the degree of doubt necessary for acquittal nor shifted the burden of proof away from the prosecution. In addition, we agree with the district court that Vargas\u2019s challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s summation is procedurally barred and that a denial of relief would not result in a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-8\">The petitioner was charged with first-degree burglary and first- and second-degree robbery in connection with a February 22, 1988, incident at the Manhattan apartment of Carlos and Cecilia Carey. Two men forcibly entered the apartment, threatened Mr. and Mrs. Carey with a gun and a knife, tied the pair up with telephone cable, and ransacked the apartment. After reporting the robbery to the police and viewing police photographs, neither of the Careys was able to identify the perpetrators. Two weeks later, however, both selected a photograph of the petitioner. For reasons that are unclear, the petitioner was not apprehended. A month after the robbery, the Careys allegedly saw the petitioner on a subway car. Mr. Carey called the police, who drove him to an apartment building; Mr. Carey saw the petitioner standing at a third-floor window and identified him as one of the two robbers and as the person he had seen on the subway. The police arrested the petitioner outside of the apartment building shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-9\">The Supreme Court in New York County held a suppression hearing beginning on November 7, 1988, to determine the admissibility of the Careys\u2019 photographic identification of the petitioner and Carlos Carey\u2019s identification of the petitioner at the scene of his arrest. When the petitioner failed to appear on the second day of the suppression hearing, the court proceeded without him, but agreed not to rule on the suppression motions until both sides had attempted to locate the petitioner. After those efforts proved unsuccessful, the court rendered its decision declining to suppress the challenged evidence and proceeded with the trial on November 16 and 17, in the petitioner\u2019s absence but with defense counsel present and participating.</p>\n<p id=\"b1355-11\">In his instructions to the jury, the trial judge defined reasonable doubt in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1355-12\">A reasonable doubt is a doubt which you consciously have after the use of your powers of reasoning which arises out of the credible evidence or the lack of credible evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1355-13\">It is a doubt <em>for which you can give a reason if called upon to do so by a fellow juror in the jury room. </em>The standard of reason must be prevailing. When you are convinced that you have no doubt in reason of the defendant[\u2019]s guilt, that is when you will be justified in rendering a verdict accordingly. Consequently, after fairly and fully considering all of the evidence and the lack of evidence and <em>using the same power of reasoning and power of thinking that would apply and do apply to weigh the importance of matters related to the [sic] important business affairs, </em>if you then believe that each element of the crime submitted to you[] has been established beyond a reasonable doubt, you would be justified in finding the defendant guilty of that crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1355-14\">(Emphasis supplied.) After deliberating for one hour, the jury convicted the petitioner on all three counts of the indictment. The petitioner was re-arrested several weeks later, and the court imposed concurrent sentences of eight to sixteen years imprisonment on the burglary and first-degree robbery counts, and seven-and-a-half to fifteen years imprisonment on the second-degree robbery count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>Vargas challenged his conviction on direct appeal. He did not challenge his trial <em>in absentia, </em>but claimed primarily that the trial court\u2019s instructions on reasonable doubt were erroneous and that the proceedings had been infected by improper prosecutorial comments on summation. On July 3, 1990, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the conviction, finding no error in the reasonable doubt instruction and concluding that the petitioner\u2019s challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s summation was procedurally barred in light of his counsel\u2019s failure to interpose an objection at trial, and (in any event) that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were not improper. <em>People v. Vargas, </em>163 A.D.2d 39, 39, 559 N.Y.S.2d 631, 632 (1st Dep\u2019t 1990) (mem.). The petitioner\u2019s application for leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals was denied. 76 N.Y.2d 945, 563 N.Y.S.2d 74, 564 N.E.2d 684 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">In June 1992, Vargas moved under \u00a7\u00a7 440.10 and 440.20 of the New York Criminal Procedure Law for a new trial or to set aside his sentence. He claimed that the court had improperly proceeded to trial in his absence and challenged his sentencing on the ground that the Probation Department had omitted his statement from the presentence report. On July 13, 1992, the New York Supreme Court denied the petitioner\u2019s motion, and the Appellate Division denied his application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">Vargas filed the instant federal petition on November 15, 1993, claiming that the trial court\u2019s reasonable doubt instruction was constitutionally deficient, the prosecutor\u2019s improper summation tainted the proceedings, and the omission of his statement from the presentence report rendered his sentencing proceeding invalid. By an order of November 26, 1993, Judge Mukasey referred the petition to Magistrate Judge Michael H. Dolinger. In a Report and Recommendation filed September 21, 1994, the magistrate judge concluded that the petition should be denied, because: (1) the trial court\u2019s reasonable doubt instruction was not constitutionally deficient, and in fact closely tracked approved New York pattern jury instructions; (2) in light of defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks during summation, the petitioner\u2019s challenge to those remarks was procedurally barred; and (3) the petitioner\u2019s sentencing challenge did not raise a federally cognizable claim. On December 19, 1994, Judge Mukasey adopted the report of the magistrate judge over the petitioner\u2019s objection and issued a certificate of probable cause to appeal. We appointed counsel to brief and argue the appeal. The petitioner pursues on appeal only his claims that the trial court\u2019s reasonable doubt instruction was constitutionally deficient and that the district court erred in treating his challenge to the prosecutor\u2019s summation as procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-7\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-8\">A. <em>Reasonable Doubt Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1356-9\">In a state criminal trial, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the accused from conviction unless the prosecution \u201cpersuade[s] the fact-finder \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 of the facts necessary to establish\u201d each element of the offense charged. <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275, 278, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 2080-81, 124 L.Ed.2d 182 (1993) (citations omitted); <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1072-73, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970). A jury instruction that permits conviction on a lesser standard \u2014 by shifting the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defendant, or by suggesting that a higher degree of doubt than \u201creasonable\u201d doubt is necessary for acquittal \u2014 is constitutionally deficient. Any such deficiency would be a <em>per se </em>ground for reversal of a criminal conviction: because the Sixth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause together require a jury verdict of guilty \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d a guilty verdict rendered by a jury applying a less demanding standard of proof is not a jury verdict at all within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. <em>Sullivan, </em>508 U.S. at 278, 280, 113 S.Ct. at 2080-81, 2082. In such circumstances, harmless error analysis \u2014 which permits a reviewing court to determine whether a jury would have rendered the same verdict of guilty absent the constitutional error occurring at trial \u2014 simply cannot apply. <em>Id.; see Chal</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number><em>mers v. Mitchell, </em>73 F.3d 1262, 1267 (2d Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-4\">Although a constitutional infirmity in a reasonable doubt instruction is a <em>per se </em>ground for reversal of a criminal conviction, not every unhelpful, unwise, or even erroneous formulation of the concept of reasonable doubt in a jury charge renders the instruction constitutionally deficient. The reviewing court must examine the charge as a whole, <em>see Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 146-47, 94 S.Ct. 396, 400-01, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973), and assess \u201cwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instructions to allow conviction based on proof insufficient to meet\u201d the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, <em>Victor v. Nebras</em>ka, 511 U.S. 1,-, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 1243, 127 L.Ed.2d 583 (1994). <em>See Chalmers, </em>73 F.3d at 1267 (\u201cSometimes, erroneous portions of the jury instructions are offset when considered in context or explained by the trial court in later sections of the instruction. [At] [o]ther times, a seemingly innocuous incorrect statement becomes extremely damaging when coupled with other sections of the jury instructions or with improper conduct by counsel during the trial.\u201d (citations omitted)). Accordingly, an asserted error in a reasonable doubt instruction may be innocuous or inconsequential when viewed in the context of the charge as a whole; surrounded by different language in a different charge, however, the same language may create a constitutional infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-6\">In the instant case, the petitioner identifies two alleged errors that, taken separately or together, are said to render the state trial court\u2019s instruction constitutionally deficient. First, the petitioner claims that it is reasonably likely that jurors would have understood the court\u2019s characterization of a \u201creasonable doubt\u201d as a doubt \u201cfor which you can give a reason if called upon to do so by a fellow juror in the jury room\u201d: (1) to require, for acquittal, not only a doubt that seems \u201creasonable\u201d in the juror\u2019s mind, but a doubt that is articulable to a fellow juror; and (2) to shift to the defendant or to fellow jurors the burden to supply a doubt that is both reasonable and articulable. Second, the petitioner claims that, in instructing the jurors to apply to their deliberations \u201cthe same power of reasoning and power of thinking\u201d that they would apply \u201cto weigh the importance of matters related to ... important business affairs,\u201d the trial court conveyed to the jurors the impression that they would be required to vote for conviction once they had given the evidence no more consideration than they would give to their \u201cbusiness affairs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-8\">We analyze the asserted defects in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1357-9\">1. <em>Reasonable doubt as \u201ca doubt for which you can give a reason if called upon to do so by a fellow juror.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1357-10\">As the report of the magistrate judge noted, the trial court\u2019s characterization of reasonable doubt as \u201cdoubt for which you can give a reason if called upon to do so by a fellow juror\u201d is a variation on New York\u2019s pattern jury instructions, which define reasonable doubt in part as \u201ca doubt for which some reason can be given.\u201d 1 Criminal Jury Instructions (New York) \u00a7 3.07, at 92 (1983); <em>see, e.g., People v. Malloy, </em>55 N.Y.2d 296, 300, 303, 449 N.Y.S.2d 168, 170, 171, 434 N.E.2d 237, 238-39, 239-40 (charge defining reasonable doubt as \u201ca doubt for which you can conscientiously express a reason\u201d was \u201cneither confusing nor inaccurate\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 847, 103 S.Ct. 104, 74 L.Ed.2d 93 (1982); <em>see also Leecan v. Lopes, </em>893 F.2d 1434, 1443 (2d Cir.) (rejecting habeas challenge to Connecticut trial court\u2019s definition of reasonable doubt as \u201ca doubt for which a reasonable man can give a valid reason\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>496 U.S. 929, 110 S.Ct. 2627, 110 L.Ed.2d 647 (1990). As we have previously noted, instructions tying \u201creasonable doubt\u201d to a doubt \u201cfor which you can give a reason\u201d \u2014 or, in the more passive formulation, \u201cfor which a reason can be given\u201d \u2014 may well be unwise, because of the possibility that such an instruction will \u201cintimidate a juror by suggesting that he may be called upon to explain his doubts.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>328 F.2d 864, 867 (2d Cir.1964) (rejecting challenge to instruction defining reasonable doubt as \u201ca doubt for which you can give a reason\u201d). More recently, we have had occasion to consider the constitutionality of a state trial court instruction defining reasonable doubt as \u201ca doubt for which some <em>good </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>reason can be given.\u201d <em>Chalmers, </em>73 F.3d at 1267 (emphasis supplied). While we noted that the \u201cgood reason\u201d language constituted an \u201cincorrect statement of law which should never be made,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1266, we concluded that, viewed in light of the charge as a whole, the challenged language did not raise the quantum of doubt necessary for acquittal or shift the burden of proof away from the prosecution, <em>id. </em>at 1268-69. Vargas argues that the trial court\u2019s instruction in this case is more dangerous than the instruction in <em>Chalmers </em>or the New York pattern jury charge, because of its assertedly more direct suggestion that a juror must be prepared to expound, in the jury room, upon his reasons for doubting the defendant\u2019s guilt. That is, the petitioner claims that even if the \u201cdoubt for which a reason can be given\u201d formulation is appropriate, the added language here \u2014 \u201cif called upon to do so by a fellow juror\u201d \u2014 in substance conveyed to the jurors that they might indeed be called upon to articulate the basis for their doubts. Two constitutional deficiencies are said to follow: (1) the instruction is reasonably likely to have conveyed to the jury the idea that a doubt sufficient to justify acquittal must not only be \u201creasonable,\u201d but must also be \u201carticulable\u201d to one\u2019s fellow jurors; and (2) the instruction is reasonably likely to have compelled the jurors to look to the petitioner or to one another to supply an articulable doubt, thus shifting the burden of proof away from the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-4\">Placing the challenged language in the context of the full charge, we find no reasonable likelihood that the jurors would have understood the instruction to increase the degree of doubt necessary for acquittal. The premise of the petitioner\u2019s challenge \u2014 and, indeed, of challenges to instructions such as those in <em>Davis </em>and <em>Leecan, </em>which do not include the language \u201cif called upon to do so by a fellow juror\u201d \u2014 is that a juror may hold a reasonable doubt of a defendant\u2019s guilt, based on the evidence or lack of evidence offered by the prosecution, and yet be unable to articulate that doubt. Even if we assume that there exists a category of \u201creasonable\u201d yet not \u201carticulable\u201d doubt, we do not see how the addition of the phrase \u201cif called upon to do so by a fellow juror\u201d alters the substance of the instruction sustained in cases such as <em>Davis </em>and <em>Leecan </em>in any constitutionally significant way. The challenged language does not suggest \u2014 any more than the \u201cfor which a reason can be given\u201d formulation standing alone \u2014 that a juror <em>will </em>be called upon to articulate his doubts, or that he <em>must </em>articulate them if so called upon. Moreover, language surrounding the challenged language renders it unlikely that jurors would interpret the passage to require a higher degree of doubt than \u201creasonable\u201d doubt for acquittal. The challenged language was immediately preceded and followed by language giving additional content to the phrase \u201creasonable doubt,\u201d emphasizing that the jurors\u2019 task was to engage in a careful, reasoned analysis of the evidence\u2014 or lack of evidence \u2014 presented. Accordingly, the jury was unlikely to have understood the challenged language to bear upon the <em>degree </em>or <em>quantum </em>of doubt necessary for acquittal, but rather, upon the appropriate <em>basis </em>for the formulation of a doubt sufficient for acquittal: as the charge properly stated, a \u201creasonable\u201d doubt is not \u201cjust any kind of doubt, a mere whim or a guess or a feeling, or a surmise that the accused may not be guilty,\u201d but a doubt that \u201carises out of the credible evidence or the lack of credible evidence.\u201d Viewed in context, the challenged language simply does not suggest that a doubt formulated within one\u2019s own mind\u2014 reasonable, but not articulable \u2014 is insufficient for acquittal. Rather, it serves to emphasize, in conjunction with surrounding language, that any doubt sufficient for acquittal must be based on a reasoned evaluation of the evidence or lack of evidence, rather than on speculation, emotion, or whim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1358-6\">As to the second asserted danger of the relevant language \u2014 that the jurors would look to the defendant or to one another to supply an articulable reason for doubt before voting to acquit \u2014 we conclude that, viewing the charge as a whole, there is no reasonable likelihood that the jurors interpreted the instruction as shifting the burden of proof away from the prosecution. Language preceding the challenged passage makes clear that the burden of proof \u201cremains upon the prosecution throughout the trial and never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>shifts to the defendant\u201d and that \u201ceach and every element of [the] crime submitted to you ... must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt by the prosecution.\u201d Indeed, the trial court, in the time-honored tradition of cautious trial courts, emphasized the prosecution\u2019s burden to prove the elements of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt <em>ad nauseam </em>\u2014 no fewer than fifteen times throughout the course of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\">2. <em>Applying \u201cthe same power of reasoning\u201d as is applied to \u201cimportant business affairs.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">The petitioner also challenges a portion of the charge instructing the jurors to \u201cuse the same power of reasoning and power of thinking\u201d as they would apply in \u201cmatters related to [their] important business affairs.\u201d The challenged language bears some resemblance to instructions defining reasonable doubt as a doubt that would cause a reasonable person to \u201chesitate to act\u201d in important personal affairs. The \u201chesitate to act\u201d formulation has consistently been approved, <em>see Victor, </em>511 U.S.-, 114 S.Ct. at 1250; <em>Holland v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 121, 140, 75 S.Ct. 127, 137-38, 99 L.Ed. 150 (1954); <em>Perez v. Irwin, </em>963 F.2d 499, 502 (2d Cir.1992), although courts have questioned the propriety of analogizing the deliberative process that jurors must undertake in a criminal trial to the thought process they undertake in weighing important personal decisions, <em>see United States v. Reese, </em>33 F.3d 166, 172 (2d Cir.1994) (noting \u201congoing debate\u201d about propriety of instruction defining reasonable doubt as \u201ca doubt which would make each of you hesitate to act in the more serious and important affairs of your own lives\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 115 S.Ct. 756, 130 L.Ed.2d 655 (1995); <em>United States v. Noone, </em>913 F.2d 20, 28-29 (1st Cir.1990) (\u201cThe momentous decision to acquit or convict a criminal defendant cannot be compared with ordinary decision-making without risking trivialization of the constitutional standard.\u201d (citing <em>Dunn v. Perrin, </em>570 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>437 U.S. 910, 98 S.Ct. 3102, 57 L.Ed.2d 1141 (1978))), <em>cert. denied, </em>500 U.S. 906, 111 S.Ct. 1686, 114 L.Ed.2d 81 (1991); <em>see also Victor, </em>511 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 1252 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (noting observation of 1987 report to Judicial Conference of the United States that analogy underlying \u201chesitate to act\u201d formulation is misplaced: \u201c\u2018[The] decisions we make in the most important affairs of our lives ... generally involve a very heavy element of uncertainty and risk-taking.\u2019\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-11\">The petitioner claims that the instruction in the instant case is in fact considerably different from and more harmful than the ordinary \u201chesitate to act\u201d formulation, in two respects. First, the jury was told to analogize not to important <em>personal </em>decisions, but to <em>business </em>decisions, which are potentially more speculative and risk-laden. Second, the jury was not told to <em>hesitate </em>to act, but to <em>convict </em>after \u201cweighting] the evidence no more carefully than when one makes a \u2018business decision.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 27. The petitioner thus contends that the instruction: (1) trivialized the deliberative process the jurors were to undertake; and (2) diluted the concept of \u201creasonable doubt\u201d by conveying that conviction was required as long as any doubts the jurors harbored were not of a kind that would prevent them from going forward with a business transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-12\">Considering this language in the context of the full charge, we find no reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instruction to permit conviction after anything but a process of careful deliberation or upon less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Leaving aside the general propriety of instructions analogizing a criminal jury\u2019s deliberative process with the process involved in making important personal or business decisions, the inclusion of the reference to \u201cimportant business affairs\u201d here could not have suggested to the jurors that they were to undertake a haphazard or speculative inquiry. On the contrary, the trial court\u2019s reference to \u201cthe power of reasoning and power of thinking\u201d associated with important business deliberations served to reinforce its earlier instruction to decide the facts \u201ccoolly, calmly and deliberately,\u201d not to \u201cindulge in speculation or guesswork\u201d or \u201cconjecture,\u201d and to \u201cfairly and full[y] consider[ ] all the evidence and lack of evidence.\u201d Similarly, the instruction did not suggest that the doubts assoeiat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>ed with the factfinding process in a criminal trial are anything like doubts that tend to arise during consideration of business decisions, let alone that the jurors were required to convict unless they held the sort of doubts that would prevent them from acting in important business matters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">In sum, it simply cannot be said that the asserted errors, taken separately or together, render the challenged reasonable doubt instruction constitutionally deficient. We pause only to make clear that in so holding w\u00e9 do not mean to suggest that the elaboration of the concept of reasonable doubt chosen by the trial court \u2014 and particularly, the reference to reasonable doubt as a doubt \u201cfor which you could give a reason if called upon to do so by a fellow juror\u201d \u2014 was prudent or desirable. Courts have long recognized that the concept of \u201creasonable doubt\u201d is not susceptible of easy definition. <em>See, e.g., Holland, </em>348 U.S. at 140, 75 S.Ct. at 138 (\u201cAttempts to explain the term \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 do not usually result in making it any clearer to the minds of the jury.\u201d (quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States v. Birbal, </em>62 F.3d 456, 457 (2d Cir.1995) (noting that requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is \u201cone of the least susceptible to verbal formulation\u201d). Indeed, at least two Courts of Appeals have instructed district courts within their circuits that the concept is best left unexplained. <em>See United States v. Adkins, </em>937 F.2d 947, 950 (4th Cir.1991) (\u201cThis circuit has repeatedly warned against giving the jury definitions of reasonable doubt, because definitions tend to impermissibly lessen the burden of proof____\u201d); <em>United States v. Hall, </em>854 F.2d 1036, 1039 (7th Cir.1988) (\u201c[A]t best, definitions of reasonable doubt are unhelpful to a jury____ An attempt to define reasonable doubt presents a risk without any real benefit.\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 1043-45 (Posner, J., concurring). There is some merit in admonitions, by courts exercising direct supervisory authority, regarding the danger of straying from tried and tested pattern jury instructions on reasonable doubt. In this instance, however, we are mindful that the challenge to the trial court\u2019s instruction arises on habeas review, and our inquiry is whether the instruction is constitutional, not whether it is exemplary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-11\">B. <em>Prosecution\u2019s Summation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-12\">The petitioner also claims that certain remarks made by the prosecutor during her summation deprived him of a fair trial. Specifically, the petitioner contends that the prosecutor (1) improperly invited the jury to convict based on the defendant\u2019s purported \u201carrogance\u201d; (2) misstated the evidence by claiming that the defendant \u201cthought he could bully into an apartment with a gun,\u201d when it was undisputed that only one of the perpetrators \u2014 not the defendant \u2014 had brandished a gun; and (3) suggested to the jury that the evidence in the case showed the defendant\u2019s guilt so clearly that the trial itself was superfluous. At trial, defense counsel failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks. On direct appeal, the Appellate Division concluded that Vargas\u2019s challenge to those remarks was not preserved for review, and, in any event, was without merit. <em>Vargas, </em>163 A.D.2d at 39, 559 N.Y.S.2d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-15\">As the district court correctly noted, the petitioner\u2019s procedural default constitutes an adequate and independent state law ground for rejection of his claim. Accordingly, federal review of the claim is barred unless the petitioner can demonstrate cause for the procedural default and prejudice flowing therefrom, <em>see Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 87-91, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 2506-2509, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977), or that \u201cfailure to consider the claim[] will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice,\u201d <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 2565, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991). The petitioner does not attempt to show cause or prejudice, and we agree with the district court that the record does not support a conclusion that the failure to grant relief will result in a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">To summarize:</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">1. Examining the state trial court\u2019s jury charge as a whole, we find no reasonable likelihood that the jury understood the instruction to overstate the degree of doubt necessary for acquittal or to shift the burden of proof away from the prosecution. Accordingly, the instruction is not constitutionally deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-7\">2. The petitioner\u2019s challenge to remarks made during the prosecutor\u2019s summation is proeedurally barred, and the record does not support a finding that a denial of relief would result in a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1360-9\">. Leaving aside the fact that the charge in this case underscored the need for careful deliberation, we note the dubious premise underlying the petitioner's argument \u2014 namely, that the phrase \"business affairs\u201d as used in such instructions necessarily connotes trade or commerce (and an associated decision-making process that is inherently risky or speculative). The term \"business\u201d is broad, and surely encompasses matters of personal as well as commercial concern.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1361-9\">WEINSTEIN, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ACL\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-10\">While concurring with the judgement and rationale of the majority opinion, I add these comments to explain the alternate route by which I arrive at the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-11\">Following the post-argument conference with the other members of the panel where affirmance was agreed upon, a Questionnaire, <em>infra, </em>was distributed by the concurring judge on his own motion to twelve jurors and four alternates. They had been selected after a full voir dire; represented an excellent cross-section of citizens in the Eastern District of New York; were observed by the court to be highly responsible in exercising their duties as jurors; and had been discharged after sitting in a simple credit card fraud case in which the defendant had been convicted. The parties in the case and the jurors agreed to the study.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-12\">The independent answers of each juror, with respect to different forms of reasonable doubt charges are summarized in the Table of Results, <em>infra. </em>The inquiry suggests that jurors are not as sensitive to the nuances of various charges on reasonable doubt as judges and lawyers seem to be.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-13\">Much has been written on how the jury interprets, understands and applies judicial instructions on the law. Professors Kalven and Zeisel have suggested that the jury sometimes applies a different standard of reasonable doubt than the judge has in mind, possibly because jurors are willing to tolerate less doubt of guilt than a judge. <em>See </em>Harry Kalven, Jr. and Hans Zeisel, <em>The American Jury, </em>182-190 (1966). Another authority notes that \u201c[for jurors] there is the realm of values alone, where the jurors\u2019 sense of justice \u2014 their sentiments <em>concerning the </em>law\u2014 may lead them to hold standards that are different from those of black-letter law.\u201d Norman J. Finkle, <em>Commonsense Justice: Juror\u2019s Notions of the Law </em>53 (1995) (emphasis in original). <em>See also, e.g., </em>Alan M. Dershowitz, <em>Reasonable Doubts </em>69-72, 93-94 (1996). As Judge Woodlock reminded us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AGM\">the concept of reasonable doubt has an <em>a priori </em>existence in the minds of all jurors. This original juror understanding of reasonable doubt is apparently considered under the case law constitutionally sufficient to resist most infectious errors communicated by misformulated charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1361-15\"><em>Smith v. Butler, </em>696 F.Supp. 748, 765-766 (D.Mass.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-16\">Studies on the effect of reasonable doubt instructions have failed to yield clear results. <em>See, e.g., </em>Amiram Elwork, Bruce D. Sales and James J. Alfini, <em>Making Jury Instructions Understandable </em>(1982); Jacquelyn L. Bain, <em>A Proposed Definition of Reasonable Doubt and the Demise of Circumstantial Evidence Following Hankins v. State, </em>15 St. Mary\u2019s L.J. 353 (1984); Norbert L. Kerr, Robert S. Atkin, Gerald Stasser, David Meek, Robert W. Holt and James H. Davis, <em>Guilt Beyond a Reasonable Doubt: Effects of Concept Definition and Assigned Decision Rule on the Judgements of Mock Jurors, </em>34 J.Pers. &amp; Soc.Psych. 282 (1976); Jon O. Newman, <em>Beyond \u201cReasonable Doubt\u201d, </em>68 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 979 (1994); Laurence J. Severance and Elizabeth F. Loftus, <em>Improving the Ability of Jurors to Comprehend and Apply Criminal Jury Instructions, </em>17 Law &amp; Soc. Rev. 153 (1982); Walter W. Steele, Jr. and Elizabeth G. Thornburg, <em>Jury Instructions: A Persistent Failure to Communicate, </em>67 N.C.L.Rev. 77 (1988); David U. Strawn and Raymond W. Buchanan, <em>Jury Confusion: A Threat to Justice, </em>59 Judicature 478 (1976); Henry A.

L.Rev.1955 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\">The form of definition is not without some effect. Kerr and his colleagues compared three different instructions given to mock juries. One instruction did not define reasonable doubt, one gave a lax definition, while the third provided a stringent definition. The only firm conclusion was that the lax definition yielded the highest mock conviction rate. Norbert L. Kerr, Robert S. Atkin et al., <em>Guilt Beyond a Reasonable Doubt: Effects of Concept Definition and Assigned Decision Rule on the Judgements of Mock Jurors, </em>34 J.Pers. &amp; Soc.Psych. 282, 286 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-5\">Severance and Loftus attempted with limited success to improve comprehension of legal concepts such as reasonable doubt and intent by changing pattern jury instructions according to psycholinguistic principles. The authors concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1362-6\">While our findings demonstrate the value of using psycholinguistic principles to rewrite pattern jury instructions, the measures reveal that considerable numbers of errors in comprehension and application remain even with the revised instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1362-7\">Laurence J. Severance and Elizabeth F. Loftus, <em>Improving the Ability of Jurors to Comprehend and Apply Criminal Jury Instructions, </em>17 Law &amp; Soc.Rev. 153, 194 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-8\">Most of these studies have limited utility. As one summary indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1362-9\">Many of the studies do not deal specifically with reasonable doubt instructions. Other studies fail to compare the comprehension or application errors of subjects who receive a reasonable doubt instruction that includes a definition with those of subjects who receive an instruction that does not include a definition. Some research even indicates that definitions may impair a jury\u2019s understanding of the reasonable doubt concept.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1362-10\">Note, <em>Reasonable Doubt: An Argument Against Definition, </em>108 Harv.L.Rev.1955, 1964-65 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-11\">Jury comprehension of instructions is estimated by researchers as low (a view not shared by the concurring judge). <em>See </em>Walter W. Steele, Jr. and Elizabeth G. Thornburg, <em>Jury Instructions: A Persistent Failure to Communicate, </em>67 N.C.L.Rev. 77, 78 (1988). Reasonable doubt seems particularly difficult to define. Most attempts fall short of improving juror understanding. As noted by Strawn and Buchanan,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABJO\">in some eases (for example, instructions about \u201cdemeanor\u201d and \u201creasonable doubt\u201d) there was a <em>loss </em>of understanding after hearing the instructions, indicating that some instructions were producing <em>confusion, </em>not comprehension.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1362-12\">David U. Strawn and Raymond W. Buchanan, <em>Jury Confusion: A Threat to Justice, </em>59 Judicature 478, 482 (1976) (emphasis in original). It is \u201cunsettling that we are using a formulation that we believe will become less clear the more we explain it.\u201d Jon 0. Newman, <em>Beyond \u201cReasonable Doubt\u201d, </em>68 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 979, 984 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-13\">Experience suggests that the unvarnished constitutionally sufficient minimum jury charge may be best. <em>See In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1072, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970); <em>see also </em>letter I in Table of Results, <em>infra. </em>Under this standard the jury is told only that the government must prove each element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt. This form may well provide close to maximum protection for the defendant. Any modifying language may have a dilutive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-14\">This bare bones charge has already been approved by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits. All have held that jury instructions defining reasonable doubt are not required and should be avoided. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Oriakhi, </em>57 F.3d 1290, 1300 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 400, 133 L.Ed.2d 319 (1995) (court should not attempt to define reasonable doubt absent a specific request for a definition from the jury); <em>Thompson v. Lynaugh, </em>821 F.2d 1054, 1060-61 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>483 U.S. 1035, 108 S.Ct. 5, 97 L.Ed.2d 794 (1987) (failure to define reasonable doubt does not deprive a defendant of due process); Henry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>A Diamond, Note, <em>Reasonable Doubt: To Define or Not to Define, </em>90 Colum.L.Rev. 1716, 1719 (1990). The Federal Criminal Jury Instructions of the Seventh Circuit, Commentary at Instruction No. 2.07 (1980), reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1363-5\">Although the Seventh Circuit has refused to adopt a <em>per se </em>rule against defining reasonable doubt, it did, in another context, describe the \u201cuse of an instruction defining [it as] equivalent to playing with fire.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1363-6\">1 <em>Federal Criminal Jury Instructions of the Seventh Circuit </em>\u00a7 2.07 (1980) (citation omitted). The Seventh Circuit Committee on Federal Jury Instructions recommends that no instruction be given defining reasonable doubt. The Committee\u2019s Comments declare:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2F\">The phrase \u201creasonable doubt\u201d is self-explanatory and is its own best definition. Further elaboration \u201ctends to misleading refinements\u201d which weaken and make imprecise the existing phrase.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1363-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Blackburn, </em>992 F.2d 666, 668 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 949, 114 S.Ct. 393, 126 L.Ed.2d 341 (1993) (reasonable doubt should not be defined even upon request by the jury). The Fourth, Fifth and Seventh Circuit approach should be adopted, it is respectfully suggested, for federal courts in the Second Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-8\">The approved Second Circuit charge is, \u201ca doubt that would make a reasonable person hesitate to act in the most important of his or her own affairs.\u201d <em>See </em>letter B in Questionnaire and Table of Results, <em>infra. </em>Although serviceable, it falls short of usefully explaining the jurors\u2019 task. It could be misunderstood since many of us recognize that in the most important affairs of our lives \u2014 such as choice of mate, careers and conception \u2014 we tend to be largely emotional. Were we to require proof beyond a reasonable doubt that our important decisions are correct, few of us would marry, choose law as a career or have children. Most of us are probably comfortable with more risk-taking when making important personal decisions than we would be in declaring as criminals people who may be innocent. <em>See, e.g., </em>Lisa Stone, <em>Portlander\u2019s Book Affirms Power of Sabbaticals, </em>Ourtown [Portland, Oregon], Feb. 19, 1996, at 2 (reviewing Hope Dlugozima, <em>\u201cSix Months Off\u201d </em>(1996)) (\u201cAlways having planned out every move of her life with a great deal of thought, this time she acted spontaneously, immediately deciding,\u201d to take a job in a foreign country, thus radically changing her life).</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-10\">Although the relatively unsophisticated survey summarized below reveals that most differences in the wording of charges do not suggest to jurors substantially different levels of proof necessary to convict, it should be recognized that the sample size is too small to permit any conclusive finding. The results do suggest, however, that with the exception of one charge that improperly uses the moral certainty language <em>(see </em>letter M in Table of Results, <em>infra.), </em>the range of probability the average juror, in this survey, would need to convict is relatively close under any proposed definition. The average ranges from 79.4% to 93.9%. <em>Cf. United States v. Fatico, </em>458 F.Supp. 388, 410 (E.D.N.Y.1978) (judges\u2019 estimates of probability required under the reasonable doubt standard range from 76% to 95%).</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-11\">There is no sound reason to conclude that the charge given in the instant case appreciably decreased the burden of proof on the state. Thus it did not violate the petitioner\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-12\">A procedural objection might be raised to the use of the survey in this concurrence. Generally, an appellate court must limit itself to the record, precedents, published materials, and matters of judicial notice. <em>See, e.g., </em>Fed.R.Evid. 201 (\u201c[a] court may take judicial notice, whether requested or not ... [of] a fact ... not subject to reasonable dispute in that it is either (1) generally known within the territorial jurisdiction of the trial court or (2) capable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d); <em>see also, </em>1 Margaret A. Berger et al., Evidence, ft 201[04][05][06] (1995); Essay, <em>Limits on Judges Learning, Speaking and </em>Acting\u2014 <em>Part I </em>\u2014 Tentative <em>First Thoughts: How May Judges Learn?, </em>36 UAriz.L.Rev. 539, 557-60 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1284\">*1284</page-number>Articles and studies once published are in the market place of ideas. They can be criticized by others as well as cited and used in briefs and arguments. Private, unpublished research should not usually be cited in opinions except where the parties have been afforded a chance to object and point out errors. <em>See, e.g., </em>John H. Mansfield, Norman Abrams and Margaret A. Berger et al., <em>Cases and Materials on Evidence </em>1303-1304 n. 5 (8th ed. 1988) (criticizing Judge Jerome Frank for relying on a private letter from a sociologist -written to him at his request while the appeal in the case was still under consideration). Where further research or a study seems useful to an appellate court, the matter should normally be remanded to the trial court where an adversary hearing and appropriate fact finding techniques can be used. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Shonubi </em>895 F.Supp. 460 (E.D.N.Y.1995) (techniques used by the trial court after remand included a panel of experts appointed pursuant to rule 706 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, opposing expert studies funded by government and defendant, evidentiary hearings, argument and reargument, and publication of a draft opinion by the trial court). In the instant case, the study was not seriously objectionable since the concurring judge had at hand the laboratory of his own courtroom and the survey did not affect the decision of the panel. The questionnaire distributed to the jury is set out below:</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\">JURY QUESTIONNAIRE</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-5\">This survey is designed to assist the court in more effectively instructing juries in future eases. <em>You do not have to answer unless you wish to.

You do not have to use every number. </em>An example of a definition that might be classified as a 10 (100% certainty) is, \u201cProof beyond a reasonable doubt requires certainty that the defendant did what he is accused of.\u201d One that might be classified as a 1 (51% certainty) is, \u201cA reasonable doubt exists unless the government proves it more likely than not that the defendant did what he is accused of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-8\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"A-P\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b1367-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
