In the petition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, the appellant raised three grounds for relief: (1) insufficient evidence to support his convictions; (2) deprivation of his right to a fair trial; and (3) constitutional error resulting from a Florida district court of appeals remand of his case to a trial court for an evidentiary hearing and factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-25\">After referring the case to a magistrate judge and receiving a report and recommendation, the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and denied the petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-26\">We have considered the appellant\u2019s claims, heard oral argument in the case, and studied the applicable legal precedent. We hold that the district court did not err in denying the petition for writ of habeas corpus. Accordingly, the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-27\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
