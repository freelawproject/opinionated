In order to be eligible for the federal assistance, a state must meet numerous requirements prescribed by Congress, one of which is that the state \u201cassure[ ] all children with disabilities the right to a free appropriate public education.\u201d After learning that Virginia has a policy under which a disabled child may be deprived of all educational services by way of expulsion or long-term suspension if that child misbehaves in a manner unrelated to his or her disability, the United States Department of Education threatened to withhold all of Virginia\u2019s IDEA-B funds unless it amended that policy so that expelled or suspended disabled children could receive educational services in an alternative setting. In <em>Virginia Department of Education v. Riley (Riley I), </em>23 F.3d 80 (4th Cir.1994), we ordered the Department to conduct a hearing on the matter. Following that hearing, the Secretary of Education ruled that Virginia\u2019s entire allotment of IDEA-B funds could indeed be withheld until the state agreed to amend its disciplinary policies. Virginia has appealed that ruling on numerous grounds. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-9\">In Part B of the IDEA \u2014 formerly known as the Education of the Handicapped Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014 Congress has directed the Department of Education to provide financial assistance, under prescribed conditions, to state and local education agencies for the education of disabled children. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1411-20 (1990 &amp; Supp.1996). The IDEA-B program is administered by the Office of Special Education Programs (\u201cOSEP\u201d), housed within the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (\u201cOSERS\u201d). 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1402(a) (Supp. 1996). To receive IDEA-B funds, a state must do two things. First, the state must submit to OSEP a plan covering a period of three fiscal years, describing (among other things) the policies and procedures that will govern the expenditure of the federal funds. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1413 (1990 &amp; Supp.1996); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.110. Second, the state must meet the eligibility requirements described in the Act. One of those requirements is that the state have \u201cin effect a policy that assures all children with disabilities the right to a free appropriate public education.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(1) (Supp.1996); <em>see also </em>34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.121(a) (\u201cEach State plan must include information that shows that the State has in effect a policy that ensures that all children with disabilities have the right to FAPE [free appropriate public education] within the age ranges and timelines under \u00a7 300.122.\u201d). If the Secretary of Education determines, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, that the state has failed substantially to comply with that or other requirements set out in sections 1412 and 1413, he or she \u201cshall, after notifying the State educational agency, withhold any further [IDEA-B] payments to the State.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1416(a) (Supp.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-16\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1419-17\">In August 1992, Virginia submitted to OSEP its IDEA-B plan for fiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995. The Assistant Secretary of Education for OSERS conditionally approved the plan in October 1992 and permitted Virginia to receive its funds for fiscal year 1993. The Department of Education thereafter discovered that Virginia has a stated policy under which, \u201c[i]f there is no causal connection [between a child\u2019s misconduct and his or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>her -disability] and if the child was appropriately placed at the time of the misconduct, the child may be disciplined the same as a non-handicapped child.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On December 17, 1993, the Department notified Virginia officials that it would not release Virginia\u2019s IDEA-B funds for fiscal years 1994 and 1995' unless Virginia altered that policy. Relying upon the Act\u2019s statement that a participating state must have \u201cin effect a policy that assures all children with disabilities the right to a free appropriate public education,\u201d as well as upon the Department\u2019s prior interpretation of that provision, the Department asserted that \u201ceven during a disciplinary removal that exceeds 10 school days, [participating states] may not cease educational services to students with disabilities ... regardless of whether the student\u2019s misconduct is determined to be a manifestation of the student\u2019s disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-4\">Virginia refused to amend its policy, insisting that, if a child\u2019s misbehavior is unrelated to his or her disability, IDEA-B does not strip school officials of their right to deprive the student of all educational services by expelling him or her or by suspending him or her for an extended period of time. After the Department refused to grant it a hearing on the matter, Virginia petitioned this court for interlocutory relief, seeking the release of its $50.2 million IDEA-B allotment for fiscal year 1994. We granted Virginia the relief it requested, holding that, under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1416(a), Virginia could not be deprived of its IDEA-B funds without reasonable notice and an opportunity for a hearing. <em>Riley I, </em>23 F.3d at 84-87. The Secretary complied with that ruling, releasing the funds for fiscal year 1994 and ordering that a hearing be held concerning the disposition of the funds for fiscal year 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-5\">In October 1994, a hearing was indeed held. The Hearing Officer found (1) that \u201cIDEA-B requires states to assure that eligible students with disabilities suspended long-term or expelled for conduct unrelated to their disabilities continue to receive special education services;\u201d (2) that the Department\u2019s policy on the matter had been articulated in the form of \u201can interpretive rule not subject to the notice and comment provisions\u201d of the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d); (3) that the Department\u2019s demand that Virginia amend its policy \u201cdid not amount to imposing [on Virginia] an impermissible new condition;\u201d and (4) that the Secretary was acting within the scope of his lawful discretion when he proposed that Virginia\u2019s entire allotment of IDEA-B funds for fiscal year 1995, as well as all future IDEA-B funds, be withheld if Virginia refused to amend its policies in the manner demanded by the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-9\">Pursuant to 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.585, the Secretary reviewed the Hearing Officer\u2019s findings, then issued his final decision on July 3, 1995. The Secretary largely concurred with the Hearing Officer\u2019s conclusions, finding (1) \u201cthat the IDEA-B, its interpretive guidance, and the case law require the continuation of education services to eligible disabled school children who are suspended long-term or expelled from their current school setting when their misconduct is unrelated to their disability;\u201d (2) that \u201cthe Department\u2019s interpretation of IDEA-Part B is an interpretive rule not subject to the notice and comment provisions of the APA;\u201d (3) that concerns we expressed in <em>Riley I </em>regarding whether the Department was imposing an impermissible new condition on Virginia were cured when Virginia was given the opportunity to present its arguments to the Hearing Officer; (4) that the Department was, in fact, not imposing such an impermissible new condition; (5) that Congress had given the Secretary the authority to withhold all of a state\u2019s IDEA-B funds if the state refuses to comply with the Act\u2019s requirements; and (6) that, despite those findings, Virginia would have access to its 1995 funds pending its appeal of the Secretary\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1420-10\">Virginia has appealed, contending that Congress must clearly demonstrate its intent to override local authority concerning school disciplinary policies before the federal government may intrude in such matters, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>that no such intent has been evinced here. Virginia also argues that the position taken by the Department in the instant case violates the \u201cequal access\u201d purpose of IDEA-B, that the Department is unlawfully coercing Virginia by threatening to withhold its entire IDEA-B allotment, and that the Department\u2019s policies cannot be imposed on Virginia because they were not promulgated in compliance with the APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-6\">We must regard the Secretary\u2019s findings of fact as conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1416(b)(2). As we explain below, we find the pertinent statutory provisions unambiguous and therefore review the Secretary\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> See Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984) (\u201cIf the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1421-8\">Virginia\u2019s principal contention on appeal has been that the authority of state and local school officials to discipline their students as they reasonably see fit can only be overridden by a federal agency when Congress has unambiguously authorized it to do so. Virginia has pointed out that education is an area \u201cwhere States historically have been sovereign,\u201d <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 1632, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), and that \u201c[n]o single tradition in public education is more deeply rooted than local control over the operation of schools,\u201d <em>Milliken v. Bradley, </em>418 U.S. 717, 741, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 3125, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069 (1974). Virginia believes that the Department of Education is trying to blunt one of school officials\u2019 most useful disciplinary tools: total exclusion from the education process by way of expulsion or long-term suspension. <em>See Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 580, 95 S.Ct. 729, 739, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975) (observing that \u201c[suspension is considered ... to be a necessary tool to maintain order\u201d). Virginia therefore contends that, because Congress has not clearly given it permission to do so, the Department cannot attempt to compel the state to alter its disciplinary policies by withholding its allotment of federal funds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1421-13\">The principles governing Congress\u2019s ability to place conditions on the states\u2019 receipt of federal funds are fairly well established. In <em>South Dakota v. Dole, </em>483 U.S. 203, 107 S.Ct. 2793, 97 L.Ed.2d 171 (1987), the Supreme Court acknowledged Congress\u2019s broad power, pursuant to its spending authority under Article I, Section 8,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to \u201cattach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>conditions on the receipt of federal funds\u201d in an effort \u2018\u201cto further broad policy objectives.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 206, 107 S.Ct. at 2795-96 (quoting <em>Fullilove v. Klutznick, </em>448 U.S. 448, 474, 100 S.Ct. 2758, 2772, 65 L.Ed.2d 902 (1980) (opinion of Burger, C.J.)). That power to place conditions on the receipt of federal funds is subject, though, to at least four restrictions: (1) Congress \u201cmust be in pursuit of \u2018the general welfare,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 207, 107 S.Ct. at 2796; (2) Congress must unambiguously articulate the applicable conditions, thereby \u201c\u2018enabl[ing] the States to exercise their choice knowingly, cognizant of the consequences of their participation,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Pennhurst State Sch. and Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>451 U.S. 1, 17, 101 S.Ct. 1531, 1540, 67 L.Ed.2d 694 (1981)); (3) the conditions must be related \u201c \u2018to the federal interest in particular national projects or programs,\u2019\u201d <em>id. </em>(quoting <em>Massachusetts v. United States, </em>435 U.S. 444, 461, 98 S.Ct. 1153, 1164, 55 L.Ed.2d 403 (1978) (plurality opinion)); and (4) \u201cother constitutional provisions may provide an independent bar to the conditional grant of federal funds,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 208, 107 S.Ct. at 2796. It is the second of those restrictions that Virginia believes precludes the Department\u2019s withholding of federal funds in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-4\">The principal issue in the instant case is therefore this: When Congress stated that all states receiving IDEA-B funds must have \u201cin effect a policy that assures all children with disabilities the right to a free appropriate public education,\u201d did it clearly indicate that states receiving IDEA-B funds could not deprive a disabled student of all educational services, even if the student had been expelled or suspended due to conduct unrelated to his or her disability? In order to answer that question, it is useful to review the facts underlying two of the Supreme Court\u2019s leading decisions in the area of conditional federal grants, <em>Pennhurst </em>and <em>Dole. </em>In <em>Pennhurst, </em>the Court reviewed the provisions of the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1975, then codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6000 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Under the Act, the federal government offered to provide funds to the states in order to help them implement programs designed to care for and treat developmentally disabled individuals. 451 U.S. at 11, 101 S.Ct. at 1536-37. Each state could choose either to comply with the conditions set forth in the Act and thereby receive the federal funds or instead to forego the opportunity to participate in the program. <em>Id. </em>Six sections of the Act described, in explicit terms, the conditions a state was required to meet in order to receive federal support. <em>Id. </em>at 12-13, 23, 101 S.Ct. at 1537-38, 1543. A seventh section\u2014 section 6010, the so-called \u201cbill of rights\u201d section \u2014 contained Congress\u2019s findings with respect to the kinds of programs to which it believed individuals with developmental disabilities were entitled.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 13, 101 S.Ct. at 1537-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1422-12\">The Solicitor General contended that, in section 6010, Congress had prescribed conditions that a state must meet in order to receive federal funds under the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 22, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>101 S.Ct. at 1542. The Court rejected that proposition on several grounds. First, unlike the six sections in which conditions had been expressly prescribed, Congress gave no express indication that section 6010 was intended to impose conditions. <em>Id. </em>at 23, 101 S.Ct. at 1543. Second, unlike the Solicitor General, the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 the agency charged with administering the Act, <em>id. </em>at 11, 101 S.Ct. at 1536-37 \u2014 had taken the position that the Department could not withhold federal funds if a state failed to act fully in accordance with section 6010\u2019s findings, <em>id. </em>at 23, 101 S.Ct. at 1543. Third, the small sum ($1.6 million) provided to the given state was \u201cwoefully inadequate to meet the enormous financial burden\u201d of complying with each of section 6010\u2019s aspirations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 24, 101 S.Ct. at 1543. Fourth, because much of the language of section 6010 was indeterminate, the Court found that Congress had not \u201cspoke[n] so clearly that [the Court could] fairly say that the State could make an informed choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 25, 101 S.Ct. at 1544. Finally, the Court believed that several other provisions of the Act would be rendered superfluous if the aspirations expressed in section 6010 were deemed to constitute conditions on the receipt of federal funds. <em>Id. </em>at 25-27, 101 S.Ct. at 1544-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-5\">In <em>Dole, </em>the State of South Dakota asked the Court to review federal legislation under which the Secretary of Transportation has been directed to withhold five or ten percent of a state\u2019s federal highway dollars if, under that state\u2019s laws, a person less than twenty-one years of age is permitted to purchase alcoholic beverages. <em>See </em>23 U.S.C. \u00a7 158. The Court upheld the Secretary\u2019s withholding of federal funds from South Dakota under that provision, finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[t]he conditions upon which States receive the funds ... could not be more clearly stated by Congress.\u201d 483 U.S. at 208, 107 S.Ct. at 2797.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-9\">Guided by those cases and the principles they exemplify, we conclude that Congress has indicated with sufficient clarity that a state risks losing all or part of its IDEA-B funds if it refuses to provide educational services to a disabled student who has been expelled or suspended for conduct unrelated to his or her disability.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We reach that conclusion for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-10\">First, to the extent that <em>Pennhurst </em>is analogical authority in support of Virginia\u2019s position (as Virginia contends that it is), that case is easily distinguished. Unlike the legislation in <em>Pennhurst, </em>the statutory provision in the case at bar appears in a section that expressly imposes conditions on the receipt of federal funds, the agency charged with administering the statute believes the statute imposes the condition in question, the federal funds provided to Virginia each year (more than $50 million) are not inadequate to meet the burden imposed by that condition, and holding that that condition has indeed been imposed by Congress would not render other portions of the Act superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1423-11\">Second, IDEA-B\u2019s plain language leaves no room for exceptions of the kind that Virginia has asked us to read into it. The Act requires that participating states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>have \u201cin effect a policy that assures all children with disabilities the right to a free appropriate public education.\u201d If a state refuses to offer educational services to a disabled child due to that child\u2019s conduct\u2014 regardless of whether that conduct is a manifestation of the child\u2019s disability \u2014 then it has ceased to assure that child of \u201cthe right to a free appropriate public education.\u201d Contrary to Virginia\u2019s belief, the statute in no way indicates that a disabled student forfeits that right when he or she misbehaves in a manner unrelated to his or her disability. The Act\u2019s unqualified language is therefore sufficiently clear to have enabled Virginia authorities to perceive that they would have to adjust their disciplinary policies for disabled students if they wished to participate in the IDEA-B program. <em>Compare Timothy W. v. Rochester, New Hampshire, Sch. Dist., </em>875 F.2d 954, 960-61 (1st Cir.) (rejecting the argument that, in order to demand educational services under the Act, a child must show that he or she would benefit from such services; because the Act is unequivocal and \u201cis permeated with the words <em>\u2018all </em>handicapped children\u2019 ... the Act in its entirety makes clear that a \u2018zero-reject\u2019 policy is at the core' of the Act\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 983, 110 S.Ct. 519, 107 L.Ed.2d 520 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-5\">Third, enforcing the plain meaning of section 1412(1) \u2014 that is, holding that the word \u201call\u201d does, in fact, mean \u201call\u201d \u2014 need not lead to absurd results. The Department has pointed out that \u201cthe issue of whether children with disabilities may be expelled or suspended from school for misconduct unrelated to their disabilities [is wholly distinct from] the issue of whether the statute requires that continuing special educational services be provided to [such] students.\u201d IDEA-B does not prevent school officials from suspending or expelling disabled st\u00fadents who have misbehaved; the statute merely requires that educational services then be provided in some kind of alternative setting.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Elsewhere in the Act, Congress has contemplated the provision of educational services in just such alternative settings. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(3)(B)(i) (Supp.1996) (\u201cExcept as provided in clause (iii), if the proceedings conducted pursuant to this section involve a child with a disability who is determined to have brought a weapon to school under the jurisdiction of such agency, <em>then the child may be placed in an interim alternative educational setting, </em>in accordance with State law, for not more than 45 days.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1424-8\">Fourth, we believe that upholding the Secretary\u2019s decision in the ease at bar is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Honig v. Doe, </em>484 U.S. 305, 108 S.Ct. 592, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988). At issue in <em>Honig </em>was the Act\u2019s \u201cstay-put\u201d provision, which states that a disabled child \u201cshall remain in [his or her] then current educational placement\u201d until various review proceedings have been completed, unless local school officials and the child\u2019s parents agree to the contrary. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(3) (Supp.1996). Two students who had been expelled due to \u201cviolent and disruptive conduct\u201d arising from their disabilities, <em>see </em>484 U.S. at 312-15, 108 S.Ct. at 598-99, argued that the state could not unilaterally expel them unless those procedures had been followed. The Supreme Court agreed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court held that the language of the statute was unequivocal, and rejected school officials\u2019 attempt \u201cto read a \u2018dangerousness\u2019 exception into the stay-put provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323, 108 S.Ct. at 604. The Court disagreed with the school officials\u2019 contention \u201cthat Congress thought the residual authority of school officials to exclude dangerous students from the classroom too obvi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>ous for comment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, the Court reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1425-5\">We think it clear ... that Congress very much meant to strip schools of the <em>unilateral </em>authority they had traditionally employed to exclude disabled students, particularly emotionally disturbed students, from school. In so doing, Congress did not leave school administrators powerless to deal with dangerous students; it did, however, deny school officials their former right to \u201cself-help,\u201d and directed that in the future the removal of disabled students could be accomplished only with the permission of the parents or, as a last resort, the courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1425-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 323-24, 108 S.Ct. at 604. Just as the Court in <em>Honig </em>refused to read a \u201cdangerousness\u201d exception into the Act\u2019s stay-put provision, we refuse to read a \u201csuspension or expulsion for conduct unrelated to disability\u201d exception into the Act\u2019s requirement that \u201call\u201d disabled children be assured \u201cthe right to a iree appropriate public education.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-8\">Virginia has argued that, by enacting IDEA-B, Congress intended merely to provide disabled children with educational opportunities equal to those enjoyed by their non-disabled counterparts. <em>See, e.g., </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(b)(3) (Supp.1996) (stating that \u201cmore than half of the children with disabilities in the United States do not receive appropriate educational services which would enable them to have full equality of opportunity\u201d). Finding no indication in the statute \u201cthat Congress intended to insulate special education students from the same discipline that non-disabled students may fairly incur, when they purposefully engage in <em>identical </em>misconduct unrelated to any disability,\u201d Virginia believes that the Department is attempting to give disabled students \u201cmore rights than other students\u201d in a manner not contemplated by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-9\">We are unpersuaded by Virginia\u2019s reasoning. First, as we have indicated, the plain language of the statute supports the Secretards finding that Congress has imposed on participating states the condition that the Department seeks to enforce against Virginia here. Second, it cannot be disputed that, in other sections of the Act, Congress has indeed granted disabled children \u201cmore rights\u201d than those enjoyed by non-disabled children. For example, IDEA-B confers upon disabled children the right to an annually reviewed\u201cindividualized education program,\u201d prepared by the school district, the child\u2019s teacher and parents, and, when possible, the disabled child himself or herself. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401(a)(20), 1414(a)(5) (Supp.1996). The specific provision at issue in <em>Honig v. </em>Doe\u2014 the Act\u2019s so-called \u201cstay put\u201d provision, discussed <em>supra </em>\u2014 also confers unique rights upon disabled children. Any argument founded upon strict equality of treatment under the Act must therefore fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-13\">Virginia contends that the Department is using IDEA-B\u2019s monetary incentives \u201cas a \u2018club\u2019 to beat [Virginia] into submitting to [the Department\u2019s] administrative interpretation\u201d of the statute. Virginia states that, in 1994, only about 126 of the state\u2019s 128,000 disabled children were expelled for conduct unrelated to their disabilities. By threatening to withhold Virginia\u2019s entire IDEA-B allotment, Virginia argues that the Department is exercising undue influence over the state\u2019s educational policies in violation of the Tenth Amendment<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and general principles of federalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b1425-14\">We should begin by noting that the plain language of the statute authorizes the Department to withhold a state\u2019s entire allotment of IDEA-B funds if the state fails to comply with the conditions expressed in the statute. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1416(a) (Supp.1996) (\u201cWhenever the Secretary ... finds that there has been a failure substantially to comply with any provision of section 1412 or section 1413 of this title, ... the Secretary shall, after notifying the State educational agency, withhold <em>any </em>further payments to the State under this subchapter____\u201d) (em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>phasis added). The issue at hand, therefore, is whether the Department\u2019s exercise of that delegated authority is so coercive that it violates the Tenth Amendment or principles of federalism implicit in our system of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-4\">Though the attachment of conditions to the receipt of federal funds generally does not amount to the kind of commandeering of the states\u2019 legislative processes that is proscribed by the Tenth Amendment, <em>see, e.g., Dole, </em>483 U.S. at 210, 107 S.Ct. at 2797-98, the Supreme Court has indicated that \u201cin some circumstances the financial inducement offered by Congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at which [permissible] \u2018pressure turns into [impermissible] compulsion,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 211, 107 S.Ct. at 2798 (quoting <em>Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, </em>301 U.S. 548, 590, 57 S.Ct. 883, 892, 81 L.Ed. 1279 (1937)). As we observed earlier this year, however, \u201c[n]o court ... has ever struck down a federal statute on grounds that it exceeded the Spending Power.\u201d <em>Commonwealth of Virginia v. Browner, </em>80 F.3d 869, 881 (4th Cir. 1996); <em>see also State of Nevada v. Skinner, </em>884 F.2d 445, 448 (9th Cir.1989) (\u201cThe coercion theory has been much discussed but infrequently applied in federal case law, and never in favor of the challenging party.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 U.S. 1070, 110 S.Ct. 1112, 107 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1990). Indeed, courts have occasionally expressed doubts with respect to whether a finding of genuine coercion can ever reliably be made. <em>See, e.g., Steward Machine Co., </em>301 U.S. at 590, 57 S.Ct. at 892 (ruling that no such coercion had occurred in the case then before the Court, \u201cassuming] that such a concept can ever be applied with fitness to the relations between state and nation\u201d); <em>Skinner, </em>884 F.2d at 448 (identifying numerous difficulties that arise when one attempts to apply the coercion theory).</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-5\">We are certain that, wherever the line separating encouragement from coercion may lie, Congress has not crossed it in the ease at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-6\">It is true that the Department has threatened to withhold all of Virginia\u2019s IDEA-B funds. Contrary to Virginia\u2019s suggestion, though, the mere fact that the federal government threatens to withhold an entire federal grant, rather than a mere portion of it (such as the five percent of federal highway dollars in Dole), does not necessarily compel a state to comply with the conditions attached to that grant. If the federal government were to offer education grants of a mere $1,000, for example, a state surely would not genuinely be compelled to comply with the conditions attached to that grant, even if the government threatened to withhold 100 percent of it: the sum is small enough that a state could easily choose to forego the benefits of the grant in favor of retaining policy-making independence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-8\">In the case at bar, the Department wishes to withhold a substantial sum \u2014 more than $50 million per year. Yet that sum represents a fairly small percentage of Virginia\u2019s total expenditures for the education of disabled children. The division chief for finance at Virginia\u2019s State Department of Education testified in the proceedings below that Virginia\u2019s education expenditures for disabled children average about $9,000 per student. She also stated that Virginia currently serves approximately 128,000 disabled children and that the state\u2019s annual IDEA-B grants provide about $400 per child. Through the IDEA-B program, therefore, the federal government is providing approximately five percent of the funds needed to educate Virginia\u2019s disabled children. While we do not doubt for a moment that the loss of those funds would be sharply felt, we cannot say that the federal government is providing such a significant proportion of the funds needed by Virginia that the state has no choice but to comply with the conditions attached to receiving the federal dollars. We reject Virginia\u2019s coercion argument accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1426-10\">Virginia has argued that, even if the Department has properly construed the provisions of IDEA-B, it may not enforce that interpretation of the Act against Virginia because it has acted by way of a \u201clegislative rule,\u201d rather than an \u201cinterpretive rule,\u201d and therefore must abide by the notice and comment provisions of the APA. Virginia has also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>pointed out that, under 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1417(b), the Secretary was required to \u201cissue, not later than January 1, 1977, ... such rules and regulations as may be necessary\u201d to \u201ccarry[ ] out the provisions of this subehapter\u201d and that \u201c[n]o other less formal method of implementing such provisions is authorized.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-5\">An agency issues an \u201cinterpretive rule\u201d when it \u201csimply states what [it] thinks the statute means, and only reminds affected parties of existing duties.\u201d <em>General Motors Corp. v. Ruckelshaus, </em>742 F.2d 1561, 1565 (D.C.Cir.1984) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1074, 105 S.Ct. 2153, 85 L.Ed.2d 509 (1985). An agency issues a \u201clegislative rule\u201d when it \u201cintends to create new law, rights or duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Unlike interpretive rules, legislative rules have the force of law; consequently, when an agency issues a legislative rule, it must abide by the notice and comment procedures mandated by the APA. <em>Chen Zhou Chai v. Carroll, </em>48 F.3d 1331, 1340 (4th Cir.1995); <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-6\">The Seventh Circuit has addressed the precise issue raised in the instant case. In <em>Metropolitan School District of Wayne Township v. Davila, </em>969 F.2d 485 (7th Cir. 1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 949, 113 S.Ct. 1360, 122 L.Ed.2d 740 (1993), the Ohio Department of Education\u2019s director of special education had asked OSERS whether IDEA-B \u201crequires states to provide educational services to disabled children who are expelled or suspended for an extended period for reasons unrelated to their disability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487. OSERS had responded by way of a letter, indicating that it believed IDEA-B did indeed require such continuation of services. <em>Id. </em>An Ohio school district filed suit, contending that OSERS had issued a legislative rule and that the agency therefore needed to comply with the APA\u2019s notice and comment requirements for issuing such rules. <em>Id. </em>The Seventh Circuit ruled in favor of the Department of Education. The court determined that OSERS had merely issued an interpretive rule, relying upon the statutory language and the legislative history in an effort to determine what Congress intended. <em>Id. </em>at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-7\">We find the Seventh Circuit\u2019s reasoning persuasive. The Department has simply told Virginia what it believes IDEA-B requires; it has not attempted to create new rights or duties. Consequently, we find that the agency has issued an interpretive rule and that the notice and comment requirements of the APA are inapplicable. We similarly reject Virginia\u2019s argument that 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1417(b) required the Department to employ more formal procedures when it attempted to enforce the plain language of IDEA-B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-9\">\n<em>m.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the Secretary\u2019s final decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1419-10\">.

Virginia agrees that the Secretary's conclusions of law must be reviewed <em>de novo. </em>Its argument, though, is curious. Virginia believes that the terms of IDEA-B are unambiguous and that we therefore should not defer to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the statute, but should instead enforce the statute's plain meaning. Yet, as we suggest below, Virginia also believes that, when Congress said that participating states must have in place \u201ca policy that assures <em>dll </em>children with disabilities the right to a free appropriate public education,\u201d it really did not mean \"all.\u201d Congress, in Virginia\u2019s view, intended that an exception be made for disabled students who have been expelled or suspended long-term due to misbehavior that is unrelated to their disabilities. To find that Congress intended that such an exception be made, we would have to find ambiguity in Congress\u2019s use of the word \"all.\u201d And if ambiguity did inhere in the statute, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of it would be entitled to substantial deference. <em>See, e.g., Honig v.

Believing that students\u2014 handicapped or not \u2014 who so completely disrupt the classroom as to prevent the educational process to continue or who actually commit serious crimes against society forfeit by their own misconduct their right to a free education, the Commonwealth expels such students from its classrooms until such time as they are willing to conform their behavior to that necessary for education to occur. During the period of expulsion, as part of the State\u2019s overall program for discipline in its public schools, the State allows its local school boards to suspend educational services to the expelled students. That is, for neither expelled handicapped nor expelled non-handicapped students does the Commonwealth require its local school boards to provide private tutors or other educational alternatives following expulsion, whether the expelled student finds himself in prison, in detention, or at home. Explaining its reasons for this policy, the State says: \u201c[A] caring public school organization ... applies this discipline as a last resort \u201cwake-up\u2019 call of accountability.\u201d Br. at 9. And, within the Commonwealth, this disciplinary tool has proven to be one of the most effective means of instilling a sense of personal responsibility and accountability in the few obstinately antisocial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>among the State\u2019s youths. Indeed, the experience of the State is that \u201cit is rare for an expelled student, when readmitted [which most are], to be expelled again.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">Bringing the full weight of the Federal Government to bear against the Commonwealth\u2019s educational policy decision not to require private tutors in prisons and elsewhere for students who have committed serious crimes or otherwise so disrupted the educational process as to require their expulsion, the Department of Education has, in the first such enforcement action ever against a state, withheld Virginia\u2019s entire $60 million annual Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d) grant until the Commonwealth capitulates to the Department\u2019s demands that it provide private educational services to these expelled handicapped students, 126 in number. This, notwithstanding that the State continues to provide education to the some 128,000 handicapped students who have not abused the educational opportunity provided them through the cooperative efforts of the Commonwealth and the United States, including those handicapped students whose misconduct warrants expulsion but who are not expelled because their misconduct relates to their disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">In an argument that only the Federal Government could make, and which the majority uncritically accepts, the Department of Education and the Department of Justice contend that the State\u2019s refusal to provide private tutors for handicapped students expelled for criminal or other serious misconduct unrelated in any way to their disabilities violates the condition on Virginia\u2019s receipt of IDEA funds to \u201cassure[] [to] all students with disabilities the right to a free appropriate public education.\u201d According to the Departments of Justice and Education, both the statute and sound policy require the States to provide private tutors, at taxpayer\u2019s expense, even to convicted murderers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1428-6\">THE COURT: Does the Department of Education take the view that if a disabled young person commits a felony murder and is incarcerated, then the State is still obligated to provide that person with an education?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1428-7\">COUNSEL: Yes, I believe that the statute specifically contemplates the provision of special education services even in institutions ____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1428-8\">THE COURT: So the State has to go in and provide a tutor to this felony murderer.

Not only did the Congress not unambiguously require the States to provide the continuing education at issue, it all but codified the common sense proviso that such an education need not be extended to such students.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-12\">Because the majority, in holding that the States must yield to the Department of Education\u2019s demands, places this court\u2019s imprimatur on what I believe to be an unauthorized, if not unconstitutional, exercise of federal authority over matters peculiarly within the province of the States and reserved to them by the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-15\">The Secretary of Education and the Assistant Attorney General acknowledge, as they must, that IDEA at most only <em>implicitly </em>conditions the States\u2019 receipt of funds upon the continued provision of educational services to students expelled for misconduct unrelated to their handicaps. <em>See </em>Decision of the Secretary, Proposed Withholding Proceeding, Docket No. 94-76-0, at 5 (July 3, 1995) (\u201c[T]he IDEA does not contain explicit language which precludes the cessation of education services for disabled children who are suspended long-term or expelled for misconduct unrelated to their disability.\u201d); Respondent\u2019s Br. at 34, 35 n. 11 (conceding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>the condition the Secretary seeks to impose is only \u201cimplicit\u201d). Because we are here concerned with a congressional conditioning of the States\u2019 receipt of federal funds, this acknowledgment is itself sufficient basis upon which to reject the Federal Government\u2019s argument that the States are required to continue providing educational services to these expelled students, as I discuss <em>infra. </em>For, in order for the States to be bound by a condition upon the receipt of federal monies, the Congress must have affirmatively imposed that condition in clear and unmistakable statutory terms. An adjustment to the critical balance of power between the Federal Government and the States cannot be authorized implicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-4\">But, before turning to the question of whether IDEA satisfies the heightened standard applicable to federal statutes that affect the distribution of power between the Federal Government and the States, it should be understood that IDEA does not impose, implicitly or otherwise, the condition for which the Federal Government argues, under even ordinary standards of statutory construction. The relevant provision of the IDEA does not require that the States have in effect \u201ca policy that assures all handicapped children a free appropriate public education\u201d \u2014 a condition which, in my view, still would not require the States to provide education to handicapped children expelled for misconduct having nothing whatever to do with their disabilities. Rather, it requires that, in order to qualify for federal special education funds, the States \u201cha[ve] in effect a policy that assures all children with disabilities <em>the right to </em>a free appropriate public education.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(1) (emphasis added). Thus, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly observed, <em>see </em>discussion <em>infra, </em>the statute only requires that the States provide handicapped children with access to such an education. And, as with any other right, that right of access to educational services may be forfeited by criminal or other conduct antithetical to the right itself. A state, accordingly, no more fails to satisfy the statute\u2019s condition when it refuses to continue educational services to a student who has forfeited his right to such services, than when it does not provide an education to a student who chooses not to avail himself of the opportunity at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-6\">The majority errs in its interpretation of the statute precisely because' it ignores the key phrase \u201cthe right to,\u201d and instead focuses exclusively upon the word \u201call.\u201d <em>See, e.g., ante </em>at 1344 n. 13 (\u201cVirginia has concentrated on the interpretation of the phrase \u2018all children,\u2019 but we have concluded that \u2018all\u2019 means \u2018all\u2019 and that concentration should more appropriately be focussed on the statutory requirement of \u2018a free appropriate public education.\u2019 \u201d). In doing so, of course, the majority entirely begs the question we must decide in order to resolve this case. It is indisputable that, as a condition to receipt of the special education funds, the States must have in place a policy that assures \u201call\u201d handicapped children something; the question is, what is that something. And it could not be clearer from the face of the statute that that something is only \u201cthe <em>right </em>to\u201d a free appropriate public education. If this were not evident from the statute\u2019s language, then it should be evident from the derisible result that follows upon the alternative interpretation \u2014 that the States are required, at taxpayers\u2019 expense, to dispatch to prisons, jails, and personal residences, private tutors to instruct those students who have so disrupted the classroom that their own instruction and that of their fellow students was rendered impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-7\">Of course, the Commonwealth of Virginia has in effect the precise policy required by the statute. Virginia extends to every handicapped school-age child within the Commonwealth the right to a free public education appropriate to his disabilities. What it does not do \u2014 and understandably \u2014 is require that local school boards discipline their handicapped students (for conduct unrelated to their disabilities) differently from their non-handicapped students, and provide educational services even to those handicapped youths who have forfeited the right to a free education by wilfully engaging in contumacious conduct so serious as to warrant the ultimate discipline of expulsion. See Regulations Governing Special Education Programs for Children with Disabilities in Virginia, \u00a7 3.3(B)(ll)(b)(4) (\u201cIf there is no causal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>neetion [between the misconduct and the disability] and if the child was appropriately placed at the time of the misconduct, the child may be disciplined the same as a non-disabled child.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> And nothing in the language of IDEA even purports to condition the Commonwealth\u2019s receipt of IDEA\u2019S special education funds upon the State\u2019s submission to the Federal Government\u2019s inexplicable demand that it now do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">Nor does anything in the purpose of IDEA suggest that the State is required to succumb to the Federal Government\u2019s demands. The express, codified purpose of the IDEA is \u201cto assure that all children with disabilities <em>have available to them </em>... a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs ... [and] to assist States and localities to provide for the education of all children with disabilities____\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(c) (emphasis added). As the Supreme Court has recognized, the statute\u2019s purpose was to ensure that disabled students are not denied <em>access </em>to a free public education <em>because of </em>their disabilities, or <em>because of </em>misconduct related to their disabilities. <em>See Board of Educ. v.

As even the Ninth Circuit held in <em>Doe v. Maher, </em>793 F.2d 1470 (9th Cir.1986), <em>aff'd as modified sub nom., Honig v.

It is axiomatic that statutory ambiguity defeats altogether a claim by the Federal Government that Congress has unambiguously conditioned the States\u2019 receipt of federal monies in the manner asserted.

The majority is unable to cite to a single word from the statute or from the legislative history of IDEA evidencing that Congress even considered such a condition, much less that it confronted the possibility of such a condition and its implications for the sovereignty of the States, and determined to condition the States\u2019 funds in this manner. As the Departments of Education and Justice themselves acknowledge, at most the statute <em>implicitly </em>conditions the receipt of funds in the manner they contend. And, as I explain above, it does not even do this; indeed, the better interpretation of the statutory language is that Congress only required the States to provide handicapped children with access to an education, reserving to the States \u2014 intentionally or otherwise \u2014 the authority to discipline handicapped students as they deem appropriate, for criminal actions and misconduct unrelated in any way to those students\u2019 disabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-11\">The majority appears to believe that merely because section 1412 indisputably sets forth conditions on the States\u2019 receipt of IDEA funds, <em>see </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412 (\u201cIn order to qualify for assistance under this subchapter in any fiscal year, a State shall demonstrate to the Secretary that the following <em>conditions </em>are met; ____\u201d (emphasis added)), Congress has <em>ipso facto </em>spoken sufficiently clearly to satisfy the clear statement requirement. However, in <em>Gregory, </em>the Supreme Court rejected this very understanding of the clear statement requirement in a holding that should control the disposition of the case before us. There, the Court held that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which covered employees of \u201ca State or political subdivision of a State,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 630(b)(2) \u2014 a provision that under today\u2019s majority opinion would seem unambiguously to cover state judges \u2014 did <em>not </em>apply to state judges because the provision did not unambiguously reveal that Congress intended such a result. In reaching this conclusion, the Court reasoned that a clear statement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>required not simply in determining whether a statute applies to the States, but also in determining whether the statute applies in the particular manner claimed. <em>Gregory, </em>501 U.S. at 460-70, 111 S.Ct. at 2400-06. In fact, Justices White and Stevens declined to join the \u201cclear statement\u201d discussion in Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion for the Court <em>because </em>it adopted the position urged by the Commonwealth and rejected by the majority in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1434-4\">[T]he majority nevertheless imposes upon Congress a \u201cplain statement\u201d requirement. The majority claims to derive this requirement from the plain statement approach developed in our Eleventh Amendment eases____ The issue in those cases, however, was whether Congress intended a particular statute to extend to the States <em>at all. </em>... In the present case, by contrast, Congress has expressly extended the coverage of the ADEA to the States and their employees.

Indeed, I would be astonished if the Congress of the United States was even aware that the Departments of Education and Justice are contending otherwise before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-4\">Because I interpret section 1412(1) of IDEA so as not to impose upon the States the condition that they provide private tutors and other alternative educational services to handicapped students expelled for egregious conduct unrelated to their disabilities, I need not resolve the Tenth Amendment issue that is presented upon the contrary reading of the statute. Suffice it to say, however, that I regard that issue as considerably more substantial than does the majority, which all but rejects it out of hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-5\">I recognize that the Court has not invalidated an Act of Congress under the Spending Clause since <em>United States v. Butler, </em>297 U.S. 1, 56 S.Ct. 312, 80 L.Ed. 477 (1936), over half a century ago. <em>But cf. United States v.

However, as Chief Justice Rehnquist, on behalf of the Court, recently reminded in <em>South Dakota v. Dole, </em>483 U.S. 203, 107 S.Ct. 2793, 97 L.Ed.2d 171 (1987), \u201c[the Court\u2019s] decisions have recognized that in some circumstances the financial inducement offered by Congress might be so coercive as to pass the point at which \u2018pressure turns into compulsion,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 211, 107 S.Ct. at 2796 (quoting <em>Steward Machine Co. v.

In that case, however, Congress had directed that the States \u201close[only] a relatively small percentage of certain federal highway funds\u201d for their noneompliance. 483 U.S. at 211, 107 S.Ct. at 2798. Because \u201call South Dakota would lose if she adhere[d] to her chosen course as to a suitable minimum drinking age [was] 5% of the funds otherwise obtainable\u201d under the program, the Court concluded that Congress had but \u201coffered relatively redid encouragement to the States to enact higher minimum drinking ages.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1435-11\">Here, in stark contrast, the Federal Government has withheld from the Commonwealth 100% of an annual special education grant of $60 million because of the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to provide private educational services to less than one-tenth of one percent (126) of the 128,000 handicapped students for whom the special education funds were earmarked. And it has withheld the entirety of this $60 million grant \u2014 only $58,000 of which would, on a <em>pro rata </em>basis, be available for educational services to the 126 expelled students \u2014 because the State refused to surrender control over its own classrooms and schoolchildren by abandoning one of its most effective tools for maintaining order and discipline, <em>see, e.g., Goss v. Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 580, 95 S.Ct. 729, 739, 42 L.Ed.2d 725 (1975) (\u201cSuspension is considered not only to be a necessary tool to maintain order but a valuable educational device.\u201d). As even the Department of Education concedes, under the interpretation of the statute embraced by the court today, \u201cCongress[has] drastically curtailed local autonomy with respect to discipline and denial of educational services to this group of children\u201d \u201c[a]s a condition of receiving federal funds.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Br. at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b1435-12\">This is a condition considerably more pernicious than the \u201crelatively mild encourage-ment\u201d at issue in <em>Dole. </em>Withholding the $58,-000 <em>pro rata </em>amount of the funds that would be used by the State to provide services to the 126 expelled students whom the Federal Government believes are entitled to educational services under the statute would be \u201cencouragement.\u201d The withholding of almost $60 million from the State and from the 128,000 disabled students who have responsibly availed themselves of their educational opportunity, simply because the State refuses to yield to the federal demands as to the 126 students who have abused their rights, begins to resemble impermissible coercion, <em>see Dole, </em>483 U.S. at 211, 107 S.Ct. at 2798, if not forbidden regulation in the guise of Spending Clause condition, as well, <em>see id. </em>at 212, 215-218, 107 S.Ct. at 2798-99, 2800-02 (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting); <em>Butler, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>297 U.S. at 73, 56 S.Ct. at 322 (\u201cThere is an obvious difference between a statute stating the conditions upon which moneys shall be expended and one effective only upon assumption of a contractual obligation to submit to a regulation which otherwise could not be enforced.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-4\">Neither of the majority\u2019s two efforts to escape the import of Dole\u2019s reasoning succeeds. The percentage of the total monies expended by the State for education of the handicapped that is represented by the federal grant is irrelevant in assessing the coerciveness of the inducement, at least as appears from the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Dole. </em>Were it otherwise, the same federal grant in the same amount would be unconstitutionally coercive as to one State, but not as to another which expends a greater amount for the purposes served by the grant; indeed, were it otherwise, there would be created a perverse incentive for the States to spend less in areas in which they expected to receive federal monies, in order to render more vulnerable under the coercion theory any conditions that were imposed. Thus, the majority\u2019s effort to compare the 100% withholding here to the 5% withholding in <em>Dole, </em>by noting that the $60 million in special education funds constitutes only \u201capproximately five percent of the funds needed to educate Virginia\u2019s disabled children,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 1346; <em>compare </em>Respondent\u2019s Br. at 43 (claiming that the federal grant \u201cprovides at most nine percent of the cost of providing special educational services to children with disabilities\u201d), is to no avail. Equally unavailing is the majority\u2019s effort to avoid the import of <em>Dole </em>by observing that a 100% withholding of a \u201cmere $1,000\u201d education grant would not be unduly coercive. The difference between a $1000 grant and, as here, a $60 million grant, insofar as their coercive potential is concerned, is self-evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-5\">The argument made by counsel for the Department of Justice is no more responsive to the constitutional barrier recognized by <em>Dole </em>than are the majority\u2019s. In contending that the withholding is not coercive, counsel emphasized that there were more coercive steps that might have been taken, such as the withholding of <em>all </em>federal funds from the Commonwealth. Sending in the troops would be more coercive still, but the existence of that more coercive alternative does not render the withholding to which the Commonwealth is subject wcmcoercive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-7\">Ultimately, if the Court meant what it said in <em>Dole, </em>then I would think that a Tenth Amendment claim of the highest order lies where, as here, the Federal Government (accepting the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute) withholds the entirety of a substantial federal grant on the ground that the States refuse to fulfill their federal obligation in some insubstantial respect rather than submit to the policy dictates of Washington in a matter peculiarly within their powers as sovereign States. In such a circumstance, the argument as to coercion is much more than rhetoric; it is an argument of fact. <em>See Dole, </em>483 U.S. at 211, 107 S.Ct. at 2798. It is, as well, an argument that the Federal Government has, in an act more akin to forbidden regulation than to permissible condition, supplanted with its own policy preferences the considered judgments of the States as to how best to instill in their youth the sense of personal responsibility and related values essential for them to function in a free and civilized society. As such, it is an argument well-grounded in the Tenth Amendment\u2019s reservation \u201cto the States respectively, or to the people\u201d of those \u201cpowers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AcU\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1436-8\">In the end, this ease is about the permissible reach of federal power under the Spending Clause in a time when the several States have become increasingly dependent upon the Federal Government for funds, because the Federal Government has increasingly become dependent upon the revenues from taxation it receives from the citizens of the several States. In particular, it is about the extent to which the Federal Government may, in our system of federalism, impose its policy preferences upon the States by placing conditions upon the return of revenues that were collected from the States\u2019 citizenry in the first place. As Justice O\u2019Connor aptly observed in <em>Dole:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>If the spending power is to be limited only by Congress\u2019 notion of the general welfare, the reality, given the vast financial resources of the Federal Government, is that the Spending Clause gives \u201cpower to the Congress to tear down barriers, to invade the states\u2019 jurisdiction, and to become a parliament of the whole people, subject to no restrictions save such as are self-imposed.\u201d <em>[Butler, </em>297 U.S. at 78, 56 S.Ct. at 324]. This, of course, as <em>Butler </em>held, was not the Framers\u2019 plan and it is not the meaning of the Spending Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1437-5\">483 U.S. at 217, 107 S.Ct. at 2801.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-6\">According to counsel for the Department of Education, requiring the States to continue to provide educational services to handicapped students expelled for reasons unrelated to their handicaps \u201cmake[s] sense, as a matter of policy, in light of the broad purposes of the statute[,] ... [and] allow[ing] individual school districts in their sole discretion to decide whether or not to deny services to this significant number of children with disabilities ... would ... inflict lasting harm on these children.\u201d The Commonwealth of Virginia, for its part, steadfastly maintains not only that the Department\u2019s policy is misguided, because it deprives the State of its most effective disciplinary and instructional tool for instilling in its especially recalcitrant students the sense of responsibility they so sorely lack, but that it is, in any event, a policy decision uniquely reserved to the States by the Constitution. And the wisdom of the Commonwealth\u2019s policy is certainly borne out by the testimony of the State\u2019s local educators and administrators. In testimony that speaks volumes, Jane Timian, the Hearing and Legal Assistant for the Fairfax County School Board responsible for overseeing all student disciplinary matters, described as follows two illustrative incidents that have recently taken place in the Commonwealth as a consequence of the Education Department\u2019s policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-7\">In a recent case at one of FCPS\u2019 23 high schools, six students were part of a group of students whose actions resulted in a loaded .357 magnum handgun being recovered in the school building. The non-special education students were expelled. One student, however, was identified as \u201clearning disabled\u201d due to the student\u2019s weakness in written language skills. An IEP team reviewed extensive evaluations and unanimously found no causal relationship between the student\u2019s writing disability and the student\u2019s involvement in the weapons violation. The student was not expelled. The student later bragged to teachers and students at the school that he could not be expelled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1437-9\">In another recent case at a different high school, a student gang which had adopted a specific name was involved in a mob assault of another student. One student involved in the melee used a meat hook as a weapon. Three of the gang members were expelled. The other two members of the gang were special education students who have not been expelled and who are still receiving services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1437-10\">J.A. at 177. And confirming what anyone even remotely familiar with public education today would have expected, Lucille Brown, Superintendent of Richmond City Public Schools, testified that the \u2018\u201chomebound instruction\u2019 and \u2018alternative education\u2019 [after expulsion]\u201d that has been required by the Federal Government\u2019s Department of Education has \u201cbecome just another \u2018badge of honor\u2019 flaunted by students who have bested the public schools again.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1437-11\">In our federal system of government, such delicate policy decisions, relating so intimately as they do to matters within the exclusive prerogative of the States, are presumed to be those of the States alone. If the Federal Government intends to expropriate these or other sovereign rights from the States, it must at least do so affirmatively and unambiguously, so that its design is known and the States may marshal their political will in opposition to that expropriation. Even then, of course, the Federal Government must effectuate that expropriation in a manner that is faithful to the limitations on Federal power that inhere in the Tenth Amendment and in the principles of federalism that undergird our entire democratic system of governance. Only when the Government acts within these limitations can one have confidence both that the United States has deliberately deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>mined to subordinate the rights of the States to the interests of the Federal Government and that it has done so consistently with the constitutional limitations that even today constrain the Federal Government as against the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b1438-4\">In my view, certainly the first, and perhaps the second, of these essential limitations on Federal power has been exceeded in the IDEA provision, at least as it is interpreted by the court today. And with these excesses has come, as always, yet a further incremental, but no less significant, incursion into the sovereign authority of the several States. As counsel for the Federal Government responded, after reflecting for a moment on the court\u2019s question whether the Department of Education was not simply saying to the States that it knows better than they what is good for America\u2019s schoolchildren and then imposing that view on the States: \u201cWell your honor, in a sense, that\u2019s what Congress is doing in this whole statute.\u201d Unwilling to acquiesce in such a pretentious arrogation of state power, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1430-6\">. Because of the procedural requirements IDEA imposes upon the States before any change in placement of a disabled student can be effected, including the requirement that the States prove that the misconduct was wholly unrelated to the student\u2019s disability, expulsion of a disabled student actually is, as a practical matter, considerably more difficult than expulsion of a non-handicapped student. <em>See, e.g., </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1415(b)(1)(D), 1415(b)(1)(E), 1415(b)(2), 1415(c), 1415(e)(2); <em>Board of Educ. v.

The student knew the consequences of being discovered would probably be expulsion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-11\">2.
