This appeal only involves Nerren\u2019s medical claims against the officers who arrested him. They contend that the district court erred in denying their motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. As Nerren has stated a claim under clearly established law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b560-22\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b560-23\">Nerren filed this <em>pro se </em>civil rights action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the Livingston Police Department, Livingston Police Officer Matt Parish, Livingston Police Officer Robert Alston, Polk County Sheriff Billy Ray Nelson, and Polk County Officer Bob Key, alleging that he was denied medical care. This appeal, however, involves only the qualified immunity-based summary judgment motions of Officers Alston and Parish (Arresting Officers). Viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant Nerren, the facts are as follows.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-24\">On July 18, 1993, Nerren was involved in an automobile accident in Polk County, Texas. Several people were injured. By the time Officers Parish and Alston arrived at the accident scene, Nerren, the driver of one of the vehicles in the accident, had fled. Several hours later while on routine patrol, Officer Alston spotted Nerren. Alston radioed for back up and with the help of Officers Parish and Ken Bohnert,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> arrested Nerren. At the time of the arrest, Nerren stated that he was in pain and requested medical attention.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One of the Arresting Officers told Nerren that because he \u201cdidn\u2019t worry about the people he had the automobile accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>with the police where [sic] not worried about him.\u201d Nerren was transported to the Polk County Jail without receiving any medical attention.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The following day Nerren was released on bond and taken by a relative to the Lufkin Memorial Hospital. Medical records reveal that at the time of his admission to the hospital, Nerren had abrasions on his face and chest. Additionally, the records indicate that a laparoscopic examination revealed a large amount (1000 ccs) of intra-abdominal blood. Nerren had a tom liver and was taken to surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">In this suit Nerren alleges that the Arresting Officers knowingly and willfully denied him reasonable medical attention in violation of his substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. Officers Parish and Alston moved for summary judgment, arguing that Nerren failed to state a claim for the denial of medical care because (1) there was no evidence that they knew Nerren needed medical care; (2) Nerren had not alleged causation of any injury by their actions; and (3) they were entitled to qualified immunity because the law was not clearly established that they had a duty to provide medical care in the absence of an obvious or expressed need for such care.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The district court referred the case to a magistrate judge. After a hearing, the magistrate judge recommended dismissing Nerren\u2019s claims against the Livingston Police Department and Sheriff Nelson as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d), but recommended denying the Arresting Officers\u2019 qualified immunity based motions for summary judgment. Applying the reasonable medical care standard applicable to pretrial detainees at that time, the magistrate judge held that Nerren\u2019s right to medical attention was clearly established, and that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the defendants knew of Nerren\u2019s need for medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">Parish and Alston filed objections. The district court overruled the objections and adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, denying the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. The court held that Nerren had stated a claim for the denial of reasonable medical care, a clearly established right. The Arresting Officers timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b561-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ANH\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b561-17\">We must first determine whether the district court\u2019s denial of the Arresting Officers\u2019 motions for summary judgment based on qualified immunity are immediately appealable orders.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Mitchell v. </em>Forsyth,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the Supreme Court held that \u201ca district court\u2019s denial of a claim of qualified immunity, to the extent that it turns on an issue of law, is an appealable \u2018final decision\u2019 within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Johnson v. </em>Jones,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Supreme Court appeared to narrow our interlocutory jurisdiction somewhat, holding that a district court\u2019s order, entered in a qualified immunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>case, is not appealable if it determines a question of \u201cevidence sufficiency.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> More recently, in <em>Behrens v. </em>Pelletier;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Supreme Court clarified that <em>Johnson </em>\u201cpermits [the defendant] to claim on appeal that all of the conduct which the District Court deemed sufficiently supported for purposes of summary judgment met the <em>Harlow </em>standard of \u2018objective legal reasonableness.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, in <em>Behrens, </em>the district court\u2019s determination that \u201cmaterial issues of fact remain\u201d did not preclude appellate review.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">In the wake of <em>Behrens, </em>the <em>Johnson </em>modification (if any) on appellate, review applies only when \u201cwhat is at issue in the sufficiency determination is nothing more than whether the evidence could support a finding that particular conduct occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, we cannot review the \u201cevidence sufficiency issue\u201d (i.e., whether the nonmovant presented sufficient summary judgment evidence to create a dispute of fact). But we retain interlocutory jurisdiction to \u201ctake, as given, the facts that the district court assumed when it denied summary judgment\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and determine whether these facts state a claim under clearly established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Applying the <em>Johnson-Behrens </em>gloss on <em>Mitchell </em>to the instant case, we conclude that the disputes of fact in this ease do not deprive us of jurisdiction. We have interlocutory jurisdiction to determine whether Nerren\u2019s summary judgment facts state a claim under clearly established law. Accordingly, we ignore the disputes of fact, take those facts assumed by the district court in a light most favorable to Nerren, and determine whether under those facts Nerren has stated a claim under clearly established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-15\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b562-16\">We review <em>de novo </em>the denial of a public official\u2019s motion for summary judgment predicated on qualified immunity.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As Nerren is proceeding pro se, we will construe his complaint liberally.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-17\">C. Nerren\u2019s Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b562-18\">First, we must parse Nerren\u2019s complaint. As already noted, Nerren alleges that by denying him medical attention, both police and jail officials, deprived him of his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. This appeal, however, deals with but a single facet of Nerren\u2019s complaint \u2014 namely, the allegations that, in the time interval between his arrest and booking, the Arresting Officers denied him medical attention.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In other words, we here address only Nerren\u2019s claims that his substantive due process rights were violated while he was an arrestee.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-19\">D. Arrestees and Pretrial Detainees</p>\n<p id=\"b562-20\">Today, we make explicit that which was heretofore either implicit or taken for granted in our case law: An arrestee\u2019s complaint for denial of substantive due process and a pretrial detainee\u2019s complaint for denial of substantive due process are evaluated under the same standards.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We discern no reason to carve out a separate standard for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>arrestees, a subset of pretrial detainees.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> After the initial incidents of a seizure have concluded and an individual is being detained by police officials but has yet to be booked, an arrestee\u2019s right to medical attention, like that of a pretrial detainee, derives from the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">E. Qualified Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Assessing the defense of qualified immunity is a two-step process.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> First, using \u201ccurrently applicable constitutional standards,\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> we determine whether the plaintiff has \u201callege[d] the violation of a clearly established constitutional right.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> If so, we then decide if the defendant\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable, because \u201c \u2018[ejven if an official\u2019s conduct violates a constitutional right, he is entitled to qualified immunity if the conduct was objectively reasonable.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">1. <em>Currently Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Under currently applicable constitutional standards, Nerren has stated a claim for the denial of his substantive due process rights. Recently, we held that a state official\u2019s episodic act or omission violates a pretrial detainee\u2019s due process right to medical care if the official acts with subjective deliberate indifference to the detainee\u2019s rights<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We then defined subjective deliberate indifference as subjective knowledge of a substantial risk of serious medical harm, followed by a response of deliberate indifference.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-14\">In the instant case, Nerren has alleged that his face and chest were marred with abrasions, he was in pain, and he informed the Arresting Officers that he needed medical attention. Moreover, the police had subjective knowledge that Nerren had recently been involved in a multiple vehicle injury accident. Nevertheless, after allegedly acknowledging Nerren\u2019s request of and need for medical attention, the Arresting Officers denied his request for the express reason that he had fled the scene of the accident without regard for the plight of the other victims. Accepting Nerren\u2019s allegations as true, the Arresting Officers had subjective knowledge of Nerren\u2019s need of medical attention yet turned a deaf ear to his request. If the evidence at trial supports these allegations, a reasonable juror could conclude that the Arresting Officers were deliberately indifferent to Nerren\u2019s constitutional right to medical attention.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Thus, Nerren has cleared the first hurdle of qualified immunity: Under currently applicable law, Nerren has alleged a violation of a clearly established right.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>2. <em>Objectively Reasonable ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Next, we must turn back the judicial clock to 1993 and determine if the Arresting Officers\u2019 conduct was nonetheless objectively reasonable at that time. We conclude that it was not. At least since 1987, it has been clear that pretrial detainees, a set that includes arrestees, are entitled to reasonable medical care unless the failure to supply that care is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> A pretrial detainee\u2019s specific right to medical attention has evolved over time from his general right to be free from punishment. Pretrial detainees, as distinguished from convicted prisoners, are those individuals who have been charged with a crime but who have yet to be tried on the charge.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">We contrast pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners because the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment accords pretrial detainees rights not enjoyed by convicted inmates under the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Specifically, \u201cwhile a sentenced inmate may be punished in any fashion not cruel and unusual, the due process clause <em>forbids punishment </em>of a person held in custody awaiting trial but not yet adjudged guilty of any crime.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This standard, applied to medical attention, \u201centitles pretrial detainees to reasonable medical care unless the failure to supply it is reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The Arresting Officers have failed to present a legitimate governmental objective for denying Nerren medical attention. Moreover, Nerren has alleged facts presented sufficient summary judgment evidence from which a reasonable juror could find an expressed intent to punish: The Arresting Officers\u2019 statements implied that they were refusing medical attention to Nerren because he was not concerned about the other accident victims. From this a reasonable juror could conclude that Nerren was denied medical attention as punishment for fleeing the accident. It is inescapable that such a punishment could not be objectively reasonable conduct by the Arresting Officers because Nerren was not subject to any punishment. His punishment, nevertheless, came in the form of the denial of his constitutional right to medical attention. In sum, whether Nerren\u2019s allegations are analyzed under a pretrial detainee\u2019s more general right under <em>Bell </em>and <em>Valencia </em>to be free from punishment or his more specific right to medical attention announced in <em>Jones </em>and <em>Hare, </em>Nerren has stated a claim and the Arresting Officers\u2019 conduct was objectively unreasonable. We thus conclude that the district court\u2019s denial of the Arresting Officers\u2019 motion for summary judgment is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b564-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-16\">. <em>See Blackwell v.
