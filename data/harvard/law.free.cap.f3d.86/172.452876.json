The cases are therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak6\">Plaintiffs appeal from the district court\u2019s orders affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s dismissals of their adversary proceedings. Plaintiff Evelyne Broitman (appeal No. 95-4081) and plaintiffs George and Helen Hermestroff (appeal No. 95-4131) brought separate proceedings, seeking judgments that debts owed to them were nondischargeable. The district court dismissed each of the proceedings for lack of timely service upon defendant/debtor Kirkland. The order affirming the dismissal of plaintiff Evelyne Broitman\u2019s complaint may be found at <em>Broitman v. Kirkland (In re Kirkland), </em>181 B.R. 563 (D.Utah 1995). The order from which the Hermestroffs appeal is unpublished. This court consolidated these cases on its own motion, Fed.RApp.P. 3(b), and affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"AKZ\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"Abg\">The facts are undisputed. Plaintiffs filed their proceedings pro se in the bankruptcy court on May 20, 1994. Pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 4(j), plaintiffs were required to serve defendant Kirkland with the summons and complaint in each proceeding on or before September 17, 1994.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since that date fell on a Saturday, the time for service was extended until Monday, September 19, 1994. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Bankr.P. 9006(a).</p>\n<p id=\"AQW\">Each plaintiff failed to meet the deadline for service. Each summons and complaint was served one day late, on Tuesday, Sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>tember 20, 1994. Defendant moved for dismissal of the complaints for untimely service.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The bankruptcy .court held a consolidated hearing on the motions to dismiss, at which plaintiffs argued that the proceedings should not be dismissed because there was \u201cgood cause\u201d for their failure to timely serve the defendant. <em>See </em>former Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(j). As evidence of good cause, plaintiff Broitman presented her affidavit, in which she described her reasons for delay:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\">2. I understood, under the law, that I had until September 20, 1994 in which to serve the Debtor with the Complaint and Summons. The Complaint and Summons was (sic) served by that date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO4-\">3. I waited to serve the Complaint and Summons because there are ongoing legal proceedings in the State of California between myself and the Debtor\u2019s partnership and/or connected entities. These legal proceedings may have made it unnecessary for me to pursue this non-dischargeability action. However, these legal proceedings are continuing and have not been resolved, therefore making it necessary for me to pursue the Debtor in this non-discharge-ability action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Appellants\u2019 App. at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Plaintiff George Hermestroff presented his own, identically-worded affidavit. <em>See id. </em>at 34-35. The bankruptcy court considered the affidavits and determined that plaintiffs had failed to show good cause for failure to timely serve defendant. <em>See </em>Court\u2019s Ruling, Appellees\u2019 Supp.App. at 5. The court granted defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss, and the district court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-11\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s decision affirming the decision of a bankruptcy court, this court applies the same standards of review which governed the district court. <em>In re Tanaka Bros. Farms, Inc., </em>36 F.3d 996, 998 (10th Cir.1994). The bankruptcy court\u2019s findings of fact will be rejected only if clearly erroneous. <em>In re Mama D\u2019Angelo, Inc., </em>55 F.3d 552, 555 (10th Cir.1995). Its conclusions of law, however, are reviewed <em>de novo. In re Davidovich, </em>901 F.2d 1533, 1536 (10th Cir.1990). Dismissal of a complaint for failure to comply with Rule 4(j)\u2019s 120-day time limit for service is committed to the bankruptcy court\u2019s discretion and will be set aside only for an abuse of that discretion. <em>See Putnam v. Morris, </em>833 F.2d 903, 904 (10th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-16\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-17\">Rule 4(j) requires the court to dismiss a proceeding if service has not been made upon the defendant within 120 days after filing and the party responsible for service cannot show good cause why it was not made. Rule 4(j) does not define \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>See Cox v. Sandia Corp., </em>941 F.2d 1124, 1125 (10th Cir. 1991). This court has interpreted the phrase narrowly, rejecting inadvertence or neglect as \u201cgood cause\u201d for untimely service. <em>See, e.g., Despain v. Salt Lake Area Metro Gang Unit, </em>13 F.3d 1436, 1438 (10th Cir.1994); <em>Putnam v. Morris, </em>833 F.2d 903, 905 (10th Cir.1987); <em>see generally Cloyd v. Arthur Anderson &amp; Co., </em>151 F.R.D. 407, 411 (D.Utah 1993)(summarizing cases), <em>aff'd, </em>No. 93-4199, 1994 WL 242184 (10th Cir. June 7, 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-18\">Plaintiffs argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>507 U.S. 380, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993), requires the application of a more flexible standard in evaluating \u201cgood cause.\u201d In <em>Pioneer, the </em>Supreme Court <em>considered </em>the meaning of the phrase \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d contained in Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to <em>Pioneer, </em>some circuits interpreted \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d to require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>proof that failure to timely perform a duty was due to circumstances beyond the party\u2019s control. <em>Pioneer, </em>507 U.S. at 387 n. 3, 113 S.Ct. at 1494 n. 3. The Supreme Court rejected this narrow interpretation, holding that the plain meaning of the word \u201cneglect\u201d includes inadvertent or negligent omissions. Id at 394-95, 113 S.Ct. at 1497-98. The court determined that \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d could include attorney inadvertence or negligence, provided certain mitigating circumstances were present. Id at 395-97, 113 S.Ct. at 1498-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The circuits mentioned in <em>Pioneer </em>rejected inadvertence as a basis for showing \u201cexcusable neglect,\u201d just as this court has also rejected it as a sufficient showing of \u201cgood cause.\u201d Plaintiffs seize on this similarity and urge application of Pioneer\u2019s flexible approach to the interpretation of \u201cgood cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The <em>Pioneer </em>Court did not in any way link its discussion of \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d with \u201cgood cause\u201d under Rule 4(j). Plaintiffs attempt to show that the standards are similar, citing <em>Putnam, </em>833 F.2d at 905, in which this court stated that the two standards are interrelated. A careful reading of <em>Putnam </em>discloses, however, that the court clarified the interrelationship with a telling quotation from <em>Winters v. Teledyne Movible Offshore, Inc., </em>776 F.2d 1304, 1306 (5th Cir.1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">Without attempting a rigid or all-encompassing definition of \u201cgood cause,\u201d it would appear to require <em>at least as much </em>as would be required to show excusable neglect, as to which simple inadvertence or mistake of counsel or ignorance of the rules usually does not suffice, and some showing of \u201cgood faith on the part of the party seeking the enlargement and some reasonable basis for noncompliance within the time specified\u201d is normally required. 10 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil \u00a7 1165 at 622 (emphasis added). <em>The district court is clearly not compelled to accept a lesser \u201cexcusable neglect\u2019\u2019 showing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">833 F.2d at 905 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\"><em>Putnam </em>thus recognized that the two standards, although interrelated, are not identical and that \u201cgood cause\u201d requires a greater showing than \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Cox, </em>941 F.2d at 1125, the court also acknowledged that \u201cgood cause\u201d under Rule 4 and \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d under Rule 60 were not identical. Thus, the cases do not support plaintiffs\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">Considering this issue anew in light of <em>Pioneer, </em>there are several \u00abreasons not to apply its flexible test concerning excusable neglect to the \u201cgood cause\u201d standard under Rule 4(j). First, in reaching its result in <em>Pioneer, </em>the Supreme Court relied upon the plain meaning of the term \u201cneglect,\u201d which can connote negligence or inadvertence. 507 U.S. at 394-95, 113 S.Ct. at 1497-98. The plain meaning of the phrase \u201cgood cause\u201d has no such connotation. Second, the Supreme Court relied upon use of the term \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d in a broad sense in Rules 6(b), 13(f), 60(b)(1), and 60(b)(6). 507 U.S. at 392-93, 113 S.Ct. at 1496-97. This phrase is not, however, used in Rule 4(j). Had the drafters of the federal rules intended to include an excusable neglect standard in Rule 4(j), they could certainly have done so. Third, the Supreme Court noted that Rule 9006\u2019s allowance for late filings due to \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d serves an equitable purpose in Chapter 11 proceedings. <em>Pioneer, </em>507 U.S. at 389, 113 S.Ct. at 1495. Rule 4(j), by contrast, applies to a wide variety of proceedings and does not have a similar, equitable purpose. Finally, Rule 4(j) is a separate rule and operates independently from Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b)(1); Rule 9006(b)(1) may actually relieve litigants from the harsh consequences of Rule 4(j).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The standard for evaluating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>\u201cgood cause\u201d contained in Rule 4(j) is not affected by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pioneer. See also Dederick &amp; Himlie, P.</em>A. <em>v. DuFour (In re DuFour), </em>153 B.R. 853, 857 (Bankr.D.Minn.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">The ultimate question is whether the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in finding that plaintiffs failed to show good cause for their failure to timely serve defendant. The court noted that, although plaintiffs filed their complaints pro se, they had some familiarity with the bankruptcy process, and had some access to legal counsel. Court\u2019s Ruling, Appellees\u2019\u00bb Supp.App. at 3. It further found that the plaintiffs made a strategic or economic decision, based upon other litigation, to wait until the last minute to serve defendant. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs showed that they miscalculated or neglected the filing date, but failed to show good cause for their error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Pro se litigants must follow the requirements of Rule 4(j). <em>DiCesare v. Stuart, </em>12 F.3d 973, 980 (10th Cir.1993). As stated above, inadvertence or negligence alone do not constitute \u201cgood cause\u201d for failure of timely service. Mistake of counsel or ignorance of the rules also usually do not suffice. <em>Putnam, </em>833 F.2d at 905; <em>Despain, </em>13 F.3d at 1439.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Plaintiffs testified to their understanding that they had until September 20, 1994, to achieve service on defendant. They failed, however, to supply any explanation for this misunderstanding. Unexplained assertions of miscalculation do not constitute \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>See Yosef v. Passamaquoddy Tribe, </em>876 F.2d 283, 287 (2d Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 U.S. 1028, 110 S.Ct. 1474, 108 L.Ed.2d 611 (1990). Although a small delay-in achieving service may not prejudice the defendant, absence of prejudice alone does not constitute good cause. <em>Despain, </em>13 F.3d at 1439. Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 affidavits reveal that they waited, apparently for strategic reasons, until the perceived last possible moment to serve defendant. The plaintiff who seeks to rely on the good cause provision must show meticulous efforts to comply with the rule. <em>Id. </em>at 1438.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">In sum, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing this action. The judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Utah is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Aq0\">. Rule 7004(a) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure makes certain provisions of Fed. R.Civ.P. 4, including Rule 4(j), applicable to adversary proceedings. Rule 7004(g) specifies that the provisions of Rule 4 in effect on January 1, 1990, apply, notwithstanding any subsequent amendment to Rule 4. Rule 4(j) has subsequently been amended, with the new rule being found at Rule 4(m). Former Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(j), applicable here, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHu\">If a service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint and the party on whose behalf such service was required cannot show good cause why such service was not made within that period, the action shall be dismissed as to that defendant without prejudice upon the court\u2019s own initiative with notice to each party or upon motion. This subdivision shall not apply to service in a foreign country pursuant to subdivision (I) of this rule.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-12\">. Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b)(1) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-13\">(b) Enlargement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-14\">(1) In General. Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision, when an act is required or allowed to be done at or within a specified period by these rules or by a notice given thereunder or by order of court, the court for cause shown may at any time in its discretion (1) with or without motion or notice order the period enlarged if the request therefor is made before the expiration of the period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order or (2) on motion made after the expiration of the specified period permit the act to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b265-8\">. It should be noted that in <em>Putnam, </em>the court discussed \"excusable neglect\u201d under Fed. R.Civ.P. 6(b). Bankruptcy Rule 9006(b)(1) is patterned after Rule 6(b) and serves a similar purpose. <em>See Pioneer, </em>507 U.S. at 391, 113 S.Ct. at 1496.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b265-9\">. The interrelationship of these two rules suggests that plaintiffs might have brought themselves within the \"excusable neglect\u201d standard by filing a motion requesting extension of time for service under Rule 9006(b)(1). <em>See Kalesse, Inc. v. Williams (In re Williams), </em>178 B.R. 255, 258-59 (Bankr.D.Mont.1995). However, the district court found that there was no evidence that they did so. <em>See Kirkland, </em>181 B.R. at 567.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
