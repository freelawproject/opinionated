ANDERSON, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">Glickman, Inc. appeals from a denial of attorney\u2019s fees under Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 40-256, in this insurance coverage diversity ease. This appeal calls upon us to interpret \u00a7 256. That statute punishes insurance companies that refuse, without just cause or excuse, to pay the full amount of an insured loss, by requiring them to pay the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees incurred in a coverage action against the insurer. As pertinent, \u00a7 256 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-10\">Attorney fees in actions on insurance policies; exception. That, in all actions hereafter commenced, in which judgment is rendered against any insurance company ... if it appear from the evidence that such company ... <em>has refused without just cause or excuse to pay the full amount of such loss, </em>the court in rendering such judgment shall allow the plaintiff a reasonable sum as an attorney\u2019s fee for services in such action, including proceeding upon appeal, to be recovered and collected as part of the costs____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-13\">(Emphasis added).. The parties agree that this statute, which refers only to refusals to pay, has been judicially extended to cover refusals to defend. We, therefore, do not address that proposition. The central question before us is whether the statutory qualifier \u201cwithout just cause or excuse\u201d embodies one legal standard for refusals to indemnify and a stricter standard for refusals to defend. The appellant, Glickman, Inc., and the Kansas Insurance Department, as amicus curiae, contend that if there is a mere possibility of coverage, there is no just cause or excuse for failing to defend, while the existence of a bona fide dispute over coverage constitutes just cause or excuse for failing to indemnify. We hold that the plain language of the statute does not support different tests for refusals to defend and refusals to indemnify, nor does it support the proposition\u2014 however desirable \u2014 that \u201cjust cause or excuse\u201d for refusing to defend exists only when there is no possibility of coverage. The plain wording of the statute does not translate refusal \u201cwithout just cause or excuse to pay the full amount of ... loss\u201d into refusal to defend where there is a possibility of coverage. To hold otherwise would be a judicial amendment, not an interpretation, of this state statute. Contrary to the appellant\u2019s argument, no Kansas appellate court has held otherwise in a case constituting binding precedent. Accordingly, the district court did not apply an improper standard in determining that Glickman is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-14\">As for the numerous other assignments of error raised by Glickman, we conclude that the district court did not err, either in procedure or substance, in granting summary judgment denying Glickman an award of attorney\u2019s fees against the defendant, The Home Insurance Company. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-16\">The chronology leading to this lawsuit is not disputed, although the parties characterize the facts differently. In August 1992, Glickman was named as a third party defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>dant in an environmental response costs action, <em>Barton Solvents, Inc. v. Southwest Petro-Chem, Inc., </em>No. 91-2382-V, 1993 WL 382047 (D.Kan.) (\u201cBarton Solvents\u201d action), brought pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601-9675 (\u201cCERCLA\u201d). More than five months later, on January 28, 1993, Glickman\u2019s attorneys wrote Gliekman\u2019s insurance agent, William H. Cohen of Insurance Management Associates in Wichita, Kansas, asking him to \u201creview insurance policies that may have been in effect\u201d in 1971 and \u201cseveral years thereafter\u201d and \u201cdetermine whether the insurers may be obligated to assist our client in the defense of this matter.\u201d Appellant\u2019s App., Tab 22, at 239^40. The letter then stated that it should be regarded as a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Insurance Management Associates responded that it did not have copies of any such policy or policies, and forwarded the inquiry to the defendant/appellee in this case, The Home Insurance Company. Home responded to Glickman\u2019s counsel on February 12, 1993, with a three-page letter. The letter, among other things, asked questions relating to the merits of the Barton Solvents action, and asked for copies of the twenty-year-old policies, the existence or terms of which had not been verified. Glickman\u2019s counsel responded promptly, demanding a defense, among other things, and advising Home that Glickman had no copies of insurance policies because of a fire. Home did not reply for more than five months, during which time Glickman\u2019s counsel repeatedly demanded Home\u2019s attention to the matter and threatened suit, including a claim for bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">On July 23, 1993, Home wrote a five-page letter to Glickman\u2019s counsel still questioning the existence of all but one policy of insurance. As to that policy, Home set out the terms of coverage, stating, among other things, that remediation costs are not covered damages under the policy. The letter also raised a variety of other potential defenses, but closed by saying that Home was willing to discuss with Glickman, and all other potential carriers, Glickman\u2019s defense in the Barton Solvents action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">Home wrote again on August 3, 1993, supplying a copy of the one policy it had found, again asking for information regarding other potential carriers, and again stating that when it had the necessary information, it would be in a position to discuss a possible defense. Glickman\u2019s counsel wrote back on August 23 and August 31, 1993, furnishing information and threatening suit if Home did not pay prior litigation expenses and undertake Glickman\u2019s defense from that time forward. Home did not respond, and on September 14, 1993, Glickman filed this action against Home seeking a declaratory judgment that Home was liable for Gliekman\u2019s defense costs and any damages assessed against it in the Barton Solvents action. It also sought a judgment for costs and attorney\u2019s fees in this action pursuant to \u00a7 256.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">In the district court, Home contested coverage, among other things, on the ground that environmental response costs are not damages within the terms of the policy. Ultimately this defense proved unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-9\">On June 28, 1994, the district court granted Glickman\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, ruling that response costs are damages within the meaning of a liability policy and that Home was obligated to defend Glickman in the Barton Solvents action and reimburse it for defense costs already incurred. Home did so, paying $85,000 for Glickman\u2019s legal expenses incurred in the Barton Solvents action. Subsequently, Home paid $45,000 to settle claims against Glickman in that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-10\">On March 31, 1995, Home moved for summary judgment on Glickman\u2019s claim under \u00a7 256 that Home must pay Gliekman\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees in this case as a penalty for refusing a defense in the Barton Solvents action. The district court granted Home\u2019s motion, ruling that Glickman was not entitled to fees under \u00a7 256. It stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-11\">The court finds that an award of attorney fees in the present case cannot be justified under K.S.A 40-256. As the court noted in its previous order, in reference to the controlling question of whether response costs could be considered damages for purposes of insurance coverage, \u201cthere is an extensive line of authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>supporting both positions.\u201d (June 29,1994 Order, p. 7.) At the time, there were no relevant Kansas appellate court decisions; two decisions in the Kansas federal court had reached opposing conclusions. Indeed, as Glickman, in its separate motion to compel discovery has admitted, Home\u2019s position was \u201carguable given the split amongst the circuits on that issue.\u201d (Pltf.\u2019s Memo, in Supp. of Motion to Compel, at 5.) In the present case, the validity of Home\u2019s response costs defense was not clearly determined until the court\u2019s ruling on June 29,1994.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-4\">The main thrust of Glickman\u2019s argument in opposition to Home\u2019s motion is directed at the need for additional discovery. Glickman contends that additional discovery is needed for a variety of purposes, including that of Home\u2019s general patterns and practices involving customer claims. Glickman asserts that Home\u2019s denial of coverage may have been based upon other, alternative rationales beyond its defense that response costs were not \u201cdamages\u201d within the meaning of the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-5\">The court finds that additional discovery is neither required nor beneficial. The court finds explicitly that Home\u2019s response costs defense was not frivolous or unjustified. Whether additional considerations or potential defenses may have been contemplated by Home is therefore irrelevant. There is no basis in the evidentiary materials before the court to say that Home\u2019s response costs defense did not play a consistent role in the company\u2019s decisions relating to Glickman\u2019s claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">(Appellant\u2019s App., Tab 16, at. 213-14). Glickman moved for reconsideration and that was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">On appeal, Glickman presents a barrage of arguments and subarguments as to why the district court erred, including reliance on incorrect legal standards and the existence of genuine issues of material facts on critical points, outlined below. It contends that Home\u2019s denial of coverage was without just cause or excuse because the defense that response costs are not damages under the policy was an afterthought, unsupported by case law nationally, inconsistent with Home\u2019s publicly announced position, and because Home failed to investigate the allegations in the Barton Solvents action. With respect to Home\u2019s alleged refusal to defend, Glickman argues, as indicated above, that refusals to defend where there is any possibility of coverage constitute refusals without just cause or excuse under \u00a7 256 and that the district court erred as a matter of law in failing to apply this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">Glickman further contends that public policy considerations dictate reversal of the district court\u2019s judgment. And, finally, Glickman contends that the district court abused its discretion by cutting off discovery by Glickman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">The standard for applying \u00a7 256 to refusals to defend is the most prominent legal point in this appeal, and the single issue addressed by amicus curiae, the Kansas Insurance Department. Accordingly, we turn to it first, applying to that and other issues the usual de novo standard for reviewing a summary judgment, <em>Wolf v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>50 F.3d 793, 796 (10th Cir.1995), and the standard applicable to a court sitting in diversity. <em>See Koch v. Shell Oil Co., </em>52 F.3d 878, 880 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-12\">A. <em>Refusal to Defend.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-13\">Section 256 is a punitive measure that requires insurance companies to pay the plaintiffs attorneys fees incurred in an action on an insurance policy, if the evidence shows that the insurance company \u201chas refused without just cause or excuse to pay the full amount of [the insured] loss.\u201d In full, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-14\">40-256. Attorney fees in actions on insurance policies; exception. That in all actions hereafter commenced, in which judgment is rendered against any insurance company as defined in K.S.A. 40-201, and including in addition thereto any fraternal benefit society and any reciprocal or interinsurance exchange on any policy or certificate of any type or kind of insurance, if it appear from the evidence that such company, society or exchange has refused without just cause or excuse to pay the full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>amount of such loss, the court in rendering such judgment shall allow the plaintiff a reasonable sum as an attorney\u2019s fee for services in such action, including proceeding upon appeal, to be recovered and collected as a part of the costs: <em>Provided, however, </em>That when a tender is made by such insurance company, society or exchange before the commencement of the action in which judgment is rendered and the amount recovered is not in excess of such tender no such costs shall be allowed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAe\">Glickman and the Kansas Insurance Department contend that the statute applies differently to refusals to pay and refusals to defend. They assert that there is just cause or excuse for a refusal to pay if a bona fide dispute over policy coverage exists; but, there can be no just cause or excuse for refusing to defend an insured if there is any possibility of coverage, however remote. <em>See </em>Glickman\u2019s Mem. in Supp. of Mo. to Reconsider, Appellant\u2019s App., Tab 18, at 220-21; Appellant\u2019s Br. at 18-20; Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 6,11-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">The idea is that \u00a7 256 should force insurance companies to defend virtually every case, even when the possibility of coverage is remote, while allowing them some leeway to argue about coverage. This interpretation is justified by sound public policy, according to Glickman and amicus, because it prevents insurance companies from sitting back and forcing \u201cthe prohibitive cost of defending ... claims\u201d upon insureds, Amicus Curiae Br. at 2; and, it avoids a chilling effect upon consumers forced to sue insurance companies to establish rights to defense and coverage. <em>Id. </em>The interpretation is also compelled, they contend, by existing case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">On the latter point, Glickman and amicus first recite settled insurance contract law in this circuit and Kansas to the effect that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend is broader than its duty to indemnify, and the duty to defend is triggered when there is a potential of liability. <em>Bankwest v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., </em>63 F.3d 974, 981 (10th Cir.1995); <em>Western Heritage Ins. Co. v. Chava Trucking, Inc., </em>991 F.2d 651, 656 (10th Cir.1993); <em>American Motorists Ins. Co. v. General Host Corp., </em>946 F.2d 1489, 1490 (10th Cir.1991); <em>Hocker v. New Hampshire Ins. Co., </em>922 F.2d 1476, 1484 (10th Cir.1991); <em>Spivey v. Safeco Ins. Co., </em>254 Kan. 237, 865 P.2d 182, 188 (1993); <em>MGM, Inc. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>253 Kan. 198, 855 P.2d 77, 79 (1993); <em>Spruill Motors, Inc. v. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., </em>212 Kan. 681, 512 P.2d 403, 407 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">However, we are dealing here with a statute, not contract law. As the Kansas Insurance Department acknowledges, after reciting to the contract rule, the issue still remains: \u201cwhether K.S.A. 40-256 applies to an insurer\u2019s duty to defend and, if so, whether [Home] failed to defend [Glickman] without just cause or excuse.\u201d Amicus Curiae Br. at 5. On the specific issue of whether the penalty under \u00a7 256 applies to a refusal to defend where the mere possibility of coverage exists, Glickman cites the following Kansas state cases: <em>Missouri Medical Ins. Co. v. Wong, </em>234 Kan. 811, 676 P.2d 113, 123 (1984); <em>Upland Mut. Ins. v. Noel, </em>214 Kan. 145, 519 P.2d 737, 742-43 (1974); and <em>Bowlus School Supply v. Swartz, </em>766 P.2d 204, 1988 Kan.App. LEXIS 816, at *6-7 (Kan.Ct.App. 1988) (not designated for publication).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Kansas Insurance Department, cites only the unpublished decision of the Kansas Court of Appeals in <em>Bowlus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-11\">None of these eases hold that an insurance company is liable for attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 256 if it refuses to defend when there is a possibility of coverage. In fact, each of the cases is decided on whether or not a bona fide dispute existed over coverage. References to duty to defend are both dicta and ultimately melded into the coverage question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-12\">In <em>Missouri Medical Ins. Co. v. Wong, </em>the Kansas Supreme Court combined a requirement of coverage with a duty to defend, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>did the court in <em>Noel, </em>upon which the court relied in <em>Wong. Wong, </em>676 P.2d at 122-23. Indeed, one commentator questioned whether <em>Wong </em>even stands for the proposition that a duty to defend is within the meaning of \u00a7 256 at all. Robert H. Jerry II, <em>New Developments in Kansas Insurance Law, </em>37 U. Kan. L.Rev. 841, 846 (1989) (\u201c[T]he decision provides some support for allowing the insured to recover as damages the attorney\u2019s fees incurred in bringing the action against the insurer for breach of the duty to defend. Such a result, however, gives section 40-256 a broader construction than its plain language seems to allow.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">In <em>Bowlus, </em>the Kansas Court of Appeals reviewed findings which intermingled the insurer\u2019s duty to defend with the question of coverage, noting that no defense of the insured was undertaken until long after the court ruled that there was coverage. The court then concluded its opinion with reasoning based on standards relating to coverage cases, i.e., whether a good faith controversy existed, and held only that the trial court had not abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees under \u00a7 256. The trial court\u2019s decision to award fees was described as follows: \u201cThe court ultimately found that Allied had been without just cause or excuse <em>in denying the claim and, </em>denying representation and awarded Swartz attorney fees.\u201d <em>Bowlus, </em>766 P.2d 204, 1988 Kan.App. LEXIS 816, at *3 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">In short, no Kansas state authority stands for the proposition advanced by Glickman. Thus, contrary to assertions by the Kansas Insurance Department, consistent application of Kansas law is scarcely placed in jeopardy by the standard employed by the district court in this case. It should go without saying that the public policy arguments of Glickman and amicus, outlined above, should be addressed to the Kansas Legislature. We are confined to the plain words of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">We conclude that under the plain language of \u00a7 256 there is no separate and stricter standard for refusals to defend, and the district court did not err in refusing to apply such a standard. Rather, in determining the existence of \u201cjust cause or excuse,\u201d the standards for refusals to pay apply. We turn to that issue next.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-8\">B. <em>Just Cause or Excuse under the Bona Fide Controversy Standard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-9\">There can be no dispute that under Kansas law the accepted test for determining the existence of \u201cjust cause or excuse\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 256 is whether the insurance company\u2019s refusal is based on a bona fide controversy over policy coverage. <em>See Allied Mut. Ins. Co. v. Gordon, </em>248 Kan. 715, 811 P.2d 1112, 1125 (1991); <em>Crawford v. Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>245 Kan. 724, 783 P.2d 900, 909 (1989) (citing <em>Forrester v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>213 Kan. 442, 517 P.2d 173 (1973), <em>modified on other grounds on reh\u2019g., </em>213 Kan. 635, 518 P.2d 548 (1974)); <em>Clark Equip. Co. v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>227 Kan. 489, 608 P.2d 903, 907 (1980). Bona fide controversy has been further defined to mean a position which is not frivolous or patently without reasonable foundation. <em>Clark, </em>608 P.2d at 907. <em>See Brown v. Combined Ins. Co. of America, </em>226 Kan. 223, 597 P.2d 1080, 1084 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">The district court found that a bona fide controversy existed between Home and Glickman as to whether or not response costs under CERCLA are damages within the meaning of the standard policy issued by Home. Glickman has admitted that Home\u2019s position was arguable \u201cgiven the split amongst the circuits on that issue.\u201d Mem. in Supp. of Pl.\u2019s Mo. to Compel, Appellant\u2019s App., Tab 11, p. 129. The Kansas Insurance Department concedes the point as well: \u201cThe District Court correctly identified a division of authority on the validity of the legal defense asserted by [Home], thereby arguably making [Home\u2019s] refusal to indemnify a good faith denial.\u201d Amicus Curiae Br. at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-11\">These concessions are essentially foregone conclusions considering the undoubted seriousness and nationwide scope of the controversy over insurers\u2019 liability for claims under CERCLA. The long list of cases on the subject cited by both parties attests to the pervasiveness and longevity of the dispute. Thus, while each case under \u00a7 256 must be decided on its own facts, it is futile to assert that Home was disconnected from one of the industry\u2019s greatest preoccupations and not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>prepared to dispute coverage for Glickman\u2019s response costs. In fact, it raised that defense in its July 23, 1993, reservation of rights letter \u2014 predictably along with every other defense it could think of.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">It was legitimately entitled to raise the defense. While Glickman strenuously argues the weight of the law elsewhere, it acknowledges that the Kansas Supreme Court had not as yet decided whether, under Kansas insurance contract law, response costs would be considered as damages under a standard liability policy. And, contrary to Gliekman\u2019s argument, the dispute was alive and ongoing nationally, albeit not with overwhelming success. Home had every right to test the law in Kansas on this important subject and would not be estopped from doing so by its positions in other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">We have considered and find unpersuasive all of Gliekman\u2019s arguments, including those related to discovery. The district court\u2019s findings and reasoning in its May 12, 1995, Memorandum and Order, in part set out above, are not in error, and neither is its decision to deny fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Glickman\u2019s Motion to Supplement the record is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">. Glickman also cites a federal district court case for its proposition, <em>Container Supply Co. v. Fireman's Fund Ins. Co., </em>715 F.Supp. 326, 327-28 (D.Kan.1989). That case does not support Glickman's argument either. It recognized that \u201c[w]hen there exists a bona fide dispute regarding the insured\u2019s claim, refusal to pay is not without just cause or excuse,\u201d and awarded attorneys' fees only because it found the insurance company's refusal to defend was not supported by common sense. <em>Id. </em>at 327.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
