It is</p>\n<p id=\"AeC\">FURTHER ORDERED that the court\u2019s opinion filed herein on March 15, 1996, be amended as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-14\">At page 8, n. 8 [78 F.3d at 686], add the following paragraph:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-15\">In their petition for rehearing, the plaintiffs contend that Rule 802.3e of the 1981 ANSI code \u2022 applies only to maintenance standards for newly installed escalators, and that the maintenance standards for existing escalators are provided by the law in force in the District of Columbia at the time of installation (for the escalator in question, the 1977 Elevator Act). \u2022 <em>See </em>ASME/ANSI Code A17.1, at 1 (1981) (\u201cscope\u201d section). Regardless of whether the drafters of the ANSI code intended to provide for different maintenance standards depending on when an escalator was installed, however, the Council of the District of Columbia repealed the 1977 Elevator Act and, in its place, legislated that the ANSI code provided the maintenance standards for new and existing escalators. D.C.Law 6-216, \u00a7 12(a)(4), 34 D.C.Reg. at 1102; D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 5-1303(a)(l).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZX\">At page 7, line 19 [78 F.3d at 686]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdK\">Between \u201cA17.1a\u201d and \u201c802.3e\u201d, delete the section symbol and substitute in lieu thereof \u201cRule\u201d, so that the citation reads \u201cASME/ANSI Code A17.1a Rule 802.3e\u201d.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
