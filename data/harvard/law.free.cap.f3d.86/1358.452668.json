HALL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1439-21\">Lisa Lee Mines petitioned for review of an order of the Department of Labor\u2019s Benefits Review Board (BRB) affirming the award of black lung benefits to Alva Rutter, a former coal miner. A panel of this court reversed and remanded. <em>Lisa Lee Mines v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>57 F.3d 402 (4th Cir.1995). Rutter, who had proceeded pro se before the panel, obtained counsel and sought rehearing en banc. Having granted such rehearing, we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1439-23\">Putting aside for a moment the question on which the parties disagree, we must first note that Alva Rutter\u2019s medical condition unquestionably qualifies him for black lung benefits. He is the very paradigm of the man Congress intended to compensate. According to x-rays taken in 1988 and 1989, he has profuse<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> small opacities in all six lung zones, upon which has developed complicated pneumoconiosis, or, by its more dauntingly descriptive name, \u201cprogressive massive fibro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>sis.\u201d One of the 1989 readers classified the large opacities in Rutter\u2019s lungs in Category B, which means that they are greater than <em>two inches </em>in diameter. Because progressive massive fibrosis is just that \u2014 progressive\u2014 Rutter is doubtless worse off now, seven years later, and he is not yet an old man.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He spent his entire working life \u2014 32 years\u2014 in the mines, most of it loading coal by hand. Because of this long tenure, he need prove nothing more than his complicated pneumoconiosis to be entitled to benefits. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(1), (3); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718.302, .304. In short, the substance of Rutter\u2019s claim is fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-5\">Procedure is the rub. In 1986, without the assistance of an attorney, Rutter applied for black lung benefits. He was still working at the time. An x-ray he submitted showed complicated pneumoconiosis; nonetheless, a Department of Labor claims examiner sent him a form denial. Rutter did not pursue the claim further.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-6\">In April 1989, he filed a new claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because of the denial of his earlier claim, this one was subject to the \u201cduplicate claims\u201d regulation at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.309(d), which states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1440-7\">If the earlier miner\u2019s claim has been finally denied, the later claim shall also be denied, on the grounds of the prior denial, unless the deputy commissioner determines that there has been a material change in conditions\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1440-8\">This time a deputy commissioner<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the Department awarded benefits. The responsible operator, petitioner Lisa Lee Mines, requested a hearing. Lisa Lee\u2019s challenge to the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision was limited to whether Rutter had made the threshold showing of a \u201cmaterial change in conditions.\u201d The parties then agreed to submit the question on the existing record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-14\">On October 11,1991, an administrative law judge (ALJ) issued a decision and order awarding benefits. After canvassing the evidence, the ALJ concluded, \u201cthe medical evidence in 1989 shows a definite progression of the disease occurring over another interval of time resulting in the Claimant\u2019s reduced capacity to do his former coal mine work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-15\">The ALJ then went on to hold that, if the evidence were inadequate to establish a material change in conditions, Rutter would still be entitled to benefits. According to the ALJ, the 1986 denial was erroneous on its face and \u201cnull and void <em>ab initio.\u201d </em>Consequently, \u201cit is believed that a determination whether or not the new evidence establishes a change of condition is immaterial.\u201d The ALJ set the date of onset of disability as August 1,1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-16\">On September 30, 1994, the BRB modified the award. It held that the ALJ\u2019s finding of an actual progression of Rutter\u2019s disease was sufficient to satisfy its Spese<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> test for material change in condition. However, the BRB held that the ALJ had no power to reopen or review the denial of the 1986 claim, which became final upon Rutter\u2019s failure to appeal or move to modify it. The BRB therefore affirmed the award but changed the date from which benefits were payable to April 1, 1989. Lisa Lee then filed a timely petition for review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1440-18\">Lisa Lee\u2019s argument is as easily stated as it is counterintuitive: Rutter must now lose because he clearly should have won in 1986. He likely should have; the ALJ here was so appalled by the 1986 denial that he deemed it \u201cvoid <em>ah initio.\u201d </em>Nonetheless, though we might share the ALJ\u2019s sentiment, we agree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>that his reasoning was flawed. The 1986 denial is final, <em>see Pittston Coal Group v. Sebben, </em>488 U.S. 105, 122-123, 109 S.Ct. 414, 424-25, 102 L.Ed.2d 408 (1988), and for present purposes, we must assume that it was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-4\">The panel rejected the BRB and Director\u2019s standards for determining whether there was a material change in Rutter\u2019s condition. The panel criticized the BRB\u2019s <em>Spese </em>standard because it \u201cimpermissibly allows a claimant to present ... evidence available at the time of the initial decision tending to show that the initial decision was in error.\u201d 57 F.3d at 406. The Director\u2019s standard met similar criticism: \u201cit permits reconsideration of critical determinations underlying a decision denying benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407. Instead, the panel adopted the Seventh Circuit\u2019s test, which, as applied, meant that the miner must show that his condition has changed on every element previously decided against him. <em>See Sahara Coal Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>946 F.2d 554 (7th Cir.1991). Moreover, as in <em>Sahara Coal, </em>the panel required inquiry into the evidence behind the earlier decision, rather than merely accepting the factual predicate of the earlier decision as correct. Consequently, the panel remanded for an all-but-certain finding that Rutter had actually been eligible for benefits in 1986, so his current conceded eligibility could not evince a material change in condition. We disagree with this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-5\">If the 1986 denial is \u201cfinal\u201d in a legal sense, we must accept the correctness of its legal conclusion \u2014 Rutter was not eligible for benefits at that time \u2014 and that determination is as off-limits to criticism by the respondent as by the claimant. Only by repudiating the 1986 judgment and its necessary factual underpinning can no- change in Rutter\u2019s eondition be found. We believe that such repudiation is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-9\">Accepting the correctness of a final judgment is more than legalistic tunnel vision; it is a practical \u2014 perhaps the only practical\u2014 way to discern a concrete form in the mists of the past. The ease we might feel at second-guessing <em>this </em>final judgment ought not tempt us to overestimate our retrospective perspicacity; most black lung claims involve a mixed bag of test results and wildly divergent medical opinions. The final decision of the ALJ (or BRB or claims examiner) on the spot is the best evidence of the truth at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-10\">In this regard, the panel opinion could be read to imply that the deputy commissioner made an express finding of fact in 1986 that Rutter had complicated pneumoconiosis. <em>See </em>57 F.3d at 404 (\u201cA Department of Labor deputy commissioner denied that claim, <em>finding that although Rutter had presented evidence of complicated pneumoconiosis, </em>he had not established that the disease was caused by coal mine work, or that he was totally disabled by the disease.\u201d) (emphasis added). This implication is mistaken. The form denial neither states that Rutter has complicated pneumoconiosis nor acknowledges that he \u201chad presented evidence\u201d of it. It may have been obvious to all who could and would see, but a finding that should have been made is not a finding that <em>was </em>made.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1441-11\">Not only does the denial of benefits itself necessarily imply the opposite finding, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 718.302 and .304, but the language of the summary denial form can logically lead only to that finding. In one part of the correspondence, Rutter was told that he had not proved total disability; in another, he was invited to submit additional evidence on that issue, and was told that proof of complicated pneumoconiosis would suffice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>We accept the final 1986 decision, as well as its necessary factual predicate, as correct. Rutter has shown a stark change in condition, and he is entitled to have his 1989 claim decided on its own considerable merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-6\">Rutter\u2019s is just a single case, and our reasons for affirming the award could end here. However, the proper standard to determine whether a given claimant has proved a \u201cmaterial change in condition\u201d has recently split the circuits, and we now take this opportunity to align ourselves with the Third and Sixth Circuits, rather than the Seventh.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-7\">In choosing the proper standard, we have three candidates: (1) the BRB\u2019s <em>Spese </em>formulation, which broadly looks to whether the newly submitted evidence favorable to the claim has a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d of changing the prior result; (2) the <em>Sahara Coal </em>test, adopted by the Seventh Circuit and the panel here, which requires the miner to show that he \u201cdid not have black lung disease at the time of the first application but has since contracted it and become totally disabled by it, or that his disease has progressed to the point of becoming totally disabling although it was not at the time of the first application,\u201d 946 F.2d at 556; and (3) the Director\u2019s \u201cone-element\u201d standard, which requires the claimant to <em>prove, </em>under all of the probative medical evidence of his condition <em>after </em>the prior denial, at least one of the elements previously adjudicated against him. The Director\u2019s standard, to which we owe deference,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> is easily the most reasonable and workable of the lot. To explain why, we should begin with background principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-16\">A new black lung claim is not barred, as a matter of ordinary <em>res judicata, </em>by an earlier denial, because the claims are not the same. The health of a human being is not susceptible to onee-in-a-lifetime adjudication.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1442-17\">It is almost too obvious for comment that res judicata does not apply if the issue is claimant\u2019s physical condition or degree of disability at two entirely different times, particularly in the case of occupational diseases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1442-18\">3 A. Larson, <em>The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation, </em>\u00a7 79.72(f) (1989). The issue in 1986 was Rutter\u2019s condition in 1986, and his future condition was not and could not have been litigated then.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-19\">Thus, nothing bars or should bar claimants from filing claims <em>seriatim, </em>and the regulations recognize that many will. <em>See, e.g., </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.409(b) (if prior claim has been denied by reason of abandonment, \u201ca new claim may be filed at any time and new evidence submitted where [the claims modification process is unavailable.]\u201d) The duplicate claims regulation, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.309(d), does not <em>bar </em>new claims, but rather directs that they shall be <em>denied </em>based on the earlier denial absent a threshold showing of a material change in conditions. Thus, the regulation simply interposes a rebuttable presumption that nothing has changed, apparently to lessen the administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number>tive burden of the black lung program.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It creates a sort of presumptive finality operating upon a future dispute, a finality that must not be confused with ordinary <em>res judicata, </em>which cannot look forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-5\">The <em>Sahara Coal </em>test, as applied by the panel here, forces the claimant to show a material change on <em>every </em>element that was previously decided against him.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This approach fails to account for the frailty of alternative holdings. A black lung claimant must prove every element of his claim. If he loses on one, or two, or three elements, the end result is the same: a denial. For this reason, if he loses on more than one element, but only one is in fact a correct basis for denial, the law does not impose a duty upon him to file a meaningless appeal to \u201ccorrect\u201d the erroneous alternative holdings. Otherwise, \u201cthe rule might be responsible for increasing the burdens of litigation on the parties and the courts rather than lightening them.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27, comment <em>i </em>(1982). Accordingly, holdings in the alternative, \u201ceither of which independently would be sufficient to support the result, ... [are] not conclusive with respect to either issue standing alone.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1443-6\">Here we meet up with something of a dilemma. We must have an anchor in the past with which to compare current conditions, but alternative holdings are not necessarily conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-7\">The Director\u2019s approach strikes a reasonable balance. Each of the alternative holdings is presumed to have been correct when made and to continue to be correct through time. Because of their tenuous nature, however, disproof of the continuing validity of just one of the alternative holdings is enough to establish a material change in condition. We defer to the Director\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the duplicate claims regulation. In doing so, we join the Third and Sixth Circuits. <em>Labelle Processing Co. v. Swarrow, </em>72 F.3d 308 (3rd Cir.1995); <em>Sharondale Corp. v. Ross, </em>42 F.3d 993 (6th Cir.1994).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1443-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-13\">In comparison to the Director\u2019s approach, <em>Spese </em>and <em>Sahara Coal </em>come up short. The <em>Spese </em>test is too vague to be applied consistently, contains illogical evidentiary rules (it permits resort to evidence available before the prior denial and forbids consideration of contrary probative evidence), and arguably sets too low a threshold (\u201creasonable possibility\u201d) to discern \u201cmaterial\u201d changes in condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-14\"><em>Sahara Coal </em>has two flaws. First, it founders on issue-preclusion principles where there are alternative holdings in the first claim, as discussed above. Second, and more importantly, it is the only one of the standards that permits \u2014 in fact demands \u2014 a plenary review of the evidence behind the first claim. For example, it is not enough for the miner to rely on an AL J\u2019s final determination that he did not have pneumoconiosis or was not disabled by it. The miner must affirmatively prove that these adverse determinations were correct.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> To use that court\u2019s own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>words, its standard \u201cmakes mincemeat of res judicata.\u201d 946 F.2d at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-4\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-5\">We are not unmindful of the possibility that the Director\u2019s standard might encourage abuse of the administrative process by wily claimants and their wily lawyers. After today\u2019s decision, an unsuccessful claimant will doubtless schedule a morning appointment with a compliant physician for a year and a day after the denial of his claim. Armed with evidence contrary to an element previously found against him, the claimant will file a new claim that afternoon, and so on, ad infinitum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-6\">This scenario belongs to that genre of horribles that seems impressive in academic debate but has little relevance to real life. Any claimant who wants to be a perpetual litigator can already be a perpetual litigator, and in a much easier fashion. The day before his hypothetical doctor\u2019s appointment, the miner may file a request for \u201cmodification\u201d of the earlier denial. For the claimant, modification is a far more attractive option than a new claim, because, in addition to a change in conditions, it can be based on a \u201cmistake in a determination of fact\u201d in the original denial. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.310(a). No new evidence is required. A claims examiner may \u201c \u2018correct mistakes of fact, whether demonstrated by wholly new evidence, cumulative evidence, or merely further reflection on the evidence initially submitted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jessee v. Director, OWCP, </em>5 F.3d 723, 724 (4th Cir. 1993) (quoting <em>O\u2019Keeffe v. Aerojet-General Shipyards, Inc., </em>404 U.S. 254, 256, 92 S.Ct. 405, 407, 30 L.Ed.2d 424 (1971) (per curiam) (decided under Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act)). Because the \u00a7 725.310(a) procedure <em>modifies </em>the original denial, the claimant has the opportunity to collect benefits from an onset of disability date preceding the original denial. The miner who waits a year and a day must file a brand new claim, and, as we have stated above, the prior denial becomes a final adjudication that the miner was not disabled by pneumoconiosis as of the date of its issuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-11\">Moreover, a miner who wanted to file duplicate claims ad infinitum would have to live ad infinitum. The black lung claims process is extraordinarily slow; today, in 1996, we still routinely hear eases involving the 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.203 interim presumption, which was superseded by the permanent regulations <em>sixteen </em>years ago. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.2 (permanent regulations effective March 31, 1980). Few miners have the time or wherewithal to go through the system twice; all too many die during the first run.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1444-12\">The risk of sporadic abuse of the duplicate claims process is far outweighed by the necessity that there be some such process and by the utility of the Director\u2019s approach to it. As we emphasized above, pneumoconiosis\u2014 especially in the advanced form from which this claimant suffers \u2014 is a progressive disease, and no rational system of law or of medicine could stand on the proposition that it can or must be measured only once.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A rational system would simultaneously account for the progressiveness of the disease, discourage useless appeals of alternative holdings, and require, at the threshold, a palpable basis to believe that conditions have changed over time. The Director\u2019s \u201cone-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>element\u201d approach accomplishes this difficult task.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-6\">Finally, we return to Mr. Alva Rutter. In clinical terms, the change in his condition has been very real, even if we reexamine the 1986 evidence. The ALJ found that, in 1986, Rutter had small opacities of 2/2 profusion in four of six lung zones, with large opacities of category A (greater than one but less than five centimeters in diameter). By 1989, small opacities clogged all six lung zones, in greater profusion (2/3 to 3/2), and large opacities had progressed to Category B (greater than five centimeters). In 1986, notwithstanding his advanced disease, Rutter could work and support his family. Now he cannot. From Rutter\u2019s viewpoint, the change in his condition could scarcely be more \u201cmaterial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-7\">The award of benefits is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1439-14\">. One reader classified the profusion as 2/3 and the other as 3/2. There are twelve levels of profusion classification for the radiographic in-teipretation of simple pneumoconiosis. 2/3 is the fourth highest profusion and 3/2 the third. <em>See </em>N. LeRoy Lapp, \"A Lawyer\u2019s Medical Guide to Black Lung Litigation,\u201d 83 <em>W. Va. Law Rev. </em>721, 729-731 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1440-9\">.

Lisa Lee correctly notes that there is no express statutory basis for the duplicate claims regulation, and asserts that it is invalid. The premise of this argument is that, absent the regulation, miners could not hie new claims. But of course they could; as the excerpt from Larson's treatise quoted above makes clear, common-law <em>res judicata </em>has no applicability where the issue is a person\u2019s health at two different times.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1443-9\">. If, as we have held above, the necessary factual premises of the 1986 decision must be accepted as true, Rutter would win under any standard.

We do not endorse, however, the closing paragraph of <em>Sharondale Corp., </em>42 F.3d at 999, where, after adopting the Director's standard, the Sixth Circuit seems to have required consideration of the evidence behind the earlier denial to determine whether it \"differ[s] qualitatively\u201d from the new evidence. Even if we agreed with such a requirement, Rutter certainly satisfied it here, inasmuch as the ALJ found an actual deterioration in his condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1443-16\">. The Seventh Circuit did speculate that this rule might allow for an exception if the claimant's current condition were \u201csubstantially worse,\u201d lest the possibility of his prior entitlement \u201ccomplicate the proceeding unduly.\" 946 F.2d at 558. Where the claimant is only \"slightly worse off,\u201d however, he must prove that he correctly (and slightly) missed the disability threshold the first time around. <em>Id. </em>This requirement lends itself to evidentiary mischief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>inasmuch as the prior file will generally contain \"admissions\u201d by the miner of all of the elements of entitlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1444-8\">. Of course, an especially cagey claimant could abuse the system by simply dropping each claim after its administrative denial, filing anew in a year and a day, and waiting, as if for the lottery jackpot, to strike it rich with a sympathetic claims examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1444-9\">This elaborate ploy could happen; all sorts of odd things happen. But it simply does not describe typical human behavior. Our lottery winner, for all the skill of his gambit, would quickly find himself faced with a controversion of the claim from the responsible operator, and he would then get a much belated chance at his decade of litigation. Out-of-work coal miners, disabled or not, generally need money badly enough to forgo such pointless intrigue in favor of honestly and earnestly prosecuting their claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1444-14\">.

While a review of the record from the claimant\u2019s first application for benefits may call the original denial of benefits into question, established and desirable principles of finality bind us to accept that conclusion. On the claimant\u2019s reapplication for benefits some years later, the objective medical facts demonstrate that his condition worsened, to the point that th\u00e9 Department of Labor concluded, without difficulty, that the claimant was disabled. The change, defined by the later finding of disability when previously such a finding was not made combined with the finding of a worsened condition, is material. And it is that material change that demands my vote in favor of affirming the Department\u2019s award of benefits, but only from the date of the second benefits application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-12\">I depart from the dissenting opinion where it draws the conclusion, contrary to the law of the case, that the claimant was \u201cunquestionably disabled\u201d at the time of his first application. To reach that conclusion, the dissent engages in an improper review of the first decision denying benefits, a decision the majority has left at rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-13\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion, sympathy \u2014 other than for what the law prescribes \u2014 played no role in our disposition of this ease.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1445-14\">LUTTIG, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AqvD\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-15\">The majority today is tempted, and ultimately persuaded, by the sympathies of this case, as is evident from the fact that it begins its analysis by \u201c[pjutting aside\u201d the legal question before us, and instead, dwelling on the uncontroverted fact that the claimant today has complicated pneumoconiosis caused by coal mine work. Whether or not, in our judgment, Rutter has complicated pneumoconiosis, or whether he is someone to whom we would award benefits were it our responsibility, are not the questions before us, however. Rather, we have before us a question of law, whether this claimant has proven a \u201cmaterial change in conditions\u201d that would warrant reconsideration of whether he is entitled to black lung benefits. <em>See 20 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 725.309(d) (providing that a successive application <em>for </em>benefits \u201cshall ... be denied\u201d unless there has been a \u201cmaterial change in conditions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1445-16\">The Department of Labor promulgated section 725.309(d), the so-called duplicate claims provision, to allow miners who were <em>not </em>disabled at the time they were initially denied benefits an opportunity to establish their entitlement to benefits if they become totally disabled following a denial of benefits. As the Department itself described the regulation, \u201ca miner whose claim has once been finally denied either by the Social Security Administration or the Department should be allowed to file a new claim on the grounds of a <em>progression to total disability.\u201d See </em>Discussion of Comments to Proposed Regulations on Duplicate Claims, 43 Fed.Reg. 36772, 36785 (Aug. 18, 1978) (emphasis add<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>ed). The regulation was never intended to, nor does it, reach a person who was unquestionably disabled at the time of the initial denial, but erroneously held to be not disabled. The law provides avenues of relief\u2014 neither of which this claimant pursued \u2014 for a person who has been erroneously denied benefits. He may either appeal the erroneous decision, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.410(c), or seek modification of that decision, for up to a year after the initial denial, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 725.310. He is not, however, entitled to benefits under the duplicate claim provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-4\">In order to conclude that this claimant is entitled to benefits under the duplicate claims provision, the majority entirely relieves claimants of their burden of proving a material change in conditions, holding that any miner who is currently entitled to benefits shall receive them, a standard that invites claimants to file claim after claim until they find a pliant ALJ. As the majority unabashedly explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1446-5\">[Njothing bars or should bar claimants from filing claims <em>seriatim </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1446-6\">After today\u2019s decision, an unsuccessful claimant will doubtless schedule a morning appointment with a compliant physician for a year and a day after the denial of his claim. Armed with evidence contrary to an element previously found against him, the claimant will file a new claim that afternoon, and so on, ad infinitum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1446-7\"><em>Ante </em>at 1362, 1364. This is, of course, precisely the result intended to be avoided under the regulation. Like the now repudiated <em>Spese </em>standard, this standard fails even to examine or consider the claimant\u2019s original conditions, much less to require a determination of whether there has been a \u201cmaterial change\u201d (or for that matter, even an immaterial change) in those conditions \u2014 as the Director himself concedes. <em>See </em>Director\u2019s Answer in Support of Respondent\u2019s Petition for Rehearing <em>En Banc </em>at 9 (acknowledging that the \u201cone-element\u201d test \u201callows an <em>inference of change </em>\u201d in conditions to support reexamination of a duplicate claim (emphasis added)). Indeed, in its haste to award benefits in this case, the majority does not so much as bother to differentiate between a change and a \u201cmaterial change,\u201d effectively holding that all changes are material.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-9\">That the majority\u2019s standard allows recovery of benefits merely upon a showing that the claimant is today eligible for benefits, without any evidence whatever of a change in his condition, is confirmed by the fact that the majority expressly rejects the requirement, from the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision it purports to adopt, that the ALJ make certain that the evidence presented with the duplicate claim \u201c \u2018differ[s] qualitatively \u201d from the evidence available at the time of the initial denial. <em>See ante </em>at 1363 n. 11 <em>(quoting Sharondale Corp. v. Ross, </em>42 F.3d 993, 999 (6th Cir.1994)). The majority, thus, adopts for this circuit the very rule that even the Sixth Circuit recognized was manifestly untenable under the regulation \u2014 that the claimant may recover benefits if \u201cthe ALJ merely disagree[s] with the previous characterization of the strength of the evidence.\u201d <em>Sharondale, </em>42 F.3d at 999.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-10\">When all is said and done, therefore, the majority holds that a claimant is entitled to benefits if he comes forward with <em>any </em>additional evidence of his condition <em>\u201cafter\u201d </em>the denial of the original claim and shows that he is now entitled to benefits, <em>ante </em>at 1362, whether or not the claimant proves a material change (or a change at all) in his conditions from what they were at the time he was earlier denied benefits. A claimant, for example, who is denied benefits and then files a duplicate claim accompanied by an additional \u201cprobative\u201d x-ray taken after the initial denial that is identical to the x-rays presented with the initial claim (that is, that show identical opacities) would receive black lung benefits on his duplicate claim, notwithstanding that his condition has not changed at all. For, he has, according to the majority, <em>\u201cprove[d], </em>under all of the probative medical evidence of his condition <em>after </em>the prior denial, at least one of the elements previously adjudicated against him.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 1362. Not only is such a holding irreconcilable with the plain language of section 725.309(d), it \u201cmakes mincemeat\u201d of the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>underlying section 725.309(d) by permitting the previous decision to be reevaluated, as the majority itself says, <em>ad infmi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number><em>turn. Cf. Sahara, </em>946 F.2d at 556 (similar criticism of the <em>Spese </em>standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-5\">Because the standard articulated by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Sahara Coal Co. v. OWCP, </em>946 F.2d 554, 556 (7th Cir.1991), is the only standard which both requires a \u201cmaterial change in conditions\u201d and respects the finality of the initial judgment, I would adopt that test as the law of this circuit. The <em>Sahara </em>standard provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1447-6\">[a] material change in conditions means either that the miner did not have black lung disease at the time of the first application but has since contracted it and become totally disabled by it, or that his disease has progressed to the point of becoming totally disabling although it was not at the time of the first application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1x\"><em>Id. </em>Of the various tests for determining eligibility for duplicate claim benefits, only the <em>Sahara </em>standard focuses upon the miner\u2019s <em>conditions </em>and requires that those conditions <em>change </em>in a way that is <em>material. </em>The majority\u2019s characterization notwithstanding, the <em>Sahara </em>standard does not require that the claimant show a material change \u201con every element previously decided against him,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 1361,1363. Rather, it requires only that the claimant show, through a comparison of the evidence existing at the time of his original denial of benefits and the evidence currently available, that he was not then, but is now, eligible for benefits. In other words, the focus of the <em>Sahara </em>standard is not on the conclusions reached as to the conditions, but rather on the underlying conditions themselves, which is exactly what section 725.309(d)\u2019s plain language demands. In no other possible way can it be determined whether the claimant\u2019s <em>conditions </em>have materially changed since the earlier denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-10\">The majority is critical of the <em>Sahara </em>standard because it believes that any examination of the evidence underlying the prior denial of benefits (that is, examination of the evidence as to the miner\u2019s prior condition) would offend principles of <em>res judicata. </em>A standard that requires denial of a duplicate claim because the claimant\u2019s underlying conditions have not materially changed (for example, because the claimant was disabled then and is disabled now), however, does not undermine the original decision to deny benefits; rather, such a standard fully respects that decision, in stark contrast to the standard adopted by the majority, which continuously allows reopening of that original decision based upon evidence reflecting no change at all in the claimant\u2019s conditions. Instead of \u201cfoundering\u201d on principles of <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel, as the majority contends, the <em>Sahara </em>standard actually represents too strict an application of those principles for the majority, because that standard, unlike the majority\u2019s standard, <em>does </em>require faithful adherence to the initial denial, irrespective of whether that denial was correct or incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-8\">The court\u2019s tortured interpretation of the duplicate claims regulation comes about as a result of this one claimant\u2019s refusal either to appeal or to seek modification of an arguably erroneous decision and the court\u2019s unwillingness to accept the result that he may, as a consequence of his insouciance, find himself without remedy. As a court of law, however, we should recognize that this circumstance is an extraordinarily unusual one, not likely to frequently, if ever, repeat itself, and resist the temptation to yield to our collective sense as to what would be \u201cfair\u201d in this most peculiar of circumstances. Doing so, and simply applying the plain language of the regulation, I would vacate and remand to the ALJ for reconsideration of whether Rutter, under the standard adopted by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Sahara, </em>has shown a \u201cmaterial change in conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1447-9\">Chief Judge WILKINSON and Judges RUSSELL, WILKINS, HAMILTON and WILLIAMS join in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
