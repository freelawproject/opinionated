The district court\u2019s judgment set aside Thompson\u2019s 1983 conviction in California state court for the rape of Ginger Fleischli. Thompson appeals the district court\u2019s partial denial of the petition challenging his state court conviction for Fleisehli\u2019s murder and imposition of a sentence of death. The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We reverse the partial grant of Thompson\u2019s petition as to the rape charge. We affirm the district court\u2019s partial denial of Thompson\u2019s petition as to the murder conviction and penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-11\">The evidence, both oral and physical, considered in the state trial court, the decisions made in state appellate proceedings and the matters considered in federal district court are reflected in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-13\">The state court trial record reveals the evidence presented for and against Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-14\">A California state court jury returned guilty verdicts against Thompson on one count of first-degree murder (Cal.Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 187, 189) and one count of forcible rape (Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 261(2)) in connection with the death of Ginger Fleischli. The jury also found true the special circumstance of murder during the commission of a rape (Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 190.2(a)(17)(iii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-19\">In a separate proceeding, David Leitch was found guilty of the second degree murder of Fleischli.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-20\">During the summer of 1981, Thompson occupied an apartment with David Leitch in Laguna Beach. Not long before, Ginger Fleischli, the 20-year-old victim, had moved out of the same apartment. Fleischli, who had been sexually involved with Leitch, moved in with Leiteh\u2019s ex-wife, Tracy Leitch.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-21\">On September 11, 1981, Fleischli, Tracy Leitch, David Leitch and Thompson met at a pizza parlor on Balboa Island. They removed to the Sandpiper Inn on Pacific Coast Highway in Laguna Beach, where Thompson and Fleischli remained drinking after David and Tracy Leitch departed. Afshin Kashani joined Fleischli and Thompson at about 9:30 p.m. The three drank and danced, both at the Sandpiper and at a nearby bar, the Boom-Boom Room. Kashani and Thompson also smoked some of Kashani\u2019s hashish.</p>\n<p id=\"b1593-22\">At about 1 a.m., Thompson, Kashani and Fleischli walked back to the apartment occupied by Thompson and Leitch. Kashani and Thompson smoked more hashish. Fleischli departed at about 2 a.m. to purchase some soda at a nearby liquor store. According to Kashani, Thompson indicated to him in Fleischli\u2019s absence that he wanted to have sex with Fleischli that night and that Kashani could have her after Thompson left the country.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1593-23\">At trial, Kashani testified that after he departed, he realized that he had forgotten his cigarettes and returned to the apartment. There, a nervous Thompson handed him the cigarettes through the door. Kashani looked for Fleischli at the liquor store; not seeing her, he went home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1514\">*1514</page-number>Tracy Leitch testified that she went to the apartment the next morning and asked Thompson where Fleisehli was. She further testified that he told her that Fleisehli had left from the inn with Kashani.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-4\">Tracy Leitch again spoke with Thompson that evening about Fleischli\u2019s whereabouts. She testified that Thompson answered using the past tense, saying that he had liked Fleisehli and that she was a nice girl. The next day, Tracy Leitch filed a missing person\u2019s report with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-5\">Fleischli\u2019s body was found two days later in a grove of trees near an interstate highway. Two sets of footprints appeared near the body. One print matched a wavy soled shoe worn by David Leitch. Investigators could not identify the other footprint, which was smooth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-6\">Fleisehli lay buried in dirt, wrapped in an old sleeping bag and a pink blanket that a previous tenant had left in the apartment occupied by Thompson and Leitch. Fibers from the blanket matched fibers found in David Leitch\u2019s automobile. A stain on the rope used to tie Fleischli\u2019s body matched paint from the trunk of Leitch\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-7\">Fleisehli was stabbed five times in the head near her right ear. A single-edged knife was thrust two and one half inches through Fleischli\u2019s ear, penetrated her carotid artery, and caused massive bleeding and ultimately her death. Her head was wrapped with silver duct tape, two towels, a sheet and her jacket. Investigators found her blood in the carpet at the apartment occupied by Leitch and Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-8\">Fleischli\u2019s shirt and bra were cut in front and pulled down to her elbows. She wore no shoes, socks or underwear, and her jeans were fully zipped but not buttoned. A vaginal swab revealed semen consistent with Thompson\u2019s blood type.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-9\">Before Fleischli\u2019s body was discovered, Thompson and David Leitch travelled to Mexico together. Leitch returned and was arrested. Mexican authorities located Thompson, who possessed handcuffs at the time of his arrest. Thompson initially claimed that Fleisehli had left the apartment with Kashani. Thompson also told police that Fleisehli had been stabbed in the head, although the media had not previously reported this information. First denying that he had sexual intercourse with Fleisehli, Thompson later asserted that he and Fleisehli had consensual intercourse in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-15\">At the state trial, Dr. Richards, a forensic pathologist, testified that he found no anatomical evidence of rape. The pathologist expressed the opinion that several bruises on Fleischli\u2019s body occurred at or near the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-16\">A police investigator testified that one of Fleischli\u2019s bruises resembled injuries he had seen and known to be caused by handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-17\">Two jailhouse informants, John Del Frate and Edward Fink, testified that Thompson, while in jail, confessed to committing' the rape and murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-18\">Thompson chose to testify despite his attorney\u2019s advice to the contrary. Thompson testified that he had sex with Fleisehli and then passed out and slept until the next morning. He said that he heard nothing of the murder in the small apartment. He called witnesses who testified that he was a heavy sleeper, but he himself said that he had been awakened in Mexico by the sound of police cocking the hammers of the revolvers they pointed at his head.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-19\">The jury found Thompson guilty of rape and murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-20\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-21\">After Thompson\u2019s state appeals failed,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thompson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1594-22\">The district court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Thompson\u2019s claim that his attorney, Ronald Brower, provided ineffective as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1515\">*1515</page-number>sistance of counsel. Thompson called Dr. Irving Root, a forensic pathologist who testified that he could have given rebuttal evidence in the state trial. A defense investigator contacted Root in 1983, but Brower did not call Root at trial. In 1983, the investigator gave Root sixteen documents, including the autopsy report, and asked for Root\u2019s professional opinion about whether rape was likely and what kind of physical trauma is associated with rape. The district court restricted the State\u2019s cross-examination of Root concerning his expertise and possible bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-5\">Brower testified at the evidentiary hearing. He defended his decisions, stating that he did not emphasize the rape charge because he based the defense on Thompson\u2019s claim that he did not commit the murder. Brower testified that he had adequately rebutted the forensic evidence and that spending an inordinate amount of time on such evidence would detract from his strategy. Brower also testified that he believed that he conducted sufficient investigation and had adequately impeached the jailhouse informant testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-6\">Both sides called attorney expert witnesses to support their arguments regarding ineffective assistance of counsel. One expert, Attorney James Stotler, characterized Brow-er\u2019s representation as high caliber. Attorney Gerald Chaleff, the other expert, termed Brower\u2019s representation ineffective and prejudicial to Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-7\">Following post-hearing briefing, the district court granted the petition in part. The court concluded that Brower\u2019s failure to impeach Dr. Richards\u2019 conclusions and to call a forensic expert, as well as his failure to impeach Fink with testimony concerning numerous prior instances where Fink had informed against others and received favors from law enforcement, rose to the level of ineffective assistance. The district court held that state trial counsel Brower prejudiced Thompson\u2019s right to a fair trial on the rape charge. The district court also faulted Brower for failing to further impeach Del Frate. The district court held that the errors combined to produce prejudice. The State appeals this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-8\">The district court rejected all of Thompson\u2019s other challenges to the murder conviction and to the death penalty phase of the proceedings. Thompson appeals this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-10\">We are mindful of the limited role of federal courts in habeas review of state convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-11\">\u201cThe role of federal habeas proceedings, while important in assuring that constitutional rights are observed, is secondary and limited. Federal courts are not forums in which to relitigate state trials.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 633, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1719, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-12\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s order granting or denying a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>Sanders v. Ratelle, </em>21 F.3d 1446, 1451 (9th Cir.1994). The district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>Bonin v. Calderon, </em>59 F.3d 815, 823 (9th Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 718, 133 L.Ed.2d 671 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-13\">This appeal presents the claimed ineffective assistance of defense counsel as a primary issue. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact which we review de novo. <em>Harris v. Wood, </em>64 F.3d 1432, 1435 (9th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Sanders, </em>21 F.3d at 1451). Both the performance and prejudice components of the ineffectiveness inquiry present mixed questions which we review de novo. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 698, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2070, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1595-14\">Thompson faces a \u201cstrong presumption\u201d that counsel rendered adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making decisions. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. at 2065-66. Thompson must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s performance was \u201coutside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Tactical decisions of trial counsel deserve deference when: (1) counsel in fact bases trial conduct on strategic considerations; (2) counsel makes an informed decision based upon in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1516\">*1516</page-number>vestigation; and (3) the decision appears reasonable under the circumstances. <em>Sanders v. Ratelle, </em>21 F.3d at 1456.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-4\">Thompson must do more than show a deficiency of representation; he must also establish prejudice. He must demonstrate a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Clabourne v. Lewis, </em>64 F.3d 1373, 1378 (9th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068). \u201cThe benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 686, 104 S.Ct. at 2064. Thompson bears the burden of showing that there is a reasonable probability that the jury would not have convicted him had defense counsel not rendered ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-6\">The State appeals the district court\u2019s partial grant of Thompson\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-7\">The district court concluded that Thompson\u2019s trial counsel, Ronald Brower, rendered ineffective assistance in defending the rape charge. The court found the ineffective assistance cumulative and prejudicial, resulting from Brower\u2019s failure to investigate, his failure to emphasize the lack of physical evidence of rape and his failure to investigate and more thoroughly cross-examine Fink and Del Frate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-9\">In finding prejudice, the district court minimized the evidence of rape and failed to account for the damage done by Thompson\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-10\">Brower testified in these proceedings that he chose not to emphasize the rape evidence in the state trial because he sought to prove that Thompson did not commit the murder. Thompson\u2019s insistence on testifying that he did not rape Fleischli and slept through the murder played a significant part in Brower\u2019s decision to adopt this strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-13\">Because we disagree with the district court\u2019s assessment of the strength of the State\u2019s rape case, we confine our review to the prejudice element of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Cf. Williams v. Calderon, </em>52 F.3d 1465, 1470 (9th Cir.1995) (not reaching cause because petitioner had not shown prejudice), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 937, 133 L.Ed.2d 863 (1996). The district court inexplicably found the evidence of rape weak but the evidence of murder \u201coverwhelming,\u201d even without the testimony of the jailhouse informants who testified to Thompson\u2019s confession to both crimes. The State presented strong evidence of rape at the state trial. This evidence overlapped substantially with the evidence of murder. The jury convicted Thompson of both charges. The nature and amount of the evidence compel us to reverse the district court\u2019s finding that Thompson had shown Brower\u2019s alleged errors to have created a reasonable probability of a different verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-16\">The State presented a strong rape case during the state trial. It demonstrated the existence of semen consistent with Thompson\u2019s. On the question of consent, the condition of the body provided compelling evidence of rape. Someone had cut Fleischli\u2019s shirt and bra up the middle and pulled them down to her elbows, placing her in a position consistent with restraint during a rape. Thompson suggested at trial that someone could have done this after killing her in order to facilitate moving her body, but the body was otherwise secured by the blanket, tape and ties. No logical inference supported exposing her breasts and restraining her in this fashion merely in order to move her dead body. Fleischli wore no shoes, socks or underwear, and her jeans had been fully zipped but not buttoned. She also suffered a severe crushing injury to her right wrist at or near the time of her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1596-17\">Most importantly, Thompson\u2019s own testimony did severe damage to his defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1517\">*1517</page-number>After having lied to police, Thompson admitted having intercourse with Fleischli that night in the apartment, and the jury did not have to believe Thompson\u2019s testimony about being sound asleep while Leitch bound, gagged and killed the victim, all a few feet away. After the trial, the state court judge revealed the impact of Thompson\u2019s fantastic claims when he took pains to indicate on the record Brower\u2019s disagreement with Thompson\u2019s decision to testify. The trial judge stated that he wanted to leave \u201cno one believing that defense counsel joined in <em>the folly </em>of his client testifying in my observation.\u201d (Emphasis added). The district court agreed with this assessment of Thompson\u2019s testimony, stating that it was \u201cdevastating to his defense.\u201d The district court found it \u201criddled with inconsistencies and outright falsehoods,\u201d and concluded that it \u201cno doubt affected the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-5\">Having reviewed the testimony, we would go further. As in <em>Williams v. Calderon, </em>52 F.3d at 1470, we may here eschew an inquiry into Brower\u2019s assistance in favor of a clear determination that Thompson has not shown prejudice, because his own words rank among the most damaging of the testimony presented to the jury. The district court concluded that. Brower should have worked harder to rebut other evidence of rape and the testimony of the informants, but this would not have rebutted the condition and position of the bra and shirt on the body, the presence of some bruising and Thompson\u2019s reluctant admission. After reviewing the opportunities that Thompson claims Brower missed, we cannot conclude that they would have made a difference in the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-7\">First, we review the district court\u2019s finding of ineffective assistance based upon Brower\u2019s failure to rebut forensic evidence of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-8\">Brower presented a defense theory in the state trial that Thompson had consensual sex and then Leitch bound, gagged and murdered Fleischli while Thompson slept. Counsel pursued this theory consistent with Thompson\u2019s testimony, given against Brow-er\u2019s advice, that he did not commit the murder or rape Fleischli. Brower stated that he did not want to emphasize the possibility of rape by spending an inordinate amount of time on the evidence of bruises. Instead, Brower sought to show that another person, David Leitch, caused the bruises and killed Fleischli while Thompson slept. The district court characterized Brower\u2019s general strategy as \u201cflawed,\u201d and found his failure to systematically rebut each piece of medical evidence to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-10\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-11\">We review the areas of forensic evidence that were the focus of the district court\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-12\">Prior to trial, Brower interviewed the State\u2019s pathologist, Dr. Richards, who told Brower that he had found no \u201canatomical evidence\u201d of rape. The parties vigorously dispute whether \u201canatomical evidence\u201d meant vaginal bruising or any bruising. Brower testified that he asked Richards to clarify \u201canatomical evidence,\u201d and Richards said that he had found no bruising, cuts or discolorations suggesting rape. Brower also testified that he and Richards went over Richards\u2019 entire report, including the bruising Richards observed, and that Richards continued to repeat that the findings did not indicate rape. Brower felt that the State could not effectively impeach Richards on these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b1597-13\">During his state court trial testimony, Richards noted bruises on the victim\u2019s arms, wrists, palms and legs. He testified that the photographs of the victim\u2019s body showed a \u201ccrushing injury with surrounding bruise to the right wrist.\u201d A \u201clarge recent bruise on the left elbow\u201d also appeared at the autopsy. He characterized a bruise to the right knee as older, but placed all the other bruises at or immediately before the time of death. He ascribed the bruising to \u201cheavy handling,\u201d perhaps by hands causing pressure. He ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1518\">*1518</page-number>pressed the opinion that something heavy caused the crushing injury to the right wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-4\">Having discussed the bruises, Richards concluded that there was no anatomical evidence of rape. Thompson vigorously disputes the meaning of the term \u201canatomical evidence\u201d as used by Richards, arguing that it meant only vaginal bruising or tearing. Richards\u2019 testimony supports the inference that by \u201canatomical evidence,\u201d he meant any trauma, not just trauma to the vagina. On the meaning of the bruising, he testified that bruising to parts of the body other than the vagina usually demonstrated lack of consent even more than vaginal bruising. Just after making this statement, Richards admitted on recross that, \u201c[tjhere is no anatomical evidence of rape. There is nothing to indicate it whatsoever. I would rely on the semen and sperm analysis.\u201d Richards later clarified the term \u201canatomical evidence\u201d by stating: \u201cMost of the time there is no trauma sufficient to identify at autopsy ... there need be no evidence of injury at all with rape.\u201d He characterized the determination of rape as \u201ca legal matter ... out of [his] hands.\u201d Richards\u2019 1983 testimony indicates that he found no physical evidence of rape aside from semen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-5\">At the evidentiary hearing in 1993, Root testified that he would have disagreed with several of Richard\u2019s conclusions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Root offered the opinion that the bruises on the victim\u2019s legs occurred weeks before her death. Root ascribed the marks on the palms to lividity. He allowed that the contusion on the left hand could have occurred at the time of death, but he felt that the injury to the left wrist occurred a minimum of two days before death. He concluded that there was in fact no injury at all to the right elbow. As to the crushing injury to the right wrist, Root could not determine a time frame, but he testified that he saw no injuries consistent with his prior observations of injuries caused by handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-7\">Deputy Darryl Coder had testified in 1983 that the injury to the right wrist looked like injuries he had seen inflicted by the locking mechanisms of handcuffs. Coder added that he could not say whether the injury occurred before or after Fleischli was killed. The jury learned that Thompson had handcuffs in his possession when Mexican authorities arrested him. In 1993, Root specifically disagreed with the conclusion of Deputy Coder that handcuffs caused the injury to the right wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-8\">The district court also focused on Richard\u2019s statement that finding vaginal bruising or tearing caused by the forceful penetration of an erect penis was \u201crare as hen\u2019s teeth.\u201d Brower did not call an expert to rebut that testimony, but he did press Richards strongly on the point during cross-examination. Brower\u2019s interrogation of Richards on cross-examination resulted in an admission that vaginal bruising or tearing was a common injury to rape victims. Richards also allowed that such injury represented a primary indication of rape as opposed to consensual intercourse. Brower questioned Richards on his insistence that this commonly found injury was only rarely caused by the forceful penetration of an erect penis, asking him if this meant that a large number of rape victims were penetrated by hard objects. While Richards stuck to his original statement, he stated that he <em>always </em>looked for ulceration or bruising as evidence of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-9\">The logical conclusion from Brower\u2019s cross-examination of Richards was that either Richards thought a large number of rape victims were penetrated by hard objects or he was mistaken regarding the improbability that an erect penis could cause vaginal bruising or tearing. Either way, Brower elicited the basic testimony that vaginal injury is common in rape cases and that Richards did not find it during his autopsy of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1598-10\">Finally, the district court noted Root\u2019s testimony that the lack of semen in Fleischli\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1519\">*1519</page-number>jeans and the tightness of the jeans indicated that no rape had occurred. The district attorney impeached the latter theory on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-5\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-6\">The alleged failure of Thompson\u2019s trial counsel to rebut forensic evidence did not prejudice Thompson\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-7\">We do not reach the question whether Thompson demonstrated ineffective assistance because we find that he cannot show prejudice. Given Root\u2019s 1993 testimony, Brower missed opportunities to rebut only certain aspects of the forensic evidence. In 1993 Root could not exclude the crushing injury to the wrist or the injury to the left hand. His testimony had no effect on the position in which the body was found, Thompson\u2019s admission and the presence of Thompson\u2019s semen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-8\">As to the handcuffs, a jury in 1983 would have weighed Root\u2019s expertise regarding handcuffs and injuries against Coder\u2019s. Coder also qualified his testimony in important regards. Coder admitted that he could not determine whether the injury occurred before or after death, a key question for rape, and Root\u2019s testimony regarding that injury would not have fixed it more clearly in time. Coder also admitted that he had only observed such injuries on living persons and that he had no formal training on the subject. The incremental addition of Root\u2019s testimony would not have greatly altered the state of the evidence on this issue, which consisted of Coder\u2019s opinion as qualified on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-9\">Most importantly, the State\u2019s own pathologist remarked upon the lack of physical trauma and summarized the evidence by stating that he found no anatomical evidence of rape. Because the defense claimed (1) that Fleischli consented to sex with Thompson and (2) that Leitch, a violent man, inflicted the bruises while killing her, the lack of vaginal bruising stood as the only anatomical evidence crucial to the defense theory. Brower brought out this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-10\">Given the state of the evidence, we find that even if Dr. Root had been called to testify and had testified at the state court trial in the manner in which he did before the district court, there is not a reasonable probability of a different verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-12\">We reverse the district court\u2019s finding of prejudice relating to the physical evidence of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-13\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-14\">Second, we examine the district court\u2019s determination that Brower rendered ineffective assistance by failing to sufficiently impeach the jailhouse informants, Fink and Del Frate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-15\">a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-16\">Fink testified that while housed in the same module as Thompson, Thompson told him about his crime. According to Fink, Thompson told him he \u201cwanted to screw\u201d Fleischli, but she refused, so he \u201ctook it.\u201d Fink testified that Thompson admitted to killing her \u201cin a quiet way, like in the jungle,\u201d so that she would not turn him in. Fink said that he came forward with the information while talking to investigators regarding another subject. He stated that Thompson\u2019s killing of a woman upset him, although he allowed that the killing of a police officer would not have upset him in the same way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-17\">Fink testified that he had asked to spend the remainder of his 29 days in prison in a different facility in return for his testimony. He admitted to four prior felony convictions and to recent heroin use. He added that heroin did not affect his brain. Fink admitted to using several aliases. Finally, Fink conceded that he informed on other inmates and that he stayed in protective custody due to this activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1599-18\">The district court listed information that Brower could have obtained about Fink. Fink had informed in several other murder cases, and he had received favors from police and prosecutors which had helped him win release on parole and lower sentences. Officials had also called Fink a liar and a confidence man. The district court found that, because Fink played a crucial role in the State\u2019s rape case, Brower\u2019s failure to discover and use Fink\u2019s history of informing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1520\">*1520</page-number>receiving favors rose to the level of ineffective assistance. Reviewing the damaging evidence used by another defense lawyer against Fink, the district court made the factual finding that Brower could have obtained the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-4\">The district court concluded that the jury would have disregarded Fink\u2019s testimony if it had learned of the undiscovered information. This conclusion assumes that the jury credited Fink, and the district court based that assumption in part on its finding that other evidence of rape was lacking. As discussed above, however, the State put on a strong rape case even without the informant testimony. The record does not indicate that the jury must have believed Fink in order to convict Thompson of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-5\">b.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-6\">The alleged shortcomings in state trial counsel\u2019s impeachment of Fink did not prejudice Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-7\">Brower discredited Fink by showing that he received the special treatment of protected custody in return for informing, that he was known as a snitch, and that he asked for favors in return for his testimony. This demonstrated a strong motive to lie: Fink\u2019s continued survival in prison. Brower mocked Fink\u2019s statement that prisoners simply came up to him and told him things that he then told to police. Brower also called Steve Whitton, another prisoner, who testified that Fink obtained his information about Thompson from newspapers. We find no prejudice from Brower\u2019s failure to impeach Fink further. Thompson has not demonstrated a reasonable probability of a different outcome had Brower further discredited Fink.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-8\">c.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-9\">Regarding Del Frate, the district court found that Brower had failed to discover certain impeachment evidence. The court termed most of the evidence cumulative, with the exception of Del Frate\u2019s testimony at his 1978 murder trial regarding his long history as an informant. We note that this history of informing consisted largely of participating in drug buys and not of jailhouse informing. The court found that Brower erred by failing to locate and use this testimony, but determined that it did not independently create sufficient prejudice. The court concluded that it did add to the cumulative prejudice created by Brower\u2019s other failures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-12\">d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-13\">No prejudice resulted from Brower\u2019s failure to further impeach Del Frate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-14\">Brower could hardly have impeached Del Frate more than he did. Brower brought out the fact that Del Frate did not initially tell investigators that Thompson admitted to forcing himself on Fleischli and stabbing her. Del Frate added these facts later, claiming that the investigators did not originally ask about them. Brower pressed Del Frate to explain inconsistencies in his statement about the stab wounds and the time frame for the rape. The jury was made aware of Del Frate\u2019s felony convictions. Brower\u2019s representation of Thompson as it concerned Del Frate did not prejudice Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-15\">e.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-16\">We conclude that Thompson\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s allegedly inadequate impeachment of the jailhouse informants did not prejudice Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1600-17\">Brower impeached both jailhouse informants. Although Thompson argues that the State made much of their testimony during its closing, we do not weigh their importance based upon the attorneys\u2019 arguments. The state court trial transcripts disclose that the informants were extensively cross-examined and discredited by Brower. We cannot say that the addition of the credited evidence, if any, that survived their impeachment formed a crucial part of the case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1600-18\">Thompson has not shown a reasonable probability of a different verdict were the informants impeached further.</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1521\">*1521</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-5\">Thompson has not demonstrated errors sufficient to undermine confidence in the verdict. Finding no prejudice from the errors taken separately, we also find no cumulative prejudice. <em>See Cooper v. Fitzharris, </em>586 F.2d 1325, 1333 (9th Cir.1978) (en banc) (\u201cprejudice may result from the cumulative impact of multiple deficiencies\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 974, 99 S.Ct. 1542, 59 L.Ed.2d 793 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-6\">We reverse the district court\u2019s granting in part of the petition on the rape charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-8\">Thompson appeals the district court\u2019s denial of the petition as to the murder conviction. Thompson challenges several of the district court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-10\">The district court held that the state trial court\u2019s introduction of a hearsay statement by the victim and instructions to the jury regarding that statement did not violate Thompson\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-11\">On direct examination, Tracy Leitch testified that on the night she died Fleischli had asked \u201cDo you think Tom [Thompson] would kill me?\u201d On cross-examination, Leitch conceded that Fleischli had actually asked \u201cDo you think David [Leitch] would have Tom kill me?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-12\">At the state trial, the judge admitted the statement under California Evidence Code \u00a7 1250, as evidence of Fleischli\u2019s state of mind indicating a lack of consent to the sexual intercourse with Thompson. The California Supreme Court found the statement properly admitted. <em>Thompson, </em>246 Cal.Rptr. 245, 753 P.2d at 46-47. We do not review that particular determination. <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67, 112 S.Ct. 475, 479-80, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). Rather, we review Thompson\u2019s claim that the state trial court\u2019s instructions allowed the jury to consider the statement for the purpose of determining guilt of murder and thereby violated his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-13\">The state trial court gave two instructions relating directly to the statement. Before the statement came into evidence, the court gave a limiting instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1601-14\">You are not to consider the following testimony as proof of the truth that the murder occurred or that defendant committed such killing. You may consider it only for a determination of the state of mind of the victim, Ginger Fleischli, as it regards a rape and as it may negate a consensual sex act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1601-15\">After repeating the last sentence for emphasis, the judge added, \u201cThat\u2019s the only purpose for this, and it\u2019s the only use you can put it to in your deliberations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-16\">In giving the final instructions to the jury, however, the court listed the statement as one of numerous factors that the jury could consider in determining guilt or innocence on the murder charge. This instruction directly contradicted the limiting instruction, and it was an error on the part of the trial court. <em>Thompson, </em>246 Cal.Rptr. 245, 753 P.2d at 48-49. The California Supreme Court and the district court found this error harmless, however, due to the other instructions, the other evidence, and the closing arguments to the jury. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1601-17\">Giving an instruction inadequate by direct appeal standards does not necessarily result in habeas relief from a state court conviction. <em>Duckett v. Godinez, </em>67 F.3d 734, 745 (9th Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 1549, 134 L.Ed.2d 651 (1996). The error must rise to a constitutional violation, which depends \u201cupon the evidence in the case and the overall instructions given to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 146, 94 S.Ct. 396, 400, 38 L.Ed.2d 368 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1601-20\">Taken as a whole, the jury instructions did not highlight the statement as a crucial factor for consideration on the murder charge. In addition to giving the limiting instruction during the testimony, the trial court instructed the jury at the end of the trial that it could also consider the following in determining guilt on the murder charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1601-21\">Seven, that on no occasion prior to the victim\u2019s demise had the defendant ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1522\">*1522</page-number>pressed any animosity, ill will or intent to harm the victim. Eight, that prior to the victim\u2019s demise she had expressed a fear of physical harm <em>from David Leitch. </em>Nine, that prior to the victim\u2019s demise David Leitch had expressed hate and ill will toward the victim and had threatened to have her killed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1602-4\">(Emphasis added). These factors, by implication, reduced the impact of the erroneous seventh factor given in the other instruction. In addition, the judge reminded the jury of his previous limiting instructions and cautioned the jury not to single out any particular sentence or instruction and ignore all the others. Taking the jury instructions as a whole, it is unlikely that the jurors singled out the erroneous instruction over and above the limiting instruction, the other factors listed, and the instruction reinforcing the limiting instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s references to the statement in rebuttal argument also weigh in favor of finding harmless error. The prosecutor mentioned the statement three times in rebuttal, but he never singled the statement out as evidence of murder as opposed to evidence of rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-6\">Finally, the evidence of murder against Thompson was compelling. Listed as it was among other stronger factors weighing in favor of guilt, Fleischli\u2019s statement could not have played a critical role in the verdict. If the statement as amended by Tracy Leitch on cross examination indicated anything crucial to murder, it showed a fear of David Leitch. Because the jury instructions as a whole and the evidence do not indicate that the trial became fundamentally unfair due to the erroneous instruction, we affirm the district court on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-8\">The district court rejected Thompson\u2019s claim that the State violated his due process rights by pursuing inconsistent theories at his trial and at the trial of David Leitch.</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-9\">Few courts have addressed this argument, but the principles it invokes are well established. Due process requires a fair trial in a fair tribunal. <em>Turner v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 466, 85 S.Ct. 546, 13 L.Ed.2d 424 (1965). The prosecutor represents the State, and that representation entails not only attention to the interests of the victim and survivors, but also to society\u2019s interest in the fairness of criminal justice administration. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 86, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). A prosecutor may not treat a defendant in a manner that undermines society\u2019s confidence in the fairness of the process. <em>Id. </em>For example, the prosecutor may not obtain a conviction through the use of false evidence. <em>Mooney v. Holohan, </em>294 U.S. 103, 112, 55 S.Ct. 340, 341-42, 79 L.Ed. 791 (1935); <em>Napue v. Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 1177, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959). From these principles emerges the requirement that the prosecutor not pursue wholly inconsistent theories of a case at separate trials. <em>See Haynes v. Cupp, </em>827 F.2d 435, 439 (9th Cir.1987) (variations in. state\u2019s theories not cause for reversal where theme that each defendant was culpable remained consistent); <em>Drake v. Francis, </em>727 F.2d 990, 994 (11th Cir.1984), <em>rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, Drake v. Kemp, </em>762 F.2d 1449 (1985) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>478 U.S. 1020, 106 S.Ct. 3333, 92 L.Ed.2d 738 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1602-11\">Presenting evidence about Fleischli\u2019s death, the State emphasized Thompson\u2019s involvement at Thompson\u2019s trial, and emphasized David Leitch\u2019s involvement at Leitch\u2019s trial. The approach at Thompson\u2019s trial included the prosecutor\u2019s unsuccessful objection on relevance grounds to evidence of Leitch\u2019s hostility toward Fleischli and argument by the prosecutor that only Thompson was in the apartment with Fleischli when she was killed. In downplaying Leitch\u2019s role, the State never argued that the witnesses testifying to Leiteh\u2019s hostility lacked credibility. This fact deflates Thompson\u2019s claim that the State presented factually inconsistent evidence when it called these same witnesses at Leitch\u2019s trial. The prosecutor had never indicated that the jury should disbelieve these witnesses; he had simply argued that the evidence in Thompson\u2019s trial pointed to Thompson as the killer, notwithstanding Leitch\u2019s hostility. We find no prejudice resulting from this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1523\">*1523</page-number>Further, we conclude that if any prejudice had resulted from the differences in emphasis, it would have affected Leitch, not Thompson. <em>See Drake v. Francis, </em>727 F.2d at 994 n. 4 (noting that any possible prejudice hurt the defendant not before the court). The trial records in both cases indicate that the State placed Thompson in the apartment at the time of the murder, and the State never argued that Thompson slept through the murder or otherwise failed to participate. Because the prosecution\u2019s theory in Leiteh\u2019s trial did not in any way exonerate Thompson, we affirm the district court\u2019s disposition of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-6\">Because trial counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective assistance in defending the rape charge did not prejudice the defense of that charge, this alleged ineffective assistance also did not prejudice the defense of the murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-7\">Thompson contends that Brower\u2019s alleged failings in defending the rape charge also prejudiced his defense of the murder charge. Thompson argues that the jury, by finding him guilty of rape and murder, accepted the prosecution\u2019s felony murder theory, and therefore the ineffective assistance on the rape charge also undermines the murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-13\">We agree that the case presented by the State did not allow for a clear division between evidence of rape and murder. We determine, however, that because Brower\u2019s conduct did not prejudice Thompson\u2019s defense of the rape charge, it does not undermine confidence in his murder conviction. Because of the strong evidence of rape, we find no \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Clabourne v. Lewis, </em>64 F.3d at 1378 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068).</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-14\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial in part of the petition on the murder charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-9\">Thompson appeals the district court\u2019s denial in part of the petition as to the penalty phase of the state court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-10\">The facts of the penalty phase are fully set out in <em>People v. Thompson, </em>246 Cal.Rptr. 245, 753 P.2d at 58-59 and in the district court order. The State presented no new evidence. Thompson presented the testimony of family and friends regarding Thompson\u2019s childhood and his good qualities. Two psychologists, Dr. Kara Cross and Dr. Francis Crinella, also testified for Thompson, describing the personality disorders he suffered as the result of a childhood spent living with his strict stepfather. After hearing this evidence and arguments from counsel, the jury returned a death verdict. Thompson raises several challenges to the penalty stage of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-12\">Thompson argues that his state trial counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance at the guilt phase prejudiced the penalty phase. Thompson has not carried his burden of demonstrating sufficient prejudice at the guilt phase to create a reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a different verdict. Likewise, we determine that Thompson has similarly failed to show that these alleged failings of defense counsel prejudiced the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-16\">Thompson challenges the district court\u2019s conclusion that the prosecutor\u2019s reference in closing argument to an invalid aggravating factor did not prejudice the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1603-17\">At the close of the penalty phase, the prosecutor told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1603-18\">The only other evidence that we have presented in the guilt phase about other acts of violence would be the defendant\u2019s plan to kill anyone who got in his way or the testimony we\u2019ve heard from Mr. Del Frate about the defendant\u2019s plan to kill the co-defendant, Mr. Leitch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1603-19\">Thompson contends that this argument prejudiced him by adding an aggravating factor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1524\">*1524</page-number>of other criminal conduct and negating the mitigating factor of his clean criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-4\">The California Supreme Court found the prosecutor\u2019s argument invalid under CalJPenal Code \u00a7 190.3(b), which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of conduct constituting commission of an actual crime. <em>People v. Thompson, </em>246 Cal.Rptr. 245, 753 P.2d at 62 (citation omitted). However, both the California Supreme Court and the district court found no prejudice resulting from this argument. <em>Id. </em>246 Cal.Rptr. at 282, 753 P.2d at 64 (finding it \u201charmless under any standard____\u201d). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-5\">The arguments of counsel are generally accorded less weight by the jury than the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Boyde v. California, </em>494 U.S. 370, 384, 110 S.Ct. 1190, 1200, 108 L.Ed.2d 316 (1989). The arguments of counsel must be judged in the context of the entire argument and of the instructions given by the court. <em>Id. </em>at 385, 110 S.Ct. at 1200-01. The prosecutor mentioned the challenged portion of the argument only once and did not emphasize it. The court instructed the jury that any set of facts considered as an aggravating circumstance must be found by all the jurors to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. We assume that the jury followed this instruction, and Thompson has shown no reasonable probability that the jury found any other crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-6\">Thompson relies on <em>People v. Lucero, </em>44 Cal.3d 1006, 245 Cal.Rptr. 185, 750 P.2d 1342, 1349 n. 5 (1988), where the prosecutor had argued that the circumstances of the crime charged also qualified as a crime of violence under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 190.3(b) and that the absence of evidence of certain mitigating factors rendered these mitigating factors aggravating. The court noted that the combination of these improper arguments \u201cturned the case upside down,\u201d leaving the jury with several aggravating factors and only one mitigating factor: the absence of felony convictions. <em>Id. </em>This portion of <em>Lucero </em>is dicta; the court stated that it did not base its reversal on the improper arguments and did not assess their prejudicial effect. 245 Cal. Rptr. at 201 n. 17, 750 P.2d at 1357 n. 17. Moreover, <em>Lucero </em>involved two problematic arguments, one doubling the aggravating impact of the crime charged and another specifically turning the absence of mitigating factors into the presence of aggravating ones. The prosecutor\u2019s solitary argument here does not present a <em>Lucero </em>problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-8\">The jury could not have concluded that any other crimes were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Thompson\u2019s lack of criminal history and lack of other criminal conduct stood as a mitigating factor. The jury was free under the state trial court\u2019s instructions to find that the mitigating circumstances were outweighed by the crimes of which Thompson was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-9\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-10\">Thompson challenges several of the state trial court\u2019s decisions regarding jury instructions at the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-11\">A faulty jury instruction compels the issuance of a writ only where the instruction so infects the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process. <em>Cupp v. Naughten, </em>414 U.S. at 147, 94 S.Ct. at 400-401. Where the habeas challenge rests on the failure to give an instruction, the already weighty burden on a petitioner becomes \u201cespecially heavy.\u201d <em>Henderson v. Kibbe, </em>431 U.S. 145, 155, 97 S.Ct. 1730, 1737, 52 L.Ed.2d 203 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-12\">Thompson argues that the penalty instruction misled the jury into believing that it must impose a death penalty if aggravating factors outweighed mitigating factors. The Supreme Court addressed and rejected this argument as applied to the same instruction in <em>Boyde v. California, </em>494 U.S. at 377, 110 S.Ct. at 1196. We reject it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-13\">Thompson also contends that the California Supreme Court\u2019s decisions finding the instruction invalid result in an unconstitutional differential application of the law in his case. We reject this argument because Thompson faded to raise it before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1604-14\">Thompson contends that the court erred in declining his jury instruction on potential for rehabilitation and that the prosecutor improperly argued that he might kill again. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1525\">*1525</page-number>Thompson presented no evidence on the specific issue of his potential for rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-5\">Moreover, Thompson makes no showing that the jury was precluded from considering his potential for rehabilitation despite the omission of the instruction. While the court rejected Thompson\u2019s lengthy proposed instruction that listed rehabilitation as a mitigating factor, the court instructed the jury that: \u201cThe mitigating circumstances which I have read for your consideration are given to you merely as examples of some of the factors which you may take into account____\u201d Thompson does not satisfy his heavy burden of showing that the omission of a more specific instruction violated his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-8\">The prosecutor\u2019s single reference to the chance that Thompson might kill again in prison did not prejudice Thompson. This argument stood alone, and the jury was instructed not to speculate or give weight to mere possibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-9\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-10\">Thompson argues that his state trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance at the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-11\">Thompson claims that Brower failed to investigate his background and to interview the psychologists, resulting in the presentation of some damaging testimony. Noting that Thompson did not raise the issue at the evidentiary hearing, the district court found that Brower made an informed tactical decision to put on the psychologists. The court also noted that Dr. Crinella told the defense investigators that his testimony would be damaging. We agree with the district court that Brower\u2019s decision to put on the testimony for its helpful aspects deserves deference under <em>Strickland </em>as a tactical decision made at the time of the state trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-12\">Thompson also argues that Brower had no coherent penalty phase strategy, pointing to inconsistencies between Brower\u2019s closing argument, where he conceded guilt, and a requested instruction allowing the jury to consider Thompson\u2019s lack of intent to kill. We do not find the argument itself to constitute ineffective assistance under the deferential <em>Strickland </em>standard. Brower was present at the trial. He saw the evidence and its effect on the jury. At the penalty phase a defense attorney may make the tactical decision to indicate that he identifies with the thought processes of the jurors. We find no possible prejudice from the inconsistency of the argument and the requested jury instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-14\">Thompson argues that Brower\u2019s failure to request proper instructions on mitigation, the effect of a death verdict and lingering doubts constituted ineffective assistance. Considering the given instructions as a whole, we find that Thompson has not shown that Brower\u2019s failure to frame better instructions and the court\u2019s failure to give instructions in these areas does not undermine confidence in the outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-15\">Having carefully reviewed-the record of the penalty phase of the state court trial proceedings, we find no cumulative prejudice sufficient to create a reasonable possibility of a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-16\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-17\">We conclude that Thompson has not demonstrated prejudice resulting from the alleged ineffective assistance of trial counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-18\">Although Thompson raises numerous claims of ineffective assistance at the guilt and penalty phases, he has not shown a reasonable probability that the incremental addition of certain evidence or the incremental reduction in the effect of other evidence would have resulted in a different verdict. The State\u2019s case against Thompson was strong on both the rape and the murder charges. Thompson himself made it much stronger by testifying after counsel advised him not to testify. We are satisfied that the jury would not have reached a different outcome either at the guilt or penalty phase had counsel done all the things that Thompson now claims he should have done. We are confident that the jury reached a just result in a fair proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1605-19\">We reverse the district court\u2019s granting in part of the petition as to the rape conviction. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial in part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1526\">*1526</page-number>of the petition as to the murder conviction and the death verdict. Because we reverse the district court\u2019s granting in part of the petition, the state conviction and sentence will not be disturbed and a writ will not issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1606-4\">REVERSED in part and AFFIRMED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1593-15\">. Thompson apparently planned to leave the country in order to smuggle Southeast Asian refugees, gold, and possibly cocaine out of Thailand. The State suggested at trial that Fleischli\u2019s knowledge of this plan formed part of Thompson\u2019s motive for murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1594-10\">. The California Supreme Court unanimously affirmed his convictions for rape and murder. <em>People v. Thompson, </em>45 Cal.3d 86, 246 Cal.Rptr. 245, 753 P.2d 37 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 960, 109 S.Ct. 404, 102 L.Ed.2d 392 (1988). State collateral proceedings did not relieve Thompson from the state court judgment and sentence. <em>People v. Thompson, </em>No. S008382 (1989); <em>In re Thompson, </em>No. S018049 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1596-11\">. Thompson does not raise on appeal his claim of ineffective assistance based on Brower\u2019s alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1517\">*1517</page-number>failure to adequately prepare him for testifying or dissuade him from testifying. Thompson himself admitted that he ignored Brower's advice,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1598-6\">. Because we find no prejudice, we do not reach the State's claims of clear error in the district court's credibility determinations and of abuse of discretion in limiting the State's cross-examination of Root on the issues of his bias and expert credentials. For the purpose of this section, we assume Root's qualifications and lack of bias and we do not rely upon Brower's explanations of his conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1600-10\">. We note again the district court's conclusion that the informants formed a crucial part of the rape case while the same alleged failings in Brower's impeachment of them did not affect the murder case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
