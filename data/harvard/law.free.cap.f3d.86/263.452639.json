Moreno, </em>947 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.1991). Fact-bound determinations, however, are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. St. Cyr, </em>977 F.2d 698, 705-06 (1st Cir.1992). \u201cThe facts constituting obstruction of justice for sentencing purposes need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Mafanya, </em>24 F.3d 412, 414 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-28\">The district court found that there was a \u201cshift in prosecution resources and attention from federal adult to state juvenile\u201d and back again as a result of Thomas\u2019 misstatements at the time of his arrest. That finding was supported by the record which included a financial affidavit filed in federal court on the date of Thomas\u2019 arrest and documentation of Thomas\u2019 presence in juvenile court several days later. The district court did not err in concluding that the shift <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>in prosecution resources and attention constituted a \u201csignificant hindrance\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">That Thomas eventually was indicted by the same grand jury as his codefendants, does not preclude a finding of a significant hindrance. Prosecution resources were diverted as a result of Thomas\u2019 false statements at the time of his arrest, requiring the prosecution of Thomas to proceed differently than if the false statements had not been made. <em>See United States v. McCoy, </em>36 F.3d 740, 742 (8th Cir.1994) (affirming two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice where \u201cadditional effort\u201d was expended as a result of defendant\u2019s use of an alias at the time of a prior arrest).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The eases that Thomas relies upon are inapposite. In <em>United States v. Manning, </em>955 F.2d 770, 774-75 (1st Cir.1992), we held that defendant\u2019s use of an alias and false birthdate at the time of his arrest did not constitute a \u201csignificant hindrance\u201d where it was \u201cunclear [from the record] that the investigation would have proceeded any differently or any faster had Manning [told the truth] at the time of his arrest.\u201d In this case, by contrast, the record reveals that the federal prosecution of Thomas was halted as a result of his misstatements to the arresting officers, and recommenced only after his true identity and age were discovered. <em>See also United States v. Bell, </em>953 F.2d 6, 9 (1st Cir.1992) (\u201cthere was no showing or even assertion by the government [that the investigation or prosecution had been impeded]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Thomas argues that the enhancement does not apply to his case because he did not \u201cwillfully\u201d obstruct or impede the administration of justice. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C.1. He alleges that his intent in lying about his name and age was to avoid being placed in an adult prison, not to avoid federal prosecution. Thomas\u2019 conduct appears to fall within the plain language of one of the listed examples of conduct meriting the enhancement because he did, and did knowingly, provide \u201ca materially false statement to a law enforcement officer that significantly obstructed or impeded the official investigation or prosecution of the instant offense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3(g)). On the other hand, there is case law that the defendant must have a <em>specific intent </em>to obstruct justice, <em>\u201ci.e., </em>____the defendant consciously acted with the purpose of obstructing justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Reed, </em>49 F.3d 895, 900 (2d Cir.1995). <em>See also United States v. Gonzales, </em>12 F.3d 298, 299-300 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">We need not decide in this ease whether this specific intent requirement should be superimposed on the explicit examples given in the guideline commentary, because the enhancement is valid even on such a premise. The guideline itself imposes the enhancement for willful obstruction or attempted obstruction of \u201cthe administration of justice\u201d <em>during </em>the complete proceeding from investigation through sentencing. It covers not only obstructions of \u201cinvestigations,\u201d \u201cprosecutions\u201d or \u201csentencing\u201d but of the entire \u201cadministration of justice\u201d in relation to the defendant\u2019s case so long as the obstruction occurs during the period specified.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">Thus, the defendant\u2019s use of a false identity in the hope of being released on bail is an obstruction of justice, <em>see Mafanya, </em>24 F.3d at 415, because the grant or denial of bail is part of the process. A determination as to whether a defendant should be held in an adult facility or in a juvenile detention seems to us scarcely less a part of the administration of justice and involves policies and consequences that are far from trivial. Since on Thomas\u2019 own version of events he did have a specific intent to affect this choice by lies as to his age, we think that he had the requisite specific intent to obstruct the administration of justice, even assuming that something beyond conduct falling within the commentary is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\"><em>Affirmed.
