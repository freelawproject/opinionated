SSA also petitions for review of the Board\u2019s decision denying its claim against the Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Program (Director) for special fund relief under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(f), and the Board\u2019s assessment of a twenty percent penalty for late payment of interest due Sproull. We grant Sproull\u2019s petition, and grant in part and deny in part SSA\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-23\">Sproull was injured on January 10, 1985 when he fell and tore the rotator cuff tendon in his left shoulder. He was off work and received temporary total disability benefits until September 16, 1985. When Sproull returned to work he was limited to dock work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>off the \u201cold man\u2019s board\u201d and could not work as he previously had at night or as a linesman, both of which offer a higher rate of pay. Consequently, Sproull claimed a loss of wage earning capacity and permanent partial disability benefits under the LHWCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">A hearing on Sproull\u2019s claim was held before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) on January 26, 1986. The ALJ found Sproull entitled to permanent partial disability benefits, reasoning that Sproull\u2019s post-injury wage-earning capacity was less than his preinjury average weekly wages. In addition, the ALJ denied SSA\u2019s request to offset Sproull\u2019s benefits with vacation and holiday pay SSA paid Sproull while he was receiving temporary total disability benefits. The ALJ did, however, grant SSA special fund relief under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">The Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s finding that Sproull is entitled to benefits and the ALJ\u2019s denial of an offset. It reduced, however, the award of benefits, reasoning that the ALJ erred in calculating Sproull\u2019s pre-injury average weekly wages. The Board also reversed the ALJ\u2019s finding that SSA is entitled to special fund relief because SSA failed to produce medical opinions establishing that Sproull\u2019s current disability is contributed to by his prior hand injury. Finally, the Board assessed a twenty percent penalty against SSA pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(f) for its late payment of interest due Sproull under the ALJ\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">SSA and Sproull each petition for review of the Board\u2019s decision. Sproull contends that the Board erred by modifying the ALJ\u2019s calculation of his average weekly wages, thereby reducing his benefits. SSA contends that the Board erred by affirming the award of benefits and the denial of an offset. SSA also argues that the Board erred by reversing the ALJ\u2019s grant of special fund relief and by assessing the twenty percent penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">We review the Board\u2019s decisions for errors of law and adherence to the substantial evidence standard. <em>Brady-Hamilton Stevedore Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>58 F.3d 419, 421 (9th Cir.1995). The Board must accept the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact unless they are contrary to law, irrational or unsupported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3); <em>Brady-Hamilton, </em>58 F.3d at 421. We give no special deference to the Board\u2019s interpretations of the LHWCA, but do defer to the Director\u2019s interpretations. <em>Port of Portland v. Director, Office of Workers Compensation Programs, </em>932 F.2d 836, 838 (9th Cir.1991). Although we respect the Board\u2019s reasonable interpretations, the \u201cdistinction in the deference owed the Director and the Board is significant ... where their positions conflict with respect to the issues raised on appeal.\u201d <em>Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Brickner, </em>11 F.3d 887, 889 (9th Cir.1993) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">A. <em>Award of Benefits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">Permanent partial disability benefits are intended to compensate an injured employee for loss of earning capacity, which is calculated by comparing the employee\u2019s post-injury \u201cwage-earning capacity\u201d with his pre-injury \u201caverage weekly wages.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(c)(21). If the wage-earning capacity is less than the average weekly wages, the employee is entitled to disability benefits equal to two-thirds of the difference. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">We first address SSA\u2019s contention that Sproull is not entitled to disability benefits because his wage-earning capacity, as represented by his actual earnings, is greater than his average weekly wages. An employee\u2019s wage-earning capacity is determined by actual earnings only if these earnings \u201cfairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(h). Otherwise, the ALJ must determine an amount representing the employee\u2019s \u201creasonable\u201d wage-earning capacity. <em>Id. </em>Here, the ALJ found that Sproull\u2019s actual wages are not a fair and reasonable measure of his post-injury earning capacity because wage rates increased approximately fifteen percent after Sproull was injured. The ALJ therefore reduced Sproull\u2019s post-injury actual earnings by fifteen percent and used this adjusted amount in determining benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-13\">Substantial evidence exists in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Sproull\u2019s actu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>al earnings are not a fair and reasonable measure of his wage-earning capacity. The ALJ reasonably concluded that these earnings do not accurately project Sproull\u2019s loss of earning capacity because of an increase in wage rates. <em>See Brady-Hamilton, </em>58 F.3d at 421. \u201cA disabled worker\u2019s post-injury earnings can only \u2018fairly and reasonably represent his wage-earning capacity5 ... if they have been converted to their equivalent at the time of injury.\u201d <em>LaFaille v. Benefits Review Bd., </em>884 F.2d 54, 61 (2d Cir.1989); <em>see also White v. Bath Iron Works Corp., </em>812 F.2d 33, 35 (1st Cir.1987) (ALJ may take into account wage increases when calculating wage-earning capacity). We therefore conclude that the Board did not err by affirming the ALJ\u2019s calculation of Sproull\u2019s wage-earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">We next address Sproull\u2019s contention that the Board erred by modifying the ALJ\u2019s calculation of his average weekly wages. Under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(c), which the parties agree governs the calculation of Sproull\u2019s average weekly wages, the ALJ is directed to determine an amount which \u201creasonably represent\u00e9] the annual earning capacity of the injured employee.\u201d This amount is then divided by fifty two, resulting in the employee\u2019s average weekly wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">In this case, the ALJ included in the calculation of Sproull\u2019s average weekly wages the vacation pay Sproull earned in 1984, the calendar year prior to his injury, even though under the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement, Sproull did not receive this pay until April 1985, after the date of his injury. The April 1985 vacation pay was based on wage rates effective July 1, 1984. According to the ALJ, including Sproull\u2019s most recently earned vacation pay best reflects his future earning capacity had he not suffered the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">The Board reversed, concluding that the ALJ\u2019s reliance on vacation pay received after the date of the injury creates needless administrative problems. The Board reasoned that by including vacation pay received in 1984, even though earned in 1983, the parties and the ALJ would have been able to calculate more quickly the average weekly wages and resolve the disability claim. Although administrative convenience may possibly be relevant in some circumstances, here there were never any issues of inconvenience, confusion or delay in payment as hypothesized by the Board. Rather the ALJ was able accurately and properly to calculate Sproull\u2019s average weekly wages. After carefully reviewing the record, we conclude that the ALJ\u2019s calculation of Sproull\u2019s average weekly wages reasonably represents his annual earning capacity. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(e). The Board therefore erred by reversing the ALJ\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">There is no merit to SSA\u2019s contention that the vacation pay Sproull received in April 1985 constitutes post-injury earnings which are typically excluded from an employee\u2019s average weekly wage. Sproull <em>earned </em>the April 1985 vacation wages before his injury, from January 1 to December 31,1984. Nothing in the LHWCA prevents the ALJ from including in the average weekly wage wages earned before, yet received after, the employee\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">Finally, we reject SSA\u2019s contention that its liability to Sproull for disability benefits should be offset by the vacation and holiday pay which it paid Sproull while he was receiving temporary total disability benefits. According to SSA, Sproull was overeompensated during this time because he did not lose any wages for those days on which he received holiday and vacation pay. This argument, however, is flatly rejected by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. Under that agreement, Sproull would have received both wages and holiday pay if he could have worked on the holidays. In addition, vacation pay is not based on an employee actually taking a vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">B. <em>Special Fund Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">The LHWCA, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 908(f), provides that where an employee is permanently disabled and the disability is found not to be caused solely by the injury incurred on the job, the employer\u2019s liability is limited to a maximum of 104 weeks, after which time liability is borne by the special fund established by 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 944. <em>E.P. Paup Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>999 F.2d 1341, 1352 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>Cir.1993). To establish entitlement to special fond relief, the employer must demonstrate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANE\">(1) that the employee had an existing permanent partial disability prior to the employment injury; (2) that the disability was manifest to the employer prior to the employment injury; and (3) that the current disability is not due solely to the most recent inquiry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-4\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">SSA requested special fond relief under section 908(f) based on medical evidence that Sproull had earlier suffered a hand injury. The only issue on appeal is whether SSA established the third requirement, namely that Sproull\u2019s prior injury contributes to his current disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">The ALJ found that Sproull\u2019s prior injury does contribute to his current shoulder injury, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkD\">Taking into consideration [Sproull\u2019s] testimony that in performing his work on the dock he has learned to use mostly his right arm and hand in handling slings, as well as the self-evident inter-relationship between the use of the hand, grip-strength and shoulder in his post-injury dock work, ... and the recency of his 1983 left hand injury immediately prior to returning to work before the 1985 left shoulder injury, I find that [Sproull] had a pre-existing permanent partial disability within the meaning of the Act prior to his 1985 shoulder injury, and that his permanent partial disability resulting after the 1985 injury is materially and substantially greater than would have resulted from the latter injury alone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">The Board reversed, reasoning that \u201cthere are no medical opinions of record stating that [Sproull\u2019s] current disability is contributed to by his prior hand injury.\u201d Nothing in the LHWCA, however, requires employers to submit \u201cmedical opinions\u201d to establish the contribution requirement, and we decline to create such a requirement. Rather, we conclude that SSA was entitled to establish the contribution requirement by medical or <em>other </em>evidence. <em>See Director, OWCP v. Newport News Shipbuilding </em>&amp; <em>Dry Dock Co., </em>8 F.3d 175, 185 (4th Cir.1993), <em>affirmed, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 115 S.Ct. 1278, 131 L.Ed.2d 160 (1995); <em>Director, OWCP v. Luccitelli, </em>964 F.2d 1303, 1306 (2d Cir.1992). The Board therefore erred by reversing the ALJ\u2019s grant of special fund relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">C. <em>Twenty Percent Penalty</em></p>\n<p id=\"b980-12\">Finally, SSA appeals the Board\u2019s assessment of a twenty percent penalty for its late payment of interest due Sproull under the terms of the ALJ\u2019s compensation order. SSA paid the interest more than ten days after the order was filed. Under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(f), \u201c[i]f any compensation, payable under the terms of an award, is not paid within ten days after it becomes due, there shall be added to such unpaid compensation an amount equal to 20 per centum thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b980-13\">\u201cCompensation\u201d is defined in the LHWCA as \u201cthe money allowance payable to an employee or to his dependents as provided for in this chapter.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(12). SSA argues that interest is not \u201ccompensation\u201d because it is not expressly provided for in the LHWCA The Director counters that interest is a necessary and inherent component of \u201ccompensation\u201d because it ensures that the delay in payment of compensation does not diminish the amount of compensation to which the employee is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-14\">We recognized the necessity of imposing interest on the delayed payment of compensation benefits in <em>Foundation Constructors, Inc. v. Director, OWCP, </em>950 F.2d 621, 625 (9th Cir.1991). In so doing, we deferred to the Director\u2019s interpretation that interest on past-due compensation serves the purposes of the LHWCA by fully compensating injured workers. <em>See also Sea-Land Service, Inc. v. Barry, </em>41 F.3d 903, 910-11 (3d Cir. 1994) (following <em>Foundation </em>and imposing interest on delayed payment of compensation). In addition, we reasoned that \u201cAllowing an employer to delay compensation payments interest-free would reduce the worth of such payments to the claimant, undermining the remedial intent of the Act.\u201d <em>Foundation, </em>950 F.2d at 625. This reasoning is equally applicable here. We therefore defer to the Director\u2019s reasonable interpretation that interest is an inherent component of compensation and affirm the Board\u2019s imposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>tion of a twenty percent penalty on SSA\u2019s late payment of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">The Board did not err by affirming the ALJ\u2019s calculation of Sproull\u2019s wage-earning capacity and the ALJ\u2019s denial of an offset to SSA and by imposing a twenty percent penalty for SSA\u2019s late payment of interest. The Board did err by reversing the ALJ\u2019s calculation of Sproull\u2019s average weekly wage and the ALJ\u2019s grant of special fund relief to SSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">PETITION GRANTED in No. 94-70906; PETITION GRANTED in part and DENIED in part in No. 94-70914.
