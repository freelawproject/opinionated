We reverse, concluding that the imposition of this sanction in addition to incarceration was an abuse of discretion under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-19\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-20\">This is our second review of this case. The facts of the first action, <em>Natural Gas Pipeline Co. v. Energy Gathering, Inc.,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>reflect that this civil RICO action was brought in 1988 under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964 by appellees Texas Industrial Energy Co. and South Gulf Energy, Inc. against a dozen people, including Navarro Crowson, who allegedly had defrauded them in a kickback scheme. The action was consolidated with eight other RICO actions, some of which also named Crowson as a defendant. Prior to the filing of this civil action Crowson had pleaded guilty to several counts of mail fraud done in connection with the alleged scheme. Appellees moved for a default judgment against Crowson. On September 17, 1991 John Fox, Crowson\u2019s partner in several business ventures and his long-time legal counsel, appeared in opposition on behalf of Crowson. On September 23, 1991, a default judgment of $1.28 million was entered against Crowson.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-21\">Post-judgment discovery requests about Crowson\u2019s assets were served on Fox as Crowson\u2019s attorney of record. After the requests were ignored and Crowson failed to comply with a court order to respond, he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>held in contempt on June 8, 1992 and incarcerated. At that contempt hearing Crowson was represented by Texas attorney Bobby Mims.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">To gain release from the onus of contempt, on June 15,1992 Crowson signed an \u201cAgreed Order,\u201d in which he pledged to produce all of his financial and business records, and to direct third parties to do likewise. After Crowson failed to comply, on July 14, 1992 the court ordered Crowson and his unnamed agents and attorneys to turn over all of his assets to the United States Marshal Service. Rather than comply, Crowson went to Mississippi where he filed for bankruptcy and then entered a mental hospital. The court <em>a quo </em>ordered Crowson back to jail. On appellees\u2019 motion, the Mississippi bankruptcy was transferred to the court <em>a quo </em>and ultimately dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In the meantime, on June 18, 1992, appellees and a United States Marshal went to Fox\u2019s office and served him with a copy of the \u201cAgreed Order.\u201d Fox denied having any of Crowson\u2019s records. Three weeks later appellees and a deputy marshal returned to Fox\u2019s office but he did not turn over all records relating to his business ventures with Crowson. On September 14, 1992 the court ordered Fox to turn over all assets of and documents relating to the Crowson Children\u2019s 1990 Trust, of which Fox was the trustee, and all assets in his possession belonging to Crowson. Fox responded by filing pleadings in the bankruptcy proceeding seeking to declare null and void the order regarding the trust assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">At a contempt hearing in March 1993 the court found that Fox acted as Crowson\u2019s agent and ordered him to produce his personal tax returns and every document in his possession relating to Crowson. Fox declined to produce as ordered, contending that as a Mississippi resident he could not be compelled to do so by . a federal district court in Texas. The court held him in civil contempt and ordered his incarceration. A panel of this court stayed that order pending appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">We subsequently held that although the district court generally would not have the inherent power to order discovery from a third party outside the district, it could order Fox .to produce Crowson-related records because Fox had entered an appearance in the ease as Crowson\u2019s attorney and had served as his agent in many respects. We held that the district court had the inherent power to sanction Fox as an errant lawyer practicing before the court. Further, we held that the district court was justified in concluding that without some sanction, Fox could not be relied on to produce all the records of his financial relationship with Crowson. Finding an abuse of discretion, we reversed the incarceration order and that portion of the judgment holding Fox in contempt for failing to turn over his personal tax returns.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The remainder of the contempt judgment was remanded for the district court\u2019s reconsideration. We suggested that traditional sanctions, such as a monetary penalty that increased each day of Fox\u2019s noncompliance, would be sufficient to accomplish the court\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">On remand Fox was deposed and after a hearing ordered to produce all Crowson-related records and all of the deposit slips and checks from his personal cheeking account for nine years. The appellees had not sought these records. At conclusion of the hearing the court suggested that Fox might want to invoke the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination because he might face criminal liability for money laundering.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Fox did so the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>At a subsequent proceeding -within days of the remand, counsel for appellees stated that some of the records had not been produced. Without taking any testimony the court ordered Fox back to jail where he remained for several days until conditionally released to find and produce more records. At a subsequent hearing appellees stated that Fox was in substantial compliance, having produced thousands of documents. Many had not been in Fox\u2019s possession but had been secured by Fox and his counsel from other sources including Crowson, Crowson\u2019s counsel, banks, and brokerage firms.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Appellees filed an application for a \u201ccompensatory fine\u201d of $459,725 for losses sustained because of Fox\u2019s failure to produce documents when he was served with the Agreed Order. The request included approximately $89,000 representing Crowson\u2019s sale of a stock jointly owned by Fox and Crowson, $189,000 representing an annuity cashed by Crowson, $82,000 in attorneys fees and expenses, and $101,000 representing payments by Crowson to Fox which appellees contend were an attempt to conceal Crowson assets and which Fox contends was payment for legal work done over a nine-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">In May 1994 the court issued a Judgment of Civil Contempt and Compensatory Fine based on evidence received at one of the November 1998 hearings. The court sanctioned Fox for misconduct and contempt by awarding appellees $460,083 against Fox as restitution \u201cdirectly occasioned by Fox\u2019s acts.\u201d The court found that Fox had violated the court\u2019s orders by failing to produce records in a timely manner, failing to produce all required records, and failing to produce his attorney billing statements. The court found that Fox\u2019s assertion of fifth amendment privilege was a \u201cfrivolous excuse for his willful nonproduction of the records\u201d and that Fox had waived the privilege by failing to object timely to the production of records.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-14\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-15\">Federal courts have inherent powers necessary to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of their dockets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These powers include the authority to punish \u25a0for contempt in order to maintain obedience to court orders and the authority to impose reasonable and appropriate sanctions on errant lawyers practicing before the court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We review contempt orders and sanctions imposed under a court\u2019s inherent powers under the abuse of discretion standard. Because of the potency of inherent powers and the limited control of their exercise, however, they must be used with great restraint and caution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The threshold for the use of the inherent power sanction is high.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such powers may be exercised only if essential to preserve the authority of the court and the sanction chosen must employ \u201c \u2018the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If there is a reasonable probability that a lesser sanction will have the desired effect, the court must try the less restrictive measure first.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-16\">We hold that in the circumstances of this case, the district court abused its discretion in imposing a $460,083 \u201ccompensatory fine\u201d as a civil contempt sanction against Fox in addition to the period of incarceration imposed. Our prior opinion noted the propriety of sanctions against Fox, but vacated as an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s incarceration order and its order that Fox produce his personal tax returns. We suggested traditional sanctions, such as a mone<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>tary penalty increasing each day of Fox\u2019s noncompliance, as the exercise of the least power necessary to accomplish the court\u2019s purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">On remand, however, the district court disregarded our caution that \u201c[t]he ultimate touchstone of inherent powers is necessity.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Instead, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>ordered Fox\u2019s reincarceration without explanation as to why incarceration was necessary to accomplish the court\u2019s legitimate discovery purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Further, despite our finding that the order to produce Fox\u2019s personal tax returns was an unwarranted invasion of privacy and unlikely to be useful in producing evidence of Crowson\u2019s assets, on remand the district court ordered that Fox produce thousands of checks and deposit slips from his personal checking accounts. This order was an abuse of discretion, causing an even greater intrusion on privacy than the invalidated order to release tax returns, and the order was not based on evidence that production of these documents would likely reveal the existence or location of additional Crowson assets.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We hold that the district court exceeded its inherent powers in imposing a monetary sanction under the facts as presented herein.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The court\u2019s imposition of a compensatory fine was excessive and unreasonable. We conclude that Fox\u2019s incarceration was sufficient punishment in itself to effectuate obedience to the court\u2019s legitimate orders and to deter future similar behavior by Fox or other litigants and lawyers. We find the mandated restraint in the exercise of inherent powers lacking in the imposition, in this case, of an additional monetary sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">As a final matter, we must address whether the district court may impose sanctions because of Fox\u2019s continuing refusal to produce records which he asserts are privileged by the fifth amendment\u2019s protection against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">In civil as well as in criminal matters, direct imposition of sanctions against one who asserts the privilege against self-incrimination violates the Constitution.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The privilege applies to documents as well as to testimony. Upon valid invocation of the privilege, an individual\u2019s potentially incriminating papers are protected from production.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">We hold that Fox\u2019s invocation of the privilege was not ftivolous; indeed, it was made at the very suggestion of the district judge who pointedly recognized that some of the documents demanded by the discovery orders might furnish incriminating information. We also hold that Fox did not waive the privilege merely by failing to invoke it at an earlier time. Because Fox did not admit at any earlier stage of this proceeding to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>guilt or to facts which are themselves incriminating, he cannot be deprived of the right to assert the privilege. Therefore, Fox was entitled to assert his fifth amendment privilege in refusing to release attorney billing records, and the imposition of sanctions for Fox\u2019s refusal to release these records was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Appellant\u2019s motion to supplement the record is denied. The judgment appealed is REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b555-22\">. 2 F.3d 1397 (5th Cir. 1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 114 S.Ct. 882, 127 L.Ed.2d 77 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\">.

The district judge substantially undermined his authority to impose sanctions in this case when he stated at hearings on November 5, 1993 that Fox\u2019s punishable actions were not in his role as lawyer but rather as a \"bag man for an embezzler,\u201d and on November 30, 1993 that Fox had done nothing wrong as a lawyer. In <em>Natural Gas, </em>we based our holding that the court had the inherent power to sanction Fox on his role as an errant lawyer practicing before the court, citing for that proposition <em>Flaksa v. Little River Marine Constr. Co., </em>389 F.2d 885 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>392 U.S. 928, 88 S.Ct. 2287, 20 L.Ed.2d 1387 (1968). \"Although it is unclear whether the inherent power to sanction discovery abuses extends to abuses committed by non-parties, there is no doubt that this power may be applied to attorneys in the case.\u201d <em>Natural Gas </em>at 1411 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b558-9\">.

Our prior decision in <em>Natural Gas </em>found that March 15, 1993, was the date by which Fox could be held responsible for failure to supply records, as that was the day on which the district court \"made fully clear to Fox\u201d that he was required to turn over all of Crowson's records responsive to the Agreed Order, which had not named him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b558-15\">. <em>Hoover v.
