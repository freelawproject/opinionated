At 10:45 a.m. Mary Ellen Boone, an experienced teller, had just completed a business transaction with a customer when, looking up, she suddenly saw a man, later identified as defendant Gary L. Kirvan, pointing a shiny black gun at her. The parties describe this gun as a .44 caliber black powder revolver, a replica of an antique. Defendant placed the gun, together with a note, on the counter before her. The note demanded all her cash and Kirvan ordered her to \u201c[d]o what the note says or you\u2019re dead.\u201d She handed him all her 100s, 50s, and 20s and, upon his waving the gun at her and telling her to \u201c[k]eep going,\u201d she gave him, in addition, all the 10s, 5s, and singles in her top drawer. After the defendant stuffed this cash amounting to $2,527 in his pockets, he fled. Later, he was apprehended while committing another armed bank robbery in Lebanon, Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">Following a trial, a jury found defendant guilty of the armed bank robbery in Rochester. He received a 30 month sentence, consecutive to the undischarged portion of his sentence for the Tennessee robbery. Defendant now appeals, raising as the sole issue the propriety of a five-level sentence enhancement for the use of a firearm in the course of the robbery, rather than a three-level enhancement for the brandishing of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">PRIOR PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">An indictment dated April 30, 1992 charged Kirvan and two others with various offenses for their involvement in the crime committed in Rochester. Kirvan was charged with committing bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), bank larceny in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b), armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d), and with carrying or using a firearm in connection with a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). He was tried separately before a jury in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York (Telesca, C.J.). Before trial the government moved, in the interest of justice, to dismiss the charge of carrying or using a firearm in a crime of violence because \u00a7 924(c) does not apply to \u201cantique firearms,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3). The district court granted the motion. The jury returned a guilty verdiet for bank robbery and armed bank robbery, and therefore did not reach the bank larceny charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">At the sentencing hearing, the trial court noted that the bank robbery and armed bank robbery convictions merged, and it sentenced defendant only for the latter conviction. The probation department recommended a five-level upward adjustment under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (U.S.S.G. or Guidelines), which applies to robberies during which the defendant \u201cbrandished, displayed, or possessed\u201d a firearm. The defendant objected to the upward adjustment, contending that the weapon used in the robbery was not a \u201cfirearm\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) because it was an \u201cantique.\u201d Instead, defendant contended, the use of the weapon warranted only the three-level upward adjustment for use of a dangerous weapon specified in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">The government agreed that the gun was an antique, but nonetheless maintained it was a firearm under the Guidelines. In imposing the five-level upward adjustment, the district court reasoned that the antique gun fell within the relevant definition of \u201cfirearm,\u201d <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1 Application Note 1 (incor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>porating definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 Application Note 1(e)), and that the exclusion of antiques from the coverage of the Gun Control Act, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3) (1994), was inapplicable. Defendant now appeals the sentence enhancement as inappropriate under Guidelines \u00a7 2B3.1. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AgZ\">I. Guidelines Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">A. <em>In General</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">This appeal requires us to decide whether an antique gun is a \u201cfirearm\u201d for purposes of the five-level enhancement set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C). We analyze this provision of the Guidelines in light of what is an allegedly contrary provision contained in the Gun Control Act of 1968, Pub.L. No. 90-618, \u00a7 101, 82 Stat. 1213 (1968) (codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3) (1994)) (Gun Control Act or Act), a statute passed by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The Sentencing Commission, created under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, Pub.L. No. 98-473, \u00a7 217(a), 98 Stat.2017-26 (1984) (codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 991-98 (1994)), promulgates the Guidelines under an express delegation of rulemaking authority from Congress. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(a)(1). The Guidelines \u201care the equivalent of legislative rules adopted by federal agencies.\u201d <em>Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 45, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 1919, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993). Because they determine what sentences individual defendants receive, the Guidelines have the force and effect of law. Congress was empowered to revoke or amend any Guidelines within the 180-day waiting period established by \u00a7 235(a)(1)(B)(ii)(III) of the Sentencing Reform Act, 98 Stat.2031-32, or, for that matter, at any time. <em>See Mistretta v. United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 393-94, 109 S.Ct. 647, 666, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989); <em>cf. </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(p) (current provision for Congressional consideration of amendments). Hence, the Commission\u2019s Guidelines may be trumped by an Act of Congress. For example, when a sentence is fixed by statute, a contrary Guideline would be ineffective. <em>See Stinson, </em>508 U.S. at 47, 113 S.Ct. at 1920 (noting validity of a Guideline unless it contravenes federal statute or Constitution, or is plainly erroneous).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">The question we must answer is whether, as defendant maintains, the Gun Control Act overrides the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 definition of a firearm. In resolving this question we examine the Guideline and statute in question with some particularity. And, in so doing, we are guided by the notion that the Guidelines, having the force and effect of law, are to be construed as if they were a statute, giving the words used their common meaning, absent a clearly expressed manifestation of contrary intent. <em>See United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 580, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2527, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">Such an approach has been adopted by a number of our sister Circuits. <em>See United States v. Gacnik, </em>50 F.3d 848, 852 (10th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Rocha, </em>916 F.2d 219, 243 (5th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>500 U.S. 934, 111 S.Ct. 2057, 114 L.Ed.2d 462 (1991); <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>900 F.2d 877, 880 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 840, 111 S.Ct. 117, 112 L.Ed.2d 86 (1990); <em>United States v. Donley, </em>878 F.2d 735, 741 (3d Cir. 1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>494 U.S. 1058, 110 S.Ct. 1528, 108 L.Ed.2d 767 (1990). We have recognized the soundness of these principles. <em>See United States v. Correa-Vargas, </em>860 F.2d 35, 38 (2d Cir.1988) (relying on \u201cfamiliar principles of statutory interpretation\u201d in reading Guidelines). Because this challenge to the application of the Guidelines involves a purely legal question, we review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo. See United States v. Vazzano, </em>906 F.2d 879, 883 (2d Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">B. <em>Specific Guidelines Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">Keeping in mind this general background of what the Guidelines are and how they are to be construed, we turn first to the provision found in \u00a7 2B3.1 of the Guidelines, which is the section used to determine the base offense level for a defendant who has committed a robbery. Section 2B3.1(b)(2) enhances the offense level by seven levels if during the commission of a robbery a firearm is discharged, six levels if a firearm is \u201cotherwise used,\u201d five levels if a firearm is \u201cbrandished, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>displayed or possessed,\u201d four levels if a dangerous weapon was \u201cotherwise used,\u201d three levels if a dangerous weapon was \u201cbrandished, displayed or possessed,\u201d or two levels if an express threat of death was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The specific provision at issue on this appeal, \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C), states: \u201cif a firearm was brandished, displayed, or possessed, increase by 5 levels.\u201d The commentary accompanying \u00a7 2B3.1 makes clear that the term \u201cfirearm\u201d is defined \u201cin the Commentary to \u00a7 1B1.1 (Application Instructions).\u201d That definition reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">\u201cFirearm\u201d means (i) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (ii) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (iii) any firearm muffler or silencer; or (iv) any destructive device. A weapon, commonly known as a \u201cBB\u201d or pellet gun, that uses air or carbon dioxide pressure to expel a projectile is a dangerous weapon but not a firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 Application Note 1(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The gun concededly used by the defendant falls squarely within the plain language of this definition of \u201cfirearm.\u201d The district court adopted the probation department\u2019s finding that defendant used an antique .44 caliber black powder revolver to commit the crime. This type of weapon uses gun powder to propel a bullet. Defendant does not assert that the gun was in some way inoperable and does not otherwise dispute the probation department\u2019s finding. Rather, he relies exclusively on the argument that an antique firearm does not trigger the five-level upward adjustment under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">Although defendant indicated at the sentencing hearing that the pistol was not loaded when the robbery was committed, the definition in \u00a7 1B1.1 does not distinguish between loaded and unloaded firearms. The only explicit exception to the applicable definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d is one for pellet guns using certain pressurized gases. That exception is clearly inapplicable to a black powder weapon designed to expel a projectile through the use of an explosive. We therefore conclude that the relevant definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d is unambiguous, and that, by its terms, it applies to the ease at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">C. <em>Statutory Definition of Firearm,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">Kirvan contends, however, that despite the language of the definition set forth in the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 commentary, antique weapons were intended to be excluded from the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d for purposes of the Guidelines. For that proposition, defendant relies on the exclusion of antique guns from the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d found in the Gun Control Act of 1968, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-12\">The term \u201cfirearm\u201d means (A) any weapon (including a starter gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive; (B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon; (C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or (D) any destructive device. Such term does not include an antique firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3). It is true that courts have consistently held that antique guns are not firearms for purposes of the criminal prohibitions contained in that Act. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mayo, </em>705 F.2d 62, 76 (2d Cir.1983) (\u201cantique firearm\u201d exception in federal firearms laws is an affirmative defense that must be raised by the defendant); <em>United States v. Washington, </em>17 F.3d 230, 232 (8th Cir.) (holding that once defendant produces evidence sufficient to raise a genuine dispute over whether firearm is an antique, the government must prove otherwise beyond a reasonable doubt), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 153, 130 L.Ed.2d 92 (1994); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>981 F.2d 887, 891-92 (6th Cir.1992) (following <em>Mayo).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-16\">II. Purposes of Gun Control Act and Guidelines Provision</p>\n<p id=\"b402-17\">A. <em>Gun Control Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-18\">Comparing the purposes underlying the Gun Control Act, including the statute\u2019s exception for antique guns, with the aims of the sentencing enhancement for defendants who use firearms in committing a robbery, is helpful in resolving the issue before us. Congress passed the Gun Control Act because \u201c[t]he increasing rate of crime and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>lawlessness and the growing use of firearms in violent crime clearly attest[ed] to a need to strengthen Federal regulation of interstate firearms traffic.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. (1968), <em>reprinted in </em>1968 U.S.C.C.AN. 4410, 4412 (House Report). Congress was concerned because, among other things, guns had been used in an untold number of violent crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 4413.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The Gun Control Act therefore significantly modified firearms regulations by requiring firearms dealers to be licensed, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923 (1994) (current version), imposing certain conditions on the importation of firearms, <em>id., </em>and prohibiting certain types of firearms transactions altogether, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922. The Act also provided for enhanced penalties where a defendant uses or possesses a firearm in committing certain crimes. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) (1994) (current version). The enhanced penalties provision was not part of the 1968 gun legislation at the time it was introduced; it was added as an amendment on the floor of the House of Representatives. <em>See </em>114 Cong. Rec. 22231, 22248 (1968) (substitute amendment offered by Representative Poff); <em>cf. Busic v. United States, </em>446 U.S. 398, 405-06, 100 S.Ct. 1747, 1752-53, 64 L.Ed.2d 381 (1980) (noting lack of evidence of congressional intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">To ensure that the new regulatory scheme governing firearms transactions would not result in an undue imposition on gun collectors, Congress stated that the Gun Control Act would not apply to \u201cantique firearm[s].\u201d <em>See </em>House Report at 4415 (\u201cIf the firearm is an \u2018antique firearm\u2019 as defined in section 921(a)(15), the transaction is exempted entirely from any coverage of the bill.\u201d); <em>Mayo, </em>705 F.2d at 76 (Congress exempted antique firearms \u201cto safeguard the rights of persons who deal in a narrow class of weapons.\u201d). <em>See also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3) (1994); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(16) (1994) (defining \u201cantique firearm\u201d). Thus, the Gun Control Act\u2019s exception for antique guns in its definition of firearms was to protect collectors of such weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">B. <em>\u00a7 2BS.1 Enhancements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The purpose of the sentencing enhancement in the Guidelines for the use of a firearm in the course of an armed robbery is reflected in the \u201cbackground\u201d portion of the commentary appended to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1: \u201cPossession or use of a weapon, physical injury, and unlawful restraint sometimes occur during a robbery. The guideline provides for a range of enhancements where these factors are present.\u201d Hence, the Guidelines recognize that a criminal who uses a firearm in the commission of a robbery is ordinarily guilty of a more serious offense\u2014 and deserves more punishment \u2014 than someone who, for example, threatens a victim without employing a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">III. Resolution of Alleged Inconsistency Between Guidelines and Gun Control Act</p>\n<p id=\"b403-11\">Although Kirvan concedes, as he must, that the definition in the \u00a7 1B1.1 commentary makes no reference to the Gun Control Act or to any exception for antique weapons, he points out that the Act <em>is </em>mentioned elsewhere in the Guidelines \u2014 in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1. The commentary accompanying \u00a7 2K2.1 \u2014 which governs when a defendant is sentenced for firearms trafficking offenses under the Act \u2014 quotes, in significant part, the definition found in \u00a7 921(a)(3) of the Act without referring specifically to the exception for antique guns. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 Application Note 1. It also provides a citation to \u00a7 921(a)(3). The commentary goes on to cite the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a), without mentioning the exception for antiques that section contains. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 Application Note 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">Defendant asserts that this reference in the Guidelines to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3)\u2014 the Gun Control Act definition that contains an explicit exception for antiques \u2014 indicates that the drafters of the Guidelines intended such an exception to apply under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C). We are unable to agree. An exception in a statute is presumed to apply only to the section to which it is attached. <em>United States v. Hescorp, Heavy Equip. Sales Corp., </em>801 F.2d 70, 74 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1018, 107 S.Ct. 672, 93 L.Ed.2d 723 (1986). That is the rule we must follow here because although Congress put the \u201cantique firearm\u201d exception in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Gun Control Act (and the Commission arguably included the exception in \u00a7 2K2.1 of the Guidelines), the Commission did not include it in the definition we are asked to construe; nor did Congress cancel or amend the relevant Guidelines provision within the 180-day period or at any other time. Such an exception will be read broadly only when expressed or implied legislative goals would otherwise be frustrated. <em>Id. </em>at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Similarly, where certain exceptions to a general prohibition are explicitly enumerated, no additional exceptions may be inferred, unless such purpose is clearly discerned. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>499 U.S. 160, 167, 111 S.Ct. 1180, 1185, 113 L.Ed.2d 134 (1991). The definition in the Guidelines that applies to robbery convictions \u2014 the one found in the \u00a7 1B1.1 commentary \u2014 contains an explicit exception for certain pellet guns that harness the pressure of air or carbon dioxide. Given that the black powder revolver falls squarely within the general Guidelines definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d and that no other exception is provided, we must presume that another exception for antique guns was not intended by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Kirvan insists it is logically inconsistent to apply the antique weapon exception to the Gun Control Act\u2019s criminal prohibitions but not to the sentence enhancement provisions for robbery convictions, and that we should construe the overall sentencing scheme in such a way as to harmonize potentially discordant provisions, <em>see United States v. Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 344, 92 S.Ct. 515, 521, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971). Such a view is untenable. The policy motivating the Gun Control Act\u2019s exception for antiques \u2014 allowing gun collectors to pursue their hobby \u2014 hardly has relevance in the context of determining the proper sentence for a person found guilty of armed robbery. An armed robbery is no less serious by virtue of the fact that the culprit happened to brandish an old or valuable pistol instead of a new one, although the crime might be more exotic or newsworthy. Like a rose, which \u201c[b]y any other name would smell as sweet,\u201d William Shakespeare, <em>Romeo and Juliet </em>act II, sc. 2, line 44 (W.J. Craig ed., Oxford Univ. Press 1928), so Kirvan\u2019s firearm, be it new or antique, could kill as well.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq-\">Giving more lenient sentences to antique-gun-toting defendants would not promote the legislative aim of insulating gun collectors from the regulatory scheme contained in the Gun Control Act. If anything, it might make this the preferred way to commit this type of crime. Quite plainly, armed robbery is not the sort of hobby Congress planned to protect when it exempted antiques from that statute\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">For purposes of the criminal law, if there is any incongruity in the way Congress has defined \u201cfirearm\u201d it lies in the applicability of the exception for antique guns to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), the section that penalizes a defendant for carrying or using a firearm with respect to certain underlying crimes. Congress could have, it seems, fully protected gun collectors from the new firearms regulations without exempting from \u00a7 924(c) violent criminals who happen to use antique guns. It chose, however, to leave in place the broad exception for antiques \u2014 one that applies to the entire Gun Control Act \u2014 despite the addition of \u00a7 924(c). It is for this reason that the district court granted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the \u00a7 924(c) charge against Kirvan. If we were interpreting the Gun Control Act in the present case, we would, of course, be required to effectuate Congress\u2019 decision to give the \u201cantique firearm\u201d exception a broad reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">But our task today involves construing a section of the Sentencing Guidelines in which the antique gun exception is conspicuously <em>absent </em>from the definition of \u201cfirearm.\u201d Imposing a higher sentence for a robbery in which a gun was displayed \u2014 whether the gun was old or a new replica of an old gun \u2014 is perfectly consistent with the purposes underlying the enhancements provided in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1: criminals who make use of such weapons are more culpable than those who do not. In addition, the fact that another portion of the Guidelines\u2014 \u00a7 2K2.1 \u2014 incorporates the definition of \u201cfirearm\u201d found in the Gun Control Act is not surprising, since that section \u2014 unlike \u00a7 2B3.1 \u2014 applies to offenses that are set forth in the Gun Control Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">In the present case there is simply no evidence of a purpose to be served that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>would lead us to apply the Gun Control Act\u2019s \u201cantique firearm\u201d exception to the portion of the Guidelines dealing with robberies in which firearms are displayed. Nor by the same token is there any evidence that a meaning other than that plainly indicated by the Guidelines\u2019 language was intended. Consequently, there is no basis for adopting defendant\u2019s view of the Guidelines. <em>See Rubin v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 424, 430, 101 S.Ct. 698, 701-02, 66 L.Ed.2d 633 (1981) (explaining that judicial construction of statutes is ordinarily complete when statutory terms are unambiguous).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Finally, Kirvan tells us that we should be reluctant to interpret \u201cfirearm\u201d to include antique weapons because federal courts in the last quarter century have consistently held to the contrary. To do so, defendant asserts, would constitute a radical departure from established law. Today\u2019s decision raises no such concerns. Because the Gun Control Act of 1968 has contained an explicit exception for antique weapons since the date of its enactment, it is not a matter of wonderment that courts have enforced the exception in cases to which the Act applies. <em>See, e.g., Mayo, </em>705 F.2d at 73-76 (interpreting exception in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3)). The Act merely exempted antiques from its coverage \u2014 it did not purport to establish a general rule that an antique gun is not really a firearm. Nor does the case law interpreting the Act establish such an astounding proposition. Thus, following the plain language of the definition in the commentary accompanying \u00a7 1B1.1 does not require us to deviate from any long-standing rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Accordingly, we hold that an antique gun is a \u201cfirearm\u201d for purposes of the sentencing enhancement in \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) of the Guidelines. Defendant\u2019s sentence is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
