Woodrup was arrested approximately seven minutes later at a nearby motel. He was subsequently tried and convicted of bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">One of the conditions of the supervised release imposed upon Woodrup\u2019s conviction for breaking and entering was that he not commit a crime during the term of supervision. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d) (\u201cThe court shall order, as an explicit condition of supervised release, that the defendant not commit another Federal, State, or local crime during the term of supervision____\u201d). Consequently, in a proceeding after his conviction for bank robbery but before he was sentenced for that offense, Woodrup\u2019s supervised release was revoked, and he was sentenced to 24 months in prison. Woodrup thereafter received a consecutive 240 month sentence for the bank robbery conviction itself, the district court having summarily denied his motion to vacate the conviction on grounds of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-15\">On this appeal, Woodrup challenges not his bank robbery conviction, but only the 240 month sentence imposed for that offense, as unconstitutional under the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He challenges, alternatively, the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction for bank robbery. Finding no merit in either claim, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-17\">Woodrup first contends that, because the term of imprisonment imposed for violation of the conditions of his supervised release constituted punishment for his bank robbery, the subsequent punishment imposed for his bank robbery conviction violates the Double Jeopardy Clause\u2019s proscription against successive punishments for the same offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>We disagree with the premise of Woodrup\u2019s contention, and therefore with his ultimate conclusion that the punishment on his bank robbery conviction is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The sentence imposed upon revocation of a term of supervised release is an authorized part of the original sentence, just as the term of supervised release is an authorized part of the original sentence for commission of the felony or misdemeanor, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(a). As the Sentencing Commission has explained, a violation of supervised release is a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d in connection with the original sentence and the resulting sentence a punishment incident to the original offense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">While the nature of the conduct leading to the revocation would be considered in measuring the extent of the breach of trust, imposition of an appropriate punishment for any new criminal conduct would not be the primary goal of a revocation sentence. <em>Instead, the sentence imposed upon revocation would be intended to sanction the violator for failing to abide by the conditions of the court-ordered supervision, leaving the punishment for any new criminal conduct to the court responsible for imposing the sentence for that offense.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">U.S.S.G. Ch. 7, Pt. A, H 3(b) (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>at Pt. B, Intro. Commentary; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (providing that the term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of supervision is a function of the particular offense for which the supervision was imposed). It is for this reason that the Commission requires the sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release to run consecutively to any sentence for the conduct that was \u201cthe basis of the revocation of probation or supervised release.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f). Indeed, because punishment for violating the terms of supervised release is punishment for the original offense, we have held that the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause prohibits legislative changes in the terms and conditions of supervised release \u2014 including the length of imprisonment imposed for a violation of supervised release \u2014 following the commission of the original offense. <em>United States v. Parriett, </em>974 F.2d 523, 526 (4th Cir.1992) (rejecting argument that \u201crevocation of [the defendant\u2019s] supervised release was not ordered as punishment for his initial crimes, but instead, as punishment for his possession of drugs during the term of his supervised release\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Meeks, </em>25 F.3d 1117 (2nd Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">That the sentence imposed upon revocation of supervision is punishment for the original offense is further confirmed by the fact that the full panoply of constitutional protections afforded a criminal defendant is not required for the revocation of supervised release. <em>See, e.g., </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (providing that a violation of supervised release need only be proven by a preponderance of the evidence); <em>compare United States v. Dixon, </em>509 U.S. 688, 696, 113 S.Ct. 2849, 2856, 125 L.Ed.2d 556 (1993) (noting that nonsummary criminal contempt is \u201ca crime in the ordinary sense\u201d for which ordinary \u201cconstitutional protections\u201d apply (citations omitted)). As was true of the enhancement at issue in <em>Witte v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 2206, 132 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995), the consideration of the \u201coffender-specific information\u201d of Woodrup\u2019s bank robbery at the proceeding to revoke the term of supervision imposed for his breaking and entering offense \u201cwithout the procedural protections attendant at a criminal trial ... necessarily implies] that such consideration [did] not result in \u2018punishment\u2019 for such conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-16\">In the analogous contexts of probation and parole,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the courts of appeals, reasoning from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the like fact that a sentence imposed upon the revocation of probation or parole is not punishment for the conduct prompting the revocation, but, rather, a modification of the original sentence for which the probation or parole was authorized, <em>Ralston v. Robinson, </em>454 U.S. 201, 220 n. 14, 102 S.Ct. 233, 245 n. 14, 70 L.Ed.2d 345 (1981); <em>see also United States v. DiFrancesco, </em>449 U.S. 117, 137, 101 S.Ct. 426, 437, 66 L.Ed.2d 328 (1980); <em>id. </em>at 148, 101 S.Ct. at 443 (Brennan, J., dissenting), have consistently held that the subsequent criminal prosecution and punishment for conduct which previously served as the basis for a revocation of probation or parole does not offend the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hanahan, </em>798 F.2d 187, 189 (7th Cir.1986); <em>Bible v. Arizona, </em>449 F.2d 111, 112-13 (9th Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 994, 92 S.Ct. 1268, 31 L.Ed.2d 463 (1972); <em>see generally Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. </em>471, 480, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 2600, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (\u201c[Rjevocation of parole is not part of a criminal prosecution and thus the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such a proceeding does not apply to parole revocations.\u201d); <em>cf. United States v. Grisanti, 4 </em>F.3d 173, 176 (2d Cir.1993) (bail revocation followed by criminal prosecution). We believe that the same must be true in the context of revocations of supervised release. It is of no moment that, as Woodrup contends, Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13-15, the sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release is \u201cin addition to the period of imprisonment\u201d already served, even if the defendant has served the maximum term authorized for the original substantive offense (exclusive of the term of supervision), rather than merely the reinstatement of an unserved sentence. The sentence is no less punishment for the original offense for which the term of supervised release was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Because the punishment imposed upon Woodrup for violating the terms of his supervised release is properly considered punishment for his previous offense of breaking and entering, not for his subsequent offense of bank robbery, the punishment imposed for this latter offense is not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">On the mistaken understanding that the sentence imposed upon the revocation of his supervised release constituted punishment for his bank robbery, Woodrup contends that <em>United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, </em>113 S.Ct. 2849, 125 L.Ed.2d 556 (1993), requires invalidation of the sentence he received on his bank robbery conviction. In <em>Dixon, </em>the Court held that a criminal contempt prosecution for violating conditions of bond barred a subsequent prosecution for the offense on which the criminal contempt conviction was based because the two offenses satisfied the same elements test of <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). Because Dixon had not been previously convicted, however, the sentence imposed for Dixon\u2019s criminal contempt could only have been punishment for the conduct that gave rise to the contempt \u2014 the same cocaine possession for which the government had again sought to \u2022 prosecute him \u2014 and therefore Dixon\u2019s subsequent prosecution for cocaine possession necessarily met Blockburger\u2019s same elements test.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">In a case such as the one before us, where the punishment (the sentence imposed upon revocation of the supervised release) as to which the challenged punishment (the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>tenee imposed for the subsequent substantive offense) is allegedly successive was itself punishment for a prior offense, the <em>Blockburger </em>test is applied to the prior offense and the offense as to which the defendant pleads the double jeopardy bar. In <em>Witte v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 182 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995), for example, the defendant\u2019s participation in a cocaine conspiracy had been used as \u201crelevant conduct\u201d to enhance the defendant\u2019s sentence for marijuana possession. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim that his subsequent cocaine conspiracy conviction was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Court concluded that, although the government was required to prove all the elements of the cocaine conspiracy at the marijuana sentencing hearing, the defendant was \u201cneither prosecuted for nor convicted of the cocaine offenses during the[marijuana] criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 115 S.Ct. at 2204. In reaching this conclusion under <em>Blockburger\u2019s </em>same elements test, the Court compared the cocaine offenses with the original marijuana offense, not with \u201crelevant conduct\u201d <em>(i.e., </em>participation in the cocaine conspiracy) that was used to enhance the sentence for the marijuana possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">In the same way that the Court in <em>Witte </em>compared the cocaine offenses with the original marijuana offense, the offenses to be compared under <em>Blockburger </em>to determine whether Woodrup\u2019s punishment for bank robbery is forbidden by the Double Jeopardy Clause are the breaking and entering and the bank robbery, not the violation of supervised release <em>(i.e., </em>the bank robbery) and the bank robbery. Whether the enhancement or modification comes at the time of the initial sentencing, as it did in <em>Witte, </em>or thereafter, as here, is immaterial. In both cases, the enhancement or modification is legislatively authorized punishment for the offense of original conviction, not for the conduct giving rise to the enhancement. <em>Cf. Witte, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 115 S.Ct. at 2205 (\u201c[Petitioner's double jeopardy theory \u2014 that consideration of uncharged conduct in arriving at a sentence within the statutorily authorized punishment range constitutes \u2018punishment\u2019 for that conduct \u2014 is not supported by our precedents, which make clear that a defendant in that situation is punished, for double jeopardy purposes, only for the offense of which the defendant is convicted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">Accordingly, we hold, as has the only other circuit to consider the issue, that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the government from criminally prosecuting and punishing an offense which has formed the basis for revocation of a term of supervised release. <em>See United States v. Soto-Olivas, </em>44 F.3d 788, 792 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 2289, 132 L.Ed.2d 290 (1995); <em>cf. Meeks, 25 </em>F.3d at 1122-23 (dicta).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-17\">Woodrup also claims that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction for bank robbery, which requires that the theft be \u201cby force and violence, or by intimidation,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), and that the evidence would support at most a conviction for bank larceny, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 2113(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-18\">The evidence introduced at trial showed that Woodrup entered the bank, looked directly at teller Evelyn Woodham, walked very quickly across the lobby to the teller position, reached across the counter \u201cas if ... trying to grab\u201d the teller, and vaulted over the counter headfirst, causing her to back away, screaming. J.A. at 48. Woodrup then proceeded to the money drawer and began stuffing money from it into his army jacket. Woodrup then proceeded to the next teller position, and ultimately fled the bank. Woodrup did not present a note, show a weapon, or make an oral demand for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-19\">The test in this circuit for intimidation under \u00a7 2113(a) is whether \u201c\u2018an ordinary person in the teller\u2019s position reasonably could infer a threat of bodily harm from the defendant\u2019s acts.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Wag-staff </em>865 F.2d 626, 627 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>882 F.2d 312, 315 (5th Cir.1987), cert. <em>denied, </em>484 U.S. 1075, 108 S.Ct. 1051, 98 L.Ed.2d 1013 (1988)) (emphasis deleted), <em>cert. denied, </em>491 U.S. 907, 109 S.Ct. 3193, 105 L.Ed.2d 701 (1989). Woodrup does not dispute that the teller was reasonably intimidated; rather, he argues that <em>Wagstaff </em>also requires the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>to prove that he <em>intended </em>the intimidation. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cFor intimidation to occur under [\u00a7 2113(a) ], a defendant\u2019s conduct must be \u2018reasonably calculated to produce fear.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Amos, </em>566 F.2d 899, 901 (4th Cir.1977); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>530 F.2d 576, 579 (4th Cir.1976))).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">We disagree. The statute merely requires that a theft of money from a bank be \u201cby force or violence, or by intimidation\u201d in order to constitute robbery; nothing in the statute even remotely suggests that the defendant must have intended to intimidate. We do not read <em>Wagstaff, Amos, </em>and <em>Harris </em>to the contrary. We therefore reaffirm that the intimidation element of \u00a7 2113(a) is satisfied if \u201can ordinary person in the teller\u2019s position reasonably could infer a threat of bodily harm from the defendant\u2019s acts,\u201d whether or not the defendant actually intended the intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The evidence adduced at trial in this case is more than sufficient to support a finding by the jury that the teller was intimidated because she reasonably could infer a threat of bodily harm from the fact that Woodrup reached toward her and then vaulted over the counter at her in the course of a bank robbery. Even Woodrup admitted that he was \u201cglad that the teller didn\u2019t have a heart attack and die.\u201d J.A. at 122-23 (testimony of agent Strong).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-10\">. The Supreme Court has held that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars subsequent prosecutions for the same offense as well as successive punishments. <em>See North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 2076, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969). Obviously, if Woodrup\u2019s challenge was one based on subsequent prosecutions, then it is the revocation hearing, not the prior bank robbery prosecution, that would be barred (if the revocation hearing can be deemed a \"prosecution\u201d at all). Presumably, it is because such a challenge would draw into question only the 24 month sentence he received at the supervised release revocation hearing, not the 240 month sentence he received for the bank robbery conviction, that Woodrup challenges the latter sentence rather than the prosecution that yielded the former sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b450-19\">. Woodrup actually received the term of imprisonment for violating the conditions of his supervised release by robbing the bank <em>and </em>by using a controlled substance. J.A. 19. Woodrup claims that the fact that the revocation was also based on a positive drug test does not \"moot\u201d the double jeopardy claim because the bank robbery conviction rendered his violation of supervised release a \"Grade A,\u201d rather than a \"Grade C,\u201d violation. Because, as we explain below, a su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>pervised release revocation based solely on the bank robbery conviction does not bar a subsequent prosecution or punishment for the bank robbery offense, we need not address whether the positive drug test would save a conviction that would otherwise be constitutionally infirm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\">. <em>Department of Revenue of Montana v. Kurth Ranch, </em>- U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 1937, 128 L.Ed.2d 767 (1994), is not to the contrary. The only issue in <em>Kurth Ranch </em>was whether the Montana tax constituted a punishment for double jeopardy purposes.
