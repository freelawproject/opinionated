KING, Senior District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b942-25\">Patrick Graham (\u201cGraham\u201d) appealed from the summary judgment granted to the vessel owner and owner pro hac vice in their action for exoneration and limitation of liability. Graham was an adult volunteer and \u201cmate\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>on an outing with the Sea Explorers, a nautical troop of boy scouts. Graham was injured when he dove into shallow water to swim to shore and secure the bowline. The main issue on appeal is whether the district court was correct when it found as a matter of law that Graham was not a seaman under the Jones Act. We find that there is a genuine issue of material fact, making summary adjudication improper, and reverse and remand.<footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Graham was a volunteer aboard The Ambrose, on a 10-day training cruise for a small troop of Sea Explorers. The unit for which Graham volunteered chartered a vessel from the Mt. Diablo Boy Scouts of America. Graham had previously been a Sea Explorer himself, and was serving as \u201cmate\u201d to the skipper, William Brazil. Brazil had selected Graham to assist him, and submitted Graham\u2019s application to the Mt. Diablo Council of Boy Scouts for approval. Both the adult volunteers and the children were required to pay annual registration fees and all were charged for expenses incurred during the cruise of The Ambrose. The activities of the voyage included training the children in navigation as well as recreation such as skiing and swimming. Graham and Brazal were the only two adults on board, and both had supervisory authority over the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">On June 18,1992, the third day of the trip, William Brazil was mooring the vessel off Brannan Island State Park. Brazil was supervising one scout who was at the helm. Graham and another scout had put out the stem anchor. Graham, intending to swim the bowline to shore to secure the boat, dove off the bow of the vessel into approximately three feet of water. He suffered quadriplegic injuries as a result of diving into the shallow water.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Brazil had not given any direct orders to Graham to leave the boat or to take the bowline to shore. There had been a brief meeting before mooring where Brazil determined that the bowline would be secured to an object on shore.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">Graham filed a negligence claim against William Brazil in state court. The owner of the vessel, Mt. Diablo, and owner, pro hae vice, Post 248, filed this action for exoneration from or limitation of liability in district court pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure F. The deadline for filing claims and answers to the complaint, set by the district court, was September 14,1993. On that day Graham filed an answer but made no affirmative claims. On September 17, without asking leave of the district court, Graham filed an amended answer which stated an affirmative claim seeking 10 million dollars in contribution and indemnity. The court allowed this amended answer to be filed. This amended answer alleges The Ambrose was unseaworthy and that the accident occurred because of the negligence of the personnel aboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">On April 7, 1994, Graham asked for leave to file an amended claim. This amended claim added a claim under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 688, re-alleged that The Ambrose was unseaworthy and improperly manned, and changed the relief sought from contribution and indemnity to maintenance and cure. Appellees opposed the motion to amend and filed separate motions for summary judgment. The district court denied the motion to amend and ordered summary judgment against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">We review grants of summary judgment <em>de novo. Warren v. City of Carlsbad, </em>58 F.3d 439, 441 (9th Cir.1995). The district court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. County of San Diego, </em>53 F.3d 965, 969 n. 6 (9th Cir.1995). Such a denial is strictly reviewed in light of the strong policy permitting amendment. <em>Texaco, Inc. v. Ponsoldt, </em>939 F.2d 794, 798 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">Jones Act protection extends to \u201c[a]ny seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment____\u201d 46 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 688. The Jones Act does not define the term \u201cseaman\u201d and the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>has been the subject of much litigation. Two recent Supreme Court cases address the question of who is a \u201cseaman.\u201d <em>Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 115 S.Ct. 2172, 2193, 132 L.Ed.2d 314 (1995); <em>McDermott Int\u2019l Inc. v. Wilander, </em>498 U.S. 337, 111 S.Ct. 807, 112 L.Ed.2d 866 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">The test regarding who is a seaman under the Jones Act is a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Wilander, </em>498 U.S. 337, 111 S.Ct. 807. \u201cIf reasonable persons, applying the proper legal standard, could differ as to whether the employee was a \u2018member of a crew,\u2019 it is a question for the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 111 S.Ct. at 818. To qualify as a seaman under the Jones Act the worker must show two basic elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-7\">the worker\u2019s duties must contribute to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission, and the worker must have a connection to a vessel in navigation ... that is substantial in terms of both its duration and nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-8\"><em>Chandris, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 115 S.Ct. at 2193. <em>Chandris </em>was decided after the briefing in this case and neither party submitted supplemental authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">The previous test established in <em>Bullis v. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp., </em>474 F.2d 392 (9th Cir.1973), included the \u201cin aid of navigation\u201d language and is no longer controlling. Under <em>Wilander, </em>the vessel needs to be one \u201cin navigation,\u201d but the duties of the seaman do not need to be \u201cin aid of navigation.\u201d There is no question that The Ambrose was a vessel in navigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">Graham contributed to the operation of the vessel. The facts show that he was the \u201cmate,\u201d and one of only two adult crew members aboard. Despite the lack of formally assigned duties, Graham was engaged in navigation, and in furthering the mission of the vessel, which was working with the boy scouts on board. He was, in the words of the Supreme Court, \u201cdoing the ship\u2019s work.\u201d <em>Wilander, </em>498 U.S. at 355, 111 S.Ct. at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">The issue here is with the second part of the <em>Chandris </em>test and whether Graham\u2019s connection to the vessel was substantial in terms of both its duration and its nature. The Supreme Court has not addressed the issue of a gratuitous worker who is only occasionally at sea. The facts in both <em>Wilander </em>and <em>Chandris </em>involve professional seamen who were paid for full-time work. The disputes in those cases focus on whether the employee was engaged primarily in land based activities or primarily in the operation of the ship in navigable waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">In this case, Graham was not doing any land-based work. When he was acting as mate of the vessel, he was closely associated with the ship. The cruise only lasted ten days, and Graham was not a professional seaman. The Supreme Court has said that the Jones Act is fundamentally status-based, \u201cgranting a cause of action to those maritime workers who form the ship\u2019s company.\u201d <em>Chandris, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 115 S.Ct. at 2186.</p>\n<p id=\"AI9\">Although <em>Chandris </em>came down after the district court\u2019s order in this ease, the district court relied on similar language: \u201cseaman status is a jury question only if there is evidence that ... the plaintiff was \u2018assigned permanently to a vessel____\u2019 \u201d citing <em>Coats v. Penrod Drilling Corp., </em>5 F.3d 877, 890 (5th Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 1303, 127 L.Ed.2d 654 (1994) <em>reh\u2019g en banc granted, </em>20 F.3d 614 (1994), opinion reinstated in part, 61 F.3d 1113 (5th Cir. 1995). The district court in this case concluded that Graham failed to satisfy his burden of showing that he had \u201cmore or less permanent status in an employment-related position.\u201d The new test, quoted above, is whether his connection was \u201csubstantial in terms of both its duration and nature.\u201d <em>Chandris, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 115 S.Ct. at 2193.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-21\">The district court\u2019s finding relied on the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-22\">(1) Graham was not paid for his services ...; (2) Graham viewed his status on board as that of a \u201cvolunteer\u201d ...; (3) Graham was not \u201chired,\u201d but rather signed up with the Post as a volunteer adult supervisor ...; (4) Graham understood that part of his job on The Ambrose was to supervise and train the youths along with the Skipper, Mr. Brazil, as well as to serve as Brazil\u2019s mate ...; and (5) The Ambrose was not a commercial venture or on a serious training mission, but was engaged in a primarily recreational cruise that in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>eluded siding, suntanning, and swimming as well as basic, informal nautical instruction for the underage crew of Boy Scouts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">For the reasons set forth below, we find that the district court erred in finding that this factual situation could not lead any reasonable trier of fact to conclude that Graham was a seaman.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">The purpose of the Jones Act is to protect maritime workers. It is ordinarily for the trier of fact to determine whether someone who does not work for wages is a maritime worker covered by the Jones Act. Only a few district courts have grappled with the issue of whether a gratuitous worker who is only occasionally at sea can be a seaman for Jones Act purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">A district court in Florida found that a person who volunteered to participate in a yacht race for personal pleasure, who was promised no wage or salary, but who was actually performing normal crew service when injured was a seaman under the Jones Act. <em>Petition of Read, </em>224 F.Supp. 241 (D.C.Fla.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">A Rhode Island case involving similar, but not the same, circumstances, <em>Heath v. American Sail Training Ass\u2019n, </em>644 F.Supp. 1459 (D.R.I.1986) declined to grant seaman status to volunteer crew members. <em>Heath </em>held that no employment relationship existed between the organizer of a sail training program and the crew members, and that the crew members who were unpaid temporary volunteers, could not maintain a Jones Act claim against the organizer. 644 F.Supp. at 1470-71. Although this case is not binding on this Court, it is distinguishable. The <em>Heath court </em>found difficulty in establishing that there was an employer-employee relationship with the program organizer. <em>Id. </em>at 1469. The <em>Heath </em>court found it significant that the volunteers were not engaged for work purposes on ASTA\u2019s behalf; that the volunteers actually paid ASTA for the privilege of participation in the sailing event; that ASTA had no \u201cmeaningful power of dismissal over the trainees once the cruise began\u201d; and that the volunteers were given considerable discretion in selecting what they wanted to do on the ship. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">However, the court in <em>Heath </em>also noted that \u201can unpaid temporary crew person may indeed qualify as an employee for Jones Act purposes____\u201d <em>Id. </em>And while the defendants in <em>Heath </em>argued that the crew not being compensated was a determinative factor, the court found this approach to be \u201ctoo parochial a view.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1468. The court went on further to state that \u201c[w]age payment is not a <em>sine qua non </em>for qualification as an employee under the common law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the <em>Heath </em>court provided the four elements that it considers in making this type of status determination: (1) the selection and engagement of the putative employee; (2) the situation vis-a-vis payment; (3) the situs of the power of dismissal; and (4) the situs of control over on-the-job conduct. <em>Id. </em>Of the four elements, the court regarded \u201cpayment of wages [ ] the least important.\u201d <em>Id. See also Petition of Read, </em>224 F.Supp. 241 (S.D.Fla.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">The factors above were derived from the law of agency. In that context, \u201c[cjonsideration is not necessary to create the relation of principal and agent and it is not necessary in the case of master and servant.\u201d <em>Read </em>at 245, <em>citing </em>Restatement (Second) Agency 225 at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">Graham was in a different position fi\u2019om the plaintiffs in <em>Heath </em>because he was at the disposal of Brazil. Not only did Brazil select Graham, and have the power to dismiss, but he also had the authority to control his on-the-job conduct. These controls weigh in favor of establishing an employment status between Graham and Brazil.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-14\">Finally, a case that involved the question of \u201cseamen\u201d status <em>Complaint of Falkiner, </em>716 F.Supp. 895 (E.D.Va.1988) is also distinguishable. In <em>Falkiner, </em>the court found that volunteer cannoneers who were injured aboard a yacht during a mock pirate battle during a festival, were not seamen for Jones Act purposes. 716 F.Supp. at 903. The injured parties submitted for decision the issue of their status as seamen within the purview of the Jones Act. <em>Id. </em>at 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-15\">The <em>Falkiner </em>court found significant the following: that the FalHners, who were the owners of the vessel on which the claimants were injured, did not select the claimants to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>participate in the mock battle; that the Falkiners did not pay the claimants\u2019 wages; that the claimants and the Falkiners were jointly participating in the event; that the Falkiners never exercised exclusive control over the claimants as cannoneers; and that the claimants were not performing a service normally provided by the crew. <em>Id. </em>at 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">The <em>Falkiner </em>court concluded that under these circumstances, the claimants were not seamen for Jones Act purposes. Again, the compensation factor was only one of several factors that the court weighed and was by no means the sole or even the predominant consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">In <em>Falkiner, </em>the court relied heavily on the fact that the cannoneers were not \u201cperforming some type of work typically performed by the [vessel\u2019s] crew.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 904. In the case at hand, Graham was at all times performing \u201ctypical\u201d crew work, including assisting the skipper as his mate.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">The duration of time aboard a vessel is not enough, standing alone, to determine status as a seaman under the Jones Act. The Supreme Court has expressly rejected what it referred to as the \u201cvoyage\u201d test, that is that anyone working on board a vessel for the duration of a \u201cvoyage\u201d in furtherance of the vessel\u2019s mission has the necessary employment-related connection to qualify as a seaman. <em>Chandris, </em>\u2014 U.S. at---, 115 S.Ct. at 2184-85. Instead the court has endorsed a \u201cstatus-based\u201d standard stressing that the seaman status belongs to \u201cthose maritime workers who form the ship\u2019s company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014\u2014, 115 S.Ct. at 2186.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">Thus, under the circumstances, there is a genuine issue .of material fact as to whether Graham had a connection to The Ambrose that was substantial in duration and nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">\n<em>Motion for Leave to Amend</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">The district court denied Graham\u2019s motion for leave to amend finding that the amendment would be futile. The proposed amendment was offered six months after the first amendment to his answer, and added the Jones Act claim. The district court found that \u201cabsent evidence that Graham was working aboard The Ambrose in a more or less permanent status in an employment-related position, he cannot maintain an action under the Jones Act.\u201d Because we find that there is a question of fact regarding Graham\u2019s seaman status that could not be decided by summary adjudication, we also find that the district court erred in denying Graham\u2019s motion to amend his answer on the ground that it was futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">Reversed and remanded for further consideration consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b943-8\"> Appellant previously conceded that summary judgment was appropriate in favor of Mount Diablo Silverado Council. Therefore, we clarify that this opinion AFFIRMS as to Appellee Mount Diablo Silverado Council, and REVERSES only as to Explorer/Sea Scout Post 248.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b946-14\">GOODWIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AzG\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b946-15\">I dissent because I do not believe Congress intended by the Jones Act to create access to insurance for catastrophic injuries suffered by hobby sailors who, from time to time, venture onto navigable waters without pay, for their own benefit, or, for the benefit of others they choose as objects of their bounty and good will.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-16\">The statute provides that \u201c[a]ny seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may ... maintain an action for damages at law ...\u201d 46 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 688. The injured party must prove three facts: 1) personal injury; 2) seaman status; and 3) that the injury arose in the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-17\">The majority discusses two discrete status requirements together: course of employment, and the occupational category of seaman, as if there were a single inquiry the jury could answer with a single yes or no. The experienced district judge looked at the statute, the more or less undisputed facts of the case, and the few appellate decisions available on the definition of \u201cseaman\u201d and granted summary judgment, thereby keeping the policy question in this ease from going to the jury at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-18\">A jury is too blunt an instrument to answer a complex question of legal policy (mixed law and fact) with a simple yes or no, although it has become more or less traditional to allow jurors to do so in worker compensation and product liability cases. In such cases, appellate review tends to be reduced to an audit of the judge\u2019s instructions, and if they pass muster, almost any award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>the jury sees fit to make will stand immune from further review. U.S. Const, amend. VII, and cases too numerous to rehearse in a dissent. But the aura that surrounds jury verdicts which make public policy in personal injury cases is a good reason for the careful and sensitive use of summary judgment where there are no real facts for a jury to decide. This case is a perfect example, because of the horrifying injury suffered by the plaintiff, of the adage that if the case goes to the jury, the only question it will actually decide will be the number of digits to place after the dollar sign.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\">I do not believe that a reasonable jury can make Graham a seaman, by saying in a verdict that he was one. Nor do I believe a jury can, by saying he was working as an employee of the ship when he was injured, make him an employee. He took instructions from the master of the vessel, just as amateur team athletes take orders from a coach. These relationships are not called employment relationships, they are called sports, or hobbies, or recreation.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">The term \u201cseaman\u201d is a term of art and is not defined by the Jones Act. The Supreme Court has said that \u201ca seaman is a mariner of any degree, one who lives his life upon the sea.\u201d <em>Warner v. Goltra, </em>293 U.S. 155, 157, 55 S.Ct. 46, 47, 79 L.Ed. 254 (1934). The Supreme Court has also held that Congress intended its language to mean what it meant at the time the Jones Act was passed in 1920. <em>McDermott International, Inc. v. Wilander, </em>498 U.S. 337, 342, 111 S.Ct. 807, 810-11, 112 L.Ed.2d 866 (1991) quoting <em>Morissette v. U.S., </em>342 U.S. 246, 263, 72 S.Ct. 240, 249-50, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">Seaman status is a mixed question of law and fact and may be determined by summary judgment in appropriate circumstances. <em>McDermott International, Inc. v. Wilander, </em>498 U.S. 337, 356, 111 S.Ct. 807, 818, 112 L.Ed.2d 866 (1991); <em>Papai v. Harbor Tug and Barge Co., </em>67 F.3d 203, 205 (9th Cir. 1995). Judges prefer to send this kind of question to the jury when they can, because they are difficult questions, and appellate courts have encouraged them to be sent to juries. But lines do have to be drawn, or all serious injury cases would go to juries, and that is not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">The test for seaman status was recently reformulated by the Supreme Court and is correctly cited by the majority opinion. <em>Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 115 S.Ct. 2172, 132 L.Ed.2d 314 (1995). The first part of the test, that to be a seaman, an employee must contribute to the function of the, vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission, is not a material question in this case. The plaintiff clearly contributed to the function of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">The second part of the test requires that a seaman have a \u201cconnection to a vessel in navigation ... that is substantial in terms of both its duration and nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 115 S.Ct. at 2190. The purpose of this part of the test is to separate sea-based maritime employees from \u201cworkers who have only a transitory or sporadic connection to a vessel in navigation, and therefore whose employment does not regularly expose them to the perils of the sea.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">We have interpreted the <em>Chandris </em>test to require a fact-specific examination encompassing the totality of the injured person\u2019s employment circumstances. <em>Papai v. Harbor Tug and Barge Company, </em>67 F.3d 203, 206 (9th Cir.1995). <em>Papai </em>is not particularly helpful in today\u2019s case because <em>Papai </em>does not involve a recreational-volunteer fact pattern, but rather seeks to explain how to apply <em>Chandris </em>to union workers, like welders and machinists who may come aboard and work for varying amounts of time on different vessels, whether they are at anchor, dockside, or under way.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">Here, Graham had only a temporary, sporadic connection to The Ambrose. Without even addressing whether Graham was an employee within the meaning of the phrase \u201cemployment related connection to a vessel in navigation\u201d under the statute, he does not appear to meet the \u201cduration and nature\u201d part of the seaman test. No part of his livelihood was earned at sea, although there are a few cases holding that fact not controlling. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b947-16\">Nothing in <em>Wilander </em>or <em>Chandris </em>or the 9th Circuit case law promotes extending to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>jurors the power to define recreational boaters as seaman. The earning of wages is not always necessary to be a seaman, but there is a difference between a workaway (one who works for passage), or a \u201cshares\u201d fisherman (who labors for a percentage of the catch), and a volunteer recreational boater. If vocational status is the key, and if the definition of seamen is further limited by the duration of one\u2019s connection to the vessel, it is unclear how the benediction of a jury can qualify this unfortunate accident victim as a seaman.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\"><em>Chandris </em>cites with approval the 5th Circuit rule that approximately 30% of the worker\u2019s time should be spent in connection with the vessel to trigger the protection of seaman status. <em>Chandris, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 115 S.Ct. at 2191. This figure is to serve as no more than a \u201cguideline\u201d <em>Id., </em>but guidelines should guide somewhere. The plaintiffs waterborne activities were more like those of a weekend yachtsman than those of a mariner earning his bread, maintenance and cure, and health insurance by his toil aboard ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">One reported district court case that has come down since <em>Chandris </em>declined to extend seaman status to recreational boaters. <em>Hardesty v. Rossi, </em>1995 WL 688416 (D.Md.). Plaintiff, aboard her friend\u2019s boat for a weekend sailing trip, failed both prongs of the <em>Chandris </em>test, having neither the employment-related connection to the vessel, nor the durational requirement. The court specifically found that she was a full-time employee of a land-based clinic, and her expected stay aboard the vessel was less than two days.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">Another <em>posb-Chandris </em>district court case failed to extend seaman status to a worker who did not spend 30% of his time aboard the vessel. <em>Nix v. Sub Sea International, Inc., </em>1995 WL 569245 (E.D.La.) (crane operator injured when walking between a lift barge and a drilling platform did not spend 30 percent of his time aboard a vessel and was not a seaman); <em>See also Dietrich v. U.S., </em>1995 WL 617577 (E.D.La.) (electrician\u2019s helper, aboard for a temporary, ten-day assignment did not have the necessary duration or type of activity required to be a seaman).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">One of the few cases that has extended seaman status to recreational boaters, and</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">relied on by the majority, is <em>Petition of Read, </em>224 F.Supp. 241 (S.D.Fla.1963). The district court in this case distinguished <em>Read </em>by noting that the plaintiff in <em>Read </em>was found to have been a full crew member and subject to the control of the defendant ship owners. <em>In re Boy Scouts of America, </em>875 F.Supp. 1391, 1396 citing <em>Heath v. American Sail Training Ass\u2019n, </em>644 F.Supp. 1459 (D.R.I.1986). However, both trial judges ruled in <em>Read </em>and in today\u2019s ease without the benefit of the language of <em>Chandris. Read </em>is inconsistent with <em>Chandris. </em>\u201cLack of long continued attachment to the vessel does not serve to deny [Read] the status of a seaman when he is injured while assigned to and performing normal crew service.\u201d <em>Read, </em>224 F.Supp. at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">While <em>Chandris </em>does not require \u201ccontinued attachment\u201d to a vessel it does require an attachment that is substantial both in its duration and nature. <em>Read </em>simply does not provide support for the conclusion that Graham\u2019s seaman status is a jury question. Furthermore, the district court relied on the language of <em>Heath </em>to distinguish <em>Read. </em>However, in <em>Heath, </em>the court presumed seaman status of the volunteer sailors and was analyzing only the \u201cin the course of employment\u201d requirement of the Jones Act. <em>Heath, </em>644 F.Supp. at 1468.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">The history of maintenance and cure, afforded by Admiralty law long before Congress enacted the Jones Act incorporating it, is inconsistent with the extension of Jones Act benefits to essentially recreational boaters. The obligation of maintenance and cure has its source in the employment relationship and the wardship of Admiralty. <em>Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, </em>287 U.S. 367, 371, 53 S.Ct. 173, 174, 77 L.Ed. 368 (1932); <em>Gardiner v. Sea-Land Service, Inc., </em>786 F.2d 943 (9th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied </em>479 U.S. 924, 107 S.Ct. 331, 93 L.Ed.2d 303 (1986). Traditionally, maintenance and cure served three purposes: (1) to protect the poor and improvident seaman while ill in foreign ports, (2) to encourage ship owners to protect the seaman\u2019s safety and health while in service, and (3) to induce employment in the merchant marine. <em>Gardiner, </em>786 F.2d at 946 paraphrasing <em>Vella v. Ford Motor Co., </em>421 U.S. 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>3-4, 95 S.Ct. 1381, 1382-83, 43 L.Ed.2d 682 (1975). For all of the above reasons, I believe the district court correctly held that Graham was not a seaman, and was not injured in the course of employment, two critical qualifications for Jones Act coverage. I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
