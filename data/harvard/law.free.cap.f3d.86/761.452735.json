Long is serving a life sentence at the Iowa State Penitentiary (ISP) for the brutal murder of a woman. <em>See Long v. Brewer, </em>253 N.W.2d 549, 551 (Iowa 1977). He filed this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1994) lawsuit against officials of the Iowa Department of Corrections seeking, among other things, treatment for a gender-identity disorder and damages for the defendants\u2019 alleged deliberate indifference to his gender-identity disorder. Based on the evidence introduced during a one-day bench trial, the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held that (1) the extent of Long\u2019s gender-identity disorder does not constitute a seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>ous medical need, (2) even if Long has a serious medical need, the defendants were not deliberately indifferent to that need, and (3) the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity from Long\u2019s claim for damages. <em>Long v. Nix, </em>877 F.Supp. 1358, 1365-67 (S.D.Iowa 1995). Long timely appeals from the judgment of the District Court, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Long began his stay at ISP in 1964. He arrived in full drag, but initially prison officials refused to let him wear women\u2019s clothes. Following a hunger strike that began shortly after his arrival, Long was allowed to wear women\u2019s clothes and make-up on a regular basis. This privilege, however, was revoked in 1981 after a member of the Iowa Parole Board complained to prison officials about Long\u2019s attire. Since 1981 Long repeatedly has sought permission to wear women\u2019s clothing and make-up. ISP officials have denied his request each time. He also has requested hormone therapy and sex-change surgery. Aside from these requests, however, Long has not sought, nor have prison health services employees ordered, any treatment for a gender-identity disorder. In fact, Long has repeatedly refused to cooperate with prison psychologists and psychiatrists over the past twenty years. <em>See Long, </em>877 F.Supp. at 1362; <em>see also </em>Program Review Committee Pre-Parole Evaluation (Feb. 3, 1978); Psychiatric Consultation (Apr. 24, 1981); Psychiatric Evaluation (Feb. 15, 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">As the District Court found, Long\u2019s 1990 evaluation was unproductive because Long presented himself in a \u201chostile and belligerent,\u201d \u201cverbally abusive and abrasive manner.\u201d <em>Long, </em>877 F.Supp. at 1362. During his 1991 psychological evaluation, all Long requested was \u201cwhat he deserves\u201d: a transfer from ISP to a less structured setting. <em>Id. </em>The psychologist concluded that \u201c[a]t this point in time there are no psychological or psychiatric issues that need to be addressed.\u201d Psychological Evaluation (Jan. 30, 1991). In 1992, Long \u201cindicated no mental health issues or problems,\u201d and the psychologist concluded that there were no psychological issues that needed to be addressed. Psychological Evaluation (Jan. 29, 1992). In 1993, Long refused to participate in a psychological interview and \u201cno meaningful psychological report\u201d was submitted. <em>Long, </em>877 F.Supp. at 1362. In contrast to Long\u2019s behavior, the record shows that prison officials have been responsive to Long\u2019s requests for treatment when they were reasonable. In 1982, for example, Long requested \u201ctreatment and evaluation\u201d at the Iowa State Medical Facility (ISMF). ISMF Referral (Feb. 12, 1982). His request was granted, and he was transferred to ISMF. Later that same year he was transferred at his own request to a Missouri maximum security prison where he was allowed to wear women\u2019s clothing at all times. In 1986 he returned to ISP. His complaints to a member of the medical staff at that time \u201ccenter[ed] around the fact that he will not be allowed to have the numerous articles of female clothing which he owns.\u201d Psychiatric Evaluation (Feb. 15, 1986). Long, however, never has shown a continued interest in psychiatric evaluation or treatment either for depression or his gender-identity disorder. \u201cIn 1994, Long [again] declined to be interviewed for his annual psychological evaluation. Long explained that he is apprehensive about meeting with ISP staff members because they are unsympathetic and because he thinks it is unlikely that he will be paroled.\u201d <em>Long, </em>877 F.Supp. at 1362.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">At trial, Dr. Walter O. Bockting, Ph.D., testified that Long has developed an intense gender dysphoria. His report diagnosed Long as suffering from a gender-identity disorder not otherwise specified, a sexual disorder not otherwise specified, and an antisocial-personality disorder. Dr. Bockting concluded .that Long has other emotional problems in addition to his gender-identity disorder, stating that tests indicated that Long \u201cmay be demanding, rebellious, hostile, aggressive, antisocial, impulsive, exhibitionistic, and promiscuous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Dr. Bockting suggested that these traits result from the dysfunctional family setting in which Long was raised. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">Several of the psychologists and psychiatrists that had worked with Long at ISP also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>testified at trial. The state\u2019s principal expert witness was Dr. Paul W. Loeffelholz, M.D. For the most part, Dr. Loeffelholz did not disagree with Dr. Bockting\u2019s diagnoses. As the District Court noted, however, the diagnoses were in conflict on some points. <em>See id. </em>at 1365-66. The main disagreement between the experts was whether Long\u2019s gender-identity disorder is his predominate psychiatric condition. Dr. Bockting stated that Long\u2019s primary psychiatric condition is his gender-identity disorder. Dr. Loeffelholz testified that Long\u2019s gender-identity disorder is intermittent and generally exhibited when Long is under stress, while his \u201cprimary psychological problem is his serious antisocial and manipulative behavior.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1363. At bottom, the difference in diagnoses turns on whether Long primarily wants to wear women\u2019s clothing to achieve sexual arousal or to satisfy his desire to be a woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Despite his opinion that Long\u2019s gender-identity disorder is Long\u2019s principal condition, Dr. Bockting admitted that he believes that Long wears women\u2019s clothing both to express his feminine identity and for sexual stimulation. Dr. Bockting concluded that, because Long experiences some arousal, he suffers in part from paraphilia (a sexual attraction to an unusual subject or object) and transvestic fetishism (sexual arousal from cross-dressing). As a result, Dr. Bockting stated that Long \u201cdoes not meet the minimal requirements that would make him eligible\u201d for hormone therapy or sex-change surgery. <em>Id. </em>at 1362. The experts thus agreed that Long is not a transsexual.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">In contradistinction to their general agreement on the diagnosis, the experts flatly disagreed about the appropriate treatment for Long\u2019s condition. Dr. Bockting recommended psychotherapy for Long\u2019s gender-identity disorder combined with tranquilizers for the depression and anxiety that has resulted from his inability to wear women\u2019s clothes. If the tranquilizers prove to be ineffective, Dr. Bockting recommended that Long be given limited opportunities to wear women\u2019s clothes to relieve his anxiety. Dr. Loeffelholz disagreed and noted that Long has not requested treatment for his anxiety or depression nor has he fully cooperated with prison psychologists so that the staff could properly respond to his anxiety or depression, let alone his gender-identity disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">The District Court found that Dr. Loeffelholz had refused to prescribe tranquilizers \u201c[i]n spite of Dr. Boekting\u2019s recommendation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1363. The District Court nonetheless found that Dr. Loeffelholz\u2019s refusal was based on a difference in professional judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 1363, 1366. As a result, the court concluded that \u201c[Dr.] Loeffelholz did not act with deliberate indifference to Long\u2019s allegedly serious medical need\u201d and that the other defendants \u201cwere justified in relying on the opinions of medical staff.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">Long argues, among other things, that the District Court erred when it held that his gender-identity disorder does not constitute a serious medical need and that the defendants were not deliberately indifferent to his gender-identity disorder.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, Long argues that both the District Court\u2019s findings of fact and its conclusions of law are subject to de novo review \u201cin light of the societal values underlying the relevant legal concepts.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 2 (citing <em>Falls v. Nesbitt, </em>966 F.2d 375, 377 (8th Cir. 1992)). We first address the standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-14\">In <em>Nesbitt, </em>we stated that \u201c[m]ixed questions of law and fact that require the consideration of legal concepts and involve the exercise of judgment about the values underlying legal principles are reviewable de novo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While we believe that the term \u201cmixed question of law and fact\u201d is confusing and best discarded, <em>Nesbitt </em>cannot be read to permit the de novo review of the factual findings of a district court. First, in <em>Nesbitt, </em>the \u201coperative facts\u201d were \u201cnot in dispute.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 376. Second, we began our discussion of the standard of review by stating that \u201c[t]he trial judge\u2019s findings of fact will not be set aside unless they are found to be \u2018clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377 (quoting Fed. R. Civ.P. 52(a)). The language cited by Long thus stands for the unremarkable proposition that a legal conclusion drawn from established facts is subject to de novo review. Despite Long\u2019s invitation, we decline to subject the District Court\u2019s findings of fact in this ease to de novo review. As usual, we review the factual findings of the District Court for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. See, e.g., <em>Little Rock School Dist. v. Pulaski County Special School Dist., #1, </em>83 F.3d 1013, 1017 (8th Cir.1996); <em>Williams v. Carter, </em>76 F.3d 199, 200 (8th Cir.1996) (per curiam); see also <em>Ornelas v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 1663, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996) (historical facts reviewed \u201conly for clear error\u201d but legal conclusions such as \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d and \u201cprobable cause\u201d reviewed de novo). After reviewing the trial transcript and the documentary evidence, we conclude that the relevant factual findings of the District Court, as outlined above, are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Turning to the merits of Long\u2019s legal arguments, we conclude that he failed to prove that the prison officials acted with deliberate indifference. Deliberate indifference to the serious medical needs of a prisoner constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 102-03, 97 S. Ct. 285, 290, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), and the Constitution prohibits state governments from inflicting such punishments, <em>Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, </em>329 U.S. 459, 463, 67 S.Ct. 374, 376, 91 L.Ed. 422 (1947) (stating that Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment incorporates Eighth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against cruel and unusual punishment). We assume without deciding that Long\u2019s gender-identity disorder constitutes a serious medical need for the purposes of this ease.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\"> \u201cA prison official exhibits deliberate indifference when the official actually \u2018knows of and disregards\u2019 a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Knox, </em>47 F.3d 966, 968 (8th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, -, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1977, 1979, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994)). Thus, the failure to treat a medical condition does not constitute punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment unless prison officials knew that the condition created an excessive risk to the inmate\u2019s health and then failed to act on that knowledge. Moreover, nothing in the Eighth Amendment prevents prison doctors from exercising their independent medical judgment. <em>White v. Farrier, </em>849 F.2d 322, 327 (8th Cir.1988). Prisoners do not have a constitutional right to any particular type of treatment. <em>See id. </em>at 327-28. Prison officials do not violate the Eighth Amendment when, in the exercise of their professional judgment, they refuse to implement a prisoner\u2019s requested course of treatment. <em>Kayser v. Caspari, </em>16 F.3d 280, 281 (8th Cir.1994); <em>Taylor v. Turner, </em>884 F.2d 1088, 1090 (8th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">The record indicates that Dr. Loeffelholz and other members of the prison medical staff were aware of Long\u2019s psychological problems. The record, however, does not show any deliberate indifference on the part of the prison officials. Long\u2019s expert in this case, Dr. Bockting, recommended an initial course of treatment that consisted of psychotherapy and tranquilizers. Dr. Loeffelholz did not reject psychotherapy, only the use of tranquilizers. In fact, the record is full of evidence of the attempts of the prison medical staff to evaluate Long\u2019s psychological problems and Long\u2019s refusal to cooperate. In these circumstances, Long has failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>prove that Dr. Loeffelholz<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was deliberately indifferent to Long\u2019s gender-identity disorder, the only serious medical need alleged in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">To the extent that Long\u2019s claim is based on the prison officials\u2019 failure to provide tranquilizers, it fails because it is merely a dispute over the course of treatment. The prison officials\u2019 decision not to treat Long with tranquilizers is \u201ca classic example of a matter for medical judgment\u201d that does not rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See Gamble, </em>429 U.S. at 107, 97 S.Ct. at 293. To the extent that Long\u2019s claim is based on the prison officials\u2019 failure to provide psychotherapy, it fails because Long consistently has refused psychological help. It is perhaps possible that Long would benefit from some form of therapy. Long, however, has resisted the attempts of Iowa prison officials to provide psychological evaluation, treatment, and therapy over the past twenty years. Even Dr. Boekting noted that \u201cLong\u2019s profile may be \u2018highly resistant to psychological treatment.\u2019\u201d <em>Long, </em>877 F.Supp. at 1362. We reject Long\u2019s contention that the Eighth Amendment requires the Iowa Department of Corrections to provide Long with a \u201csensitive\u201d psychotherapist trained in gender-identity issues. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 14, 15. The record shows that the ISP medical staff is competent to diagnose inmates\u2019 medical problems and to order treatment or further evaluation by other medical professionals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The District Court correctly stated that \u201c[i]n essence, Long demands the privilege of cross dressing so that he can exist in the prison on his own terms, rather than in conformity with prison regulations.\u201d <em>Long, </em>877 F.Supp. at 1366. Having no apparent interest in overcoming his gender-identity disorder, Long has frustrated the attempts of prison doctors to treat that disorder by his consistent refusal of psychological evaluation over the past twenty years. In these circumstances, the District Court unquestionably was correct when it held that Long failed to prove that the defendant prison officials have been deliberately indifferent to his gender-identity disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-17\">. The Honorable Celeste F. Bremer, United States Magistrate Judge for the Southern District of Iowa. The case was tried before Magistrate Judge Bremer by consent of the parties pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-6\">. Because we agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the prison officials did not act with deliberate indifference to Long's gender-identity disorder, we need not and do not address his arguments regarding the prison officials\u2019 entitlement to qualified immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b845-11\">. A psychological disorder may constitute a serious medical need. <em>White v. Farrier, </em>849 F.2d 322, 325 (8th Cir.1988). We have held that transsexualism is a serious medical need, <em>id.., </em>though that holding may be in doubt in light of <em>Farmer v. </em>Brennan,-U.S.-, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), and subsequent cases. It is undisputed in this case, however, that Long is not a transsexual, and thus <em>White </em>does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>control the resolution of whether Long's gender-identity disorder is a serious medical need.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\">. We also agree with the District Court's conclusion, <em>Long, </em>877 F.Supp. at 1366, that the other defendants were entitled to rely on the opinions of the medical staff when refusing Long\u2019s requests to cross-dress. See <em>Heidemann v. Rother, </em>84 F.3d 1021, 1029 (8th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b846-8\">. In his Reply Brief, Long alleges that his anxiety and depression constitute independent serious medical needs and that cross-dressing is the appropriate treatment for these conditions. Reply Brief at 7. This argument is not properly before us, having been raised for the first time in Long's Reply Brief. <em>See United States v. Darden, </em>70 F.3d 1507, 1549 n. 18 (8th Cir.1995), <em>cert. </em>denied, U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 1449, 134 L.Ed.2d 569 (1996). The only serious psychological need referred to in Long's amended complaint, and the alleged serious medical need on which the case was tried, is his gender-identily disorder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b846-28\">. ISP employs three full-time psychologists. The psychologists may refer a prisoner to the prison system\u2019s 46-bed licensed psychiatric hospital or to outside facilities and specialists for further evaluation and treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
