The district court held that it lacked jurisdiction because the petition was unauthorized. It also held that, lacking jurisdiction, it could not evaluate Lucky\u2019s mental competence to waive his right to federal habeas review. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-14\">Lucky was convicted and sentenced to death in 1982. The California Supreme Court upheld the conviction and sentence in 1988. <em>See People v. Lucky, </em>45 Cal.3d 259, 247 Cal.Rptr. 1, 753 P.2d 1052 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-15\">On November 30, 1990, Lucky\u2019s counsel, Monica Knox, filed a \u201cMotion to Schedule Hearing on Sanity and Competency\u201d in the Los Angeles Superior Court. In an affidavit accompanying the motion, she stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-16\">During October and November 1990, I attempted to visit Mr. Lucky three times at San Quentin; I have been advised by prison guards that Mr. Lucky refuses to come out of his cell to meet with me; prior to October 1990, Mr. Lucky had never refused to meet with me ... I have no reason to believe that his recent refusal to come out of his cell to meet with me is the result of any dissatisfaction with [his] representation ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-17\">On November 6, 1990, I wrote to Mr. Lucky explaining my attempts to visit him; I asked him to telephone or write me and let me know what was going on; I have not heard from him; I also sent him documents, requesting him to sign them and return them to me and explaining the importance of the documents to further legal proceedings; I have not heard from Mr. Lucky and have not received any documents back ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-18\">The superior court denied the motion for a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-19\">Lucky\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed on February 1, 1991. In an affidavit accompanying the petition, Knox stated that she was verifying the petition on Lucky\u2019s behalf because \u201c(1) he is incarcerated in Marin County at San Quentin State Prison; (2) of the emergency nature of this petition for writ of habeas corpus and application for issuance of a writ staying execution of his sentence; and (3) these matters are more within my knowledge than his.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-20\">Litigation proceeded over the next four years. In June 1995, the district court requested briefing on the relevance of Lucky\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>present mental competence. In her Memorandum of Points and Authorities, Lucky\u2019s attorney stated that she had verified Lucky\u2019s federal habeas petition \u201cfor the very reason that petitioner refused.\u201d In its reply brief filed on July 7, 1995, the government then argued for the first time that Lucky\u2019s habeas petition was unauthorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">In an affidavit dated July 14, 1995, Knox stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-6\">Petitioner had a February 8th [1991] execution date; he had not expressed in any way a desire to be executed, and I felt ethically bound to try to obtain a stay of his execution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-7\">When I could not get petitioner to sign the necessary papers, I verified the petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">At the July 17, 1995, hearing on whether the district court had jurisdiction over the petition, Knox stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1005-9\">We have a petitioner who was refusing to come out and meet with me ... refusing to answer my mail, and refusing to sign papers that I would send to him for signature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-10\">On July 27, 1995, the district court dismissed the petition \u201cas unauthorized.\u201d Lucky immediately filed a motion for reconsideration. On August 31, 1995, Lucky filed an affidavit stating that \u201cMs. Knox is fully authorized to file and pursue this litigation or any other challenging my death judgment.\u201d The district court denied the motion for reconsideration on September 26,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-12\">A denial of a petition for habeas corpus is reviewed de novo. <em>Riley v. Deeds, </em>56 F.3d 1117, 1119 (9th Cir.1995). We hold that the same standard applies to a summary dismissal of a petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-13\">A federal habeas petition can be signed and verified by \u201csomeone acting in [the petitioner\u2019s] behalf.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242; <em>see also </em>Advisory Committee Note on Rule 2(c) (\u201cAs required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242, the petition must be signed and sworn to by the petitioner (or <em>someone acting in his behalf)\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). Thus, a habeas petitioner\u2019s attorney can sign and verify the petition for the petitioner. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, there is a presumption that a petitioner has been fully informed of, and has consented to, claims raised in the petition. <em>Deutscher v. Angelone, </em>16 F.3d 981, 984 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-16\">Lucky\u2019s actions in October and November of 1990 were sufficient to rebut this presumption. The lack of a signature alone is not determinative. <em>See Hendricks v. Vasquez, </em>908 F.2d 490, 491 (9th Cir.1990) (the district court may disregard petitioner\u2019s failure to sign and verify petition). But here there was more than a failure to sign. Knox\u2019s affidavit to the district court indicated that she verified the petition on Lucky\u2019s behalf because of the emergency nature of the petition and her particular knowledge of the underlying facts. Knox conceded in the <em>affidavit </em>signed four years later, however, that she actually signed the petition because she could not get Lucky to meet with her or sign the petition. We conclude that Lucky\u2019s repeated failures to respond to his attorney in any way, combined with his lack of verification and signature, rebutted the presumption that he consented to the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-17\">The burden then shifted to Lucky to demonstrate that the petition was, in fact, authorized. He met this burden by filing the affidavit stating that his attorney was \u201cfully authorized to file and pursue\u201d the litigation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-18\">We reject the government\u2019s argument that Lucky\u2019s authorization came too late, and that \u201cthe crucial issue is whether the Petition was authorized <em>at the time of filing.\u201d </em>After the government rebuts the presumption of authorization, the petitioner must simply demonstrate that the petition is presently authorized. The petitioner need not also prove that the petition was authorized at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>of filing, for at the time of filing, the presumption of authorization is in effect. Lucky did not have the burden to provide proof of authorization beyond his attorney\u2019s verification until July 1995, when the government overcame the presumption that Lucky had consented to his attorney\u2019s actions. Lucky then provided affirmative proof in the form of his affidavit that he authorized the petition. That was sufficient. The district court had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Since we conclude that Lucky authorized the petition, we need not consider the decision of the district court that it lacked jurisdiction to consider whether Lucky was mentally competent to waive his right to federal habeas review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">We REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">. The government challenges the admissibility of Lucky's affidavit. It notes that the affidavit was filed with Lucky\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and that the motion is not part of this appeal because Lucky failed to file an amended notice of appeal under Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(4). The government is correct, but \u201cin the interest of expediting decision\u201d of this appeal, we will overlook Lucky\u2019s procedural error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
