The district court also awarded the plaintiffs one hundred dollars in nominal damages against the state court judge in both his individual and official capacities. For the reasons that follow, we REVERSE the damages judgment, VACATE the permanent injunction, and REMAND with instructions to enter judgment for the state court judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-24\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-25\">Concerned Citizens for a Caring Family Court, Inc. (\u201cCCCFC\u201d), one of the named plaintiffs in this case, was organized as a nonprofit organization under Aabama law and was incorporated in June of 1990; plaintiff Glynnie B. Simmons is one of the founders of CCCFC. Judge Paul S. Conger, Jr., the defendant, was an Aabama Circuit Court Judge in the Sixth Judicial District in Tuscaloosa County until January of 1995, at which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>time his term of office ended.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judge Conger\u2019s primary duties were as a domestic relations and juvenile court judge, although he had the general power of an Alabama circuit judge to hear other matters assigned to him. All domestic relations cases in Alabama are nonjury, and, as a general matter, juvenile proceedings before the family court are closed to spectators. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 12-15-65(a) (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">Some background information on CCCFC is helpful to place the events at issue in this case in the proper context. CCCFC allegedly was formed \u201cto focus attention on the laws and procedures governing the Juvenile and Family Courts and to promote constructive change to enable the residents to be served by a judicial system that is fair and just in its decisions and efficient and economical in its operations.\u201d Rl-11, Exh. E at 1. Most, if not all, of the founding principals in CCCFC had been litigants in Judge Conger\u2019s court or had a child or close relative who had been a litigant in Judge Conger\u2019s court. The record indicates that these individuals were unhappy about the outcome of their proceedings and generally disapproved of his decisions and his courtroom demeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-9\">Simmons testified at trial that her grievance with Judge Conger was personal and stemmed from her disagreement with Judge Conger\u2019s decision in a case involving her daughter.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In order to achieve its stated goals, CCCFC operated what Simmons referred to as a \u201ccourt monitoring program.\u201d R2-30-53. As part of this program, CCCFC members went to court to lend \u201cmoral support\u201d to family court litigants, particularly first-time litigants. <em>Id. </em>at 54. Interestingly, none of the \u201cinformation\u201d that allegedly was collected in these monitoring sessions was ever written down, and Judge Conger\u2019s court was the only one that was ever monitored. Not only did CCCFC monitor Judge Conger\u2019s court, but also it initiated proceedings against him before both the Alabama Judicial Inquiry Commission and the Alabama Court of the Judiciary; its complaints were based on his rulings, courtroom demeanor, and alleged practice of closing certain family court hearings to the public. Both of these actions were dismissed as being without merit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nonetheless, they helped further the considerable animosity that already existed between Judge Conger and the members of CCCFC.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1162-10\">The conduct at issue in this case occurred on April 15, 1991, during a hearing that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>Judge Conger held in a divorce and child custody case, <em>Gosa v. Gosa, </em>Civil Action No. DR90-374. Simmons attended this hearing as a spectator and sat through the morning session without incident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Upon resumption of the hearing after lunch, counsel for Wilmon Gosa addressed the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-5\">MR. NOLEN [counsel for Mr. Gosa]: Your Honor, if I may at this point, the great majority of the allegations that we have heard this morning were not in the pleadings and are certainly surprising to us. In light of that, we would ask that only the parties and counsel and whatever witness is testifying be allowed in court at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-6\">THE COURT: You are asking for Mrs. Simmons to be excused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-7\">MR. NOLEN: Yes, sir, we are.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-8\">THE COURT: Mrs. Simmons, at the request of the Defendant, I will ask you to please excuse yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-9\">MRS. SIMMONS: You are asking me to leave?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-10\">THE COURT: Yes, ma\u2019am, I sure am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-11\">MRS. SIMMONS: I want that on the record that you are\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-12\">THE COURT: The counsel for the Defendant, Mr. Richard Nolen, has asked that Mrs. Simmons, who is a member of Concerned Citizens, be asked to leave this courtroom because his client objects to her presence in the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-13\">MRS. SIMMONS: I am just monitoring the Court because every citizen has a right to sit in the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-14\">MR. NOLEN: Well, ma\u2019am, on behalf of my client, I would like to ask you to leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-15\">MRS. SIMMONS: I will leave if the Judge makes it official. I will not leave on your asking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-16\">THE COURT: Yes, ma\u2019am, I am asking you to leave. At the request of the Defendant, I am asking you to leave, please, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-17\">MRS. SIMMONS: I would like to have a notarized statement to that effect. I will pick it up next week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-18\">THE COURT: Yes ma\u2019am. We will see about that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1163-19\">(Whereupon, Mrs. Simmons exits the courtroom).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1163-20\">Rl-11, Exh. A at 4-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-21\">Simmons claims that she was in court that day to lend moral support to Marcia Gosa. Significantly, after Simmons left the courtroom, Marcia Gosa\u2019s lawyer stated that neither he nor his client had any problem with her being asked to leave the courtroom. Therefore, both sides were in favor of Simmons being removed from the courtroom for the afternoon session. The record indicates that Wilmon Gosa\u2019s lawyer likely wanted to have Simmons removed because Wilmon Gosa, who was on the witness stand at the time, began being questioned on cross-examination about alleged extramarital conduct and children possibly bom outside of the marriage. Judge Conger testified at trial that \u201c[i]f Mr. Gosa felt that the testimony there might threaten his job, economically that has a direct impact on his ability to support his children.\u201d R2-30-138.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-22\">On September 19, 1991, Simmons and CCCFC filed their complaint in district court in this case, in which they sought declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Simmons claimed that her exclusion from court in the <em>Gosa </em>proceeding, as well as what she called Judge Conger\u2019s \u201cpolicy and practice<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of excluding members of CCCFC and the general public from proceedings in his court,\u201d deprived her and CCCFC of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>access to judicial proceedings and association. Rl-1-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">Judge Conger answered that his exclusion of Simmons was done pursuant to section 12-21-9 of the Alabama Code, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae0\">In all civil cases sounding in damages involving the question of rape', assault with intent to ravish, seduction, divorce or any other case where the evidence is vulgar, obscene or related to the improper acts of the sexes and tends to debauch the morals of the young, <em>the presiding judge shall have the right, in his discretion and on his own motion, or on motion of plaintiff's or defendants or their attorneys, to hear and try the case after clearing the courtroom of all or any portion of the audience whose presence is not necessary.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">Ala.Code \u00a7 12-21-9 (1995) (emphasis added). The case proceeded to trial, and a one-day bench trial was held in the Northern District of Alabama on December 2, 1992. Almost twenty months later, the district court issued its Memorandum Opinion and Final Judgment and Permanent Injunction, both dated July 29, 1994. Although the district court expressly stated that it was avoiding the constitutional issues presented, it nonetheless found that Judge Conger had \u201cabused his discretion under federal common law and Title 12-21-9.\u201d Rl-23-9. Based on this finding, the district court permanently enjoined Judge Conger and his successors \u201cfrom excluding plaintiffs and members of the public from any divorce trial convened in the Sixth Judicial Circuit of Alabama in the absence of a prior judicial determination, based on factual findings, that their interests in attending the trials are outweighed by a specifically identified compelling state interest.\u201d Rl-24-1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-7\">In addition, the district court awarded Simmons and CCCFC one hundred dollars in nominal damages, recoverable from Judge Conger \u201cindividually and as Circuit Judge of the Sixth Judicial District of the State of Alabama.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. On appeal, Judge Conger raises three issues, whether: (1) federal common law can be created by a district judge to control attendance and procedures in a state court when there is a state statute that governs, and the court avoids addressing the federal constitutional issues; (2) the district court should have abstained from deciding a matter involving the discretionary decisions of a state court judge acting pursuant to a state statute, the constitutionality of which the plaintiffs did not challenge; and (3) this matter should be certified to the Alabama Supreme Court, in order for it to interpret section 12-21-9 of the Alabama Code, which guided Judge Conger\u2019s conduct in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-10\">The district court awarded both nominal damages and injunctive relief; these two issues will be addressed separately. On appeal, we review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo. Worthington v. United States, </em>21 F.3d 399, 400 (11th Cir.1994). The district court\u2019s application of the law to the facts also is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Massaro v. Mainlands Section 1 &amp; 2 Civic Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>3 F.3d 1472, 1475 (11th Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 56, 130 L.Ed.2d 15 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-13\">A. <em>Nominal Damages</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-14\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s award of damages under a clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>Davis v. Marsh, </em>807 F.2d 908, 913 (11th Cir.1987) (per curiam). In this case, the district court ordered Judge Conger to pay one hundred dollars in nominal damages. The damages were recoverable against him both in his individual and official capacities. The district court clearly erred in awarding damages against Judge Conger in his individual capacity because he is entitled to absolute judicial immunity from damages in this section 1983 case. It also erred in awarding damages against Judge Conger in his official capacity, given that such relief is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-15\">The Supreme Court has set forth a two-part test for determining when a judge is entitled to immunity from money damages liability when sued under section 1983. <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978). The first part of the test is whether the judge dealt with the plaintiff in a judicial capacity. <em>Id. </em>at 362, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>98 S.Ct. at 1107. If the judge was not dealing with the plaintiff in a judicial capacity, then there is no immunity. If the judge was dealing with the plaintiff in his judicial capacity, however, the second part of the test is whether the judge acted in the \u201c \u2018clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 98 S.Ct. at 1105 (quoting <em>Bradley v. Fisher, </em>80 U.S. (13 Wall.) 335, 351, 20 L.Ed. 646 (1872).</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">In this case, it is clear that Judge Conger was dealing with Simmons in his judicial capacity. The incident at issue occurred while Judge Conger was hearing a domestic relations case. He excluded Simmons from his courtroom during a proceeding that was properly before him, and he was acting in his official capacity in excluding her. Therefore, Judge Conger\u2019s actions satisfy the first part of the test for determining the applicability of judicial immunity. <em>See Rolleston v. Eldridge, </em>848 F.2d 163, 164 (11th Cir.1988); <em>Harris v. Deveaux, </em>780 F.2d 911, 914 (11th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">Furthermore, Judge Conger satisfies the second part of the <em>Stump </em>test. He clearly had jurisdiction over the <em>Gosa </em>matter, and there is no allegation to the contrary. Therefore, because Judge Conger\u2019s conduct at the <em>Gosa </em>hearing satisfies both prongs of the <em>Stump </em>test for judicial immunity from damages liability under section 1983, the district court\u2019s damages judgment against him in his individual capacity is reversed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As for the damages awarded against Judge Conger in his official capacity, this relief is barred by the sovereign immunity of his then employer, the State of Alabama. \u201c[A] suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit against the official\u2019s office,\u201d and, \u201c[a]s such, it is no different from a suit against the State itself.\u201d <em>Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2312, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (holding in a damages action that neither a state nor its officials acting in their official capacities are \u201cpersons\u201d subject to suit under section 1983). Therefore, the award of damages against Judge Conger in his official capacity is also reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-10\">B. <em>Permanent Injunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1165-11\">On appeal, the standard of review for the grant of a permanent injunction is abuse of discretion. <em>Centel Cable Television Co. v. Thos. J. White Dev. Corp., </em>902 F.2d 905, 910 (11th Cir.1990). Unlike a damages suit under section 1983, \u201cjudicial immunity is not a bar to prospective injunctive relief against a judicial officer acting in her judicial capacity.\u201d <em>Pulliam v. Allen, </em>466 U.S. 522, 541\u201442, 104 S.Ct. 1970, 1981, 80 L.Ed.2d 565 (1984). Simply because prospective injunctive relief is available against a judge in a section 1983 action, however, does not mean that such equitable relief is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-12\">In this case, Simmons and CCCFC allege that their First Amendment rights of access to judicial proceedings and association, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, were violated when Judge Conger excluded Simmons from the <em>Gosa </em>hearing. Judge Conger, in his answer to this lawsuit, explained that he was exercising his discretion under Alabama Code \u00a7 12-21-9, which by its terms permits him to do exactly what he did in this ease. Since he was acting pursuant to a state statute, logic dictates that Simmons and CCCFC\u2019s challenge in this case is not really to Judge Conger\u2019s actions, but rather to the constitutionality of section 12-21-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-13\">Simmons and CCCFC, however, repeatedly have emphasized, both in their briefs and at oral argument, that they are not challenging the constitutionality of the statute. Rather, they explicitly state that they are challenging Judge Conger\u2019s actions in this specific case, which they allege violated their First Amendment rights. Since Judge Conger was acting pursuant to a presumptively constitutional statute, Simmons and CCCFC fail to state a claim upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1086\">*1086</page-number>relief can be granted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> One cannot allege a constitutional violation by a judge, who was doing precisely what a statute permits him to do, without challenging the constitutionality of the statute under which he was acting.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This leads us to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in entering a permanent injunction against Judge Conger and his successors.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, the permanent injunction entered by the district court is vacated, and the district court is instructed on remand to enter judgment for Judge Conger on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ai_\">The district court erred in awarding nominal damages against Judge Conger in his individual capacity because he is entitled to judicial immunity from money damages liability in this section 1983 case. In addition, the district court erred in awarding nominal damages against Judge Conger in his official capacity because that relief is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Lastly, the district court abused its discretion in entering a permanent injunction, regarding the exclusion of the public from divorce trials, against Judge Conger and his successors. Therefore, the damages judgment is REVERSED, the permanent injunction is VACATED, and the ease is REMANDED to the district court with instructions to enter judgment for Judge Conger.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1162-5\">. Judge Conger was first elected in 1982 and was succeeded in 1995 by Judge Herschel T. Hamner. This fact is noteworthy because the district court\u2019s permanent injunction runs against Judge Conger and his \u201csuccessors in office and responsibilities.\u201d Rl-24-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1162-6\">. Two other founding members of CCCFC testified at the bench trial about their personal grievances with Judge Conger. Roselyn Jordan stated that she was \"mad as hell at Paul Conger\u201d as a result of his decision in her domestic relations case involving her former husband's abuse of her daughter. R2-30-86. Fay Price testified that she had a grievance with Judge Conger concerning how her case before him was resolved. R230-22. Price also testified that she backed Judge Conger's political opponent in the election due to her personal grievance with Judge Conger. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1162-7\">. This is not to say that no harm occurred. Simmons testified that CCCFC and its followers went by caravan to Montgomery, Alabama, to present their petition to the Judicial Inquiry Commission. R2-30-71. In addition, she testified that CCCFC issued a press release, setting forth its unsubstantiated charges against Judge Conger, prior to any hearing being held on the merits of its allegations. <em>Id. </em>Roselyn Jordan testified that she and some other CCCFC members went to New York and appeared on an episode of the \"Geraldo\u201d show about bad judges and bad decisions; on the show, Jordan spoke about her personal experience in a domestic relations matter before Judge Conger.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1162-12\">. In fact, this is the second time that we have heard an appeal in a case involving Judge Conger. An advocacy group, known as the Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, Inc. (\"ACES\u201d), brought the first case based on an incident in which a lawyer for a parly told an ACES member that she could not observe a child custody proceeding before Judge Conger. <em>See Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, Inc. v. Conger, </em>899 F.2d 1164 (11th Cir. 1990) (affirming dismissal of case because (1) dispute was not ripe, given that exclusion was done by a lawyer and not the judge, (2) plaintiffs lacked standing, and (3) plaintiffs did not state a cause of action). Although ACES and CCCFC are separate organizations and there is little in the record regarding overlap in membership between the two, both groups monitored Judge Conger\u2019s courtroom and were actively opposed to Judge Conger politically.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1163-23\">. Simmons was the only spectator at the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1163-24\">. Interestingly, Simmons admits that the <em>Gosa </em>case is the only instance in which she was asked to leave Judge Conger\u2019s courtroom. R2-30-75. We fail to see how this one incident constitutes what Simmons and CCCFC characterize in their complaint as Judge Conger\u2019s \u201cpolicy and practice\u201d of exclusion. Rl \u2014 1\u20144. The record indicates that other members of CCCFC were excluded from Judge Conger\u2019s courtroom on other occasions, but those exclusions occurred either because the CCCFC members were witnesses affected by the exclusionary rule or because the proceedings involved a juvenile and were closed as a matter of Alabama law. We view these latter instances as wholly unrelated to the incident complained of in this case, and therefore they do not aid the plaintiffs in establishing proof of any \u201cpolicy or practice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1165-7\">. Aside from the legal error on the judicial immunity issue, we are troubled that the court awarded damages in this case, because all that the plaintiffs sought was declaratory and injunctive relief. There is no prayer for damages in their complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1166-5\">. Given our decision, we need not address the abstention and certification issues raised by Judge Conger.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1166-6\">. We do not disagree with Judge Barkett's reading of <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, </em>448 U.S. 555, 100 S.Ct. 2814, 65 L.Ed.2d 973 (1980), as stating, in general terms, that a judge acting pursuant to a state statute is limited by the constraints of the Constitution and may not exercise his discretion under that statute in a unconstitutional fashion. <em>See Richmond Newspapers, </em>448 U.S. at 562 n. 4, 100 S.Ct. at 2820 n. 4. Plaintiffs therefore must allege either (1) that the state statute is unconstitutional or (2) that a particular judge\u2019s actions pursuant to that statute violated the limits placed upon him by the Constitution. In this case, Simmons and CCCFC assert that they are not challenging the constitutionality of the state statute. However, they do not allege that Judge Conger's actions constituted an unconstitutional exercise of authority <em>under the state statute. </em>What they challenge is not Judge Conger's judgment in deciding to close his courtroom, but rather the fact that he has the authority to exclude anyone at all. This challenge is an attack not on the judge's exercise of his discretionaiy function, but rather on the underlying statute that affords him his discretion. Given that Simmons and CCCFC expressly deny that they are making such a challenge and that they have not alleged that Judge Conger's actions constituted an unconstitutional exercise of his authority under the statute, they have failed to state a valid claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1166-13\">. We need not address fully the reasoning employed by the district court in granting the injunction. In its memorandum opinion, the district court states that \"[wjithout reaching the constitutional issue, this Court holds that the exclusion violates federally protected common law rights.\u201d Rl-23-1. Since the only claims that Simmons and CCCFC make are constitutional claims, it is puzzling that the district court could avoid addressing them and still find that they were entitled to relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1166-9\">BARKETT, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aeq\">specially concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-10\">I agree with the majority\u2019s ultimate conclusion that the decision of the district court in this case should be reversed for many of the reasons stated by the majority. I write only because I believe the majority is wrong when it states that \u201c[o]ne cannot allege a constitutional violation by a judge, who was doing precisely what a statute permits him to do, without challenging the constitutionality of the statute under which he was acting.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, </em>448 U.S. 555, 562 n. 4, 100 S.Ct. 2814, 2820 n. 4, 65 L.Ed.2d 973 (1980) (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-11\">Although the majority recognizes in footnote 9 that \u201ca judge acting pursuant to a state statute is limited by the constraints of the Constitution and may not exercise his discretion under that statute in a unconstitutional fashion,\u201d it nonetheless concludes that the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim. The majority characterizes the plaintiffs\u2019 claim not as a challenge to \u201cJudge Conger\u2019s judgment in deciding to close his courtroom, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1087\">*1087</page-number>but rather the fact that he has the authority to exclude anyone at all.\u201d I believe the plaintiffs in this case are challenging, rather, Judge Conger\u2019s \u201cpolicy\u201d of <em>summarily </em>closing his courtroom as an <em>unconstitutional exercise </em>of his authority.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">In order to ascertain the nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, one must understand the nature of the underlying right supporting such claim. The plaintiffs are seeking the type of procedural protections surrounding the <em>qualified </em>right of access to judicial proceedings guaranteed by the First Amendment, and first articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Richmond </em>Newspapers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs in both <em>Richmond Newspapers </em>and this ease challenged not the trial court\u2019s ultimate \u201cauthority to exclude anyone at all,\u201d but merely the manner in which the judge exercised such authority. In their complaint, Simmons and CCCFC specifically contend that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-7\">Judge Conger did not make any order or finding balancing the interest of the public to attend and the interest of the husband to have a closed hearing. Judge Conger made no finding that the denial of public access served an important governmental interest and that there was no less restrictive way to serve that governmental interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1167-12\">In fact, the relief sought by Simmons and CCCFC was to enjoin Judge Conger \u201cfrom excluding members of CCCFC and the general public from court proceedings <em>unless, after notice and hearing, he finds a proper, overriding interest in favor of closure.\u201d </em>This seems to me to be an attack on Judge Conger\u2019s \u201cexercise of his discretionary function,\u201d not a claim that the statutory grant of such discretion is invalid <em>per se. </em>Thus, I believe plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Judge Conger infringed their First Amendment right of access to judicial proceedings states a valid constitutional claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1167-13\">Ultimately, although I believe that plaintiffs otherwise stated a valid claim, I do have reservations as to whether a \u201cgenuine and present controversy, not merely a possible or conjectural one\u201d exists in this case. <em>See Gully v. First Nat. Bank in Meridian, </em>299 U.S. 109, 111-13, 57 S.Ct. 96, 97, 81 L.Ed. 70 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1088\">*1088</page-number>(1936). Judge Conger is retired and no longer in a position to injure the plaintiffs or the public by excluding them from court proceedings, and his alleged \u201cpast wrongs do not in themselves amount to that real and immediate threat of injury necessary to make out a case or controversy.\u201d <em>City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 103, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 1666, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983). Even if Judge Conger\u2019s \u201csuccessors\u201d are substituted as defendants in an attempt to save this action from mootness, I do not believe that the relief sought \u2014 injunctive relief \u2014 is warranted in this ease. Injunctive relief against Judge Conger\u2019s successors is inappropriate because the threatened harm is merely speculative, i.e., we would have to assume that the successor judges would impose a similar \u201cpolicy\u201d of exclusion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Notwithstanding that I think the plaintiffs brought a cognizable constitutional claim under <em>Richmond Newspapers </em>and its progeny, the permanent injunction should be vacated because this case no longer presents a \u201clikelihood of substantial and immediate irreparable injury,\u201d an element requisite to any grant of equitable relief. <em>O\u2019Shea v. Littleton, </em>414 U.S. 488, 501-03, 94 S.Ct. 669, 679, 38 L.Ed.2d 674 (1974).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1166-14\">. The state statutes in <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, </em>448 U.S. 555, 100 S.Ct. 2814, 65 L.Ed.2d 973 (1980), and the instant case permit, but do not require, trial courts to close court proceedings. If Judge Conger had been mandated by state law to close the divorce proceeding, I would find persuasive the majority's conclusion that \"logic dictates that Simmons and CCCFC's challenge in this case is not really to Judge Conger's actions, but rather to the constitutionality of section 12-21-9.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1167-8\">. The majority implies in footnote 6 that Simmons and CCCFC fail to state a claim because they allege only one incident in which Judge Conger excluded Simmons from the courtroom, which the majority considers as insufficient proof that Judge Conger had a \"policy and practice\u201d of exclusion. Alleging a policy or custom, however, is relevant only if the \u00a7 1983 claim is brought against a local governmental body. <em>See Arnold v. Board of Education of Escambia County Alabama, </em>880 F.2d 305, 310 (11th Cir.1989). Municipal accountability is not at issue in this case. If \u201cpolicy and practice\u201d has any relevancy, it is to the question of whether Judge Conger\u2019s successor is similarly excluding the public from his courtroom, of which no allegation has been made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1167-9\">. Had we reached the merits of Simmons' and CCCFC's action, we would be called upon to determine whether to extend to civil divorce proceedings the constitutional safeguards surrounding the right of access established in <em>Richmond Newspapers. </em>There the Court found a <em>limited </em>right of access to judicial proceedings, not an absolute right: \"[A] trial judge [may], in the interest of the fair administration of justice, impose reasonable limitations on access to a trial.\u201d 448 U.S. at 581 n. 18, 100 S.Ct. at 2830 n. 18. The Court required a balancing of the competing constitutional interests involved \u2014 the public's First Amendment interest in open proceedings as against the criminal defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial \u2014 and held that \u201d[a]bsent an overriding interest articulated in findings, the trial of a criminal case must be open to the public.\" <em>Id. </em>at 581, 100 S.Ct. at 2829. Simmons and CCCFC are seeking similar relief in this case, arguing that Judge Conger was constitutionally allowed to exclude persons from his courtroom only after conducting a <em>Richmond Newspapers </em>balancing of the interests involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1167-15\">. Indeed, this constitutional claim is similar to that presented in <em>Nowicki v. Cooper, </em>56 F.3d 782 (7th Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 753, 133 L.Ed.2d 700 (1996), in which a paralegal challenged a state family-court judge\u2019s policy of not allowing him to attend or record custody hearings because he was neither a party to the proceedings nor an attorney for either of the parties. The plaintiff claimed that the judge\u2019s actions, although authorized by Wisconsin law, Wis.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 757.70, 767.19(2), violated several federal rights. <em>Nowicki, </em>56 F.3d at 783. The Seventh Circuit held that to the extent the plaintiff alleged that the judge's \"policy deprives him of the limited right, ... held implicit in the First Amendment, to observe trials. ... his suit is not frivolous\u201d and was erroneously and prematurely dismissed by the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 785 (citing <em>Richmond Newspapers, </em>448 U.S. at 580 &amp; n. 17, 100 S.Ct. at 2829 &amp; n. 17).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">. We previously affirmed the dismissal of an action challenging Judge Conger's \"policy\" of excluding observers from child support hearings because the threatened injury was too speculative, and the case not ripe for adjudication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1168-6\">[Ajppellants' claims must be based on what they predict will happen as a result of Judge Conger\u2019s policy should they attempt, at some time in the future, to enter Judge Conger\u2019s courtroom during a support hearing. <em>This is plainly the type of hypothetical case that </em>we <em>should avoid deciding. </em>We do not generally decide cases based on a party\u2019s <em>predicted </em>conduct---- [W]e are faced only with an unofficial \u201cpolicy\u201d announced in an informal setting. <em>We simply cannot know whether Judge Conger will enforce this policy until he actually does so.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1168-17\"><em>Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, Inc. v.
