GARZA, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b472-24\">Pablo Quinonez-Terrazas (\u201cQuinonez\u201d) pleaded guilty to one count of reentry after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the presentence report added sixteen offense levels to the base offense level because Quinonez had been deported following a conviction for an aggravated felony. The conviction at issue was for aggravated assault of a law enforcement officer in Kansas, for which Quinonez received an indeterminate sentence of four to ten years\u2019 imprisonment. Adopting the presentence report, the district court sentenced Quinonez to seventy-eight months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-25\">Quinonez asserts that the district court erred in determining that his prior conviction was an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application and legal interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Domino, </em>62 F.3d 716, 719 (5th Cir.1995). Section 2L1.2 states, \u201cIf the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony, increase by 16 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(2). The commentary to the guidelines defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d as \u201cany crime of violence ... for which the term of imprisonment imposed (regardless of any suspension of such imprisonment) is at least five years.\u201d U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n. 7). Quinonez does not dispute that his prior conviction was for a crime of violence. Rather, Quinonez contends that because he was sentenced to an <em>indeterminate </em>sentence of four to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, he was not sentenced to \u201cat least five years\u201d imprisonment for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2. Whether the upper end of an indeterminate sentence should be used to determine the length of a sentence for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2 is an issue of first impression in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">We begin by noting that an indeterminate sentence is defined as, \u201cA sentence to imprisonment for the maximum period defined by law, subject to termination ... at any time after service of the minimum period.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>694 (5th ed. 1979); <em>see also Baughman v. United States, </em>450 F.2d 1217, 1220 (8th Cir.1971) (\u201cIndeterminate sentences have long been held sentences for the maximum term for which the defendant might be imprisoned.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 923, 92 S.Ct. 1791, 32 L.Ed.2d 123 (1972). This definition is consistent with the instructions for computing a defendant\u2019s criminal history category, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1. The commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">For purposes of applying \u00a7 4Al.l(a), (b), or (c), the length of a sentence of imprisonment is the stated maximum (e.g., ... in the case of an indeterminate sentence for a term not to exceed five years, the stated maximum is five years ...).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n. 2). Quinonez contends that the commentary\u2019s introductory clause specifically limits it application to \u00a7 4A1.1. Quinonez also urges us not to apply this commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 because there are \u201cinconsistencies between Application Note 7 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 and Application Note 2 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1 which demonstrate that they are inherently incompatible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Having reviewed the commentary to both sections, we find no irreconcilable inconsistency between the two, and conclude that it is entirely proper to use \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.1-2 in determining whether an indeterminate sentence qualifies as an aggravated felony for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2. The commentary to \u00a7 4A1.2 merely restates the common law definition of an indeterminate sentence, and we believe that it is reasonable to treat a prior indeterminate sentence in the same manner for the purpose of calculating the offense level under \u00a7 2L1.2 as for the purpose of determining the criminal history category under \u00a7 4A1.1. <em>See United States v. Ortiz-Gutierrez, </em>36 F.3d 80, 82 (9th Cir.1994) (concluding that it makes sense to treat prior sentences in the same manner under both sections because they both \u201cdetermine the extent to which prior convictions affect a defendant\u2019s sentence for the current offense\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in determining that Quinonez\u2019s prior conviction for an indeterminate sentence of four to ten years\u2019 imprisonment was an aggravated felony under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\">. <em>See also United States v. Reyes-Castro, </em>13 F.3d 377, 379-80 (10th Cir.1993) (applying upper end of indeterminate state conviction for purposes of determining aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43), which defines aggravated felony in the same manner as U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2); <em>Nguyen </em>v. <em>INS, </em>53 F.3d 310, 311 (10th Cir.1995) (concluding that it was reasonable and permissible to measure an indeterminate sentence \"by the possible maximum term of imprisonment\u201d for purposes of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43), and noting that this was consistent with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(b)(l)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
