The jury found that the deliberate indifference of these defendants was a proximate cause of Haley\u2019s injuries, which were sustained when another inmate set their joint cell on fire, severely burning Haley and killing himself. The jury found the defendants jointly and severally liable to Haley for $1.65 million in compensatory damages, but did not award punitive damages. The defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law and, alternatively, requested a new trial. After their motions were denied, they appealed. On appeal the defendants maintain 1) that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law, 2) that trial errors occurred which, at a minimum, require the grant of a new trial, and 3) that they are shielded from liability under the doctrine of qualified immunity. We affirm the jury verdicts of deliberate indifference and the lower court\u2019s denial of the defendants\u2019 post-verdict motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-18\">The denial of a post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law, under Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Matlock v. Barnes, </em>932 F.2d 658, 663 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 909, 112 S.Ct. 304, 116 L.Ed.2d 247 (1991). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 50 judgment notwithstanding the verdict motion by asking \u201cwhether the evidence presented, combined with all reasonable inferences permissibly drawn therefrom, is sufficient to support the verdict when viewed in a light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is directed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Tice v. Lampert Yards, Inc., </em>761 F.2d 1210, 1213 (7th Cir. 1985)). Thus in determining whether the jury could lawfully find that the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>were deliberately indifferent to the safety of Haley, we must consider all the evidence that came before the jury at trial and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to Haley. The facts below are presented from this perspective.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">On Monday, April 3, 1989, a terrible fire occurred in one of the cells at the Menard Correctional Facility. The fire was set by Kim Wilbom, one of the two inmates housed in the cell. Wilbom was killed in the blaze, and Arzel Haley, his cellmate, was severely burned, requiring extensive, painful skin grafts and months of recovery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The intensity of the fire, described at trial as an \u201cinferno,\u201d may have been enhanced by oil-based paint on the walls of the cell. Rescue efforts were halting at best, primarily because very few officers were in the cellhouse at the time the fire broke out and Haley\u2019s cell was \u201cdeadlocked,\u201d meaning it could only be opened with the right key, rather than with the general crank. Haley\u2019s deliberate indifference claims are based upon events that preceded this fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Haley had been living in cell 35 on the Ten Gallery of the East Cellhouse (cell 10-35) since December of 1988.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Wilbom was moved into this cell with Haley on March 17, 1989, approximately two-and-one-half weeks before the fire. Haley and Wilbom did not get along from the beginning. Haley was 19 years old at the time and weighed about 160 pounds. Wilbom, who was generally known by the nickname \u201cCountry,\u201d was in his thirties and was substantially larger than Haley. Haley, along with various other inmates, testified that Wilbom was widely believed to be crazy by people who observed him at Menard. These inmates consistently described him as \u201cbuggy,\u201d meaning crazy or disturbed. They noted that Wilbom rarely associated with or talked to other inmates, spent most of his time in his cell, acted peculiarly, talked to himself or his \u201cimaginary friend,\u201d would walk around the jail gallery in only his underwear, did not wear shoes, never showered or brushed his teeth, and dressed in smelly, disheveled clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">Baron Horton, an inmate who lived in cell 10-38 at the time (three cells down from Haley and Wilborn), testified that the nickname \u201cCountry\u201d came from Wilborn\u2019s appearance: being barefooted, wearing raggedy clothes, etc. Horton also testified to observing Wilborn talking to a non-existent person while waiting in the \u201cchow line\u201d and drinking coffee with an imaginary friend in his cell \u2014 Wilborn had prepared two cups though no one else was around. Horton noted that anyone who saw Wilborn would think he was crazy and that Wilbom \u201clooked as if he needed help.\u201d Edward Swift, another inmate at Menard at the time, confirmed that Wilborn was generally thought to be \u201cmentally disturbed\u201d or \u201ccrazy,\u201d due to his unusual actions and appearance, as well as his non-association with other inmates (being a \u201cloner\u201d). Inmate Clarence Dace, who lived four cells down in 10-39, likewise affirmed these perceptions of Wilbom. The testimony of these inmates, including Haley, would allow the jury to reasonably infer that anyone familiar with Wilborn would perceive that he had mental problems.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Haley testified that he first began requesting to be moved to a new cell on the Wednesday or Thursday preceding the Monday, April 3 fire.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Haley testified that he first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>spoke to Superintendent Boniface Gross, who was in charge of the eellhouse at the time.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He testified that he went to see Gross in his office on Four Gallery during the morning of that Wednesday or Thursday. Haley told him that he and his \u201ccelly\u201d (cellmate Wilbom) were having problems and that his celly was crazy and buggy. He explained to Gross why he thought Wilborn was crazy, noting that Wilborn hadn\u2019t taken a shower since he moved in, didn\u2019t come out of the cell, moved Haley\u2019s things around, \u201ctried to start stuff,\u201d and tried to intimidate Haley. Haley also told Gross that Wilborn had reported once attempting to burn his own sister\u2019s house down. Haley testified that Gross told him that he would check into it and see what he could do. Haley also spoke to Sergeant Ellis about the situation, who he saw on Two Gallery.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Later that day, Haley again saw Superintendent Gross and asked him when he or his celly were going to be moved from their cell. Haley noted that Gross seemed to have forgotten what he was talking about, so Haley reminded him of the information he had earlier conveyed. Haley testified that Gross told him he would check into it before shift change that day, which occurred at 3:00 in the afternoon. Gross never got back to him, however, and Haley did not see him again until the Monday of the fire. Haley also testified, and other inmates confirmed this testimony, that he was known <em>not </em>to be a gang member and that at Menard members of \u201cthe organization\u201d (i.e., gangs) were substantially more likely to have requests granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">By Sunday, when nothing had yet been done and realizing that Gross was off for the weekend, Haley went back to Sergeant Ellis, who he spoke to near the sergeant\u2019s cage on the way up to the galleries. Haley testified to again telling Ellis about the problems he and his celly were having, though Ellis \u201cknew the situation\u201d when Haley reminded him about it. Ellis told Haley that he would check into it. Haley noted that the conversation was short, five to ten seconds long, since other inmates were hanging out and waiting to talk to Ellis in the area near the sergeant\u2019s cage.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">At trial Haley described a terrible night with Wilborn that Sunday evening. He testified that they were arguing and that Wilborn had earlier threatened that \u201csomething crucial was going to happen if they didn\u2019t get him out of the cell\u201d or they didn\u2019t get separated that Sunday. When night came on Sunday and they were still together, Haley was terrified. He stayed up until around 3:00 a.m., afraid that if he went to sleep Wilborn would \u201ctry something.\u201d Not only did Wilborn threaten him, but he was acting strangely, walking around the cell, and not going to sleep. When Haley woke up Monday morning, he went to breakfast and then went directly to Superintendent Gross\u2019s office, but he still wasn\u2019t around. So Haley went and found Sergeant Ellis and told him about his continuing problems with his cellmate. The jury could have inferred from Haley\u2019s testimony, though it was less than perfectly clear, that Haley told Ellis about how Wilborn had threatened him. Once again, Ellis said he would \u201ccheck into it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-10\">Between 11:00 and 12:00 that Monday morning, on his way back from morning yard, Haley found Superintendent Gross on Two Gallery talking to inmates outside the sergeant\u2019s cage. Haley again requested that he and Wilborn be separated. Haley testified that Gross appeared not to remember him, so he once more explained the situation and why he wanted to be separated from his celly. This time Gross told Haley that he should check back with Gross. Later that day, after discovering that Wilborn was deadlocked in their cell,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> though Haley did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>not know why, he again went in search of aid. Haley waited around for awhile near the sergeant\u2019s cage on Two Gallery for a sergeant or superintendent to return. Eventually Superintendent Gross came in, and Haley again spoke to him about getting moved. While Haley\u2019s testimony on the conversation is a bit vague, the jury could have reasonably inferred that Haley told Gross that his cellmate \u2014 of whom he was already afraid \u2014 was now deadlocked in their cell. The fact that Wilbom was deadlocked may have indicated that he had violated some rule and definitely meant it would be much harder for Haley to get in and out of the cell, since he would have to be individually keyed in and out each time. Superintendent Gross, like all the defendant officers, was very familiar with the implications of a cell being deadlocked. Haley testified that he saw Gross a total of four or five times that Monday in different areas of the cellhouse, each time asking to be separated from Wilborn.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Yet nothing was getting done.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Growing frustrated with the lack of results, Haley then went to Captain John In-man about the situation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> When Inman learned that Haley was already in contact with Sergeant Ellis and Superintendent Gross, however, he assured Haley that they were taking care of the issue, so he need not get involved. Later that afternoon Haley found Sergeant Ellis down by the sergeant\u2019s cage. Haley told Ellis again how he and his celly weren\u2019t getting along, that Wilbom was crazy and had been moving his stuff around and trying to intimidate him and to \u201cstart something,\u201d that it was getting close to shift change, and that Wilbom was now deadlocked in their cell. Haley testified that another inmate was with him at the time he talked to Ellis. Inmate Clarence Dace testified that he was the one with Haley during this conversation and that he told Ellis that \u201ceveryone knows that Wilbom is bugged\u201d (crazy) and that Haley shouldn\u2019t be in a cell with him. Ellis told Dace to mind his own business and that he wasn\u2019t moving Haley.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">In fact, Sergeant Ellis was well aware that Wilbom was deadlocked in the cell, since he was the one who put Wilbom on protective custody status. Ellis testified that he worked the 7:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. shift on the Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday before the Monday evening fire. He was at home when the fire actually occurred. Ellis testified, however, that on that same Monday, Wilbom had approached him around lunchtime requesting protective custody (\u201cp.c.\u201d) status and to be moved out of the cellhouse. According to Ellis, Wilbom would not specify why he needed protection and simply kept saying that he couldn\u2019t \u201cget along\u201d and wanted to be moved out of the cellhouse. Although the protective custody request sheet provided an area to explain why the protection was being sought, Wilbom\u2019s p.c. request listed no reason. While Sergeant Ellis admitted that normally protective custody is not given automatically and that he would generally seek specifics and require a good reason, he gave Wilbom p.c. status even though Wilbom would not specify why he wanted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">What exactly occurred between Ellis and Wilbom that day is somewhat difficult to determine, since the story told by Ellis at trial was so different than the story he told in his earlier sworn interrogatory answers, which the jury heard when Ellis was impeached with them. At trial Ellis testified that after Wilbom made his request, Ellis told him he would look into it. Ellis testified that he then checked into the matter, and when Wilbom came back after lunch, he told Wilbom that there was no room in the segregation unit. Ellis testified that he then took Wilborn up to his cell and locked him up, only later receiving the signed p.c. request form, which had been signed in front of another officer. The jury learned, however, that in a long-winded interrogatory answer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Ellis told a rather different story. This time Wilborn signed the p.c. form in front of him, after Ellis suggested going on p.c. status in his cell until room was available in the segregation unit; however, Wilborn didn\u2019t actually get put on p.c. status at that point. Ellis asserted in the interrogatory answer that later that day he was called to Ten Gallery, where Wilborn was upset about not being moved or put on p.c. status. Wilborn became belligerent at this point and had to be physically placed in the cell. Ellis also wrote in his interrogatory answer that Wilborn was given a disciplinary ticket for this incident, though prison disciplinary records revealed (and Ellis admitted at trial) that no disciplinary ticket was actually written for Wilborn that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">As if the jury had not heard enough confusing testimony, after being impeached Ellis then went on to claim that he had actually had only a <em>single </em>incident with Kim Wilborn that day, which simply involved Wilborn requesting p.c. status, refusing to return to his cell, and Ellis then placing him in the cell. Nevertheless, at some point that April 3, 1989, Sergeant Ellis signed the Menard Temporary Confinement Sheet stating that Wilbom had been put on protective custody status in cell 10-35. This form, which was introduced into evidence, also revealed that Wilborn was the only one on his gallery on p.c. status at the time, out of the 87 inmates on Gallery Ten. Ellis admitted at trial that there were other available cells in East Cell-house in which he could have put Wilborn, away from Haley.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">Haley testified that when he went to his cell at the time of the 3:00 p.m. shift change on that Monday, Officer Benjamin Russell (who the inmates called \u201cPontiac\u201d) had to come let him into the cell, since it was deadlocked.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Haley testified that Wilborn was acting aggressively toward Russell at the time and that Wilborn told Russell that he wanted to be separated from Haley and that he didn\u2019t understand why he hadn\u2019t been moved. Haley later was allowed out to go to dinner. When he came back, Officer Russell had to let him in again, and Haley told him at this point that he didn\u2019t want to go back in the cell with Wilborn, who was also asking why he hadn\u2019t been moved and telling Russell to go see when he was going to be moved. Russell told Haley to go into the cell or he would be given a disciplinary ticket.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> So Haley went in, and the cell was deadlocked for the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">Officer Russell then went back to getting other inmates into their cells for the 4:00 p.m. count \u2014 which followed dinner and which all agree was ongoing long after 4:00\u2014 when all the inmates would be counted to make sure no one was missing.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After Russell left, Wilborn kicked over the boxes containing Haley\u2019s things, including Haley\u2019s pictures and mail, and then ran over and jumped up on his bunk. This made Haley angry, since it wasn\u2019t the first time Wilborn had messed with his things, so he started yelling at Wilborn, and they got into a big argument. Russell came back when he heard all the commotion and found Wilborn and Haley screaming at each other, Wilborn on the top bunk leaning over and Haley standing in front of him, their faces only six inches apart. Officer Russell testified that he called over Sergeant George Stewart, who was already on the gallery and who was ranked above him, to help control the situation.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Sergeant Stewart testified that he soon after radioed Lieutenant Scott McKee to come to the scene. Stewart\u2019s incident report, written approximately four hours af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ter the encounter, indicated that he arrived at approximately 5:15 p.m., and McKee arrived at approximately 5:18 p.m. The jury could certainly have inferred, from the fact that both Russell and Stewart were unable to control the situation and had to call in a superior officer, that the situation in cell 10-35 was extremely volatile by the time Lieutenant McKee arrived. In fact, Sergeant Stewart testified that he called Lieutenant McKee because he was unable to contain the situation or get any results.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Meanwhile, Haley and Wilborn continued to battle verbally. Haley tried to get Wilbom to come down and face him, saying \u201cGet down off the bunk. Get down off the bunk. What you want to do now? I\u2019m tired of you intimidating me\u201d; but Wilborn continued to taunt him, saying \u201cWhat you going to do, pussy? What you going to do?\u201d. Haley then went and knocked Wilborn\u2019s stuff off the shelf. At some point, just as they were ready to start physically fighting,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Lieutenant McKee arrived and yelled in, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Haley testified that he then told McKee the problems that they had been having for two weeks, that Wilborn had been trying to intimidate him, that Wilborn had knocked his stuff down, and that Wilborn was crazy and one of them needed to be moved.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> When the arguing between Wilborn and Haley resumed, Lieutenant McKee ordered Wilborn to come down off his bunk, come to the cell bars, and speak to him. When Wilborn did nothing, McKee repeated the order, but Wilborn still refused to move. Wilborn and Haley continued to yell at each other and at McKee to move them during this time. According to Haley\u2019s testimony, when McKee threatened that he was just going to leave them, Wilborn shouted out, \u201cIf you walk away, I\u2019ll burn this mother fucker down, you fucking honkey.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> At that point McKee lashed out, saying \u201cWell, go ahead, you nigger, bum your black asses. You\u2019ve got to be in there.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> And he walked away, followed by Stewart and Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">Haley testified that as they walked off he grabbed the bars and screamed for McKee to come separate them, yelling \u201cCome get me out of [this] cell.\u201d Haley kept yelling until they were too far away to hear him, but no one turned around or came back; and all three of them left the cellhouse. At that point Haley turned around, and Wilborn said to him, \u201cYou\u2019re going to die tonight.\u201d Haley realized he was stuck with Wilborn for another night, so he went over and sat down on his bed. Although his normal routine was to put his pajamas on before going to sleep, Haley remained in his prison-issue clothes, with his shoes and coat on. He testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>didn\u2019t lay down or get ready for bed because he was uncomfortable and felt like something was going to happen. Eventually Haley dozed off, however, exhausted from the previous night of little sleep, the arguments, and all the running around he had done on Monday trying to get moved.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">Haley testified that he believed he had been dozing only for five or ten minutes when he awoke to the smell of smoke. When he woke up, he found all sorts of paper and rolls of toilet paper burning in their cell, in the area in the back between the sink and the toilet. There was a sheet hanging from the ceiling around the toilet area (for privacy purposes), which was then catching on fire. Haley ran to the bars at the front of the cell and starting yelling for help, but there were no officers on the gallery.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Inmate Edward Swift was on the gallery, however, having come back late from his prison job, and Haley called him. By then Wilborn was back sitting on his bunk, saying \u201cI told you you\u2019re going to die tonight. You\u2019re going to burn.\u201d Wilborn then reached over and took the t.v. off the stand and threw it at Haley, who caught it. When Swift arrived, Haley was standing there holding the television. When Swift saw what was going on, he ran to get help.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Meanwhile, Wilborn came down and was lighting more things on fire, including more paper and the boxes they had used as st\u00e1nds for the t.v. and radio. After kicking the boxes into the fire, he slammed the radio to the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">The fire grew, and Haley continued to scream for help. Eventually Officer Donald Nicholson, the catwalk officer on duty at the time, ran down and stopped in the catwalk area in front of the cell.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Nicholson told Haley to lay down, which he did, as he felt the fire blazing out of the cell from behind him.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Haley testified that Wilborn remained in the back of the cell laughing and at one point tried unsuccessfully to drag Haley back into the fire with him. By then the fire was burning up the walls.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Haley testified that at some point McKee came with a fire extinguisher and sprayed the fire, which went down temporarily, but then came back as powerful as ever. Haley testified that McKee ran off after the extinguisher was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>empty, without letting him out.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The cell could not be opened with the general crank, since it was deadlocked. McKee testified that he did not have the right key and that he called \u201csomebody,\u201d though he wasn\u2019t sure who, to bring it. Haley told the jury that he just lay there alone, hollering and yelling, and told himself just to take the pain and die. Eventually, approximately twenty to thirty minutes after the fire began, Officer Mifflin arrived with the right key, kicked the door open, and Mifflin and Inmate Swift helped Haley get out of the blazing cell, saving his life.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Most of the above facts come from the trial testimony of Haley. The defendant officials testified quite differently. Superintendent Boniface Gross testified that inmates frequently requested things from him and that even though he worked the Thursday and Friday preceding the fire, as well as the Monday of the fire, he did not recall any conversations with Haley. Sergeant Michael Ellis also testified that he did not recall having any conversations with Haley prior to the fire and that Haley did not ask him for anything on the day of the fire. Ellis did not recall any exchange with Inmate Dace on the day of the fire either. Lieutenant McKee testified that although there was <em>no </em>yelling or arguing going on at cell 10-35, he made the determination that Haley and Wilbom needed to be separated.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In fact, he testified that as he and the other officers walked away, he told Sergeant Stewart to find an empty cell to move Wilbom into and that he also told the catwalk officer to keep an eye on cell 10-35. McKee admitted at trial, however, that he did not say anything to Wilbom and Haley about this planned move or give them any indication that he intended to have them separated.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It was also revealed at trial that on April 3, 1989, there was an empty cell just two cells down the gallery, cell 10-37, and that there were numerous other cells in the East Cellhouse that were either empty or contained only one inmate that night.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Lieutenant McKee testified that, as a lieutenant, he had the authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>move one of the inmates to a different cell, but that Officer Russell and Sergeant Stewart did not have this authority.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">There was substantial testimony at trial regarding prison rules about when inmates could be moved and what other options could be used when inmates needed to be separated. Sergeant Ellis testified that inmates could <em>only </em>be separated if they were physically fighting. Superintendent Gross, on the other hand, testified that inmates can be moved before they are physically fighting and that the idea is to separate inmates before they are actually hitting each other, in order to protect them from being harmed or injured. Regarding the count, Lieutenant McKee testified that there was an unwritten rule at Menard that no one could be moved while a count was ongoing, as it was on April 3, 1989 when he was at cell 10-35. He later admitted, however, that inmates could be separated during count, but only if they were physically fighting. Captain Inman testified that inmates could be moved during count under certain circumstances, that he had seen inmates moved during counts, and that a lieutenant confronted with the situation that McKee observed in cell 10-35 that night could have moved one of the inmates, even during count. He explained that an inmate moved during count could still be marked as present in his cell for paperwork purposes. Superintendent Gross testified that he agreed with Captain Inman that inmates could be moved during count and still be counted as being on the gallery. rarily placed in the sergeant\u2019s cage area; or one of the inmates could be temporarily placed in the holding pen next to the sergeant\u2019s cage. None of these options was implemented for the inmates in cell 10-35 on the evening of April 3,1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">In <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), the Supreme Court held, as it had previously \u2022assumed, that \u201cprison officials have a duty ... to protect prisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 1976 (internal citations omitted). Each of the defendants admitted at trial that they were aware of this duty. The <em>Farmer </em>Court acknowledged: \u201cHaving incarcerated \u2018persons [with] demonstrated proclivities] for antisocial criminal, and often violent, conduct,\u2019 ... having stripped them of virtually every means of self-protection and foreclosed their access to outside aid, the government and its officials are not free to let the state of nature take its course.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 114 S.Ct. at 1977 (internal citations omitted); <em>see also McGill v. Duckworth, </em>944 F.2d 344, 347 (7th Cir.1991) (finding duty to protect prisoners from each other is \u201clogical correlative\u201d of state\u2019s obligation to replace means of self-protection among its wards), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 907, 112 S.Ct. 1265, 117 L.Ed.2d 493 (1992). While every injury suffered by one prisoner at the hands of another does not constitute a violation of the Eighth Amendment prohibition on \u201ccruel and unusual punishments,\u201d if deliberate indifference by prison officials effectively condones the attack by allowing it to happen, those officials can be held liable to the injured victim. \u2014 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-16\">The <em>Farmer </em>Court clarified the standard for compensable \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d in the prison context. First, the danger to the inmate must be objectively serious, posing a substantial risk of serious harm. Second, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>prison official must have a sufficiently culpable state of mind-one of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to inmate health or safety. The Court summarized the state of mind requirement for deliberate indifference as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">[A] prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he also must draw the inference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alt\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 1979. Thus we can uphold the jury\u2019s findings that Superintendent Gross, Sergeant Ellis, and Lieutenant McKee were deliberately indifferent to Haley\u2019s safety only if we conclude that the jury could reasonably find that these defendants had <em>actual knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm </em>to Haley from Wilborn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The <em>Farmer </em>Court emphasized the importance of the \u201cactual knowledge\u201d prong, finding that because the Eighth Amendment relates only to \u201cpunishment,\u201d it is not enough that the official \u201cshould have known\u201d of a substantial risk or that a reasonable officer in the situation would have known of the risk. The Court insisted that negligence on the part of the officer is insufficient to impose liability: \u201c[A]n official\u2019s failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not, while no cause for commendation, cannot under our eases be condemned as the infliction of punishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus the Court affirmed the subjective knowledge test that has been the rule in the Seventh Circuit at least since <em>McGill v. Duckworth, </em>944 F.2d 344 (7th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">On the other hand, the Supreme Court also acknowledged in <em>Farmer </em>that actual knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm can be <em>inferred </em>by the trier of fact from the obviousness of the risk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-11\">Whether a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question of fact subject to demonstration in the usual ways, including inference from circumstantial evidence, ... and a factfinder may conclude that a prison official knew of a substantial risk from the veiy fact that the risk was obvious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">\u2014 U.S. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 1981. While a jury is not required to infer actual knowledge from the conspicuous nature of a risk, it is allowed to do so. The <em>Farmer </em>Court further clarified that a prisoner claiming deliberate indifference need not prove that the prison officials intended, hoped for, or desired the harm that transpired. The standard for deliberate indifference \u201cis satisfied by something less than acts or omissions for the very purpose of causing harm or with knowledge that harm will result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 114 S.Ct. at 1978; <em>see also Price v. Sasser, </em>65 F.3d 342, 345 (4th Cir.1995). Furthermore, \u201can Eighth Amendment claimant need not show that a prison official acted or failed to act believing that harm actually would befall an inmate; it is enough that the official acted or failed to act despite his knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 1981. Thus Haley did not need to prove that any of the defendants <em>intended </em>that Wilborn harm him or that they actually <em>believed </em>that Wilborn would harm him. It is enough for Haley to show that the defendants <em>actually knew </em>of a substantial <em>risk </em>that Wilborn would seriously harm him. To the extent that any language in our prior eases may have suggested that a plaintiff inmate making a deliberate indifference claim must establish that prison officials intended the harm that ultimately transpired, those statements do not accurately state the law in this circuit post <em>Farmer v. Brennan. See, e.g., Gibbs v. Franklin, </em>49 F.3d 1206, 1207 (7th Cir.) (\u201c[T]he issue is whether the guards <em>intended </em>that Gibbs be injured by their failure to timely intervene.\u201d) (emphasis in original), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 167, 133 L.Ed.2d 109 (1995);<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Hous</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>ton v. Sheahan, </em>62 F.3d 902, 903 (1995) (per curiam) (\u201cDamages do not follow from knowledge of a problem; the [officials] must intend to harm the prisoner.\u201d) (citing <em>Farmer).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">Evaluating Haley\u2019s deliberate indifference verdicts in light of the preceding discussion, and remembering that when we review a district court\u2019s denial of a post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law, we construe the facts presented and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed at trial, i.e., Haley, we conclude that the district court properly rejected the defendants\u2019 Rule 50 motion. A jury could have reasonably found that Superintendent Gross, Sergeant Ellis, and Lieutenant McKee were deliberately indifferent to the safety and welfare of Haley.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">We begin with Lieutenant McKee, whose behavior appears to constitute a paradigm case of deliberate indifference. When McKee was called to cell 10-35 by Sergeant Stewart, he was confronted by an extremely volatile situation. -Haley and Wilbom were screaming at each other, appeared ready to fight physically, and two other prison officers had been unable to diffuse the intense quarrel. Lieutenant McKee was told by Haley about what had been happening, that Wilbom was intimidating him and moving his things around, and that Wilborn was crazy. McKee\u2019s incident report reveals that he also knew that Wilbom was on protective custody deadlock status, making it more dangerous for Haley to be with him because it would be more complicated to get either one of them out of the cell if necessary. McKee\u2019s initial response to the situation was not unreasonable. He listened to Haley and ordered Wilbom to come down to the bars and talk to him. Even threatening to walk away if Wilbom did not obey may have been reasonable. However, when Wilbom specifically threatened to burn the cell down if McKee left, and having observed Wilbom and Haley and how explosive the situation already was, and having heard what they were saying about their ongoing battles and desperate desire to be separated, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that McKee manifested a deliberate indifference to Haley\u2019s safety by walking away with nary a hint that he intended to do anything about the situation.- Deliberate indifference can hardly be more succinctly demonstrated than by McKee\u2019s words as he left that night: \u2018Well, go ahead, you nigger, bum your black asses. You\u2019ve got to be in there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-11\">The cases of Superintendent Gross and Sergeant Ellis are not nearly so blatant; but the test for deliberate indifference does not require a prison official to affirmatively proclaim, as Lieutenant McKee effectively did, \u201cGo right ahead and assault each other because I\u2019m not looking and I don\u2019t care.\u201d As noted above, the test is whether the official had actual knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm to the inmate. According to Haley\u2019s testimony, he spoke to Superintendent Gross no less than four and perhaps as many as seven times about the problems he was having with Wilbom and the need to move one of them out of the cell. The jury could have reasonably found that, due to these conversations, Gross knew that Haley and Wilborn were feuding, that Wilbom acted like he was crazy, that Wilbom was intimidating Haley, and that Wilbom had previously attempted to bum his sister\u2019s house down. In addition, the jury could have reasonably found that by the Monday of the fire, Gross actually knew that Wilborn presented a substantial danger to Haley, which was enhanced because their cell was then deadlocked. Thus we cannot say, as a matter of law, that Gross did not have actual knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm to Haley, which he deliberately disregarded by leaving Haley in the same cell with Wilborn. Repeatedly stating that he would \u201csee what he could do\u201d and \u201ccheck into the situation,\u201d without ever actually doing anything, was not an acceptable response to the substantial risk of harm to Haley that the jury determined Gross perceived.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>We uphold the jury\u2019s finding of deliberate indifference against Sergeant Ellis on similar grounds. Haley testified that he originally spoke to Ellis about the situation in cell 10-35 on the same Wednesday or Thursday that he first spoke to Gross. Haley again spoke to Ellis on that Sunday, at which time Ellis indicated that he did know about the problems and that he would check into it. After a terrible Sunday night, on Monday morning Haley went and told Sergeant Ellis about the continuing feuds in cell 10-35, including how Wilbom was intimidating him, acting strangely, and had threatened Haley that \u201csomething crucial was going to happen\u201d if one of them wasn\u2019t moved. Ellis said he would \u201ccheck into it,\u201d but nothing happened. Haley testified that later that day he returned to Ellis and again told him how Wilbom was crazy, was trying to intimidate him and \u201cstart something,\u201d and that Wilborn was now deadlocked in their cell \u2014 a fact with which Ellis was already intimately familiar, since he was the one who put Wilborn on protective custody deadlock status in the first place. Yet still Ellis made no attempt to get either of the inmates moved or even to further investigate the situation. Even though Ellis was not present when the fire began, the jury could have reasonably concluded that by that Monday evening, Sergeant Ellis had actual knowledge of a substantial risk of serious harm to Haley from Wilbom and that he deliberately disregarded that risk by doing nothing about it.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Because we reject the defendants\u2019 claim that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we now consider their arguments that certain trial errors necessitate a new trial. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Grassi v. Information Resources, Inc., </em>63 F.3d 596, 601 (7th Cir. 1995); <em>M.T. Bonk Co. v. Milton Bradley Co., </em>945 F.2d 1404, 1407 (7th Cir.1991). The defendants claim they were entitled to a new trial due to erroneous jury instructions, improper expert witness testimony, and the admission of certain photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">The defendants challenge the following language in one of the jury instructions: \u201cReckless disregard occurs where the defendant disregards a substantial risk of danger that is either known or would be apparent to a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position.\u201d The defendants argue that this language was improper because it allowed the jury to find deliberate indifference based on what the defendants \u201cshould have known,\u201d rather than what they actually knew. The defendants, however, face two major hurdles to making this challenge: 1) waiver and 2) the remainder of the jury instructions given.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">Federal Rule 51 clearly states that \u201c[n]o party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 51. The defendants nowhere objected to the language that they now claim was erroneous and prejudicial, though they had the opportunity to do so at both the jury instruction conference and again at trial just before the instructions were given. In fact, Haley argues that the defendants, at the request of the trial court, stipulated to the instructions that they now attempt to challenge. We have reviewed the transcript of the purported stipulation, but we find it unclear regarding, which specific instruction was stipulated to by the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>dants; hence we do not find that the defendants stipulated to the instruction now challenged. On the other hand, the defendants suggestion that remarks made at the close of evidence in support of their motion for judgment as a matter of law \u2014 which addressed the proper legal standard for deliberate indifference and emphasized the need for actual knowledge \u2014 somehow constituted an implicit objection to the jury instruction language that they now challenge is meritless. One of the basic purposes of Rule 51 is to give district courts the opportunity to amend erroneous jury instructions, thus avoiding the need for appellate consideration of the issue and potential re-trial. An entirely separate discussion about whether the facts presented at trial entitle a party to judgment as a matter of law is hardly fair notice to the trial court that the same party takes issue with certain jury instruction language.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Failure to challenge a jury instruction in a civil case constitutes waiver of that challenge and precludes appellate review. <em>See Deppe v. Tripp, </em>863 F.2d 1356, 1362 (7th Cir.1988) (holding that \u201cin civil cases a plain error doctrine is not available to protect parties from erroneous jury instructions to which no objection was made at trial\u201d); <em>see also Doe v. Johnson, </em>52 F.3d 1448, 1458-59 (7th Cir.1995); <em>Bogan v. Stroud, </em>958 F.2d 180, 184 (7th Cir.1992); <em>Sims v. Mulcahy, </em>902 F.2d 524, 535-36 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 897, 111 S.Ct. 249, 112 L.Ed.2d 207 (1990). We note that even if the defendants had objected at trial, they could not have established that the instructions as a whole were insufficient to inform the jury correctly of the applicable law or that the instructions so misguided the jury that they were prejudiced. <em>See Miller v. Neathery, </em>52 F.3d 634, 637 (7th Cir.1995); <em>Maltby v. Winston, </em>36 F.3d 548, 560 (7th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 2576, 132 L.Ed.2d 827 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">In addition to the challenged language, the complete challenged instruction contained language stating that 1) \u201cNegligence or even gross negligence will not establish a constitutional violation\u201d; 2) \u201cMere inadvertence or negligence is not enough to support a \u00a7 1983 action raising Eighth Amendment issues\u201d; and 3) \u201cIn a \u00a7 1983 case, the plaintiff must prove that the defendants had actual knowledge of impending harm readily preventable, so that a conscious culpable refusal to prevent harm can be inferred from the defendant\u2019s failure to prevent it.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In addition, a separate jury instruction clearly directed that the plaintiff had to prove, \u201cFirst, that a defendant had actual knowledge of impending harm readily preventable\u201d and noted that the defendants were not liable if this proposition had not been proved. While the sentence challenged by the defendants does seem to invoke an improper reasonable person test for knowledge, the jury instructions as a whole definitely required actual knowledge and thus could not have prejudiced the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">The defendants also challenge the testimony of plaintiffs expert, Thomas Rozzaza, claiming that he was improperly allowed to testify concerning the legal standards governing the case. We review the trial court\u2019s admission of expert testimony under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Buscaglia v. United States, </em>25 F.3d 530, 532 (7th Cir.1994). Thomas Rozzaza was called by Haley as an expert in the area of corrections and prison management, who had over 27 years of work experience in corrections. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>was allowed to testify regarding what he believed to be the proper response to certain prison situations, including the situation that confronted Lieutenant McKee. Although the defendants argue that Rozzaza was allowed to testify about \u201clegal standards,\u201d the only example they recite comes from Rozzaza\u2019s testimony explaining his background and qualifications. After Rozzaza mentioned that he had served at a Maryland prison as \u201cDirector of Standards and Inspections,\u201d plaintiffs counsel asked Rozzaza what was meant by the term \u201cstandards.\u201d Rozzaza responded, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-5\">Well, a standard is sort of a statement about what a prison should be doing. And \u2014 you know \u2014 we may have standards, for example, on use of force that the prison will have a written policy and procedure on the use of force____ The standards that I dealt with in Maryland were limited to some degree. We were only allowed to set standards regarding life, health, safety, and constitutional issues. In other words, what is legal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\">Defendants fix on the final phrase \u201cwhat is legal\u201d and attempt to parlay this into a claim that Rozzaza\u2019s testimony essentially consisted of improperly telling the jury why the defendants\u2019 conduct was illegal. We do not accept this spin on the testimony. It appears clear that Rozzaza used the phrase \u201cwhat is legal\u201d simply to explain one of the elements of his job as Director of Standards-he helped prisons establish policies in compliance with constitutional law. Rozzaza was not allowed to testify regarding the dictates of deliberate indifference law, nor was it an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion to admit his testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">Defendants also challenge the admission of two particular photographs at trial. Because we give special deference to a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, the defendants bear a heavy burden in challenging these rulings on appeal. <em>Grassi </em>63 F.3d at 601. We review the admission of the photographs under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>The first challenged photograph is one in a series of 22 pictures taken at the hospital after the fire, which were introduced to demonstrate the severity and extent of Haley\u2019s horrible burns and his treatment.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The defendants objected to one of these pictures in particular, claiming that it was cumulative and unduly prejudicial because it showed ankle shackles around the burned legs of the plaintiff. The defendants suggest that the picture was unfairly prejudicial because the jury may have assumed that the defendants shackled Haley and that this was cruel under the circumstances. Thus they argue that the photograph should have been excluded under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. They point to <em>Lemons v. Skidmore, </em>985 F.2d 354, 357 (7th Cir.1993), where we recognized that the presence of handcuffs and leg restraints on a prisoner plaintiff testifying in his \u00a7 1983 suit, where his own propensity for dangerousness and violence were \u201ccentral to the trial of his ease,\u201d could have unfairly prejudiced the plaintiff, thus denying him a fair trial. <em>Lemons </em>has absolutely no application to the case at hand. While it was easy to see the potential prejudice in <em>Lemons, </em>it is difficult to imagine any realistic potential for prejudice here. The jury was aware that Haley was a convicted felon who was in prison at the time of the fire, thus explaining the shackles, and his counsel never drew attention to the shackles or implied that the defendants were responsible for their presence. Furthermore, the use of the shackles in the picture did not suggest any cruelty at all, since they appear carefully placed over a gauze-like substance and are not actually touching Haley\u2019s skin. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">The other challenged photograph is one depicting the severely burned cell 10-35 after the fire was extinguished, which includes the charred body of Kim Wilborn, who died in the fire. The defendants likewise challenge the admission of this photograph under Rule 403, claiming it had \u201ca strong emotional impact\u201d and \u201cminimal probative value.\u201d The photograph is certainly chilling, particularly because of the presence of the body. Yet this does not mean that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>court should have excluded it. The picture was one of only three taken of the burned cell by arson investigators from the Office of the State Fire Marshall on the night of the fire; they were the only pictures available showing the appearance of the scene of the blaze that night. The arson investigator who testified noted that this particular photograph depicted the scene before it was disturbed in any way for investigation purposes. The picture was highly probative, in that it indicated the severity of the fire and intensity of the damage and showed an area that the other two pictures did not. Unlike the other two photographs of the cell, it also portrayed some of the combustibles that the investigators determined were used to start the fire. In addition, the challenged photograph was specifically used by the testifying arson investigator to show the jury where he believed the fire began. While the photograph is certainly disturbing, its contents were highly relevant; and its very significant probative value was not substantially outweighed by any danger of unfair prejudice. Thus it was properly admitted, and the defendants\u2019 challenge is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Finally, the defendants argue that to the extent the district court imposed upon them a greater burden than previously recognized by law, they are shielded from liability by the doctrine of qualified immunity. The Supreme Court held in <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 819, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2739, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982), that government officials performing discretionary functions are shielded from civil liability \u201cinsofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d In <em>Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987), the Court noted that in order for a right to be \u201cclearly established\u201d in this context, \u201c[t]he contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d We find that while <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811, further clarified the proper standard for deliberate indifference, it did not change the law in any way that could have affected this ease.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">The deliberate indifference standard under which the jury reasonably found the defendants liable was well-established at the time of the defendants\u2019 conduct. <em>See Duck-worth v. Franzen, </em>780 F.2d 645, 652-53 (7th Cir.1985) (finding criminal recklessness to be proper standard for deliberate indifference), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 816, 107 S.Ct. 71, 93 L.Ed.2d 28 (1986); <em>see also Goka v. Bobbitt, </em>862 F.2d 646 (7th Cir.1988); <em>Smith-Bey v. Hospital Adm\u2019r, </em>841 F.2d 751 (7th Cir.1988); <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976). In fact, the trial court\u2019s jury instructions essentially came from our decision in <em>Duckworth v. Franzen </em>and our subsequent restatement of this standard in <em>McGill v. Duckworth, </em>944 F.2d 344, 348\u201449 (7th Cir.1991) (adopting <em>Duckworth v. Franzen </em>subjective knowledge test for deliberate indifference). The defendants admitted during trial that they knew they had a duty to protect inmates from other inmates. They could not have reasonably believed that their indifference to Haley\u2019s pleas for help was lawful. We conclude that the defendants were not held to a higher standard of behavior than the existing law at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court denying the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment as a matter of law, as well as their motion for a new trial, is</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-14\">. Michael Ellis is now a correctional captain at Menard Correctional Center, but since he was a sergeant at the time of the relevant events, he will be referred to throughout as \"Sergeant Ellis\u201d or simply \u201cEllis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b713-10\">. Even at the time of the trial, Haley continued to experience physical limitations due to the severe burns, and the jury was allowed to view many of his permanent scars.

There were five levels of cells, called \u201cgalleries,\u201d in the area of Menard where Haley and Wilbom were housed.

Prison records introduced at trial revealed that when Wilbom was interviewed on September 19, 1988 at Joliet Correctional Facility, he reported a history of alcoholism, drug use, auditory hallucinations, a suicide attempt at the direction of one of these voices, being on antipsychotic medications for three years, and psychotic episodes. Although these records were sent to Menard when Wilhom was transferred, there was no evidence presented at trial that any of the defendants were aware of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b713-15\">.

When a cell is \u201cdeadlocked,\u201d it cannot be opened with the general crank that opens the other cells, but must be individually opened with a key. An inmate can be deadlocked at Menard due to either \"protective custody\u201d (for his own protection from other inmates) or for \u201cdisciplinary deadlock\u201d (for violating a rule). An inmate who is deadlocked is not allowed to leave the cell. While Menard has a special unit of single-person cells for inmates on deadlock status, when that unit is full, two-person cells can also be individually deadlocked. In that case, the deadlocked person would be stuck in the cell all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>day, and the other person would have to be let in and out by a guard with the key.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b715-10\">.

Officer Russell admitted that he had to let Haley into his cell, but denied that Haley resisted in any way.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b716-13\">. As the defendants emphasize repeatedly, the following events, leading up to the fire, occurred before the final completion of the cellhouse count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b716-14\">. Sergeant Stewart was also a defendant at trial, but the jury rejected Haley's deliberate indifference claim against him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"ARH\">. Officer Russell testified that the inmates were yelling and agitated when McKee arrived and that they had <em>not </em>calmed down. Sergeant Stewart testified that when McKee arrived, Wilborn was \"combative\u201d and the arguing was \u201cloud.\u201d In addition, although Stewart denied at trial that the inmates appeared about to physically fight, he was impeached by his incident report (they \"were attempting to fight\"), earlier deposition testimony (indicating his suspicion that \"these two possibly may fight\u201d), and the summary by internal investigators of his statement to them that night (they \"appeared about to start fighting\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AzK\">Although Lieutenant McKee stubbornly insisted at trial that the situation in cell 10-35 when he arrived was quiet and calm, that there was absolutely no arguing, yelling, or fighting going on, and in fact that he really wondered why a sergeant would call him up to come look at two quiet inmates just sitting in their cell, his testimony must have appeared frightfully non-credible to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">. Haley testified that he had never seen Lieutenant McKee before this incident, and McKee likewise testified that he had no involvement with either Haley or Wilborn prior to April 3, 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b717-11\">. Sergeant Stewart confirmed Haley\u2019s testimony, testifying at trial (as he had stated in his initial incident report) that Haley told McKee that Wilborn was crazy, that he was moving Haley\u2019s stuff around, and that he was going to tear up Haley\u2019s property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b717-12\">. The substance of this threat to \"bum the place down\u201d was confirmed by both the testimony and incident reports of Officer Russell, Sergeant Stewart, and Lieutenant McKee. These incident reports were filled out the evening of the fire. Russell testified that Wilbom\u2019s conduct was \"aggressive\u201d at this time, and McKee described Wilbom\u2019s talk as \u201caggressive\u201d in his incident report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b717-13\">. Inmate Edward Swift testified that Lieutenant McKee was known to be a racist and to ignore the requests of black inmates. Haley and Wilbom were both black.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b718-5\">. The suggestion by the defendants that Haley\u2019s going to sleep establishes that he was not really afraid of Wilborn is hardly the only interpretation of the evidence and certainly does not constitute construing the evidence and the inferences therefrom in favor of the party who prevailed at trial, i.e., Haley.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\">. Haley testified that at some point he pulled down the privacy blanket that was hanging over the front of the cell, which had evidently been put up by Wilborn, perhaps so his fire-starting activities would not be immediately noticed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\">. Swift confirmed that when he first arrived, Haley was standing near the bars holding a television. Swift testified that there was a small fire going in the cell and that Haley told him to get an officer. Swift then walked down and told the catwalk officer that someone wanted to speak to him in cell 10-35 \u201cbecause he says his celly\u2019s trying to bum him up.\u201d Swift testified, however, that he did not initially tell the catwalk officer that there was actually a fire going. When Swift returned to the cell and saw that Wilborn had set additional fires and that they were much bigger, he ran back to the catwalk officer and told him about the fires. This time the officer, Officer Nicholson, came down. Swift testified that he then began running from cell to cell asking for water to put out the fire, though the cups of water he was given had no effect on the blaze.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b718-10\">. Officer Nicholson testified that the \u201ccatwalk\" is a long caged area that runs the length of the gallery, from which the catwalk officer can observe the entire cellhouse, though he cannot physically reach any of the galleries. The catwalk is suspended from the opposite cellhouse wall, about 15 feet from the Eight Gallery \u2014 the level below Ten Gallery where Haley and Wilbom were housed. It was Nicholson's job to watch the five galleries on that side of the cell-house. Although there were normally two catwalk officers on duty, the other officer was at dinner at the time the fire broke out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b718-11\">. Nicholson testified that when he arrived in front of the burning cell, where the fire was \u201cgoing wild,\u201d Haley was at the front of the cell at the bars yelling \"get me out.\u201d Nicholson immediately called for assistance on his radio and attempted to hook up the fire hose on the catwalk. The hose was too short, however, and by the time he could add another length of hose, he could not get enough water pressure to reach the ceE on Ten GaEery. Haley continued to scream \u201cget me out\u201d as the flames engulfed the cell. Nicholson did not, however, ever see or hear WEbom.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b718-12\">. Officer Nicholson testified that the paint on the waEs started burning, and then the fire \u201ctook off like wild.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b719-5\">. This testimony was confirmed by McKee\u2019s incident report on the night of the fire, which stated that the entire cell was covered in flames when he arrived and that although he used an entire fire extinguisher, he was unable to put out the fire. McKee also testified, however, that he was still at the cell when Officer Mifflin came with the keys and saved Haley. Officer Mifflin, who received an award for saving Haley's life, testified that when he came running in with the keys, McKee was running away to get air packs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b719-6\">. Apparently the fire was eventually put out by inmates, who climbed up the steel grillwork on the outside of the galleries from Two Gallery to Ten Gallery (4 levels up) carrying fire hoses, which they sprayed into the cell. Officer Nicholson described this strange scene to the jury, which also explained why he was unable to get enough water pressure, since his hoses were connected to the same standpipe as those of the inmates.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b719-7\">. McKee\u2019s incident report from that night, which was admitted into evidence, stated that he told Stewart to move Wilbom because of his \"aggressive talk and his P.C. deadlock status.\" Thus the jury could have determined that McKee knew that Wilbom was in protective custody that night.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b719-8\">. Sergeant Stewart testified that as they left, Lieutenant McKee told him to locate an empty cell, though no one notified the inmates that one of them would be moved. Officer Nicholson likewise testified that McKee did tell him to \"keep an eye on\" cell 10-35, though at the time Nicholson was also responsible for monitoring the 249 other cells in the cellhouse. McKee estimated that there were probably 400 inmates in the East Cellhouse at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-11\">Captain Inman testified, though grudgingly so, that he would have separated the inmates if he had confronted the situation that McKee did and that McKee had the power to immediately separate the inmates and then deal with the placement office later. Inman also testified that it was not reasonable for officers to walk away from a situation where inmates were about to fight and that he would advise his staff not to walk away from such a situation. Similarly, Superintendent Gross testified that the minimum an officer should do in a situation like the one McKee and the others confronted is to tell the inmates that you will try to get them moved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b719-12\">. Wayne Ellner, the Record Office Supervisor at Menard, confirmed the testimony of various inmates that cell 10-37 was indeed unoccupied that night and noted that there were at least, four other cells on Ten Gallery housing only one inmate at the time. While some of the empty cells in the cellhouse may not have been operational, the defendants did not deny that there was available space in the cellhouse to have either Wilbom or Haley moved immediately. In fact, Officer Russell testified that he remembered there being cells on Ten Gallery that held only one inmate that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>The testimony of the various officers also revealed a range of possible techniques that have been used at Menard for dealing with feuding inmates: one could be moved to an empty cell; one could be moved to a cell containing only one other inmate; one of the inmates could be \u201cflip-flopped\u201d with an inmate from a different cell; an officer could be left outside the cell to monitor the inmates; one of the inmates could be tempo-</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b720-6\">. The statement that officers and sergeants did not have the authority to unilaterally move feuding inmates at Menard, though lieutenants did, was confirmed by Captain Inman, Sergeant Stewart, and Sergeant Ellis. Even the corrections expert called by Haley concluded that officers and sergeants at Menard were not authorized to move inmates. Perhaps this testimony helps explain why the jury found that Officer Russell and Sergeant Stewart were not deliberately indifferent to Haley's welfare, even though they both heard Wilbom's threat and then left without doing anything to assuage the situation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b721-10\">. <em>Gibbs </em>was a jury instruction case originally decided less than three months before <em>Farmer. See Gibbs v. Franklin, </em>18 F.3d 521 (7th Cir. 1994). After releasing <em>Farmer, </em>the Supreme Court vacated the original panel decision in <em>Gibbs </em>and remanded the case to the Seventh Circuit for further consideration in light of <em>Farmer. </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 115 S.Ct. 307, 130 L.Ed.2d 271 (1994). The <em>Gibbs </em>panel concluded, however, that both the original judgment and opinion were consis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>tent with <em>Farmer. </em>49 F.3d at 1207, 1208. Yet because the focus of <em>Gibbs </em>was on the \"readily preventable\u201d language, rather than the \"specific intent\u201d language, contained in the challenged juiy instruction, and because the instruction in <em>Gibbs </em>only required specific intent <em>or </em>deliberate indifference, we need not and do not overrule <em>Gibbs.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">. The <em>Farmer </em>Court noted that when a prison official is \"aware of an obvious, substantial risk to inmate safety,\" he cannot escape liability by establishing that \"he did not know that the [inmate] was especially likely to be assaulted by the specific prisoner who eventually committed the assault.\u201d \u2014 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 1982. Likewise, Sergeant Ellis and Superintendent Gross are no less liable for deliberate indifference because, while they knew that Wilbom presented a substantial risk of serious harm to Haley, they may not have envisioned that Wilbom would light the cell on fire. While there must be some link between the risk of which the official was aware and the harm that actually occurred \u2014 as it would be unfair to hold officials liable for risks they could not have anticipated simply because they ignored other unrelated risks \u2014 prison officials need not be specifically aware of the precise risk that unfolds. It is sufficient that Ellis and Gross knew that Haley was in danger of some kind of attack from Wilbom and made no attempt to prevent it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b724-5\">. This jury instruction language is consistent with a number of our <em>pre-Farmer v. Brennan </em>cases. <em>See, e.g., Duckworth v. Franzen, </em>780 F.2d 645, 653 (7th Cir. 1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 816, 107 S.Ct. 71, 93 L.Ed.2d 28 (1986); <em>McGill v. Duckworth, </em>944 F.2d at 348. We note that, in light of <em>Farmer, </em>such an instruction is no longer advisable because it may suggest to the jury that prison officials need not respond to a substantial risk of serious harm unless the risk is \u201creadily\u201d or easily preventable. <em>Farmer </em>only stated that prison officials who \"responded reasonably to the risk\u201d could not be found liable; the Court did not say that the only responses required are the easy ones. <em>Id. </em>at 1982-83. <em>But see Gibbs, </em>49 F.3d at 1208 (upholding same jury instruction language because it merely \u201creferred to one way in which the jury could infer intent on the part of the prison guards\u201d). While doing nothing in the face of a substantial danger that is easily or readily preventable does make an official look particularly culpable, we should not invite juror confusion regarding whether the Eighth Amendment requires anything more than doing what is easy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b725-10\">. Haley points out, and the defendants do not deny, that this picture was the only one showing the use of a catheter in Haley\u2019s treatment, which was used for hydration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b726-6\">. If anything, <em>Farmer </em>made clear that Haley did not have to prove that the defendants intended to harm him, thus making inappropriate defense counsel's repeated suggestion in closing arguments that the defendants were not liable because they did not want or intend Haley to be harmed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
