(\u201cCounty Line\u201d) and two of its officers, Carmine Bellofatto and Patrick DeJoseph, to recover moneys allegedly fraudulently obtained in violation of federal and state law. The plaintiffs appeal from a May 17, 1995 memorandum and order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Charles P. Sifton, <em>Chief </em>Judge) granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Because the district court erred in holding that the plaintiffs\u2019 common law fraud claim is preempted by ERISA, we vacate the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b109-21\">The facts of this case, in which an employer is being sued by a trust for improper administration of an employee benefit plan, are set forth by the district court in <em>Geller v. County Line Auto Sales, Inc., </em>No. CV-94-3123,1995 WL 313123 (E.D.N.Y. May 17,1995). On a motion directed to the pleadings, we, like the district court, must take as true the facts as alleged in the complaint. We reiterate only those facts necessary to the disposition of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-22\">The plaintiffs brought this action in their capacity as trustees for the Trust, which provides medical benefits to members of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association (the \u201cAssociation\u201d) and their employees. To be eligible to receive benefits under the Trust, a participant must be a full-time employee of a member-employer. County Line is a member-employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>In October 1989, the defendants registered Patricia Kleppner, defendant DeJoseph\u2019s girlfriend, as a full-time employee of County Line who was eligible for Trust plan membership even though she was not so employed. In reliance, the plaintiffs enrolled Kleppner in the Trust plan effective December 1989. The defendants confirmed Kleppner\u2019s status as a full-time employee between December 1989 and August 1993 by remitting monthly premiums to the Trust upon receipt of an invoice. The invoice stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-4\">By paying this bill the company hereby acknowledges and guarantees that the employees listed are in fact eligible for the group insurance shown according to the terms of the contract as outlined in the employee booklet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">During the relevant period, Kleppner\u2019s name was among the employees listed on each invoice.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">In November 1991, Kleppner was diagnosed with lung cancer and was hospitalized several times before her death in August 1993. During the period of her illness, Kleppner received medical, diagnostic, and laboratory services for which the plaintiffs paid out $104,554.82 from the Trust fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">After Kleppner died, the Trust learned that she had never been a County Line employee. The Trust demanded that the defendants reimburse the Trust for its expenditures on Kleppner\u2019s behalf. When the defendants refused, the plaintiffs brought this action seeking 1) reimbursement pursuant to ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provisions, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a), 2) compensatory and punitive damages based upon New York common law fraud, and 3) New York common law restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">The district court found that the plaintiffs could not prevail under ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provisions: first, as fiduciaries the plaintiffs were limited to equitable relief under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(2) and the claim here was for money damages; second, the broad panoply of remedies available against fiduciaries under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3) was not available to the plaintiffs because the defendants were not fiduciaries. The district court further held that ERISA\u2019s preemption provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a), barred the plaintiffs\u2019 second and third causes of action for state law relief. The Trustees now appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">We review de novo the dismissal of the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, taking as true the facts alleged in the complaint and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor. <em>Jackson Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co. v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., </em>32 F.3d 697, 699-700 (2d Cir.1994) (citing <em>Allen v. WestPoint-Pepperell, Inc., </em>945 F.2d 40, 44 (2d Cir.1991)). A dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a cognizable claim may be affirmed only where \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff[s] can prove no set of facts in support of [their] claim which would entitle [them] to relief.\u201d <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 101-02, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">I. ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">The Trust\u2019s first cause of action is predicated upon 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a), which identifies the persons empowered to bring a civil action and provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-14\">A civil action may be brought\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-15\">(2) by the Secretary, or by a participant, beneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under section 1109 of this title [for imposition of liability for breach of fiduciary duty]; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b110-16\">(3) by a participant, beneficiary or fiduciary (A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this sub-chapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b110-17\">The plaintiffs may recover against the defendants if they can demonstrate either that the defendants are \u201cfiduciaries\u201d under subsection (2) or that restitution is encompassed by the phrase \u201cother ... equitable relief\u2019 in subsection (3). We agree with the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>that the plaintiffs are unable to recover under either provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Section 1132(a)(2) incorporates by reference 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109, which states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">(a) Any person who is a fiduciary with respect to a plan who breaches any of the responsibilities, obligations, or duties imposed upon fiduciaries by this subchapter shall be personally liable to make good to such plan any losses to the plan resulting from each such breach, and to restore to such plan any profits of such fiduciary which have been made through the use of assets of the plan by the fiduciary, and shall be subject to such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate, including removal of such fiduciary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Thus, the plaintiffs are foreclosed from recovering under \u00a7 1132(a)(2) unless they can demonstrate that County Line, Bellofatt0, and DeJoseph are fiduciaries. They are not. \u201cFiduciary\u201d is defined, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">[A] person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent (i) he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets, (ii) he renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to any monies or other property of such plan, or has any authority or responsibility to do so, or (iii) he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A). The Department of Labor regulations that set forth the Department\u2019s interpretative guidelines further delineate the responsibilities of a fiduciary, explaining that \u201cpersons who have no power to make any decisions as to plan policy, interpretations, practices or procedures\u201d and, therefore, perform \u201cpurely ministerial functions\u201d are not fiduciaries. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2509.75-8. According to the regulations, the performance of ministerial functions in-eludes, <em>inter alia, </em>the determination of eligibility for participation or benefits, the maintenance of service and employment records, the calculation of benefits, and the processing of claims. <em>Id. </em>A person performing these functions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-12\">is not a fiduciary because such person does not have discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of the plan, does not exercise any authority or control respecting management or disposition of the assets of the plan, and does not render investment advice with respect to any money or other property of the plan and has no authority or responsibility to do so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-13\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b111-14\">The defendants\u2019 duties, as alleged in the complaint, are insufficient to support a finding that they are fiduciaries. The single paragraph of the complaint that addresses their responsibilities in relation to the plan states only that each month the Trust presented an invoice to County Line which \u201cset forth Patricia Kleppner as a covered employee of County Line.\u201d Compl. U15. The defendants\u2019 acts in guaranteeing eligibility and remitting premiums to the Trust cannot be construed as discretionary. Because the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to support an inference that any of the defendants is a plan fiduciary, no liability can attach to them under \u00a7 1132(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-15\"><em>United States Steel Corp. v. Com. of Pennsylvania Human Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>669 F.2d 124, 127 (3d Cir.1982), cited by the plaintiffs, is inapposite. We agree with the plaintiffs that there is \u201ca legislative presumption that not infrequently the same entity would be both employer and fiduciary and that an employer who sponsors an employee benefit plan for its employees and determines the terms of its employees health insurance plan, is a fiduciary under ERISA.\u201d Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellants at 26; <em>see United States Steel Corp., </em>669 F.2d at 127. However, the employer must exercise the requisite degree of control and discretion to be held liable as a fiduciary. The plaintiffs\u2019 allegations do not permit such an inference in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The plaintiffs also seek to premise ERISA liability on a theory of restitution under \u00a7 1132(a)(3). The defendants respond that restitution is not available because they were not unjustly enriched and that the claim against them is essentially one at law for damages. The district court correctly stated that to receive restitution, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant \u201chad wrongfully secured a benefit, or had passively received one which it would be unconscionable for him to retain.\u201d <em>Geller, </em>1995 WL 313123 at <em>*4 </em>(quoting Plaintiffs\u2019 Mem. at 18). In an action for restitution, the essential inquiry \u201cis whether it is against equity and good conscience to permit the defendant to retain what is sought to be recovered.\u201d <em>Paramount Film Distrib. Corp. v. State, </em>30 N.Y.2d 415, 421, 334 N.Y.S.2d 388, 393, 285 N.E.2d 695, 700 (1972) (citations omitted). The complaint alleges that Kleppner, not the defendants, received the health care benefits and that the payments from the Trust were solely on Kleppner\u2019s behalf. Because the defendants were not unjustly enriched, a restitution award is not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">II. New York common law claims</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The district court held that the plaintiffs\u2019 state common law claims of fraud and restitution concern matters that \u201crelate to\u201d employee benefit plans and are therefore preempted by ERISA The plaintiffs\u2019 third cause of action seeks reimbursement of the $104,554.82 based upon unjust enrichment and restitution under New York common law. Although there are strong policy reasons to permit such claims to preserve the integrity of employee benefit plans, restitution under common law may be preempted because restitution is accounted for in ERISA. <em>See Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs., </em>508 U.S. 248, 256-59,113 S.Ct. 2063, 2068-70, 124 L.Ed.2d 161 (1993) (noting that restitution may be an appropriate equitable remedy in an ERISA case under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3)). In any event, we need not reach this issue because restitution will not he for the reasons stated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">We believe, however, that the plaintiffs\u2019 fraud claim may stand. ERISA is a remedial statute enacted to protect the interests of beneficiaries of private retirement plans by reducing the risk of loss of pension benefits. ERISA established a comprehensive federal statutory program intended to control abuses associated with pension benefit plans. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (statement of congressional purpose). \u201cTo protect the integrity of the federal regulatory scheme,\u201d <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. v. Kramarsky, </em>650 F.2d 1287, 1292 (2d Cir.1981), ERISA expressly preempts \u201cany and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan\u201d covered by the statute, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a). \u201c[T]he express preemption provisions of ERISA are deliberately expansive,\u201d <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 45-46,107 S.Ct. 1549, 1551-52, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987); indeed, they are among the broadest that can be found in the law. However, the intent of Congress \u201cwas not to foreclose every state action with a conceivable effect upon ERISA plans, but to maintain exclusive federal control over the regulation of such plans.\u201d <em>NYS Health Maintenance Org. Conference v. Curiale, </em>64 F.3d 794, 803 (2d Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The district court held that the plaintiffs\u2019 common law fraud claim was preempted by ERISA on the ground that it \u201crelated to\u201d an ERISA-regulated employee benefit plan in the sense that it has \u201ca connection with or reference to\u201d an employee benefit plan. The district court reasoned simply that the plaintiffs\u2019 common law fraud claim \u201crelated to\u201d the plan because it \u201car[o]se directly out of the allegedly improper administration of the plan.\u201d <em>Geller, </em>1995 WL 313123 at *2; <em>see McNamee v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>692 F.Supp. 1477, 1479 (E.D.N.Y.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">We have held previously that a common law fraud claim for misconduct arising from the administration of an ERISA plan may be preempted. In <em>Diduck v. Kaszycki &amp; Sons Contractors, Inc., </em>974 F.2d 270 (2d Cir.1992), a demolition company failed to make required pension fund contributions for a group of \u201coff-the-books\u201d workers. We held that the class action plaintiffs\u2019 common law fraud claim on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of the pension plan was preempted on the ground that the claim had \u201cas a \u2018critical factor in establishing liability5 the existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>of a plan and duties similar to those imposed by ERISA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288. In this case, however, allowing the plaintiffs to pursue their common law fraud claim would in no way compromise the purpose of Congress and does not impede federal control over the regulation of employee benefit plans. To the contrary, \u201cinsuring the honest administration of financially sound plans\u201d is critical to the accomplishment of ERISA\u2019s mission. <em>Pompano v. Michael Schiavone &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>680 F.2d 911, 914 (2d Cir.) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1039, 103 S.Ct. 454, 74 L.Ed.2d 607 (1982). ERISA is designed to protect the interests of participants and beneficiaries of employee benefit plans, <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, </em>498 U.S. 133, 137, 111 S.Ct. 478, 482, 112 L.Ed.2d 474 (1990), and the preemption provision should not be read to contravene the statute\u2019s underlying design. The unauthorized diminution of pension benefits \u2014 in the present case, the outright squandering of funds \u2014 is squarely at odds with the congressional purpose of protecting pension benefits. The plaintiffs\u2019 common law fraud claim, which seeks to advance the rights and expectations created by ERISA, is not preempted simply because it may have a tangential impact on employee benefit plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We are persuaded further in this conclusion by the fact that although the defendants improperly administered the plan, the essence of the plaintiffs\u2019 fraud claim does not rely on the pension plan\u2019s operation or management. The \u201cbare bones\u201d of the claim are that 1) the defendants fraudulently misrepresented that Kleppner was a full-time employee and 2) in reliance on the defendants\u2019 representation, the plaintiffs paid out more than $104,000 on her behalf. The plan was only the context in which this garden variety fraud occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the plaintiffs state a valid cause of action under New York law for fraud, and we vacate the order of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
