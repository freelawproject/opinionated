While on supervised release, Lomayaoma was implicated in a child molestation incident. The district court held a hearing and then decided to revoke Lomayaoma\u2019s supervised release. We determine that the district court had jurisdiction under the Indian Major Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b233-17\">In September 1990, Lomayaoma was indicted in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona for violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153 &amp; 2244(a)(1). The indictment charged Lomayaoma with one count of abusive sexual contact with a minor female child under the age of twelve. The indictment alleged that this criminal sexual contact took place on the Hopi Indian Reservation. Lomayaoma pled guilty to the indictment in November 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-18\">In February 1991, the district court sentenced Lomayaoma to a fine, twenty-one months of imprisonment, and thirty-six months of supervised release. The court conditioned the supervised release on Lomayaoma\u2019s remaining \u201claw abiding.\u201d The issues on appeal relate to Lomayaoma\u2019s conduct during his supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-19\">In July 1995, Lomayaoma\u2019s probation officer, James Barqu\u00edn, petitioned the court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>revocation of Lomayaoma\u2019s supervised release. The petition alleged that Lomayaoma had committed two counts of child molestation on August 2, 1994, in violation of the condition of his supervised release. Lomayaoma opposed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">On October 13, 1995, the district court conducted an evidentiary hearing. The court heard the testimony of the alleged victims, Mary and Jane Doe,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as testimony from Angelina Talyumptewa, a Counselor for the Hopi Children\u2019s Court. The testimony established that on the morning of August 2, 1994, Lomayaoma, without permission, entered the victims\u2019 home, which is located in Polaeca, Arizona on the Hopi Indian Reservation. Mary and Jane were the only persons at the home on the morning of August 2, 1995. Mary was fourteen years old and Jane was twelve at the time of the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The events as alleged by the two girls are as follows. Lomayaoma entered Jane\u2019s bedroom and woke her by touching her on her breast or stomach area.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Jane did not yell or scream and the defendant left the room. Lomayaoma then entered Mary\u2019s bedroom. He woke her by placing his hand on her vagina.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mary testified that the touching occurred through the blankets and her clothes, but was forceful enough for her to feel its pressure, giving her a \u201ctingly feeling.\u201d Mary also testified that Lomayaoma\u2019s touching made her feel \u201cdirty\u201d and \u201cawful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Lomayaoma then fled the house. Shortly thereafter, Jane telephoned her mother, who immediately notified the Hopi Tribal Police. The police went to the victims\u2019 home with Talyumptewa, the Hopi Children\u2019s Court Counselor, to investigate the incident. Talyumptewa testified that the ordeal had adversely affected the girls, making psychological counseling necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">The court found that the testimony of the two sisters was credible and that the nature of the acts would constitute illegal sexual contact under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court then concluded that the government had proved that Lomayaoma had failed to remain law abiding.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-16\">At a final hearing held on November 6, 1995, Lomayaoma moved to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. The court denied the motion. In an order filed November 7, 1995, the district court sentenced Lomayaoma to ten months imprisonment for violation of the terms of his supervised release. Lomayaoma now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b234-18\">Before we reach the merits, we address Lomayaoma\u2019s argument that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), requires us to find that the Indian Major Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153, is unconstitutional. In addressing this argument, we look first to <em>Lopez </em>and then to the Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996). We then consider the Indian Major Crimes Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-23\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b234-24\"><em>Lopez </em>addressed a conviction under the Gun-Free School Zones Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 22(q)(l)(A) (1988 ed. Supp. V). <em>Lopez, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 115 S.Ct. at 1626. In the Gun-Free School Zones Act, Congress criminai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>ized possession of a firearm within defined school zones. Alfonso Lopez, Jr., a 12th-' grade student, was convicted under the Act after he arrived at his high school carrying a handgun and five bullets. <em>Id. </em>In overturning Lopez\u2019s conviction, the Fifth Circuit held that the Gun-Free School Zones Act was \u201cinvalid as beyond the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 2 F.3d 1342, 1367-68 (5th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The Supreme Court affirmed. The Court began its analysis with what it termed \u201cfirst principles.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>- U.S. at -, 115 S.Ct. at 1626. Among these constitutional precepts, the Court explained, is the principle that Congress\u2019s power to legislate under the authority of the Interstate Commerce Clause is necessarily limited. <em>Id. </em>at-- -, 115 S.Ct. at 1626-27. Thus, Congress may regulate only those activities that \u201csubstantially a\u00a3fect[ ]\u201d interstate commerce. <em>Id. </em>at-, 115 S.Ct. at 1630. The Court stated, \u201cby its terms the [Gun-Free School Zones] Act has nothing to do with \u2018commerce\u2019 or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>at ---, 115 S.Ct. at 1630-31; <em>see </em>Charles Fried, <em>The Supreme Court, 1994 Term </em>\u2014 Foreword: <em>Revolutions?, </em>109 Harv. L.Rev. 13, 41 (1994). The fact that education is an area \u201cwhere States historically have been sovereign\u201d increased the Court\u2019s concern that Congress was exceeding its Interstate Commerce Clause power by regulating guns in local school zones. <em>Lopez, </em>at-- -, 115 S.Ct. at 1632-33; Fried, 109 Harv. L.Rev. at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-18\">In <em>Seminole Tribe, </em>the Supreme Court struck 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710(d)(7), in which Congress purported to authorize tribes to sue states in federal court to enforce the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. The Seminole Tribe used this provision to sue Florida. Florida argued that the suit violated its Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit in federal court. The Supreme Court agreed, holding that Congress could not use the Indian Commerce Clause to abrogate Florida\u2019s Eleventh Amendment immunity. <em>Seminole Tribe, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 116 S.Ct. at 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-19\">However, the Court then took care to reaffirm the principle that Indian commerce is under the exclusive control of the Federal government. <em>Seminole Tribe, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 116 S.Ct. at 1126. Indeed, the Court recognized that although they are similar, the Indian Commerce Clause confers more extensive power on Congress than does the Interstate Commerce Clause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-23\">Reading <em>Lopez </em>with <em>Seminole Tribe, </em>we do not believe that the Court has called into question Congress\u2019s authority under the Indian Commerce Clause to regulate Indian criminal conduct in Indian country.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-24\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b235-25\">Historically, Congress has held plenary authority to regulate Indian affairs. This power \u201cto deal with the special problems of Indians is drawn both explicitly and implicitly from the Constitution itself. Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3, provides Congress with the power to \u2018regulate Commerce ... with the Indian Tribes,\u2019 and thus, to this extent, singles Indians out as a proper subject for separate legislation.\u201d <em>Morton v. Mancari, </em>417 U.S. 535, 551-52, 94 S.Ct. 2474, 2483, 41 L.Ed.2d 290 (1974). <em>See also </em>William C. Canby, Jr., <em>American Indian Law </em>2, 11-12 (2d ed.1988) (discussing federal power over Indian affairs). We therefore note at the outset that \u201cfirst principles\u2019\u2019 in federal Indian law are distinct from those governing the federal regulation of interstate commerce. <em>See </em>Philip Frickey, <em>Marshalling Past and Present: Colonialism, Constitutionalism, and Interpretation in Federal Indian Law, </em>107 Harv. L.Rev. 381, 384 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-26\">In the Indian Major Crimes Act of 1885, Congress chose to \u201cplacet ] under the jurisdiction of the federal courts Indian offenders who commit certain specified major offenses.\u201d <em>Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe, </em>435 U.S. 191, 203, 98 S.Ct. 1011, 1018, 55 L.Ed.2d 209 (1978) (citing Act of Mar. 3, 1885, \u00a7 9, 23 Stat. 385, now codified, as amended, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153). In 1886, the Supreme Court upheld the Indian Major Crimes Act as within the power of Congress to regulate Indian criminal activity in Indian country. <em>United States v. Kagama, </em>118 U.S. 375, 384-85, 6 S.Ct. 1109, 1114, 30 L.Ed. 228 (1886). The Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kagama </em>was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>not anomalous. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Antelope, </em>430 U.S. 641, 648, 97 S.Ct. 1395, 1399, 51 L.Ed.2d 701 (1977), <em>Keeble v. United States, </em>412 U.S. 205, 209, 93 S.Ct. 1993, 1996, 36 L.Ed.2d 844 (1973); <em>Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, </em>187 U.S. 553, 566-67, 23 S.Ct. 216, 221-22, 47 L.Ed. 299 (1903); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>151 U.S. 577, 585, 14 S.Ct. 426, 429, 38 L.Ed. 276 (1894). Even in more recent years, the Court has assumed the constitutionality of the Indian Major Crimes Act. <em>See, e.g., Negonsott v. Samuels, </em>507 U.S. 99, 103, 113 S.Ct. 1119, 1122, 122 L.Ed.2d 457 (1993); <em>Oliphant, </em>435 U.S. at 203-04 &amp; n. 14, 98 S.Ct. at 1018-19 <em>&amp; </em>n. 14. For example, in <em>Negonsott </em>the Court stated: \u201c[a]s the text of \u00a7 1153 ... and our prior cases make clear, federal jurisdiction over the offenses covered by the Indian Major Crimes Act is \u2018exclusive\u2019 of state jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Negonsott, </em>507 U.S. at 103, 113 S.Ct. at 1122 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Neither <em>Lopez </em>nor <em>Seminole Tribe </em>should be read as casting doubt on Congress\u2019s power to enact the Indian Major Crimes Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See Seminole Tribe, </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 116 S.Ct. at 1126; Fried, 109 Harv. L.Rev. at 34-44 <em>(Lopez). Lopez </em>overturned an act of Congress that impinged on state sovereignty, \u2014 U.S. at---, 115 S.Ct. at 1626-27, 32-33, and <em>Seminole Tribe </em>overturned a congressional statute that abrogated the States\u2019 Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity, \u2014 U.S. at-, 116 S.Ct. at 1122. The Indian Major Crimes Act, by contrast, governs an area where Congress has traditionally held plenary and exclusive power. We therefore conclude that Congress did not exceed its powers under the Indian Commerce Clause when it enacted the Indian Major Crimes Act in 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">We have explained that one of the purposes of \u00a7 1153 is to \u201cgrant[ ] exclusive jurisdiction to federal courts for federal or state crimes committed by Indians in Indian country.\u201d <em>United States v. Bear, </em>932 F.2d 1279, 1281 (9th Cir.1990). See <em>Negonsott, </em>507 U.S. at 103, 113 S.Ct. at 1122. Here, Lomayaoma is a Hopi Indian and his' criminal activities occurred on the Hopi Indian Reservation. This case undoubtedly falls squarely within the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction as defined by Congress in \u00a7 1153(a). <em>See Bear, </em>932 F.2d at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">We turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">We review a district court\u2019s application of the supervised release statute de novo. <em>United States v. Lockard, </em>910 F.2d 542 (9th Cir.1990). We review a district court\u2019s factual findings at the sentencing phase for clear error. <em>United States v. Haggard, </em>41 F.3d 1320, 1329 (9th Cir.1994). We have explained that \u201c[a] district court may \u2018revoke a term of supervised release, and require the person to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release ... if the court ... finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Vallejo, </em>69 F.3d 992, 994 (9th Cir.1995) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3)), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 1447, 134 L.Ed.2d 567 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-17\">A condition of Lomayaoma\u2019s supervised release was that he remain law abiding. Thus, in this case, a conviction is not a prerequisite for revoking supervised release. As the supervised release statute makes clear, the court in this case only needed to look to the testimony presented to determine whether a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d supported the conclusion that Lomayaoma had acted unlawfully. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-18\">The district court conducted a hearing on the events that involved Lomayaoma\u2019s conduct on August 2, 1994. Defense counsel cross-examined the government\u2019s witnesses and was given the opportunity to introduce evidence on behalf of Lomayaoma. After considering the testimony of Mary and Jane, as well as the evaluation of the Hopi Children\u2019s Court Counselor, the district court determined that the testimony of the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>girls was credible. The court then concluded that Lomayaoma had touched the two girls in a manner that would constitute a crime under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Lomayaoma argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a violation under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246 because there was no evidence that he intended to \u201cabuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246. But for purposes of a supervised release revocation hearing, the district court need only conclude that a preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion that Lomayaoma violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2246. The district court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-6\">The purposes or reasons why Mr. Lomayaoma might have been there and might have done \u2014 or did do those things, as I find that he did, it\u2019s reasonable to infer that he was doing it with an intent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade or arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, himself, by those acts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">A preponderance of the evidence in the record supports the district court\u2019s determination that Lomayaoma intended to abuse or at the very least harass Mary and Jane on the morning of August 2,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">TV</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">For the reasons stated above, the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-12\">. Section 1153, entitled \"Offenses committed within Indian country,\" reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-13\">(a) <em>Any Indian who commits against the person or property of another Indian or other person any of the following offenses, </em>namely, murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, maiming, a felony under chapter 109A, incest, assault with intent to commit murder, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault resulting in serious bodily injury ..., an assault against an individual who has not attained the age of 16 years, arson, burglary, robbery, and a felony under section 661 of this tide <em>within the Indian country, shall be subject to the same laws and penalties as all other persons committing any of the above offenses, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-21\">(b) Any offense referred to in subsection (a) of this section that is not defined and punished by Federal law in force within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States shall be defined and punished in accordance with the laws of the State in which such offense was committed as are in force at the time of such offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avf\">18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1153 (West Supp.1996) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b234-7\">.
