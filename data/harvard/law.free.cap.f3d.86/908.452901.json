TWI Ocean Logistic Services (\u201cTWI\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction over TWI\u2019s admiralty action seeking to collect tariff charges and to foreclose a maritime lien against an item of cargo: One (1) Pyramid Tent Arena (\u201cthe Pyramid\u201d), a five-story modular tent-like structure transported by TWI from England to California.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-27\">Pebbles Music, Inc. (\u201cPebbles\u201d) owns the Pyramid. On February 24, 1994, Pebbles leased the Pyramid to Diamond Entertainment II, Inc. (\u201cDiamond\u201d), which is the predecessor in interest to Chariot Entertain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>ment, Inc. (\u201cChariot\u201d). Under the lease agreement, Diamond assumed responsibility for the costs of transporting the Pyramid from Birmingham, England to the back lot of the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada for use as the arena for a series of American Gladiators performances.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">Appellant TWI, a non-vessel-operating common carrier (\u201cNVOCC\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entered into a contract of carriage with Diamond to transport the Pyramid from England to Las Vegas. TWI issued a combined transport bill of lading, consigned to Diamond, for transport of the Pyramid. The notation \u201cFREIGHT PREPAID\u201d appears on the face page of the bill of lading. The contract provides that \u201c[t]he Carrier [TWI] shall have a lien on the Goods and any documents relating thereto for all sums payable to the Carrier under this Contract____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">TWI contracted with an ocean carrier, Maersk Pacific, Ltd. (\u201cMaersk\u201d), to transport the Pyramid from Felixstowe, England to Newark, New Jersey on Maersk\u2019s vessel, the <em>Lauren.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>The <em>Lauren </em>discharged the Pyramid on April 1, 1994, in the Port of Newark, and TWI paid Maersk in full for its ocean transport services.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">Six weeks later, the Pyramid was delivered to a rail carrier for transport to Long Beach, California. The Pyramid arrived in Long Beach on June 1, 1994, but TWI refused to deliver the Pyramid to Las Vegas, claiming that Diamond and Chariot failed to pay freight and related charges of more than $250,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-11\">On June 27, 1994, TWI filed a verified complaint for foreclosure of a maritime lien against the Pyramid <em>in rem, </em>and for collection of tariff charges against Diamond and Chariot <em>in personam. </em>TWI also filed an ex parte application for maritime arrest of the Pyramid. The district court granted the application for maritime arrest, ordering Maersk to be appointed the Pyramid\u2019s substitute custodian (in lieu of the U.S. Marshal) pending TWI\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">In July 1994, intervenor-claimant Pebbles filed a verified claim to the Pyramid and applied for a mandatory injunction against Diamond and Chariot, seeking an order compelling them to pay TWI for the freight and related charges involved in transporting the Pyramid. The district court denied the request for an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-13\">On October 12, 1994, without presenting factual findings or legal analysis, the district court granted Pebbles\u2019 motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction (under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1)) as to TWI\u2019s <em>in rem </em>action against the Pyramid, and further ordered the dismissal of TWI\u2019s <em>in personam </em>action against Diamond and Chariot. TWI filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-14\">In August 1995, this court dismissed Diamond and Chariot as appellees for failure to appoint new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-15\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b991-16\">As a threshold matter, Pebbles contends that the determination of a valid lien is a prerequisite for jurisdiction over TWI\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>admiralty action. TWI disagrees. We review de novo the district court\u2019s conclusion that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Seven Resorts, Inc. v. Cantlen, 57 </em>F.3d 771, 772 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">In <em>The Rock Island Bridge, </em>73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 213, 18 L.Ed. 753 (1867), the Supreme Court stated: \u201cThe lien and the proceeding <em>in rem </em>are, therefore, correlative-where one exists, the other can be taken, and not otherwise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>73 U.S. at 215; <em>see </em>Grant Gilmore &amp; Charles L. Black, Jr., The Law of Admiralty \u00a7 9-19, at 622 (2d ed. 1975) (\u201cIn American jurisprudence the existence of a maritime lien is synonymous with the availability of a libel <em>in rem.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">Thirty years after <em>The Rock Island Bridge, </em>the Supreme Court indicated that the minimum requirements for admiralty jurisdiction are the <em>res </em>and a maritime contract. In <em>The Resolute, </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-6\">Jurisdiction is the power to adjudicate a case upon the merits, and dispose of it as justice may require. As applied to a suit <em>in rem </em>for the breach of a maritime contract, it presupposes, first, that the contract sued upon is a maritime contract; and, second, that the property proceeded against is within the lawful custody of the court. These are the only requirements necessary to give jurisdiction. Proper cognizance of the parties and subject-matter being conceded, all other matters belong to the merits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-7\">.... In fact, the question of lien or no hen is not one of jurisdiction, but of merits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b992-8\">It is true that there can be no decree <em>in rem </em>against the vessel except for the enforcement of a hen given by the maritime law, or by a state law; but if the existence of such a hen were a question of jurisdiction, then nearly every question arising upon the merits could be made one of jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b992-13\"><em>The Resolute, </em>168 U.S. 437, 439-40, 18 S.Ct. 112, 113, 42 L.Ed. 533 (1897).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-14\">The Supreme Court\u2019s statement that \u201cthe question of a hen or no hen is not one of jurisdiction, but of merits\u201d has been cited with approval by this court. <em>See, e.g., Mel-wire Trading Co. v. M/V Cape Antibes, </em>811 F.2d 1271, 1273 n. 1 (9th Cir.) (\u201cthe Supreme Court held that the question as to whether a maritime hen exists is not one of jurisdiction, but rather involves the merits\u201d), <em>amended on other grounds, </em>830 F.2d 1083 (9th Cir.1987); <em>Beverly Hills Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Compania De Navegacione Almirante S.A., Panama, </em>437 F.2d 301, 305 n. 5 (9th Cir.) (\u201cIt is immaterial to admiralty jurisdiction that the claim of hen ultimately failed. \u2018[T]he question of hen or no hen is not one of jurisdiction, but of merits.\u2019\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>402 U.S. 996, 91 S.Ct. 2173, 29 L.Ed.2d 161 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-15\">Since TWI\u2019s bill of lading, which contains a clause reserving a hen on the cargo for freight, is a maritime contract (involving ocean carriage)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and since the Pyramid is physicahy within the \u201clawful custody of the court,\u201d TWI satisfied the \u201conly requirements necessary to give jurisdiction.\u201d <em>See The Resolute, 168 </em>U.S. at 439, 18 S.Ct. at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-16\">Accordingly, the district court erred in dismissing TWI\u2019s action against the Pyramid for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Ordinarily, this conclusion would end our inquiry and necessitate a remand to give the district court an opportunity to consider the legal question of whether an NVOCC such as TWI is entitled to a maritime hen on cargo. However, because the district court dismissed TWI\u2019s <em>in rem </em>action on the ground that an NVOCC cannot claim a maritime hen on cargo,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we are in a position to review de novo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>this purely legal issue, which has been fully briefed on appeal.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">The issue of whether an NVOCC can have a maritime lien on cargo is a matter of first impression nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">Pebbles argues that TWI is not entitled to a maritime lien on the Pyramid because, as an NVOCC, TWI was not the vessel owner in possession of the cargo and, therefore, lacks standing to assert a maritime lien. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-8\">Pebbles correctly notes that courts are reluctant to recognize new forms of maritime liens. <em>See Melwire, </em>811 F.2d at 1273 (citations omitted) (\u201cMaritime hens must be construed <em>\u2018stricti juris, </em>and cannot be extended by construction, analogy, or inference.\u2019 Consequently, \u2018[t]he only hens recognized today are those created by statute and those historically recognized in maritime law.\u2019 \u201d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-9\">We do not beheve that recognizing an <em>in rem </em>hen on cargo in favor of NVOCCs would appreciably expand the universe of maritime hens. The carrier\u2019s hen for ocean freight is well-established and NVOCCs are common carriers regulated by the Federal Maritime Commission (\u201cFMC\u201d). Although TWI neither owned nor operated the vessel transporting the Pyramid, TWI nonetheless assumed responsibility for the transportation as a \u201ccarrier\u201d within the meaning of that term in maritime law.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">For centuries, courts have held that people who own and operate a vessel have a lien on the cargo transported on their ships. <em>The Bird of Paradise, </em>72 U.S. (5 Wall.) 545, 555, 18 L.Ed. 662 (1866) (\u201cLegal effect of such a lien is, that the ship-owner, as carrier by water, may retain the goods until the freight is paid, or he may enforce the same by a proceeding <em>in rem </em>in the District Court.\u201d); <em>In re 4,885 Bags of Linseed, </em>66 U.S. (1 Black) 108, 113, 17 L.Ed. 35 (1861) (\u201cThe lien of the carrier by water for his freight, under the ordinary bill of lading, although it is maritime, yet it stands upon the same ground with the carrier by land, and arises from his right to retain the possession until the freight is paid, and is lost by an unconditional delivery to the consignee.\u201d). Courts later permitted persons who merely <em>operate </em>a vessel (but who do not own it) to assert a lien on the cargo transported on that vessel. <em>T.J. Stevenson &amp; Co. v. 81,193 Bags of Flour, </em>449 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>F.Supp. 84, 120 (S.D.Ala.1976), <em>aff'd in part &amp; rev\u2019d in part, </em>629 F.2d 338, 375 (5th Cir. 1980) (holding that time charterer who operated a vessel owned by another had maritime lien for unpaid freight); <em>Dominica Mining Co. v. Port Everglades Towing Co., Inc., </em>318 F.Supp. 500, 506 (S.D.Fla.1969) (holding that bareboat charterer had lien for unpaid freight), <em>aff'd without opinion, </em>433 F.2d 986 (5th Cir.1970). When these later courts did this, they implicitly recognized that it was the carrier\u2019s assumption of responsibility for the transport of the cargo that conferred the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">NVOCCs assume the same responsibility for the delivery of cargo as do vessel owners or operators. 46 U.S.C.A.App. \u00a7 1702(17) (\u201c[an NVOCC is] a common carrier\u201d); 46 U.S.C.A.App. \u00a7 1702(6)(A) (\u201c[a common carrier is] a person that ... assumes responsibility for the transportation from the port or point of receipt to the port or point of destination ...\u201d); <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Am. Ins. Co. v. Puerto Rican Forwarding Co., Inc., </em>492 F.2d 1294, 1295 (1st Cir.1974) (\u201calthough [an NVOCC] may not own the ships on which its customers\u2019 goods are physically transported, it nevertheless is the \u2018carrier\u2019 <em>responsible far the through transportation </em>of such goods, including the water portion\u201d) (emphasis added). We see no reason to deny NVOCCs the same rights to assert a lien that are possessed by these other carriers. We therefore hold that NVOCCs have an <em>in rem </em>maritime lien for unpaid freight against the cargo they are responsible for transporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Moreover, we note that TWI specifically reserved a lien on the Pyramid in its contract of carriage with Diamond. Contractual provisions regarding Kens on cargo for freight are enforceable in admiralty. <em>The Bird of Paradise, </em>72 U.S. at 555 (\u201cParties ... may frame their contract of affreightment as they please, and of course may employ words to affirm the existence of the maritime Ken, or to extend or modify it____ [A]nd where they so agree, the settled rule in this court is, that the law wiK uphold the agreement and support the Ken.\u201d); <em>Melwire, </em>830 F.2d at 1083 (citations omitted) (\u201cIt is weU-estabKshed that breach of a shipping contract may give rise to a maritime Ken.\u201d); Eric M. Danoff, Provisional Remedies in Admiralty United States, 4 U.S.F. Mar. L.J. 293, 299 (1992) (\u201c[A] Ken on the cargo is normaKy expressly granted in the biUs of lading and charter parties. If so, the extent of the relevant Ken is governed by the terms of the Ken clause.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">Even if TWI has standing to assert a maritime Ken, Pebbles contends that the Ken was extinguished by the deKvery of the Pyramid to the rail carrier and by TWI\u2019s full payment to the ocean carrier. These arguments are meritless and wiK be addressed in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">Unlike a maritime Ken that attaches to the vessel itself, a Ken on cargo for freight is lost by an unqualified delivery of the cargo. <em>4,885 Bags of Linseed, </em>66 U.S. at 113 (\u201cif [the shipowner] delivers [the goods], the incumbrances of the Ken does not foKow them in the hands of the owner or consignee\u201d); <em>Beverly Hills Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>437 F.2d at 304 (citations omitted) (\u201cIt is extinguished by unconditional deKvery of the goods.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">However, courts have emphasized that the preservation of the cargo Ken does not require that the cargo remain on the vessel. Provided that the carrier has not unconditionaKy deKvered the cargo to the consignee, the carrier may preserve the Ken by maintaining actual or constructive possession of the cargo. <em>See 4,885 Bags of Linseed, </em>66 U.S. at 114 (\u201c[I]t is frequently, perhaps more usuaKy, understood between the parties, that transferring the goods from the ship to the warehouse shaK not be regarded as a waiver of the Ken, and that the shipowner reserves the right to proceed <em>in rem </em>to enforce it, if the freight is not paid.\u201d); <em>Beverly Hills Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>437 F.2d at 304 (\u201c[T]he vessel owner\u2019s Ken on cargo for freight continues only so long as the cargo remains in the owner\u2019s actual or constructive possession.\u201d); <em>see also 2 </em>Benedict on Admiralty \u00a7 23, at 2-19 to 2-20 (7th ed. rev.1995)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>(citing <em>The Saturnus, </em>250 F. 407 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>247 U.S. 521, 38 S.Ct. 583, 62 L.Ed. 1247 (1918)) (\u201cSuch liens are not strictly a privilege, as are liens on ships, but are approximate to the possessory lien of the land carrier and do not survive unconditional delivery of the cargo.\u201d); 1 Thomas J. Schoenbaum, Admiralty and Maritime Law \u00a7 9-1, at 489-90 (2d ed.1994) (footnote omitted) (\u201cThe deposit of the goods in a warehouse will not be considered an unconditional delivery giving up the lien, however, if the evidence shows the parties intended to preserve it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">TWI preserved its cargo lien by maintaining actual or constructive possession of the Pyramid until the district court granted TWI\u2019s application for its arrest.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At no point did TWI deliver the Pyramid, conditionally or unconditionally, to Diamond and Chariot. Accordingly, the fact that the Pyramid was not on board the vessel <em>Lauren </em>when TWI filed its complaint in admiralty poses no bar to the enforcement of TWI\u2019s cargo lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">In addition, by paying Maersk for the freight due on the bill of lading between Maersk and TWI, TWI by no means extinguished its lien for the freight due on its bill of lading with Diamond and Chariot. By definition, NVOCCs such as TWI have an obligation to pay the freight to the actual water carrier, while expecting to receive from the shipper a slightly higher freight. TWI fulfilled its obligation to Maersk, but Diamond and Chariot failed to satisfy their obligation to pay the freight charged by TWI.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aoh\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Pebbles goes on to contend that the notation \u201cFREIGHT PREPAID\u201d on TWI\u2019s bill of lading equitably estops TWI from claiming that Diamond and Chariot did not actually pay the freight. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">\u201cThe estoppel doctrine requires that the consignee be in good faith and rely upon the false bill of lading. Without reliance, the holder of the bill cannot have been harmed by any false description of the goods and cannot recover.\u201d 2 Schoenbaum \u00a7 10-12, at 56 (footnotes omitted); <em>see Portland Fish Co. v. States S.S. Co., </em>510 F.2d 628, 633 (9th Cir.1974) (\u201cabsent reliance, there can be no estoppel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">Diamond and Chariot cannot show good faith or detrimental reliance since they did not actually pay the freight to TWI.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Unlike the shipper who successfully invoked equitable estoppel on \u201cfreight prepaid\u201d bills of lading in <em>Mediterranean Shipping Co. v. Elof Hansson, Inc., </em>693 F.Supp. 80 (S.D.N.Y.1988), Diamond is not in danger of paying the freight twice. The shipper in <em>Mediterranean Shipping </em>paid all freight charges due on the bills of lading to its supplier in reliance on (1) the carrier marking the bills of lading \u201cfreight prepaid,\u201d and (2) the supplier paying over to the carrier the freight monies received from the shipper. <em>Id. </em>at 81. However, unbeknownst to the shipper, the supplier terminated its business without transferring the freight monies to the carrier. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">In its verified complaint, TWI asserted an <em>in personam </em>cause of action against Diamond and Chariot for collection of tariff charges under the Shipping Act of 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">In response to Pebbles\u2019 motion to dismiss TWI\u2019s <em>in rem </em>action against the Pyramid under a cargo lien theory, the district court dismissed not only TWI\u2019s <em>in rem </em>lien action, but also TWI\u2019s <em>in personam </em>action against Diamond and Chariot. The district court dismissed the latter action even though (1) Pebbles\u2019 motion referred only to the <em>in rem </em>action, and (2) Diamond and Chariot never moved to dismiss the <em>in personam </em>action against them. <em>Cf. Melwire, </em>811 F.2d at 1274 &amp; n. 2 (affirming dismissal of admiralty action <em>in rem, </em>but stressing that this holding \u201cdoes not affect any action by Melwire <em>in personam </em>against the [vessel owner]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">This court has clearly held \u201cthat an implied private cause of action under the Shipping Act allows carriers to sue shippers to collect fees owed pursuant to the published tariffs.\u201d <em>Sea-Land Service, Inc. v.
