CSX Transportation sought to consolidate four separate railroads that it had acquired. The unions representing the railroads\u2019 employees opposed the consolidation. After the arbitrator\u2019s award in favor of CSX\u2019s proposed consolidation was upheld by the Interstate Commerce Commission (\u201cICC\u201d), the unions threatened a strike. CSX then obtained an injunction prohibiting that strike. The unions now appeal this injunction, contending that the NorrisLaGuardia Act (\u201cNLGA\u201d) prohibits anti-strike injunctions to enforce arbitration awards under the Interstate Commerce Act. We disagree. The NLGA may not be used to circumvent the \u201cfinal, binding, and conclusive\u201d arbitration process that is undertaken pursuant to the ICC\u2019s interpretation of the ICA, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11347 (now recodified at 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11326). <em>New York Dock Railway-Control-Brooklyn Eastern Dist. Terminal, </em>360 I.C.C. 60, 78, 88 (1979), <em>aff'd sub nom. New York Dock Ry. v. United States, </em>609 F.2d 83 (2d Cir.1979). We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-16\">CSX Transportation, Inc. was formed from eleven rail carriers and their subsidiaries, including the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (\u201cB &amp; 0\u201d), the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad (\u201cC &amp; O\u201d), the Western Maryland Railway (\u201cWM\u201d), the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, Seaboard Coast Line Railroad, and the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad (\u201cRF &amp; P\u201d). The CSX network is one of the nation\u2019s largest, totaling 18,800 miles in 19 states, the District of Columbia, and Ontario, Canada. Its employees are represented by the United Transportation Union and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (\u201cunions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-17\">CSX has attempted to merge these various operations into a single, integrated network. It is one of these attempts at consolidation that gave rise to the present dispute. CSX claimed that its attempts at integration were hindered by the existence of separate labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>agreements with the railroads\u2019 unions. The practical result of these separate agreements was that CSX could not use its engineers and trainmen throughout its system, but was forced to operate separate workforces within the geographic confines of each former railroad. This apparently caused train delays (as trains passing from one railroad to the next had to switch crews) and frustrated CSX\u2019s ability to efficiently allocate manpower across railroad boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">On January 10, 1994, CSX gave notice to the unions that it intended to consolidate train operations on the WM, RF <em>&amp; </em>P, a portion of the C &amp; 0, and then merge these into the B &amp; 0. This would create a unified operation between southern Pennsylvania and southern Virginia called the Eastern B &amp; 0 Consolidated District. The new territory was to be governed by the collective bargaining agreement applicable to the former B &amp; 0 district, and the consolidation therefore would require changes in the collective bargaining agreements for the WM, RF &amp; P, and the C &amp; 0. In particular, the working and seniority lists of the various territories would be consolidated, there would be a temporary loss of positions (CSX anticipated adding more trains and positions after the consolidation), some supply points would be closed, and reporting points would be changed for some employees, thus requiring their transfer. Otherwise, the terms of the collective bargaining agreements applicable to the employees on these lines would remain unchanged in the new B &amp; 0 district.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Pursuant to \u00a7 11347 of the ICA as interpreted by the ICC\u2019s decision in <em>New York Dock, </em>360 I.C.C. at 60, a railroad must establish protective conditions for employees who are adversely affected by a consolidation. 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11347. Because the unions claimed that CSX\u2019s planned alteration of bargaining units would violate <em>New York Dock, </em>the unions refused to participate in the negotiation of a protective agreement. Under the terms of <em>New York Dock, </em>the dispute was then submitted to mandatory arbitration. Both the unions and CSX agreed to Robert M. O\u2019Brien as their arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">O\u2019Brien held a hearing on March 28, 1995. At this hearing, both parties presented extensive arguments and a \u201cplethora of evidence.\u201d On April 24, the ALJ, pursuant to New York <em>Dock, </em>360 I.C.C. at 78, issued his \u201cfinal, binding, and conclusive\u201d award. O\u2019Brien agreed with CSX, holding that CSX\u2019s proposed changes flowed from the merger and were necessary to secure the public benefits of that merger: \u201cWere the Carrier required to continue operating this territory as four separate railroads each with its own work force and seniority district, the operating efficiencies contemplated by the coordination would be illusory.\u201d O\u2019Brien noted that the vast majority of the former collective bargaining agreements would be preserved in the consolidation and that this case was not an attempt by CSX to transfer wealth from employees to CSX. Indeed, under the <em>New York Dock </em>protective arrangement set forth by CSX, any displaced employees would continue to receive their full wages and fringe benefits for a period of years \u2014 even if they were not working. In short, the arbitrator\u2019s approval of CSX\u2019s consolidation was contingent upon CSX making whole all displaced employees. <em>See New York Dock, </em>360 I.C.C. at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">Both parties appealed aspects of O\u2019Brien\u2019s decision to the ICC. On November 22,1995, the ICC affirmed O\u2019Brien\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">Because the proposed implementing agreements are necessary to effect the proposed transaction and would not override any \u201crights, privileges, and benefits\u201d that must be preserved under our <em>New York Dock </em>labor protection conditions, we conclude that those agreements satisfy the requirements of our labor protection conditions. The agreements should therefore be adopted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">The unions then sought a stay from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The court denied this motion on January 5,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">On January 15, CSX notified the unions that it would implement the consolidation on January 30. Four days before the consolidation was to take place, the unions announced that they would strike unless CSX rescinded its plans. CSX then obtained a preliminary injunction from the district court that barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the proposed strike. On January 30, CSX implemented its consolidation. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Congress has bestowed significant powers on the ICC with respect to rail mergers. The ICC is vested with the \u201cexclusive authority to examine, condition, and approve proposed mergers and consolidations.\u201d <em>Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. Co. v. American Train Dispatchers Ass\u2019n., </em>499 U.S. 117, 119, 111 S.Ct. 1156, 1158, 113 L.Ed.2d 95 (1991). It is also responsible for ensuring that \u201cthe employees of the affected rail carrier will not be in a worse position related to their employment as a result of the transaction.\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11347. Pursuant to the Congressional authority vested in the ICC and \u00a7 11347, the ICC, in <em>New York Dock, </em>360 I.C.C. at 60, adopted \u201ca comprehensive set of conditions and procedures designed to meet its obligations under \u00a7 11347.\u201d <em>American Train Dispatchers Ass\u2019n., </em>499 U.S. at 120, 111 S.Ct. at 1159. These guidelines require consolidating railroads to preserve displaced employees\u2019 pay, working conditions, benefits, and rights to collective bargaining. <em>New York Dock, </em>360 I.C.C. at 77. For example, if an employee is forced to take a lower paying job as a result of the consolidation, a displacement allowance provides the difference in pay between the old and new positions for a period of years. <em>Id. </em>at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\"><em>New York </em>Dock\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 11347 has long been relied upon in settling labor disputes that result from railroad consolidations. <em>See American Train Dispatchers Ass\u2019n., </em>499 U.S. at 120-21, 111 S.Ct. at 1159. <em>New York Dock </em>provides for thirty days of negotiations between the consolidating railroad and its unions \u201cfor the purposes of reaching agreement with respect to application of the terms and conditions\u201d of the labor protective compact. 360 I.C.C. at 77. If no agreement is reached by the end of this period, either party may request arbitration. Once arbitration is requested, the parties are called upon to \u201cselect a neutral referee\u201d and if they cannot agree upon one, the National Mediation Board shall appoint one. <em>Id. </em>at 78. After the arbitration hearing, the referee has thirty days to render a decision, which \u201cshall be final, binding, and conclusive.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Section 11347 and <em>New York Dock </em>seek to achieve a balance between the interests of labor and management. Labor receives guaranteed wage protections while management benefits by avoiding a strike. The avoidance of strikes is crucial to the public interest in maintaining the nation\u2019s transportation system. <em>International Ass\u2019n. of Machinists v. Soo Line Railroad Co., </em>850 F.2d 368, 371 (8th Cir.1988) (an important goal of the ICA is \u201cpreventing labor strife\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>489 U.S. 1010, 109 S.Ct. 1118, 103 L.Ed.2d 181 (1989). \u201cThe peaceable settlement of labor controversies, especially where they may seriously impair the ability of an interstate rail carrier to perform its service to the public, is a matter of public concern.\u201d <em>Virginian Ry. Co. v. System, Federation, </em>300 U.S. 515, 552, 57 S.Ct. 592, 601, 81 L.Ed. 789 (1937). While both sides may thus contest the particulars of a proposed implementing agreement before an arbitrator, the arbitrator\u2019s \u201cfinal, binding, and conclusive\u201d decision prevents either the union or the railroad from holding the nation\u2019s transportation system hostage to its aims.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">The unions claim that the \u201cfinal, binding, and conclusive\u201d arbitration provided for by the ICC is unenforceable if the unions choose to strike. The unions contend that because the NLGA generally prohibits labor injunctions, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101-107, unions may strike if they choose and federal courts are without jurisdiction to enjoin them. Such a strike, however, would unilaterally frustrate the arbitrator\u2019s decision, undermine the ICC\u2019s efforts to \u201censure the development and continuation of a sound rail transportation system,\u201d 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 10101(4), and shut down part of the nation\u2019s vital rail transportation network.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">The NLGA does not command any such result. In fact, the Supreme Court has clearly held that the NLGA will not be interpreted to frustrate the results of binding arbitration. <em>See Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, </em>398 U.S. 235, 251, 90 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>1583, 1592-93, 26 L.Ed.2d 199 (1970); <em>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River &amp; Indiana Railroad Co., </em>353 U.S. 30, 34, 77 S.Ct. 635, 637, 1 L.Ed.2d 622 (1957). And the Eighth Circuit has expressly recognized that the NLGA may not operate to restrict the terms of \u00a7 11347 of the ICA. <em>Burlington Northern Railroad Co. v. United Transportation Union, </em>848 F.2d 856, 862-63 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 969, 109 S.Ct. 499, 102 L.Ed.2d 535 (1988); <em>Missouri Pacific Railroad Co. v. United Transportation Union, </em>782 F.2d 107, 111-12 (8th Cir. 1986). Based on the reasoning of these precedents, we hold that the NLGA does not prohibit an antistrike injunction that is issued to enforce an arbitration award made pursuant to \u00a7 11347 of the ICA.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">While the NLGA generally removes from federal courts the jurisdiction to enjoin labor strikes, its provisions are not absolute. The NLGA allows for an injunction when \u201cunlawful acts have been threatened and will be committed unless restrained,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 107, and when such an injunction would not be \u201ccontrary to the public policy declared in\u201d the NLGA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. Moreover, the Supreme Court has curtailed the sweeping nature of the NLGA in the face of subsequent statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">As labor organizations grew in strength and developed toward maturity, congressional emphasis shifted from protection of the nascent labor movement to the encouragement of collective bargaining and to administrative techniques for the peaceful resolution of industrial disputes. This shift in emphasis was accomplished, however, without extensive revision of many of the older enactments, including the anti-injunction section of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Thus it became the task of the courts to accommodate, to reconcile the older statutes with the more recent ones.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-7\"><em>Boys Markets, </em>398 U.S. at 251, 90 S.Ct. at 1592.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Of substantial concern to courts faced with accommodating the NLGA has been the conflict between the NLGA\u2019s prohibition of labor injunctions and more recent statutes\u2019 arbitration provisions. If a federal court cannot enjoin a strike when a union deems an arbitration award unfavorable, the practical result is that arbitration is meaningless. <em>Id. </em>at 247, 90 S.Ct. at 1590. Indeed, such a \u201c \u201crequest for judicial enforcement may be viewed as the final step in the arbitration process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sear-Land Service, Inc. v. International Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n., </em>625 F.2d 38, 41-2 (5th Cir.1980) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">Recognizing these principles, the Supreme Court has held that the NLGA cannot be used to circumvent the arbitration provided for by the Railway Labor Act (\u201cRLA\u201d). <em>Chicago River, </em>353 U.S. at 42, 77 S.Ct. at 641. Under the RLA, if parties are unable to reach agreement, the dispute may be referred \u201cby either party to the appropriate division of the [National Railroad] Adjustment Board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34, 77 S.Ct. at 637 (quoting 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153, 1st (i)). The arbitration awards of the Board \u201cshall be final and binding upon both parties to the dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153,1st (m)). In <em>Chicago River, </em>the union contended that it could avoid arbitration by striking because the NLGA prevented a court from enjoining such a strike. <em>Id. </em>at 34, 39-40, 77 S.Ct. at 637, 640. The Supreme Court squarely rejected this argument. It found that the union\u2019s interpretation of the NLGA \u201cwould render meaningless those provisions in the [RLA] which allow <em>one </em>side to submit a dispute to the Board, whose decision shall be final and binding on <em>both </em>sides,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 34, 77 S.Ct. at 637, and that \u201cthe specific provisions of the Railway Labor Act take precedence over the more general provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 42, 77 S.Ct. at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">So too has the Court accommodated the NLGA to arbitration provisions in collective bargaining agreements. In <em>Boys Markets, </em>the union called a strike despite the existence of a clause in its collective bargaining agreement requiring that labor disputes be resolved by arbitration. 398 U.S. at 253, 90 S.Ct. at 1594. The district court entered an injunction against the strike. The Supreme Court affirmed the district court\u2019s determination that \u201cthe dispute was subject to arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement and that the strike was in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240, 90 S.Ct. at 1586-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In <em>Boys Markets, </em>the Court focused on the purpose of the NLGA explaining that \u201ca refusal to arbitrate was not \u2018part and parcel of the abuses against which the [NLGA] was aimed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 242, 90 S.Ct. at 1588 (quoting <em>Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, </em>353 U.S. 448, 458, 77 S.Ct. 912, 918-19,1 L.Ed.2d 972 (1957)). While the NLGA was aimed at correcting \u201cthe abuses that had resulted from the interjection of the federal judiciary into union-management disputes on the behalf of management,\u201d arbitration raises no such concern. <em>Id. </em>at 251-53, 90 S.Ct. at 1592-94. When a court enforces an arbitrator\u2019s award, that court is not interjecting itself on behalf of either side. Sometimes enforcement of a neutral arbitrator\u2019s award will benefit the railroads, other times, the unions. <em>See, e.g. Nursing H. &amp; Hosp. Union v. Sky Vue Terrace, </em>759 F.2d 1094, 1098 (3d Cir.1985) (\u201can injunction prohibiting the further distribution of Sky Vue\u2019s assets was necessary to ensure that an arbitral award in the union\u2019s favor was more than a \u2018hollow formality\u201d\u2019). There is no risk, however, of the systemic bias that motivated Congress to enact the NLGA in 1932. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 102. Moreover, the NLGA \u201cmanifests a policy determination that arbitration should be encouraged.\u201d <em>Boys Markets, </em>398 U.S. at 242, 90 S.Ct. at 1588. Section 8 of the NLGA requires parties to make \u201c \u2018every reasonable effort\u2019 to settle the dispute by negotiation, mediation, or \u201cvoluntary arbitration.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lincoln Mills, </em>353 U.S. at 458, 77 S.Ct. at 918 (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 108).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">While the NLGA\u2019s purpose provides the basis for limiting its scope, strikes in the face of labor arbitration awards also fall within the NLGA\u2019s exception for \u201cunlawful acts.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 107. Subsequent statutes, such as the Railway Labor Act, establish arbitration as the remedy for certain labor disputes. <em>See </em>45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153. If a union, as in <em>Chicar go River, </em>seeks to use a strike to violate such a law, this should qualify as an \u201cunlawful act\u201d within the meaning of the NLGA and should therefore preserve the jurisdiction necessary to grant an injunction. The Supreme Court recognized as much when it stated that there \u201cis no substitute for an immediate halt to an <em>illegal </em>strike.\u201d <em>Boys Markets, </em>398 U.S. at 248, 90 S.Ct. at 1591 (emphasis added); <em>see also Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Chicago &amp; North Western Ry. Co., </em>362 U.S. 330, 338-39, 80 S.Ct. 761, 765-66, 4 L.Ed.2d 774 (1960) (\u201cthe <em>Chicago River </em>case [ ] held that a strike could be enjoined to prevent a plain violation of a basic command of the Railway Labor Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">Whether one accommodates the NLGA to arbitration clauses on the basis of the NLGA\u2019s purpose or because of the NLGA\u2019s \u201cunlawful acts\u201d exception, the result is the same. \u201c[T]he Norris-LaGuardia Act must be accommodated to the subsequently enacted provisions ... and the purposes of arbitration.\u201d <em>Boys Markets, </em>398 U.S. at 250, 90 S.Ct. at 1592. The district court thus has the jurisdiction to issue injunctive orders to enforce compliance with arbitration awards notwithstanding the provisions of the NorrisLaGuardia Act. <em>See Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad Co. v. Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n., </em>491 U.S. 490, 513, 109 S.Ct. 2584, 2598, 105 L.Ed.2d 415 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">The same principles that mandate accommodation of the NLGA to arbitration clauses in the RLA and in collective bargaining agreements generally also apply to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 11347. The unions seek to distinguish the RLA provision at issue in <em>Chicago River </em>from \u00a7 11347 by arguing that the former is a labor statute deserving of accommodation and the latter is a transportation statute undeserving of accommodation. But the arbitration procedures under both statutes are indistinguishable provisions governing labor-management disputes. The arbitration process under both statutes operates to protect interstate commerce (as well as labor and railroads) by prohibiting strikes. Section 11347 also guarantees substantial benefits for labor \u2014 presumably in exchange for the prohibition on the right to strike \u2014 including wage maintenance for a period of years following a consolidation. Accordingly, \u00a7 11347, like the RLA\u2019s arbitration provision, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 153, is \u201cpart of a pattern of labor legislation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number><em>Chicago River, </em>353 U.S. at 42, 77 S.Ct. at 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Moreover, the unions\u2019 argument that the NLGA should only be accommodated to other statutes when the result furthers the interests of labor, misses the point of both <em>Chicago River </em>and <em>Boys Markets. </em>In both of those cases, the unions\u2019 proffered interpretation of the NLGA was rejected by the Supreme Court because it would have rendered arbitration involving labor unions meaningless. Such a result, the Supreme Court held, was contrary to both the NLGA and subsequent statutes. <em>See Boys Markets, </em>398 U.S. at 235, 90 S.Ct. at 1585; <em>Chicago River, </em>353 U.S. at 30, 77 S.Ct. at 635. The weakness of the unions\u2019 argument is made evident by the fact that neither of the principal cases relied upon by the unions involved arbitration. <em>See Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie, </em>491 U.S. at 490, 109 S.Ct. at 2584; <em>Railroad Telegraphers, </em>362 U.S. at 330, 80 S.Ct. at 761. In fact, <em>Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie </em>actually supports our holding here: \u201cThus, a union may be enjoined from striking when the dispute concerns the interpretation or application of its contract and is therefore <em>subject to compulsory arbitration.\u201d </em>491 U.S. at 513, 109 S.Ct. at 2598 (emphasis added). In this case, a strike by the unions would have prevented CSX from implementing changes in bargaining agreements that O\u2019Brien, after compulsory arbitration, found were \u201cnecessary to implement the transaction proposed by [CSX]\u201d and that the ICC upheld as necessary to \u201ceffect that carrier\u2019s coordination of operations in a new operating district.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The \u201cfinal, binding, and conclusive\u201d arbitration at issue here is simply indistinguishable from the arbitration provisions at issue in <em>Chicago River </em>and <em>Boys Markets. </em>Certainly when Congress enacted \u00a7 11347 and the ICC adopted the <em>New York Dock </em>conditions, neither contemplated that the NLGA would frustrate a \u201cfinal, binding, and conclusive\u201d arbitration that protects workers while obviating the concern that a strike might hold hostage a portion of our national transportation system. The Eighth Circuit recognized this in <em>Burlington Northern:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">[WJhen a consolidation transaction [is] subject to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 11341, 11347, statutory provisions which specifically exempt carriers from all other law and require mandatory employee protective conditions, neither the RLA nor Norris-LaGuardia could operate to restrict the terms of the ICA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">848 F.2d at 862-63; <em>see also Missouri Pacific, </em>782 F.2d at 111-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">To hold otherwise would thwart the operation of the arbitration provisions in <em>New York Dock. </em>Like previous courts addressing these issues, we too decline to create a conflict between the ICA and the NLGA. <em>See Railway Labor Executives\u2019 Ass\u2019n. v. CSX Transportation, </em>938 F.2d 224, 230 (D.C.Cir.1991) (\u201c[u]se of the RLA\u2019s status quo obligation to halt a sale approved by the ICC under section 11343 would short-circuit the functioning of the ICC and would bring the two statutes into conflict\u201d). After all, it was for Congress and the ICC, pursuant to its delegated authority, \u201cto make the choice of the means by which its objective of securing the uninterrupted service of inter-state railroads was to be secured.\u201d <em>Virginian Ry. Co., </em>300 U.S. at 553, 57 S.Ct. at 602. Given the \u201ccongressional policy in favor of the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate grievance disputes,\u201d <em>Lincoln Mills, </em>353 U.S. at 458-59, 77 S.Ct. at 919, we hold here that \u201cNorris-LaGuardia\u2019s policy of nonintervention by the federal courts should yield to the overriding interest in the successful implementation of the arbitration process.\u201d <em>Boys Markets, </em>398 U.S. at 252, 90 S.Ct. at 1593 (explaining the holding of <em>Chicago River, </em>353 U.S. at 30, 77 S.Ct. at 635). As the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ana\">the very purpose of arbitration procedures is to provide a mechanism for the expeditious settlement of industrial disputes without resort to strikes, lockouts, or other self-help measures. This basic purpose is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>obviously largely undercut if there is no immediate, effective remedy for those very tactics that arbitration is designed to obviate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><em>Boys Markets, </em>398 U.S. at 249, 90 S.Ct. at 1591.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\"> As for the unions\u2019 argument that CSX lacked standing to seek the injunction in the first instance, CSX (as the prevailing party in the arbitration and the party that would be injured by the strike) is the logical one to seek enforcement of the arbitration. <em>See Chicago River, </em>353 U.S. at 30, 77 S.Ct. at 635 (injunction granted to railroad to prevent strike that would have circumvented arbitration); <em>Sky Vue Terrace, </em>759 F.2d at 1094 (injunction granted to union to prevent the dilution of a company\u2019s assets necessary to pay an arbitration award).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
