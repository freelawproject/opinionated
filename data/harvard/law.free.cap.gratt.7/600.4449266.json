Harris and John Hickman for selling ardent spirits to be drank where sold, without a license, to Hugh Ramey. Upon this presentment an information was filed, to which the defendants pleaded jointly \u201cnot guilty;\u201d and were tried together, when the jury found them guilty in manner and form as was alleged in the information.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-8\">When the jury brought in their verdict, the defendants moved the Court to arrest the judgment on the grounds,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9Qj\">*lst. That the information charges the offence jointly against the defendants for committing jointly one offence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-10\">2d. That the verdict of the jury is joint against the two defendants; and the judgment of the Court, if entered up, must impose a fine upon them jointly for one offence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-11\">But the Court overruled the motion, and gave a judgment against each of the defendants for thirty dollars, the fine imposed by the statute, for the use of the Literary fund, and the costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-12\">The defendants applied to the Judge of the Circuit court of Pittsylvania for a writ of error to this judgment, which was awarded. And when the cause came on to be heard, the Court with the assent of the defendants, adjourned to this Court the questions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-13\">1st. Can two persons be jointly indicted, or proceeded against by information, for retailing ardent spirits?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-14\">2d. Is the judgment of the Hustings court of Danville right in rendering, on the finding of the jury, a several fine against each of the plaintiffs in error, for thirty dollars each; or should the Court have rendered judgment against them jointly for the sum of thirty dollars and the costs?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-15\">3d.
