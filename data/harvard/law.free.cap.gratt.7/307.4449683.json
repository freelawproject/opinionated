And if the jury shall believe from the evidence, that the loss and damage were occasioned by the negligence of the plaintiff, or could have been prevented by proper care and diligence on the part of the plaintiff, then the defendant is entitled to the full amount of the loss and damage by way of set off.\u201d To the opinion of the Court refusing the instruction asked, and giving the other, the defendant again excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b133-17\">There was a verdict and judgment in favour of the plaintiff for 172 dollars 72 cents, with interest thereon from the 22d of July 1839, till paid; and thereupon Galt applied to this Court for a supersedeas, which was awarded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-18\">Stanard and Bouldin, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARS\">insisted, that in this case the special contract had not been completely executed ; and therefore, .that the plaintiff below was not entitled to recover upon it, under the common indebitatus count.
