Morgan was indicted, for that he, on the 15th of February 1848, at the county &amp;c., without a license, did sell by retail, to be drank in his house, rum, wine, brandy or other spirituous liquors, to be drank where sold, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-9\">The- defendant demurred to the indictment, on the ground that the charges were laid in the disjunctive: But the Court overruled the demurrer. The defendant then pleaded \u201cnot guilty,\u201d and on the trial demurrer to the evidence; and the Commonwealth joined in the demurrer. Whereupon the jury found a verdict of guilty, subject to the demurrer to evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AlA\">*The evidence consisted of the testimony of a single witness, who deposed, that on the 15th of February 1848, he and John Perry drank spirits at the house of the defendant; which said spirits were called for by Perry, and by him paid for; the purchase having been made of, and the payment made to, the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-14\">The Court gave judgment upon the demurrer to evidence, against the defendant, for a fine of 30 dollars and the costs, Whereupon he applied to this Court for a writ of error, which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-15\">Day, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b310-16\">The Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-11\">Indictments\u2014Sale of Ardent Spirits\u2014Charging Of-fence in the Disjunctive,\u2014Several cases cite and reaffirm the- proposition of the principal case, that it is not error to charge the offence of selling spirituous liquors, wines, etc., without a license, in the disjunctive instead of the con j unctive, by using the word \u201cor\u201d in lieu of \u201cand\u201d in describing the various kinds of liquors and drinks charged in the indictment to have been sold without a license. See Thomas v. Com., 00 Va. 93, 17 S. E. Rep. 788; Cunningham v. State, 5 W. Va. 509; State v. Charlton, <em>11W. </em>Va. 336-7. But, in this last case, the court said; \u201cIt <em>(l e., </em>the decision of the principal case) ought not to be regarded as overthrowing the general rule, that an indictment ought not to state the case disjunctively, when it is thereby left uncertain, what is really intended to be relied on as the accusation. And while <em>Morgan's Case </em>must govern us whenever a case like 'it arises, yet we cannot safely extend it to cases which differ from it and fall within this general rule.\u201d See, further, monographic mofe on \u201cIndictments, Informations and Presentments\u201d appended to Boyle v.
