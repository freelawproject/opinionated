On the trial the jury found a special verdict, which set out the following facts, viz;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-11\">That the defendant received from John G. Oliver the sum of 470 dollars 86 cents, that being the amount of a bond executed by Oliver to J. Murray Yates. That on the 17th of December 1841, the defendant became the surety of Yates in a bond to E. James &amp; Co. for *the sum of 222 dollars 78 cents, in consideration of the promise of Yates to assign to him the bond aforesaid, and other papers, to indemnify him for thus becoming his surety, and for previous liabilities of the defendant as surety for Yates.

That after this act of bankruptcy, Yates wrote an assignment on the bond of Oliver to the defendant; and after the 30th of May 1842, for the first time delivered the bond to the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-12\">On this special verdict the Court rendered a judgment in favour of the plaintiff for 470 dollars 86 cents, with interest from the 21st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>October 1843 till paid, and his costs. Whereupon the defendant applied to this Court for a supersedeas, which was granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-5\">Stanard and Bouldin, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A33s\">admitted that the judgment was in accordance with the decisions in England; but they insisted that the English decisions were founded upon a provision of the English statute to which there was no similar provision in the act of Congress: and that in cases not coming within that provision, the English decisions were opposed to the judgment in this case. They referred to Mogg v. Baker, 3 Mees. &amp; Welsb. 194; Winsor v. M\u2019Bellan, 2 Story\u2019s R. 492; Mitchell v. Winslow, Id. 630; Winsor v.

Alfred Jones, for the appellee, insisted,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJ_\">that the agreement between the appellee and Yates, did not constitute such an equitable assignment of the bond as was protected by the act of Congress. He referred to *Eoster v. Howell, 4 Mass. R. 308; Anderson v. Temple, 4 Burr. R. 2235; Hague v. Rolleston, Id. 2174.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b140-13\">See monographic <em>note </em>on \u201cAssignments\u201d appended to Ragsdale v.

The Court is therefore further of opinion, that the Circuit court erred in pronouncing the law upon the special verdict to be for the defendant in error, and in rendering the judgment thereon in his favour.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">Judgment of the Circuit court reversed, with costs; and this Court proceeding to render such judgment as said Court ought to have rendered, judgment for the plaintiff in error, on the special verdict, with costs, &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
