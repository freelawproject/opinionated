Within the boundaries were two small rocks or islands one fourteen one hundredths of an acre and the other one one hundredth of an acre in area. In 1899'tlie President made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>an order reserving the two rocks and describing them as of the above mentioned fractional acreage for naval purposes.

These rocks or islands rose abruptly out of the Bay of San Francisco. Their sides to the extent that they were covered and uncovered by the flow and ebb of the tide varied from ten to twenty-five feet, depending on their steepness. Both rocks were barren, without soil or water, and were of no value for purposes agricultural or mineral. They lay at a distance of about half a mile of the then shore line of that part of the bay upon which the city of San Francisco fronted.

Upon the acquisition of California from Mexico, under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, May 30, 1848, 9 Stat. 922, all the territory then belonging to Mexico became the property of the United States, both the tide lands and the upland. Excepting the lands which Mexico, prior to the treaty, had granted' or in any way disposed of, the United States became the owner of all the land in California. ' The tide or submerged lands the United States took in trust for the future State of California. <em>San Francisco </em>v. <em>Le Roy, </em>138 U. S. 656, 671; <em>Knight </em>v. <em>U. S. Land </em>Association, 142 U. S. 161, 183. All the rest it held in absolute ownership.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b425-9\">In all the cases where the land, under this doctrine, went to the original States when the Revolution took place, and to the subsequent States upon their admission to the Union, it was submerged land \u2014 land under water, not land above water. The submerged lands which went to the State were lands entirely under water. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Waddell, </em>16 Peters, 367; <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Board of Harbor Commissioners, </em>18 Wall. 57 ; <em>Illinois Cen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number><em>tral Railroad </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>146 U. S. 387; <em>Shively </em>v. <em>Bowlby, </em>152 U. S. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-5\">II. Conceding that, upon the admission of California into the Union, the State took and has since held the ownership of the tide lands, or the submerged lands, or, the navigable waters with the soils under them, to be used in tbust for the people in the furtherance of navigation and commerce, the island or islands known as Mission Rock remained the property of the United States, because they never had been nor are they now tide land, or submerged land, or soil under navigable waters.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-6\">The purchase of over fourteen acres of submerged land surrounding these rocks or islands shows conclusively that the rocks or islands were not submerged land. The submerged land was purchased because of the location of the islands. Without the islands, the soil under the navigable waters of the bay of S\u00e1n Francisco a half mile from shore would have been worthless. The submerged land was bought upon the condition that a marine railway and dry dock should be built at Mission Rock. ' This of itself is sufficient to show the possible use and value of this island, not' as submerged land, but as \u201c fast land,\u201d land above water, permanently fixed, and capable of a valuable commercial use. If valuable to a private individual or corporation for improvement as a site for docks and warehouses, Mission Rock was equally valuable to the United States as a site for naval, military, or commercial purposes. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Shaw, 14 S. &amp; R. 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-7\">III. But it is insisted that upon the admission of California, all property \u201c above and below high water,\u201d not reserved by the United States in the act of admission, passed to the State. This is novel doctrine, and cannot be sustained. <em>Newhall </em>v. <em>Sanger, </em>92 U. S. 761; <em>Leavenworth Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>92 U. S. 733; <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>13 Pet. 498; <em>Doolan </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>125 U. S. 618; <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Tacoma Land Co., </em>153 U. S. 273; <em>Grisar v. McDowell, 6 </em>Wall. 363.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b426-9\">IV. That the title to Mission Rock and the adjacent island never passed to the State of California and still remains in the United States, is conclusively shown by the fact that, by the act under which the defendant claims, the State of California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>never attempted to convey any title to it. The act is entitl\u00e9d, \u201c An act to provide for the sale and conveyance of certain submerged lands in the city and county of San Francisco to Henry B. Tichenor.\u201d It attempts to convey, not Mission Bock, but only the submerged land inclosed in a square measuring 800 feet on each side, surrounding Mission Bock. The island of islands included in the square were, by clear implication, excluded from the proposed grant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-5\">However the patent may read, it cannot extend the grant made by the legislature, which is defined by the act. Under the act nothing but the submerged land, which was ascertained by the survey to contain fourteen and thirty-five one hundredths^ acres, was paid for and conveyed. There is no ambiguity in the act; but if there were, the doubt would be resolved against the grantee. All grants of this description are strictly construed against the grantee; nothing passes but what is conveyed in clear and explicit language. <em>Dubuque etc. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>23 Howard, 66, quoted with approval in <em>Leavenworth etc. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 92 U. S. 733, 740; <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>1 Black, 380 ; <em>Charles River Bridge </em>v. <em>Warren Bridge, </em>11 Peters, 420 ; <em>Delaware Railroad Tax Case, </em>18 Wall. 206, 225.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-6\">Y. The right by the grantee of the State to reclaim the submerged lands surrounding Mission Bock being subordinate to that of the United States as the owner of the island, no title as against the United States ever passed by the patent or the grant on which it was based.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMM\">YI. The State of California did not have unqualified ownership over the submerged lands of San Francisco Bay. It held these lands in trust for the public. It could only convey them to be used for public purposes, and the only public purposes for which these lands could be used was a purpose which required the ownership and use of Mission Bock. The State, therefore, had no power to convey the lands to be held distinct from Mission Bock and in opposition to the title of the United States to one of its islands. <em>Shively </em>v. <em>Bowlby, </em>152 U. S. 1, distinguished; Stoc<em>kham </em>v. <em>Browning, </em>18 N. J. Eq. 390; <em>Blakslee Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakslee &amp;c. Works, </em>129 N. Y. 155.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>VII. Before California was admitted into the Union, the United' States might have granted Mission Book, and, along with it, the right to use the submerged land and the navigable waters covering it, which surrounded the island. It might have granted Mission Bock and the submerged land about it for use for the purposes set out in the California act relied, on in this case. But the United States preferred to reserve Mission Bock for national uses. When the United States reserved Mission Rock for national uses, it also reserved the right to use the surrounding navigable waters and submerged land, for without them no national use could be made of the island. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bellingham Bay Boom Co., </em>176 U. S. 211, 215; <em>Scranton </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>179 U. S. 141.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-5\">VIII. The United States had the absolute and unqualified ownership of Mission Island. The United States might have sold Mission Island to any individual -arid conveyed an absolute, title. What would .this absolute title to Mission Island have included ? To determine this, the nature and location of the island must be considered. It was situated in the bay of San Francisco, half a mile from the shore, surrounded by navigable waters. It was not susceptible of cultivation. It contained no mineral except the rock of which it was composed. It was valuable only for use for war, naval, or commercial purposes, as a site for a fort, a coaling station, warehouses and docks, etc. TJp be used for any of these purposes it was necessary that access should be had from the island to the navigable waters surrounding it; \u00e1nd for this purpose that the contiguous submerged land should be filled up and docks and wharves constructed. This right of access was a property right incident to the ownership of the island. <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>1 Black, 1 (1861); <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Board of Harbor Commissioners, </em>18 Wall. 57; <em>Illinois Central Railroad </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>146 U.

The improvements made at Mission Rock were of such character that they necessarily became, when made, a part of the island itself, impossible to be separated, and therefore the property of the owner of the island. The right of the United States to recover the island consequently carries with it the right to recover the property attached to and made a part of the island. <em>Ledyard </em>v. <em>Ten Eyck, </em>36 Barbour, 102; <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>15 Connecticut, 137, and cases cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-6\">2. It is stated in the third finding that in 1850, when California was admitted into the Union, Mission Rock had an area above high water mark of fourteen one hundredths of an acre, and the adjacent rock or island an area of one one hundredth of an acre.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-7\">It is now conceded that by depositing many thousand tons of rock on the submerged land under the shallow water around and contiguous to Mission Rock and the adjacent island, the area has been increased to about four acres.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-8\">The United States is entitled to recover the entire area claimed by the defendant company, that is, the fourteen and sixty-nine one hundredths acres, because that amount is claimed by the defendant, is held in possession by the defendant, and if necessary to the defendant in order to occupy and use Mission Island, it is equally essential to the United States..</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-9\">To recover Mission Rock as it once stood would be a victory as barren as the rock itself. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Waddell, </em>16 Peters, 367; <em>Den </em>v. <em>Jersey Co., </em>15 Howard, 426; <em>Frisbie </em>v. <em>McClernin, </em>38 California, 568; <em>Coburn </em>v. <em>Ames, </em>52 California, 385.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-10\">21. As to the action of the government officer who fixed the harbor or dock lines surrounding Mission Island, that officer acted simply upon the visible facts presented to him. Having no authority to determine questions of title, his action can in nowise be held to estop the government.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-11\">211. The order of the President may be read without reference to the act of \u2022 July 1, 1864. If, as the Circuit Court of Appeals held, this act had no relation to Mission Rock and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>adjacent islands, \u201c which were, and are far outside of the pueblo grant'of lands claimed by and confirmed to the city,\u201d the order of the President may be read, not as a reservation under that act, but as an appropriation of Mission Island and the small island southeast thereof, with th\u00e9 shores, contiguous submerged land, and navigable water appurtenant thereto, permanently for naval purposes. An appropriation, not in the sense of a condemnation for public purposes of private land, but as a designation of the particular public use to which these islands, long set apart from sale, were to be finally and permanently devoted. See <em>Grisar </em>v. McDowell, 6 Wallace, 363, 381; Opinion Attorney General MacVeagh, 17 Opinions, 160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-5\">If a private corporation had without authority filled in the land and constructed permanent, wharves, piers, docks, etc., making them a part of the islands, then the reservation operated as an appropriation of these additions to the realty, for reasons before stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-6\">If there are any equitable claims to compensation on the part of the defendant, growing out of the cost of the improvements made, these may safely be left to the consideration of Congress.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-7\"><em>Mr. Gha/rles Page, </em>with whom <em>Mr. Edward J.

The. submerged or tide lands became the property of the State on its admission. This right of property included the right to dispose of the land in its discretion, subject only to the right of-control by the national government, if such disposition should interfere with the primary use of the waters over them as a means of commerce. <em>Pollard's Lessee </em>v. <em>Hagan, </em>3 Howard, 221; <em>Shively </em>v. <em>Bowlby, </em>152 U.

Justice McKenna,</author>\n<p id=\"ASr\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u201c It will be observed,\u201d as was said by the Circuit Court of Appeals, \u201cthat the judgment of the Circuit Court was not limited to the two rocks or islands embraced in the executive order of January 13, 1899, the one covering fourteen one hundredths and the other one one hundredth of an acre, but awarded the government the entire tract of fourteen and sixty-nine one hundredths acres, including the warehouses and other improvements constructed by the defendant and its predecessors in interest.\u201d The Circuit Court of Appeals confined the recovery of the plaintiff to the rocks proper and awarded the submerged lands to the defendant. The controversy then is, which party lias the title to the latter. The defendant in error is the successor of the rights and title of the California Dry Dock Company, that company being grantee of Henry. B. Tichenor, who received the patent for the lands on the 11th of July, 1872, from the State of California, in pursuance of and in conformity with an act of the legislature of the State, entitled \u201c An act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>to provide for the sale and conveyance of certain subinerged lands in the city and county of San Francisco to Henry B. Tichenor.\u201d Stat. California, 1869-70, p. 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Had the State the title to convey ? The plaintiff in error, in effect, contests this, and asserts besides a right to the submerged land as an easement appurtenant to the islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The title and dominion which a State acquires to lands under tidewaters by virtue of her sovereignty received elaborate consideration, exposition and illustration in the case of <em>Shively </em>v. <em>Bowlby, </em>152 U. S. 1-58. Prior cases are there collected and quoted, among others, <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>18 Wall. 57, 65. From the latter as follows (and the case concerned tide lands in California): \u201c Although the title to the soil under the tidewaters of the bay was acquired by the United States by cession from Mexico, equally with the title to the upland, they held it only in trust for the future State. Upon the admission of California into the Union upon equal footing with the original States, absolute property in, and dominion and sovereignty over, all soils under the tidewaters within her' limits passed to the State, with the consequent right to dispose of the title to any part of said soils in such manner as she might deem proper, subject only to the paramount right of navigation over the waters, so far as such navigation might be required by the necessities of commerce with foreign nations or among the several States, the regulation of which was vested in the general government.\u201d And Mr. Justice Gray said, delivering the opinion of the court in <em>Shively </em>v. <em>Bowlby: </em>\u201c Each State has dealt with the lands under the tidewaters within its borders according to its' own views of justice and policy, reserving its own'control over such lands, or granting rights therein to individuals or corporations, whether owners of the adjoining upland or not, as it considered for the best interests of the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">This right is an attribute of the sovereignty of the State, and it follows that in the exercise of the right, as said by Mr. Justice- Gray, the State may \u201cdispose of its tide lands free from any easement of the upland proprietor.\u201d The facts of the case emphasized its doctrine, Shively was the owner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>the upland. Bowlby was the grantee of .the State of Oregon of the tide lands in front of Shively\u2019s property. The grant was sustained. The sovereignty of California and the rights and powers dependent upon it are as complete as those of other States. How has California chosen to exercise them ? In other words, what is the law of California as to the title and rights of riparian or littoral proprietors in the soil below high water mark ? Upon the answer to these question the present litigation must be determined. The .title papers of the defendant contain an act of the legislature of the State conveying the lands in controversy in private ownership, and the history of the State shows that the act was in accordance with the policy and practice of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">The legislature, commencing at the first session after the admission of the State into the Union, made grants of the tide lands to municipalities under conditions which contemplated their being conveyed to and held in private ownership. Among these was the act of March 26, 1851, known as the \u201c Beach and Water Lot Act.\u201d It was entitled \u201cAn act to provide for the disposition of certain property of the State of California,.\u201d Section 1 provided that \u201c all the lots of land situated within the following boundaries according to the survey of the city of San Francisco, and the map or plat of the same now on record in the office of the recorder of the county of San Francisco, are known and designated in this act as the San Francisco Beach and Water Lots; that is to say, beginning at the point,\u201d etc. Then follows a description by streets, which includes a portion of the bay. Section 2 grants the use and occupation of the land for ninety-nine years and confirms grants of lands sold by authority of the ayuntamiento, or town or city council, or by any alcalde of said town or city ; and section 4 makes the boundary line described in the first section a permanent water front of the city. These acts came up for consideration, and the character of the title conveyed was defined in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>2 California, 524; <em>Eldridge </em>v. <em>Cowell, </em>4 California, 80, 87; <em>Chapin </em>v. <em>Bourne, </em>8 California, 294; <em>Hyman </em>v. <em>Read, </em>13 California, 445; <em>Holladay </em>v. <em>Frisbie, </em>15 California, 630, 635; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number><em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>16 California, 125; <em>City and County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Straut, </em>84 California, 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">These cases all expressed under varying facts the validity of the title conveyed by the acts'of the legislature. They are re-i viewed in <em>Pacific Gas Imp. Co. </em>v. <em>Ellert, </em>64 Fed. Rep. 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">In <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Underhill, </em>40 California, 473, Mr. Justice Temple .said, speaking of lands below high water mark: \u201c The State can probably sell the land and authorize the purchaser to extend the water front so as to enable him to build upon this land. . . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The decisions cover a period of many years and have become a rule of property and the foundation of many titles. As said by Circuit Judge Ross, delivering the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appfeals: <em>\u201c </em>A large and valuable part of the' city of San Francisco, extending from the present water front to, in some places, Montgomery street, was at the time of and subsequent to the admission of California into the. Union, a part of the submerged lands of the bay, but has since been filled in by many hundred, grantors under, the city and State, who have erected buildings and improvements thereon at costs running into many millions of dollars. All of this was done in aid of commerce, in the upbuilding of a great city upon the bay, and with the encouragement and consent of the general government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">There is nothing inconsistent with these views in <em>Shirley </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>67 California, 545 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gold Run Ditch and Mining Co., </em>66 California, 138, <em>151 ; </em>or in <em>Heckman </em>v. <em>Swett, </em>99 California, 303. In <em>Shirley </em>v. <em>Bishop </em>there was no question of riparian rights. . The defendants attempted, under a franchise from the city of Benicia, to erect a wharf within three feet of the plaintiffs wharf, and parallel to it for sixty feet in the navigable waters of the straits of Carquinez, and beyond the water front, established by an act of the legislature of the State. The building of the wharf was restrained. The other two cases expressed the general doctrine that the title of the State to the lands covered by navigable .waters is held in trust for the public. That doctrine is declared- in all of the cases. It has a conspicuous illustration in the <em>Lake Front Case, (Illinois Central Railroad </em>v. <em>Illinois,) </em>146 U. S. 387, 463. The doctrine and its limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>are expressed in <em>Heckman </em>v. <em>Swett, </em>99 California, 309, and in <em>Shively </em>v. <em>Bowlby. </em>The court said in <em>Heckman </em>v. <em>Swett: </em>\u201c Navigable streams and the shores tb ordinary high water mark are held by the State in trust for the public; but qualified rights therein may be granted, so far as they are not inconsistent with, or are in aid of the principal use, viz., for the purposes of navigation.\u201d In .other words, the rights granted must be in aid of commerce; and it is recognized, as we have seen, in judicial decisions and established by practical examples that the conveyance by the State of its title to tide lands to be held in private ownership free from any .'easement of the upland proprietor, is in aid of commerce, and therefore in strict performance of the State\u2019s trust. See, in addition to the other cases, <em>Oakland </em>v. <em>Oakland Water Front Co., </em>118 California, 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">2. A claim was made in the Circuit Court of Appeals by the plaintiff in error under section 5 of the act of Congress of July 1,1861, entitled \u201cAn act to expedite the. settlement of titles to lands in the State of California.\u201d 13 Stat. 333. By that section the title of the United States to the lands within the corporate limits of the' city of San Francisco was relinquished and granted to the city \u201c for the uses and purposes \u201d specified in a certain ordinance of the city called the Yan Ness ordinance, which ordinance had been ratified by. the legislature of the State. Answering and disposing of the contention of the plaintiff in error, the Circuit Court of Appeals said: \u201c Those uses and purposes . . . had no relation whatever to the rocks or islands here in controversy, which were and are far outside of the pueblo grant of lands claimed by and confirmed to the city.\u201d This is not contested here, but it is urged that \u201c the order of President McKinley may be read, not as a reservation under that act, but as an appropriation ,of Mission Island and the small island southeast thereof, with the shores, contiguous submerged land, and navigable water appurtenant thereto, permanently for naval purposes.\u201d There are two answers to' the contention. The order' of the President explicitly designates the islands proper, and besides limits the areas appropriated to \u201c fourteen one hundredths of an acre and one one hundredth of an acre respectively.\u201d At the time the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>was made the land in controversy had been reclaimed by the California Dry Dock Company, and upon it were \u201c extensive warehouses,\u201d which had been built by that company, \u201cand wharves erected for the accommodation of shipping.\u201d The property was so valuable that the plaintiff in error regarded itself damaged by its withholding in the sum of $250,000, and the rental thereof was alleged to be $5000 per annum. It is not conceivable that the President, by his order, intended to appropriate so valuable a property without explicit declaration, or to leave the appropriation to result as \u201c appurtenant \u201d to the rocks.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
