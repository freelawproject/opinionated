that the survey, field notes and plat were incorrect, and did not accurately show the location and subdivisions of the land and \u25a0water of the township, for that Cedar Island Lake is smaller than delineated, and several of the c\u00f3mplainants\u2019 fractional lots are larger, and others are smaller, than shown on the plat;

that the principal consideration inducing such purchase ivas that the land bordered on the lake and they owned other timber lands, the timber from which could be brought to market by floating through the lake and its outlet down the St. Louis Eiver, then the only means of transport; that in 1892j five certain settlers, knowing complainants\u2019 rights and claims, petitioned for a survey of said lands, which the surveyor general recommended to the Commisioner of the General Land Office should be allowed, but the petition was disallowed, whereupon on appeal to the Secretary of the Interior such proceedings were thereafter had that in October, 1895, the Commissioner of the General Land Office directed the United States surveyor general of the district of Minnesota to make a resurvey, which order was ratified and confirmed in November, 1896;

On or about April 26, 1S76, a contract for the survey of all lands in township 57 north, of range 17 west, in Saint Louis County, Minnesota, was made by the government of the United States with one Henry S. Howe, as a deput\\ surveyor of the United States, and thereafter said Howe made and filed what purported to be field notes of a survey of said township, from which a purported official plat of said township was thereafter made and approved by the surveyor general of the United States for the District of Minnesota and by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, of which plat Exhibit A attached to the bill of complaint is a substantially correct copy</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-8\">\u201c 2. There is no evidence, nor any marks upon the ground, to indicate that any actual survey of said township 57 was ever made by said Howe, as required by his said contract, and by the rules and regulations of the General Land Office, or at all, beyond the running and due marking of the exterior boundary lines of said township, where the section, quarter, and other postsand markings established by him are and always have been clear, distinct, and readily found and traced. There is no evidence on the ground that section lines were ever rim by him in or across said township, of section corner posts or quarter posts ever located or set by him, except a corner post at the northwest corner of section thirty-six (36) and a quarter post in the Avestern line of said section thirty-six <em>(t&amp;), </em>and there is no evidence that witness trees were ever blazed or marked by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\u201c3. Cedar Island Lake is a. navigable, deep, and permanent body of water, fed principally by springs, having an area of about nine hundred (900) acres, instead of about \u00e9ighteen hundred (1800) acres as described in the field'notes of Ilowe and shown on said official plat of said township. Instead of the shores of said lake being' low arid swampy as stated in said field notes, the banks are generally high and sloping lands, suitable for agriculture, extending around the lake, and support a good growth of pine and other forest trees large enough for lumbering, such as will not grow in water. The condition was the same in 1876, and no material part of the land surrounding the lake is accretion. Southerly and westerly of said Cedar Island Lake are five other deep, navigable, and permanent lakes in the same township, none of which are shown by the field notes of Howe\u2019s survey or upon said government official plat of said township, and all of which have, since the making of said official plat, been sold and patented by the government as land according to said plat.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-5\">\u201c4. There is no evidence upon the ground that any meander line of said Cedar Island Lake was ever surveyed bj said Howe, or any meander posts placed by him about said lake, except one where the north line of said township encounters said lake. And the outlet olrsaid lake is at a different place from that described in said field notes and shown upon said official plat. After the making of the said survey and plat and before its approval, complaints touching the accuracy thereof were made to the Commissioner of the General Land Office, but 'on the withdrawal of such, complaints the said survey, and plat were approved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">\u201c5.

Complainants purchased said fractional lots of land of the patentees or their grantees for the pine timber thereon, and the convenience of landing the same in the said Cedar Island Lake, to be driven to the place of manufacture; and before such purchase, in the year 1883, caused said lands to be ex-plored and \u00e9xamined by an experienced timber estimator, who in making such examination used, as is customary in such cases, a copy of said official plat of said township which did not have upon it in any statement of the acreage or amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>land in any of the subdivisions; and who reported to the complainants his estimate of the amount of pine timber on said lands, and the general character of said land, and the riparian character thereof as bounded upon said Cedar.

The lake is thus made a designated natural object constituting a boundary of. the lots. It is a boundary monument of the lots. <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Wilder, </em>29 Maine, 169; <em>Erskine </em>v.

The patents, by reference to the plat, haying described the lands as extending to and bounded by the lake, conveyed all the land within the descriptions, and the United States is estopped to deny that the lots extend to and are bounded by the lake. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Poole, </em>7 Gray, 83; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>17 Massachusetts, 411, 415 ; <em>O'Linda </em>v. <em>Lothrop, </em>21 Pick. 292; <em>Rodgers </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>9 Gray, 445; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Union Sugar Refinery, </em>109 Massachusetts, 292; <em>Farnsworth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>9 Gray, 162 ; <em>Stetson </em>v. <em>Dow, </em>16 Gray, 372 ; <em>Lunt </em>v. <em>Holland, </em>14 Massachusetts, 149.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b74-7\">Estoppel applies against the United States as it applies under like circumstances against a private person.

The descriptions of these fractional lots contained in the patents, being lots as they appear by their numbers, and. by their boundaries designated on the plat, and the lake itself being made the boundary, the boundary by the lake thus made governs the description, notwithstanding no courses, distances, nor computed contents correspond with such boundary. This is clearly decided by the following cases, even though it may be found that no survey of the lots had in fact been made <em>Newsome </em>v. <em>Pryor's Lessee, </em>7 Wheat. 7; <em>McIver's Lessee </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>9 Cranch, 173, 179; <em>Preston's Heirs </em>v. <em>Bowmar, </em>6 Wheat. 580; <em>Higueras </em>v. <em>United States, </em>5 Wall. 827, 835, 836; <em>Morrow </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>95 U.

S. 300.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b75-7\">Generally, these meandered lines are lines which course the banks of navigable streams or other navigable waters. Hence, it appears distinctly from the field notes and the plat that the surveyor, Rice, stopped his surveys at this \u201c marsh <em>\" </em>as he called it. These surveys were approved and a plat prepared, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>was based upon the surveys and field notes, and showed the limits of the tracts which were for sale. The patents referring in terms to the survey and plat, clearly disclose, that the government was not intending to and did not convey any land which was a part of the marsh.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-5\">By the plat in the case which is now before the court, the meander line is fixed upon the shore of the lake, and the lake is delineated and named on the plat.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-6\">The intbntion plainly expressed by the patent and plat is that the meander line and shore of the lake coincide, and that the lake itself is the boundary of the land conveyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-7\">In this manner the lake is made the boundary of the land within the decisions in <em>Horne </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>and <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Cedar Point Club, </em>because the plat shows that the lake is intended as the boundary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-8\">IY. Defendants contend that a patent of unsurveyed lands conveys no title, and that, therefore, no title passed from the United States to the lands in controversy, because it was not, in fact, surveyed by Deputy Surveyor Henry S. Howe, and cite to sustain this position the expression of the court in the case of <em>Horne </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>159 U. S. 40.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-9\">That case does not hold, as claimed by defendants\u2019 counsel, that land which is not surveyed cannot pass by patent.

The decree granted a perpetual injunction, and, describing the fractional lots, adjudged that they \u201cextend to and are bounded by and upon the actual waters of Cedar Island Lake.\u201d The deflection of the lines required by the decree is indicated on the diagram.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">Sections 2395, 2396 and 2397 of the Devised Statutes specify the m\u00e1nner of making surveys of public lands, and prescribe the rules by which the form and boundaries of the tracts are determined. In this case no survey was in fact made, no meander line was in. fact run, and no body of water in fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>existed near the false meander line indicated. The line purporting to delimit the lake was from one mile to a quarter of a mile from the lake, and ran over high agricultural land, covered with ancient trees, which could not have grown in water. The theory of the decree is that the government' is estopped by the pretended survey and plat to deny that these lots were bounded by the lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The Land Department must necessarily consider and determine what are public lands, what lands have been surveyed, what are to be surveyed, what have been disposed of, what remain to be disposed of, and what are reserved. The department has held that the land lying between the alleged meander line and the lake, some 1200 acres, is government land, and has ordered it to be surveyed. <em>In re </em>Burns, 20 L. Dec. 28, 295; 23 L. Dec. 430. The execution of that order was restrained by the preliminary injunction herein, and that has been made perpetual by the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">We are confronted on the threshold with two objections to the maintenance of this bill, namely, the want of jurisdiction in equity, and the want of jurisdiction thus to interfere with executive administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Equity jurisdiction was invoked on the ground of lack of adequate remedy at 'law in that irreparable injury in the destruction of timber and exposure to fire by the'' survey, and multiplicity of suits were threatened.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq6_\">In our opinion complainants failed to make out a case of liability to irreparable injury. The township was resurveyed by a county surveyor in 1893 ; defendant Croswell has made surveys in the township, locating the actual meanders of the lake ; and he- testified that this survey could be made by him \u201c without any material injury to the soil or timber; \u201d and that he would not \u201c have to cut very much valuable timber.\u201d If complainants as owners of the 859.38 acres contained in their frac-' tional lots became through that ownership owners of the 1202 acres lying between those lots and the lake, the proposed survey would be but a fugitive and temporary trespass, lacking the elements of irreparable mischief, and of such long continuance as to become a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>And bills, of peace will not lie where the legal remedy is otherwise adequate, and where the persons directly interested are not. made' parties, are not numerous, and assert separate and independent rights. <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Allinson, </em>188 U. S. 56; <em>Cruickshank </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>176 U. S. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">But, in the next place, was the Circuit Court justified in thus arresting the action of the Land- Department in proceeding with a survey under the circumstances ? In other words, can the Land Department be stayed in the discharge of a duty, not' ministerial, but involving the exercise of judgment and discretion, on the ground, that its jurisdiction has been lost by estoppel? We do not think so, and hold that complainants\u2019 contention that they are entitled to. bound upon the lake involves a legal right, which cannot be properly passed on until after the department has acted. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Having participated in the proceedings before the department, complainants, after survey was ordered, obtained this injunction' against, further administrative action, on the ground of absolute want of power, and not of error in its exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The administration of .the public lands is vested in the Land Department, and its power in that regard cannot be divested by the. fraudulent action of a subordinate officer, outside of his authority, and in violation of the statute. <em>Whiteside v. United States, </em>93 U. S. 247; <em>Moffat </em>v. <em>United States, </em>112 U. S. 24; <em>Hume </em>v. <em>United States, </em>132 U. S. 406, 414. The courts can neither correct nor make surveys'. The power to-do so is reposed in the political department of the government, and the Land Department, charged with the duty of surveying the public domain, must primarily determine what are public lands' subject tp survey and disposal under the. public land. laws. Possessed of the power, in general, its exercise of jurisdiction cannot be questioned by the courts before it has taken final action. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, </em>173 U. S. 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">In <em>Litchfield </em>v. <em>The Register and Receiver, </em>9 Wall. 575, Litchfield sought an injunction to restrain the register and receiver of the Hnited States land office at Port Dodge, Iowa, from entertaining and acting upon applications made to them to prove preemptions to certain lands which lay within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>land district for -which they were respectively register and receiver. The hill averred that, complainant was the legal owner of the lands; that they, were not public lands, and were in no manner subject to sale or preemption by the government or its-officers. The bill was dismissed for want of jurisdiction in equity, and this court affirmed the decree. Mr. Justice Miller said: \u201cThe principle has been so repeatedly decided in this court, that the judiciary cannot interfere either by mandamus or injunction with executive officers such as the respondents here, in the discharge of their official duties, unless those duties are of a character purely ministerial, and involving no exercise of judgment or discretion, that it would seem to be useless to repeat it here.\u201d <em>Gaines </em>v. Thompson, 7 Wall. 347; <em>The Secretary </em>v. <em>McGarrahan, </em>9 Wall. 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">It was held that the fact that complainant asserted himself, to be the owner \u00f3f the . tract of land, which the officers were treating as public lands, did not take the case out of that rule, where it was the duty of these officers to determine, upon all the facts before them, whether the land was open to. preemption or sale; and further, that if the court could entertain jurisdiction, the persons asserting the right of preemption would be necessary parties to the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Mr. Justice Miller further said: \u201c After the .land officers shall have disposed of the question, if any legal right of plaintiff has been invaded, he may seek redress in the courts. He insists that he now has the legal title. If the Land D\u00e9partment finally decides in his favor, he is not injured. If they give patents to the applicants for preemption, the courts can then in the appropriate proceeding determine who has the better title or right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">And: \u201c It appears on its face, that the register and receiver have no real interest in the matter, but that persons not named are asserting before them the legal right to preempt these lands. These persons are the real parries whose interests are to be affected, and whose claim of right is adverse to plaintiff. If the court should hear the case, and enjoin perpetually the register and receiver from entertaining their applications, they have no further remedy. That is the initial point of establish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ing their right, and in this mode a valuable and recognized right may be wholly defeated and destroyed, without the possibility of a hearing on the part of the party interested. This is not a case in which the land officers represent these claimants. They have no such duty to perform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The case has been frequently cited, and in, amon^ others, <em>Carrick </em>v. Lamar, 116 U. S. 423, an application to the Supreme Court of the .District of Columbia for a mandamus to the' Secretary of the Interior to order the survey of an island in the &gt; Mississippi River, opposite the city of St. Louis, by an alleged settler thereon, who averred that he had applied to'the department for a survey of the island, so that it might be brought into the market, and that on the hearing of the application the city contended that the island had been surveyed and set apart to it, under certain acts of Congress, which he denied, because, as he insisted, the island surveyed was then located above this island. The court refused to grant the writ, and its judgment was affirmed, this court holding that the question how far the title of the city to the island was affected by its being carried down river by the action of the current, required consideration and judgment on the part of the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\"><em>Noble </em>v. <em>Union River Logging </em>Company, 147 U. S. 165, is not to the contrary, for that was a case where the executive department had confessedly finally acted, and then attempted to resume jurisdiction, and an injunction was sustained. But the government raised no point as to the form of the remedy; deprivation' of a vested legal right of property, acquired before any suggestion that it could be taken away, was threatened; and it appeared that the only remedy was through equity interposition. <em>Cruickshank </em>v. <em>Bidwell, </em>176 U. S. 73, 80. In this case, whether the lands lying between the alleged meander line and the lake were public lands, or not, was for the Land Department to determine in the first instance, and if error was committed, this is not the way to correct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">In dur judgment the Circuit Court should not have taken jurisdiction, and therefore the</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">\n<em>Decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed; the decree of the- Circuit Court is also reversed, a/nd the cause remanded to that court with a direction to dismiss the bill.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
