The decision recited that one definition of the word \u201cdump\u201d given in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary reads: \u201cto unload', as from a cart by tilting it.\u201d The Assistant Commissioner pointed out that this is the precise function performed by appellant\u2019s hydraulic device. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>and followed this with the statement: \u201c * * * I am clearly of the opinion that registration was properly refused, for it is now well established that \u2018a mark is descriptive within the meaning of the Act if it describes the intended purpose, function, or use, of the goods to which it is applied,\u2019 or if it describes \u2018the result to be obtained\u2019 by using the goods. In re W. A. Sheaffer Pen Company, 158 F.2d 390, 34 C.C.P.A., Patents, 771; Basic Food Materials, Inc. v. Keyes Fibre Co., 162 F.2d 422, 34 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1117.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Before us appellant has presented an elaborate brief in which many decisions are cited that are claimed to be in point. Practically all of the cases so cited are cases resting upon the well established rule that marks which are nothing more than suggestive are registrable. Such authorities are not persuasive with us. Indeed, if there should be found registered a mark truly descriptive, it would be no authority for granting registration of another descriptive mark. The proper procedure would be to cancel the first registration. The courts have stated this principle so often and it so fully harmonizes with common sense that it is not deemed necessary to cite authorities in its support. Appellant\u2019s mark is descriptive. To hold it otherwise would, in our opinion, do violence to good judgment It describes the only function and sole purpose of the device to which it is applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Appellant\u2019s brief states: \u201c* * * Whether the present mark is even suggestive might well be argued, but that is beside the point. If it is \u2018merely descriptive\u2019, however, <em>within the meaning of the statute, </em>what, may we ask, does it describe?\u201d (Italics ours.) and, replying to its own question, says: \u201cThere is only one answer, and that is\u2014absolutely nothing. \u2018Dump IT\u2019 is no more descriptive of a hydraulic lift unit than it is of a wheel barrow, a steam shovel, a child\u2019s sand pail, or of the gasoline which powers the engine * * * that raises the truck body from which the contained load is finally dumped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">In the first place, it may be remarked that if \u201cDump IT\u201d applied to a hydraulic lifting device is merely descriptive within <em>the meaning of the </em>statute\u2014and we so regard if\u2014 that ends the case. No such mark may be registered originally under the 1905 Trade-Mark registration Act. However, we think the brief is not apt in comparing appellant\u2019s lifting device with a wheelbarrow, a child\u2019s sand pail, gasoline, and even with a steam shovel, although the latter lifts and dumps, but if they be properly comparable, as counsel for appellant seems to think, their manufacturers might wish to use the descriptive phrase \u201cDump IT\u201d in connection with them, and they ought not to be embarrassed in so doing by meeting a registered trade-mark which implies the right of exclusive use.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">The brief for appellant seems really to make a concession against interest in the following statement: \u201cThe fact that a single word \u2018Dump\u2019, when segregated from \u2018IT\u2019, is commonly used in connection with <em>dump </em>truck is not denied, and applicant is perfectly willing to disclaim \u2018Dump\u2019 apart from the balance of the mark if that will clarify the matter. But this should not be critical or necessary as obviously <em>no claim cam possibly be made to exclusive use of the word \u2018Dump\u2019 as applied to anything related to dump trucks.\" </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">The implication seems to be that the word \u201cIT\u201d is the dominating part of the mark, the brief saying: \u201cThe very short and usually insignificant word \u2018IT\u2019 gives this composite mark character and significance that makes itt particularly and peculiarly distinctive in the industry and with the purchasing public, and this effect should not be summarily dismissed in a proceeding of this nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">We are unable to agree that the implication relative to \u201cIT\u201d being the dominating part of the mark is sound. Both words have distinct meanings. \u201cDump\u201d means what the dictionary says it means, supra, and \u201cit\u201d obviously has reference to the material which is to be dumped. The two words taken together seem to us obviously to constitute a descriptive phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">In the brief on behalf of appellant a statement of the examiner to the effect that a search of the office records shows that no trade-mark like applicant\u2019s has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>registered for use on the same kind of goods is quoted, and it is said: \u201cThis is believed to be significant,\u201d and further: \u201cNot only is the mark new, but there is absolutely nothing to indicate that it is one that another member of the industry would normally ever adopt. In fact, and to the contrary, the notation is no [so] incongruous and singular in character as to become an oddity with respect to the general run-of-the-mill type of conventional trademarks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">There may be many reasons why other manufacturers of hydraulic operated units like those of appellant have not adopted and sought to register \u201cDump IT\u201d as a trademark. For example, one may be that they,, unlike, appellant, have regarded it as a descriptive phrase and hence not registrable.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Many authorities might be added to those cited in the decision of the commissioner but ithe matter seems to clear to us that we can see no necessity for such citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">We are not convinced of error in the decision of the commissioner and, therefore, it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b280-9\">By reason of illness, HATFIELD, Judge,, was not present at the argument of this case and did not participate in the decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
