Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> [counts one &amp; two]), two counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated (\u00a7 191.5, subd. (a) [counts three &amp; four]), and one count of driving with a suspended license (Veh. Code, \u00a7 14601.4, subd. (a) [count five]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-9\">In connection with counts one through four, the indictment alleged defendant was previously convicted of (1) first degree burglary \u2014 a qualifying strike under the \u201cThree Strikes\u201d law (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (c)-(j), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(e)) and a serious felony (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)) \u2014 on or around March 9, 1992, for which he served time in prison (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)); (2) possessing a controlled substance on or around June 6, 2006, for which he served time in prison <em>(ibid.); </em>(3) possessing a controlled substance on or around October 27, 1998, for which he served time in prison <em>(ibid.); </em>(4) possessing a controlled substance on or around March 1, 1996, for which he served time in prison <em>(ibid.); </em>and (5) possessing a narcotic on or around April 14, 1989, for which he served time in prison <em>(ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1209-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>In connection with counts three and four, the indictment alleged defendant had been convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) on May 10, 2002, and August 11, 2009, respectively. (\u00a7 191.5, subd. (d).) As to count five, it alleged he was previously convicted of (1) driving with a suspended license on or around April 10, 2006 (Veh. Code, \u00a7 14601.2, subd. (d)(2)) and (2) driving with a suspended license on or around August 11, 2009 <em>(ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">On May 23, 2013, the jury convicted defendant on all counts and found true the allegations of his earlier DUI convictions on counts three and four. In a bifurcated proceeding, the trial court did not issue a finding as to the allegation of being convicted of driving with a suspended license on or around August 11, 2009, on count five, but found true all remaining allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-6\">On August 6, 2013, defendant was sentenced to 30 years to life, plus five years for a prior serious felony conviction and four years for four prior prison terms,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on count one; 30 years to life, plus five years for a prior serious felony conviction and four years for four prior prison terms (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 2), on count two, to be served consecutively; and 180 days in jail on count five, to be served concurrently. The trial court also imposed 30 years to life, plus five years for a prior serious felony conviction and four years for four prior prison terms (see <em>ante, </em>fn. 2), on counts three and four, respectively, but stayed execution of these sentences pursuant to section 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-7\">On appeal, defendant contends the evidence did not establish he was under the influence of a drug (counts three &amp; four) or killed with malice aforethought (counts one &amp; two); claims the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on unconsciousness, denying his motion to suppress blood test results, and admitting into evidence a detective\u2019s opinion about his state of intoxication, other-crimes evidence, and his mug shot profile; alleges various sentencing errors; and asks us to review the sealed reporter\u2019s transcript of the trial court\u2019s April 2, 2013, in camera hearing and determine whether the trial court properly ruled on his motion for discovery pursuant to <em>Pitchess v. Superior Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 531 [113 Cal.Rptr. 897, 522 P.2d 305].</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-8\">In the published portion of the opinion, we conclude substantial evidence established defendant was under the influence of a drug, substantial evidence established implied malice, and defendant\u2019s blood test results were not subject to exclusion. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we conclude an instruction on unconsciousness was unwarranted, the trial court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>abuse its discretion when it admitted a detective\u2019s opinion regarding defendant\u2019s state of intoxication or when it admitted other-crimes evidence, the admission of defendant\u2019s mug shot profile did not constitute prejudicial error, one sentencing error must be corrected, and the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it determined certain peace officers\u2019 records contained no discoverable materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-4\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">I. <em>Prosecution case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">On April 26, 2011, at approximately 9:00 a.m., Maria Rocha heard a loud collision while she was in her residence at 2701 Sierraglen Court in Bakersfield. Through a bedroom window, she saw a gray truck \u2014 which had plowed through a fence \u2014 in her backyard. Rocha\u2019s son called 911. Meanwhile, Rocha entered the backyard and observed defendant emerging from the driver\u2019s side of the vehicle. As he ran westward on Auburn Street, she warned, \u201cHey, don\u2019t run. I\u2019ve already called the cops.\u201d Rocha believed defendant \u201cwas trying to get away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-7\">At 9:11 a.m., Detective Kevin Fidler arrived at the scene of the accident. He spotted Albert Cichy lying near the truck, Annabelle Cichy lying on the northeastern corner of Sierraglen Court and Auburn Street, defendant sitting on the curb close to Annabelle,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>and an upended fire hydrant. After Fidler recruited bystanders to stabilize the Cichys until the arrival of emergency medical services, he spoke to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-8\">Defendant told Fidler he was driving eastbound on Auburn Street between 35 and 40 miles per hour when he was cut off by another vehicle, which forced him to swerve and hit the fire hydrant and the Cichys. He was also \u201ccoming down off of speed.\u2122\u201d Defendant then mentioned he had \u201cblacked out\u201d until he crashed into the hydrant. He admitted having a suspended driver\u2019s license. When Fidler asked why the license was suspended, defendant answered, \u201cFor a DUI.\u201d Defendant \u201cappeared nervous and jittery,\u201d \u201chad an accelerated, mumbled speech,\u201d and \u201cshow[ed] signs of bruxism,\u201d i.e., \u201cconsistent\u201d \u201cclench[ing],\u201d \u201ctwitch[ingj,\u201d and/or \u201cthrashing of] the[] jaw.\u201d In view of defendant\u2019s remarks and actions, Fidler opined defendant was \u201cimpaired by methamphetamine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-9\">Officer Patrick Dillard, a vehicular accident reconstructionist, charted the truck\u2019s path of travel. The areas of impact, in sequence, included (1) the curb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>on the northwestern corner of Auburn Street and Sierraglen Court; (2) a \u201cNo Parking Any Time\u201d sign; (3) the fire hydrant; (4) the Cichys; (5) the curb on the northeastern corner of Auburn Street and Sierraglen Court; (6) the street name signs for Auburn Street and Sierraglen Court; (7) a tree; and (8) the fence bordering Rocha\u2019s backyard. Dillard did not notice any skid marks or other evidence of braking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-4\">Officer Scott Lazenby inspected the truck and found no mechanical issues with the steering mechanism, brakes, and tires. He surveyed the road and confirmed there were no objects that would have prompted defendant to abruptly change direction. The weather, which was clear and dry, was also excluded as a contributing factor. Inside the pocket in the driver\u2019s side door, Lazenby retrieved an eyeglass case, which was inscribed with defendant\u2019s last name and contained a glass pipe with methamphetamine residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-5\">At the scene of the accident, emergency medical services measured defendant\u2019s heart rate twice at 9:33 a.m. and 9:41 a.m., respectively. In both instances, the rate was at or below 90 beats per minute. Defendant was then transported to Kern Medical Center. Officer Jeffrey Paglia, who was present during intake, heard a nurse ask defendant \u201cwhy he\u2019s shaking\u201d and defendant say \u201che was withdrawing from methamphetamine.\u201d Dale Robbins, a physician assistant, was informed of defendant\u2019s \u201caltered mental status\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by the paramedics. At approximately 9:50 a.m., Robbins evaluated defendant, who was \u201calert,\u201d \u201cverbally responsive,\u201d and \u201coriented to person, place, time, and surroundings.\u201d Aside from a slightly elevated blood pressure, vital signs were normal. Defendant was hydrated and his mouth was \u201cnormal.\u201d In both eyes, he presented \u201csmall and mildly reactive\u201d pupils and nystagmus, i.e., \u201cfluttering of the eye movements,\u201d signifying an injury to the central nervous system and/or intoxication. He also presented \u201ctwitching\u201d of the extremities and dysphasia, i.e., \u201cdifficulty speaking.\u201d A computed tomography scan of the brain was inconclusive. At 10:00 a.m., upon Paglia\u2019s request, a nurse drew blood from defendant\u2019s right arm. Paglia had not asked defendant for consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1211-6\">On April 28, 2011, an initial test of defendant\u2019s blood sample at the Kern County Crime Laboratory was positive for amphetamine and marijuana. On April 29, 2011, a confirmatory test found 0.2 micrograms per milliliter (pg/ml) of amphetamine and 0.44 pg/ml of methamphetamine. Additional analysis on June 14, 2011, detected 2.0 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the \u201cparent compound in marijuana.\u201d According to Thomas Sneath, the toxicologist who tested the blood sample <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>for marijuana, delta-9-THC is \u201conly [in the circulatory system] for a few hours\u201d following ingestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-4\">In the wake of the April 26, 2011, accident, Albert died due to multiple blunt force injuries and Annabelle died due to complications stemming from blunt force trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-5\">At trial, the prosecutor indicated he would introduce evidence \u201cof [defendant\u2019s] prior arrests or convictions . . . and things that he may have learned during the course of those arrests and convictions.\u201d The trial court preemptively instructed the jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-6\">\u201cDuring the trial certain evidence will be admitted for a limited purpose. You may consider that evidence only for that purpose and for no other. You may consider the evidence that [defendant] has allegedly been previously arrested and charged with [DUI] for the limited purpose of determining the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1212-7\">\u201cNumber one, whether or not at the time he acted he knew his act was dangerous to human life and he deliberately acted with conscious disregard for human life. [\u00b6] This is relevant to the implied malice counts in Counts 1 and 2.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1212-8\">\u201cNumber two, whether or not he acted with gross negligence in Counts 3 and 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1212-9\">\u201cNumber three, whether or not he suffered the alleged [DUI] convictions as alleged in . . . section 191.5(d), allegations as to Counts 3 and 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1212-10\">\u201cAnd number four, whether or not he had a suspended or revoked driver\u2019s license in Count 5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1212-11\">\u201cIf you have a reasonable doubt that [defendant] learned from his prior conduct that that conduct was dangerous to life, you must disregard the evidence of that prior conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1212-12\">\u201cYou must determine whether [defendant] knew that his conduct was dangerous to human life at the time of the present offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1212-13\">\u201cYou may not consider any evidence of prior incidences of [DUI] as evidence of [defendant\u2019s] bad character, criminal record, or violation of any laws.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1212-14\">The parties agreed to the following stipulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>\u201cOn . . . June 8th, 2009, . . . [defendant\u2019s blood] sample screened positive for amphetamines and marijuana. The sample was not confirmed. The sample was later destroyed after [defendant\u2019s 2009 court case had concluded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1213-5\">\u201c. . . [D]efendant was arrested in March of 1987 and convicted in June of 1987 of . . . alcohol [DUI] in Pasadena, California. He received two days in jail, three years probation, and his license was suspended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1213-6\">\u201c. . . [D]efendant was arrested and convicted of . . . alcohol [DUI] in Kern County in December of 1988.

[D]efendant was arrested and convicted of . . . alcohol [DUI], Vehicle Code [s]ection 23152(a), in Kern County in March of 2002. He received 30 days jail, three years probation, and his license was suspended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1213-8\">Roderick Frye formerly directed WestCare California\u2019s residential substance abuse treatment program, which incorporated lectures, seminars, and video presentations on the consequences of drug use in certain scenarios, e.g., ingesting methamphetamine and driving. In 2008, defendant completed the program in approximately 90 days. Frye testified an individual could not \u201cgo through that 90-day program and not have that idea presented . . . that . . . methamphetamine [DUI] could result in somebody dying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-9\">On June 4, 2009, at about 1:15 a.m., California Highway Patrol (CHP) Officer Michael Phillips saw defendant nearly sideswipe another vehicle with his truck at an intersection in Bakersfield. Phillips followed defendant \u2014 who \u201cwas weaving consistently, going in and out of his lane\u201d \u2014 and initiated a traffic stop. Defendant was \u201cextremely fidgety,\u201d slurred his speech, displayed constricted pupils, and had a heart rate of 104 beats per minute. He failed the field sobriety tests. Defendant admitted taking methamphetamine \u201ca couple of days prior.\u201d Roughly 45 minutes later, CHP Officer Kelly Walker, a drug recognition expert, evaluated defendant at Kern County jail. Defendant was \u201clethargic,\u201d had \u201cdroopy\u201d eyelids and a \u201cslack\u201d face, \u201cstruggl[ed] to stay awake,\u201d and spoke \u201cquickly\u201d and \u201cquietly.\u201d His pupils were 2.0 millimeters (mm) in \u201cnormal room light,\u201d 2.5 mm in \u201cnear darkness,\u201d and 2.0 mm \u201cwith a pen light . . . directing] light in[to] his eye[s.]\u201d Defendant\u2019s heart rate fluctuated between 64 and 72 beats per minute. He also exhibited \u201ca thick white coating on his tongue [and/]or in his oral cavity\u201d and injection marks \u201c[i]n the bend of his right arm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-10\">On August 11, 2009, defendant pleaded nolo contendere to drug DUI, inter alia. Pursuant to Vehicle Code section 23593, subdivision (a), he received the following judicial admonition: \u201cYou are hereby advised that being under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>influence of alcohol or drugs, or both, impairs your ability to safely operate a motor vehicle. Therefore, it is extremely dangerous to human life to drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or both. If you continue to drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or both, and, as a result of that driving, someone is killed, you can be charged with murder.\u201d (Some capitalization omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-4\">James Rabuse was defendant\u2019s substance abuse counselor at Turning Point Kennemer Center, where defendant participated in another residential substance abuse treatment program from January 29, 2010, to July 23, 2010. The program addressed, inter alia, \u201cthe possible legal ramifications stemming from . . . being a reckless driv[er] to a driv[er] under the influence.\u201d In response to a written question about whether his substance abuse endangered the lives of others, defendant answered, \u201cI\u2019ve driven while under the influence for starters.\u201d He successfully completed the program in six months. Rabuse \u201ccould not see any reason why [a person going through the program] wouldn\u2019t be able to understand\u201d \u201cthat using a drug, [like] methamphetamine, and driving could result in somebody dying.\u201d On cross-examination, he testified a person \u201cshould\u201d be able to operate a motor vehicle \u201c[e]ight to 12 hours . . . after the last ingestion of [methamphetamine],\u201d \u201ceven though the period of time where [the drug] shows up in the blood might not have lapsed,\u201d and he offered this advice in \u201cone-on-ones\u201d and \u201cgroup counseling.\u201d On redirect examination, Rabuse conceded he did not know \u201cwhat is a safe amount of methamphetamine to have in your blood to drive,\u201d adding \u201c[i]t depends on the individual and how much [he] ingested prior to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">Dr. Barry Logan, a forensic toxicologist, identified two phases of methamphetamine intoxication. In the first phase, also known as the \u201cexcited\u201d phase, the user is alert, energetic, and euphoric. Common signs include an elevated pulse and blood pressure, dilated pupils, jumbled and/or accelerated speech, tics, twitching, bruxism, and other fidgety behavior. In the second phase, also known as the \u201ccrash\u201d or \u201cwithdrawal\u201d phase, the methamphetamine has disseminated throughout the user\u2019s body, diluting the initial stimulative effects. As a result, the user \u2014 who had originally been invigorated by the drug \u2014 experiences depression, fatigue, and sleepiness, cannot concentrate, reacts slower, and craves further methamphetamine ingestion to \u201cfeel better again.\u201d The pulse and blood pressure return to normal and the pupils sometime constrict.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Marijuana is often consumed to offset the effects of the \u201ccrash\u201d phase. Logan added: \u201c[I]t\u2019s basically a continuum of effects. So you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>start with the excited phase or the initial intoxication phase, and then as those effects start to wear off, the effects of withdrawals start to appear. It\u2019s not like you hit a switch and you go from one phase to the other. There\u2019s some overlap in terms of the symptoms. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] . . . As you start ... to come down from the effects of the drugs, you still have some of your residual excitatory effects, but the adverse effects, the tiredness, the fatigue, the somnolence, these start to become more prominent. So . . . you can have both effects at the same time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1215-5\">In a study of methamphetamine DUI cases, Logan found the methamphetamine concentration ranged between 0.05 and 2.5 pg/ml. Defendant\u2019s blood sample contained 0.44 pg/ml of the drug, which was \u201cconsistent with abuse\u201d rather than \u201ctherapeutic use.\u201d Logan then explained how defendant\u2019s methamphetamine concentration at the time of the blood draw was a \u201cpretty good estimate of what it was at the time of driving\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-6\">\u201c[DJrugs have a property called half[-]life .... [I]f you have a concentration of a drug in your blood right now that\u2019s [100], and the half[-]life of a drug is in an hour, then an hour later, instead of having [100], you would have 50. [\u00b6] And then an hour [after] that, that 50 would have again fallen in half to 25. [\u00b6] So over time, the drug concentration is going to decline.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1215-7\">\u201cThe half[-]life o[f] methamphetamine . . . varies from person to person. It\u2019s between probably eight and 12 hours. [\u00b6] So [after] eight to 12 hours . . . the concentration would fall by half. [\u00b6] So over a period of an hour, the amount of change in the blood concentration would be quite small.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1215-8\">Based on percipient witnesses\u2019 statements about defendant\u2019s appearance and conduct at the crime scene (i.e., \u201cexcited, accelerated speech,\u201d \u201cfidgety\u201d) and hospital (i.e., \u201cmuscle tremors and shakes\u201d), defendant\u2019s abnormal driving behavior (i.e., \u201closfing] control of his vehicle, cross[ing] several lanes of traffic, mount[ing] a curb, hit[ting] a number of fixed objects with no apparent effort to brake or to prevent hitting the[m],\u201d \u201ccollidfing] with the victims\u201d), defendant\u2019s admission he was \u201ccoming down off of speed,\u201d medical records, and the blood test results, Logan opined defendant fell asleep at the wheel due to methamphetamine withdrawal on April 26, 2011. He reiterated defendant\u2019s impairment was caused by methamphetamine intoxication: \u201c[M]y view of methamphetamine intoxication is that it doesn\u2019t stop with somebody as soon as somebody reaches their peak and enters the downside. Intoxication is . . . the effect on an organism, a cell, a human being, an animal, as a result or consequence of their ingestion of a drug or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>alcohol. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] So . . . that process [of] somebody . . . reaching their peak, starting] to come down, all of that, in my view, would be intoxication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-4\">II. <em>Defense case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1216-5\">Teresa Jimenez testified defendant, her husband, \u201csle[pt] a full night\u2019s sleep\u201d on each of the three nights preceding the morning of April 26, 2011. On the night of April 25, 2011, he \u201cseemed normal\u201d at bedtime. The following morning, defendant was \u201cnormal,\u201d \u201cdidn\u2019t seem[] tired,\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t\u201d \u201chigh.\u201d On cross-examination, Teresa acknowledged defendant had used methamphetamine for years, had prior DUI convictions, and attended various programs for substance abuse treatment, but rarely observed him in an intoxicated state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-6\">Vincent Jimenez woke defendant, his father, at around 7:45 a.m. on April 26, 2011, to get a ride to the school bus stop. According to Vincent, who had observed defendant in an intoxicated state,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> defendant was \u201cnormal.\u201d They left their residence at 6009 Fairfax Road at around 7:55 a.m. En route to the bus stop on the corner of Auburn Street and Fairfax Road, defendant and Vincent talked about the latter\u2019s girlfriend troubles and physical training for the Marine Corps. Defendant drove and spoke \u201cnormally].\u201d His eyes were also \u201cnormal.\u201d On cross-examination, Vincent acknowledged defendant had \u201ca problem with methamphetamine.\u201d In addition, he admitted telling either defense counsel or defense counsel\u2019s investigator he believed defendant was under the influence on the night of April 25, 2011, when he and defendant were \u201cfixing a bumper on the truck\u201d together.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-7\">Norma Jimenez saw defendant, her brother, at her residence near Bakersfield Memorial Hospital at or around 8:10 a.m. on April 26, 2011.

Factors that \u201cincrease the likelihood that a warning will work\u201d relate to either \u201cthe warning itself\u2019 or \u201cthe person receiving that information.\u201d Krauss scrutinized the judicial admonition read to defendant on August 11, 2009. (See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1345-1346.) He deemed the admonition ineffective because, inter alia, (1) it did not provide \u201cnew\u201d information (i.e., defendant \u201calready . . . knew what the hazard was\u201d because he was in a courtroom); (2) it did not specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>address \u201cdriving many hours after ingesting narcotics\u201d; and (3) defendant was already inclined to disregard it because he \u201cha[d] driven many times under the same circumstance without a negative outcome\u201d and \u201cperceive[d] that the next time [wa]s going to be safe.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-4\">On the other hand, Krauss believed Rabuse\u2019s advice (see <em>ante, </em>at p. 1346) was more effective than the judicial admonition on the basis of \u201csource credibility\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1221-5\">\u201cIf you\u2019re given just a passive warning or a passive admonition, ... if you\u2019re reading sort of a []rote instruction that is a generic that\u2019s given to every person that passes through the court under these conditions, that\u2019s going to have some level of merit associated with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1221-6\">\u201cIf you\u2019re then in a drug rehab facility where you\u2019re presumably working with people who are trying to better your situation, are trying to make you write specifically not to do what got you in there, and they give you an instruction[, t]hat instruction that is directed] solely to you by somebody who is specifically there to make sure you don\u2019t do what you did again is likely going to carry a lot more weight.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1221-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1221-8\">I. <em>Substantial evidence established defendant was under the influence of methamphetamine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-9\">a. <em>Standard of review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1221-10\">\u201cTo determine the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we review the entire record in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether it contains [substantial] evidence that is reasonable, credible and of solid value, from which a rational trier of fact could find that the elements of the crime were established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(People v.

The truck had no mechanical issues, and external factors such as road debris and the weather did not play a role in the accident.

The record \u2014 viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution \u2014 shows he had smoked the drug at some point before the accident. Vincent, defendant\u2019s son, recognized alertness and dilated pupils, inter alia, as signs of methamphetamine use. Expert witnesses for the prosecution and the defense corroborated these physical traits are such indicia. Vincent \u2014 proven to be acquainted with the aforementioned symptoms \u2014 believed defendant was in a state of intoxication while they were repairing the truck\u2019s bumper on the night of April 25, 2011. A subsequent search of this vehicle uncovered defendant\u2019s glass pipe, which contained methamphetamine residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-5\">On April 26, 2011, less than an hour before the accident, defendant was \u201csomewhat tired.\u201d Approximately 10 minutes after the accident, he was \u201cnervous and jittery,\u201d \u201chad an accelerated, mumbled speech,\u201d \u201cshow[ed] signs of braxism,\u201d and confessed to a detective he had \u201cblacked out\u201d and was \u201ccoming down off of speed.\u201d Defendant\u2019s heart rate at the scene was normal. Later, at the hospital, he was seen \u201cshaking,\u201d which he attributed to \u201cwithdrawing from methamphetamine.\u201d During the physician assistant\u2019s evaluation, defendant presented \u201csmall and mildly reactive\u201d pupils, \u201ctwitching\u201d of the extremities, and \u201cdifficulty speaking,\u201d but otherwise exhibited normal vital signs. According to Logan, a forensic toxicologist, defendant\u2019s accelerated speech, twitching, braxism, and other fidgety behavior were indicative of the \u201cexcited\u201d phase of methamphetamine intoxication while his fatigue, mildly reactive pupils, and normal vital signs were indicative of the \u201ccrash\u201d or \u201cwithdrawal\u201d phase. Logan testified these phases constitute a \u201ccontinuum\u201d rather than discrete intervals; thus, overlapping symptoms are not unusual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1223-6\">Testing of defendant\u2019s blood sample \u2014 taken within an hour of the accident \u2014 revealed a methamphetamine concentration of 0.44 pg/ml. This amount, which was \u201cnon-therapeutic\u201d and \u201cconsistent with abuse,\u201d fell within the 0.05-to-2.5 pg/ml range observed by Logan in a study of methamphetamine DUI cases. Also, given the drug\u2019s eight- to 12-hour half-life, 0.44 pg/ml was a \u201cpretty good estimate\u201d of defendant\u2019s methamphetamine concentration at the time of the accident. Testing also revealed 2.0 ng/ml of delta-9-THC, the principal ingredient in marijuana that only remains in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1356\">*1356</page-number>circulatory system for \u201ca few hours\u201d after consumption. Logan pointed out marijuana is often taken to counteract the adverse effects of methamphetamine withdrawal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-4\">In sum, the night before the accident, defendant \u2014 who had smoked a non-therapeutic amount of methamphetamine \u2014 was in the first or \u201cexcited\u201d phase of intoxication. By the morning of April 26, 2011, he began to exhibit symptoms of the second or \u201ccrash\u201d/\u201cwithdrawal\u201d phase. Even so, defendant chose to drive his truck. Ultimately, he fell asleep at the wheel, lost control of his vehicle, and ran over the Cichys. Both Logan and Zorick, a psychiatrist specializing in addictive disorders, confirmed sleepiness is a symptom of methamphetamine withdrawal. Defendant experienced sleepiness because he ingested methamphetamine in the first place. Hence, <em>\u201cas a result of using methamphetamine\u201d (People v. Bui, supra, </em>86 Cal.App.4th at p. 1194, italics added), his \u201cphysical or mental abilities [wejre impaired to such a degree that he no longer ha[d] the ability to drive his vehicle with the caution characteristic of a sober person of ordinary prudence under the same or similar circumstances\u201d <em>(ibid.). </em>(Cf. <em>People v. Mathson </em>(2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 1297 [149 Cal.Rptr.3d 167] [prescription sleep drug DUI].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-5\">On appeal, defendant argues he can only be convicted of methamphetamine DUI if his driving impairment stemmed from \u201cthe drug itself . . . <em>actively </em>influencing the body.\u201d (Italics added.) In the context of this case, he is likely claiming he cannot be convicted of methamphetamine DUI because his driving impairment, i.e., sleepiness, was induced by withdrawal. As supporting authority, defendant cites the following excerpt from <em>People v. Canty </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1266, 1278 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 90 P.3d 1168] <em>(Canty): </em>\u201c[F]or a defendant to be guilty of driving while under the influence of drugs . . . , 4 \u201cthe . . . drug(s) must have so far affected the nervous system, the brain, or muscles [of the individual] as to impair to an appreciable degree the ability to operate a vehicle in a manner like that of an ordinarily prudent and cautious person in full possession of his faculties. [Citations.]\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d (Italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1224-6\">To the extent defendant suggests <em>Canty </em>categorically prohibits drug DUI convictions where the driver\u2019s impairment was brought about by drug withdrawal, we disagree. In that case, the defendant \u2014 who pleaded guilty to transporting methamphetamine, a felony, and methamphetamine DUI, a misdemeanor \u2014 asked the trial court to be placed on probation and diverted to a drug treatment program pursuant to the Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000. <em>(Canty, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at pp. 1272-1274.) Under this law, an offender is eligible for probation and diversion to such a program if he or she has been convicted of a \u201c \u2018nonviolent drug possession offense,\u2019 \u201d e.g., \u201c \u2018being under the influence of a controlled substance\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at pp. 1272, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1357\">*1357</page-number>1275), but \u201cineligible ... if he or she has been \u2018convicted in the same proceeding of a misdemeanor not related to the use of drugs\u2019 \u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1273, italics omitted). The trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s request because her methamphetamine DUI was a \u201c \u2018misdemeanor not related to the use of drugs\u2019 \u201d and the appellate court affirmed. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1274-1275.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-4\">On appeal before the California Supreme Court, the defendant argued a DUI misdemeanor \u201cshould be equated with\u201d the crime of \u201cbeing under the influence of drugs\u201d because \u201cuse of drugs is integral to each offense.\u201d <em>(Canty, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th at p. 1278, italics omitted.) In rejecting this argument, California Supreme Court emphasized three significant differences between <em>being </em>under the influence of drugs and <em>driving </em>while under the influence of drugs. First, whereas a person can be convicted of the former merely \u201cby being in that state in any detectable manner\u201d <em>(ibid.), </em>he or she can only be convicted of the latter if the drug \u201c \u2018 \u201cso far affected [his or her] nervous system, the brain, or muscles ... as to impair to an appreciable degree the ability to operate a vehicle in a manner like that of an ordinarily prudent and cautious person in full possession of his faculties\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(ibid., </em>italics omitted). Second, whereas a simple drug-use misdemeanor focuses on \u201cthe individual offender\u2019s own private involvement with the proscribed substance\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1279), a DUI misdemeanor \u201cprimarily is concerned not with the offender\u2019s use of the proscribed substance, but with his or her use of a motor vehicle\u201d <em>(ibid.). </em>Third, whereas the Legislature intended to \u201cprotect the user from the consequences ... of his or her own conduct\u201d in proscribing being under the influence <em>(ibid., </em>italics omitted), it intended to \u201cprotect the public and guard against the threat of injury to others\u201d in proscribing DUI (ibid., italics omitted). The appellate court\u2019s judgment was affirmed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1286.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1225-5\">At most, <em>Canty </em>\u2014 for purposes of the Substance Abuse and Crime Prevention Act of 2000 \u2014 differentiated between two drug-related misdemeanors on the bases of degree of impairment and public policy. <em>Canty </em>never intimated an offender cannot be convicted of drug DUI if his or her driving impairment stemmed from drug withdrawal. Furthermore, we are unwilling to countenance this proposition in the instant case. Substantial evidence established defendant smoked methamphetamine and subsequently underwent withdrawal, resulting in somnolence that impaired his driving. We cannot overlook the fact defendant endured the effects of methamphetamine withdrawal \u2014 namely, <em>sleepiness </em>\u2014 precisely <em>because he had used </em>methamphetamine.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>II. <em>Substantial evidence established implied malice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-4\">a. <em>Standard of review. </em>(See <em>ante, </em>at pp. 1353-1354.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-5\">b. <em>Analysis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1226-6\">\u201cSecond degree murder is defined as the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought, but without the additional elements \u2014 i.e., willfulness, premeditation, and deliberation \u2014 that would support a conviction of first degree murder.\u201d <em>(People v.

The record \u2014 viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution \u2014 shows defendant was previously convicted of alcohol DUI in 1987, 1988, and 2002. In 2009, after he nearly sideswiped another vehicle with his truck, he displayed symptoms suggestive of both the \u201cexcited\u201d and \u201ccrash\u201d phases of methamphetamine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>intoxication and preliminarily tested positive for amphetamine and marijuana, the latter of which is often taken to offset the adverse effects of methamphetamine withdrawal. Defendant subsequently pleaded nolo contendere to drug DUI and received a judicial admonition pursuant to Vehicle Code section 23593, subdivision (a), which warned (1) \u201cbeing under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or both, impairs [the] ability to safely operate a motor vehicle\u201d; (2) \u201cit is extremely dangerous to human life to drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or both\u201d; and (3) \u201c[i]f [he] continue^] to drive while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or both, and, as a result of that driving, someone is killed, [he] can be charged with murder.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Some capitalization omitted.) Moreover, in 2008 and 2010, defendant completed two different substance abuse treatment programs, both of which addressed the potentially fatal consequences of drug DUI. Indeed, in the course of the 2010 program, defendant acknowledged he endangered the lives of others by driving while under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-5\">Yet, despite several prior brushes with the law, a near collision in 2009, a straightforward judicial admonition, stints in two separate substance abuse treatment programs, his awareness of withdrawal effects, and his acknowledgement of the risks of DUI, defendant smoked methamphetamine sometime before April 26, 2011, experienced withdrawal on the morning of April 26, 2011, and \u2014 with a license revoked on account of his prior DUI conviction \u2014 \u25a0 chose to drive anyway. While driving, he succumbed to sleepiness \u2014 -a symptom of withdrawal \u2014 and killed two pedestrians. Any rational jury could find \u2014 beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 defendant knew his impaired driving endangered the lives of others, but acted \u201cwith conscious disregard for life.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dellinger, supra, </em>49 Cal.3d at p. 1215; accord, <em>Costa, supra, </em>183 Cal.App.4th at p. 697.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1227-6\">On appeal, defendant insists he was advised by Rabuse, his former substance abuse counselor, \u201cth[at] <em>danger did not exist if </em>he did not use methamphetamine for eight to [12] hours before driving,\u201d which essentially \u201cmooted\u201d the judicial admonition. (Italics added.) We are not compelled to accept his self-serving interpretation of Rabuse\u2019s testimony in light of our obligation as an appellate court to view the record \u201cin the light most favorable to the prosecution\u201d <em>(Tripp, supra, </em>151 Cal.App.4th at p. 955) and \u201cpresume in support of the judgment the existence of every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence\u201d <em>(Redmond, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d at p. 755). On cross-examination, Rabuse testified he informed multiple patients \u2014 not just defendant \u2014 in \u201cone-on-ones\u201d and \u201cgroup counseling\u201d that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>person \u201cshould\u201d be able to operate a motor vehicle \u201c[e]ight to 12 hours . . . after the last ingestion of [methamphetamine].\u201d On redirect examination, however, he conceded his statement was not intended to be a hard-and-fast rule and was conditioned on both the individual and the amount of methamphetamine consumed beforehand. It is difficult to envisage how a trier of fact could construe Rabuse\u2019s advice as positively guaranteeing a methamphetamine user will drive unimpaired so long as he or she waits eight to 12 hours after ingestion, irrespective of the user\u2019s individualized response and the amount of the drug actually taken. It is equally difficult to envisage how such advice \u201cmoots\u201d the substantial evidence of defendant\u2019s implied malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-4\">III. <em>An instruction on unconsciousness was </em>unwarranted.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-5\">IV. <em>Defendant\u2019s blood test results were not subject to exclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-6\">a. <em>Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1228-7\">On May 8, 2013, defense counsel filed a motion in limine to \u201cprohibit[] the [p]rosecution from directly or indirectly identifying to the jury or making any comment of the fact of a blood draw or analysis or of the results of or of any opinions based upon a blood draw or analysis of the defendant\u2019s blood.\u201d He cited as supporting authority <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>McNeely </em>(2013) 569 U.S. _ [185 L.Ed.2d 696, 133 S.Ct. 1552] <em>(McNeely), </em>inter alia.

It reasoned;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-4\">\u201cThe officer in the present case . . . might reasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency, in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant, under the circumstances, threatened \u2018the destruction of evidence,\u2019 [citation]. We are told that the percentage of alcohol in the blood begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops, as the body functions to eliminate it from the system. Particularly in a case such as this, where time had to be taken to bring the accused to a hospital and to investigate the scene of the accident, there was no time to seek out a magistrate and secure a warrant. Given these special facts, we conclude that the attempt to secure evidence of blood-alcohol content in this case was an appropriate incident to [the defendant\u2019s arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-5\">\u201cSimilarly, we are satisfied that the test chosen to measure [the defendant\u2019s blood-alcohol level was a reasonable one. Extraction of blood samples for testing is a highly effective means of determining the degree to which a person is under the influence of alcohol. [Citation.] Such tests are a commonplace in these days of periodic physical examinations and experience with them teaches that the quantity of blood extracted is minimal, and that for most people the procedure involves virtually no risk, trauma, or pain. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1230-6\">\u201cFinally, the record shows that the test was performed in a reasonable manner. [The defendant\u2019s blood was taken by a physician in a hospital environment according to accepted medical practices. We are thus not presented with the serious questions which would arise if a search involving use of a medical technique, even of the most rudimentary sort, were made by other than medical personnel or in other than a medical environment \u2014 for example, if it were administered by police in the privacy of the stationhouse.\u201d <em>(Schmerber, supra, </em>384 U.S. at pp. 770-772, fns. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1230-7\"><em>Post-Schmerber </em>and <em>prt-McNeely, </em>a period spanning nearly 50 years, \u201c \u2018California cases uniformly interpreted <em>Schmerber </em>to mean that no exigency beyond the natural evanescence of intoxicants in the bloodstream, present in every DUI case, was needed to establish an exception to the warrant requirement.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Youn, supra, </em>229 Cal.App.4th at p. 577; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1363\">*1363</page-number><em>People v.

In other words, the exclusionary rule is limited \u201cto situations in which [deterrence] is \u2018thought most efficaciously served.\u2019 [Citation.] Where suppression fails to yield \u2018appreciable deterrence,\u2019 exclusion is \u2018clearly . . . unwarranted.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 237 [131 S.Ct. at pp. 2426-2427].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1232-8\">\u201c[T]he deterrence benefits of exclusion \u2018var[y] with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct\u2019 at issue.\u201d <em>(Davis, supra, </em>564 U.S. at p. 238 [131 S.Ct. at p. 2427].) \u201cWhen the police exhibit \u2018deliberate,\u2019 \u2018reckless,\u2019 or \u2018grossly negligent\u2019 disregard for Fourth Amendment rights, the deterrent value of exclusion is strong and tends to outweigh the resulting costs. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cBut when the police act with an objectively \u2018reasonable good-faith belief\u2019 that their conduct is lawful, [citation], or when their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>conduct involves only simple, \u2018isolated\u2019 negligence, [citation], the \u2018 \u201cdeterrence rationale loses much of its force,\u201d \u2019 and exclusion cannot \u2018pay its way.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 238 [131 S.Ct. at pp. 2427-2428].) In particular, \u201cwhen binding appellate precedent specifically <em>authorizes </em>a particular police practice, well-trained officers will and should use that tool to fulfill their crime-detection and public-safety responsibilities. An officer who conducts a search in reliance on binding appellate precedent does no more than \u2018 \u201cac[t] as a reasonable officer would and should act\u201d \u2019 under the circumstances. [Citation.] The deterrent effect of exclusion in such a case can only be to discourage the officer from \u2018 \u201cdo[ing] his duty.\u201d[\u2019] [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 241 [131 S.Ct. at p. 2429].) Hence, \u201csearches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 232 [131 S.Ct. at pp. 2423-2424].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1233-4\">Here, the record shows defendant, after having run over two pedestrians with his truck, informed a hospital nurse he \u201cwas withdrawing from methamphetamine.\u201d Paglia, who was present, overheard this remark. In \u201cobjectively reasonable reliance\u201d <em>(Davis, supra, </em>564 U.S. at p. 232 [131 S.Ct. at p. 2423]) on <em>Schmerber, </em>then still authoritative, Paglia could \u201creasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency, in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant, under the circumstances, threatened \u2018the destruction of evidence\u2019 \u201d <em>(Schmerber, supra, </em>384 U.S. at p. 770), i.e., the natural evanescence of methamphetamine in the bloodstream. His request for a blood draw to secure evidence of defendant\u2019s drug intoxication fell \u201cwithin the parameters of the \u2018good faith\u2019 exception to the exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>(Rossetti, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.4th at p. 1076.)
