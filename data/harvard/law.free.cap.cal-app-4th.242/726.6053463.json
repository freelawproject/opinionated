If such an inmate meets the criteria enumerated in Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (e),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he or she will be resentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines such resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (f); <em>People v. Yearwood </em>(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161, 168 [151 Cal.Rptr.3d 901].)</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">On September 12, 2013, after the Act went into effect, defendant filed a petition for recall of sentence and request for resentencing under the Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time defendant filed a petition for resentencing, defendant was serving a term of 25 years to life for two felony convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) with three or more prior convictions for DUI (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23152, subds. (a), (b)). DUI with three or more prior convictions for DUI is neither a violent felony as defined by Penal Code section 667.5, subdivision (c), nor a serious felony as defined by section 1192.7, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Ultimately, on January 16, 2014, after a hearing at which defendant\u2019s brother testified, the court denied the recall and resentencing petition. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">On appeal, defendant claims that because the trial court applied the wrong definition of unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, this court must reverse the denial of his recall and resentencing petition. Further, he asserts that because the trial court placed the burden of proof on him, his due process rights were violated. In addition, defendant maintains that he had a right to a jury trial. Alternatively, if his request for a jury trial was not preserved for appeal, his due process rights were violated since the court denied his request for a continuance, which resulted in the dismissal of his petition. Finally, defendant argues that along with his right to a jury trial he was entitled to a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and his attorney\u2019s failure to assert that standard deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">In addition, Abel Rodolfo Esparza has filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, which this court ordered considered with the appeal. In his petition, Esparza contends that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to call as a witness a prison expert to testify in support of his Proposition 36 resentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>petition. Further, Esparza asserts that the trial court\u2019s finding in his 1997 case that his priors were strikes violated his constitutional right to due process under <em>Descamps v. United States </em>(2013) 570 U.S. _, _ [186 L.Ed.2d 438, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2288] <em>(Descamps).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">For reasons that follow we agree with defendant that the court erred below and that he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">\n<em>The Recall and Resentencing Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">In his recall petition, defendant argued that his current status showed that he was not dangerous. Attached to the petition were letters indicating that defendant had been accepted into the Options Recovery Services outpatient reentry program, an abstinence-based drug and alcohol treatment program; that he had been accepted into the Salvation Army Adult Rehabilitation Center in San Jose; that he had been attending the Saturday Alcoholics Anonymous program at San Quentin for six months beginning in the first half of 2013; and that his \u201cC-file\u201d showed that had been participating in AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) since May of 2012. In addition, defendant submitted a two-page relapse prevention plan in which he outlined how he would avoid relapsing and returning to the use of drugs and alcohol. Finally, defendant submitted a letter to the court in which he acknowledged that his criminal record was \u201cbad and really questionable,\u201d and in which he indicated remorse for his past actions. He wrote \u201cI. . . grieved the passing of life and the injury to another. I am appalled of my causing such pain to the family of the deceased.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">\n<em>Prosecution\u2019s Opposition to Resentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-11\">The prosecutor argued that if defendant were resentenced and released he would be a serious danger to public safety. The prosecutor noted that defendant had 14 alcohol- and drug-related criminal driving convictions, three convictions for being under the influence of narcotics, and 17 convictions for driving on a suspended or revoked license. The prosecutor pointed out that defendant\u2019s record stretched back to 1971 and that previously defendant\u2019s driving had resulted in the death of one person and the severe injury of that person\u2019s wife.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prosecutor asserted that the danger of releasing defendant was \u201cgreat\u201d because \u201che has shown, over the course of 26 years that he continually drives while intoxicated with alcohol or high on drugs, but also because his attitude, as expressed . . . both in this case and in the case involving his strike priors, indicates a refusal to acknowledge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>terrible danger he presents each and every time he gets in a car while high on alcohol and drugs. In his statement to the probation officer in this case, the defendant says he is \u2018guilty\u2019 in this case, and even admits he was \u2018pretty high\u2019 before he left the bar in his car, but nevertheless \u2018believes he was driving safely.\u2019 After 26 years of alcohol education, drug programs, numerous grants of probation with drug and alcohol counseling, this man had <em>[sic] </em>not changed his behavior and refused to recognize that driving while under the influence of alcohol presented any danger at all, even after he killed someone! He did \u2018not think he could have injured anyone in the current case\u2019 because he was not \u2019totally gone.\u2019 He was AT LEAST a .26 at the time. He refused to accept responsibility for his actions and blamed other people for his problems. He blamed his most recent convictions for DUI on his relationship with he [vie] ex-girlfriend[;] \u2018. . . had he not became <em>[sic] </em>involved with her, he would not have those convictions.\u2019 Defendant blames others, expresses no remorse for his continually putting the community at risk by driving and intoxication choices, and is absolutely going to continue with this behavior over the next 25 years, just as he has for the past 26 years. There is no law or court order which would stop this man from endangering our community besides keeping him behind bars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The prosecutor went on to conclude, \u201cTime after time, one year after another, for 26 years he has continued to commit crimes. At this point, the People of Santa Clara County and the State of California deserve protection from his continual criminal conduct. The intent of the \u2018Three Strikes\u2019 law was to remove dangerous criminals from our streets and towns, so that the rest of the law abiding citizenry can enjoy the menace of criminal behavior such as that in which the defendant engages.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">As to defendant\u2019s record while incarcerated, all the prosecutor could point to in defendant\u2019s record was a \u201cConviction\u201d for \u201cPossession of Contraband.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">\n<em>The Recall Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Joel Esparza, defendant\u2019s brother \u2014 a registered nurse \u2014 testified that he was prepared to help his brother with housing, food, clothing, and the basic necessities of life should his brother be released from prison. Mr. Esparza <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>said that his brother had learned to avoid a alcohol and drugs and had expressed remorse for a vehicular manslaughter conviction that his brother sustained wherein his brother killed a man and seriously injured the man\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">At the end of the hearing, defendant\u2019s counsel argued that defendant\u2019s records \u201cshow a durable and sustained absence from the use of alcohol\u201d while defendant has been in prison. Counsel pointed out that in the 17 years defendant has been in prison he \u201chas not done anything wrong.\u201d Counsel asserted that defendant had made a lifetime commitment never to drink alcohol again and that the recidivism rate for 60-year-olds such as defendant was \u201cvery, very, low.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The prosecutor countered that defendant posed an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. The prosecutor conceded that for violent offenders the older they get the recidivism rate lowers, but stated that defendant was an alcoholic and \u201c[t]hat never goes away.\u201d The prosecutor referred to defendant\u2019s never taking advantage of drug and alcohol programs for 26 years and again noted that defendant blamed other people for what happened. The prosecutor continued, \u201cI do find it ironic that attached to counsel\u2019s papers that during the 16 years that he\u2019s been in custody there\u2019s no evidence of AA meetings or any type of drug or alcohol treatment that he received in prison. It wasn\u2019t unless [sic] two years ago when he knew he potential <em>[sic] </em>could be able to present to the Court and be resentenced that he finally took action, and I think it\u2019s only been six months that he\u2019s gone to AA meetings and he\u2019s finally programmed and looked for options that would be able to help this issue. [\u00b6] And I would just like to state that maybe he didn\u2019t drink in prison, maybe he did. We don\u2019t know. All we know is that he wasn\u2019t caught drinking in prison and disciplined for it. But it is hard to get access to alcohol while you\u2019re in prison. So who is to say when he gets out when he is an alcoholic, for 26 years when he was drinking, programming, being told not to drink, being arrested, spending time in jail, spending time in programs, he continued to drink for 26 years. We don\u2019t know what he did in prison. There\u2019s no evidence of a [sic] that. We just know he wasn\u2019t caught. But the fact is he\u2019s still an alcoholic.\u201d The prosecutor concluded, \u201cThere\u2019s no assurance he\u2019s not going to drink again, and we still do see that he\u2019s a danger to the community.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The court said that it had never seen a case where someone had 14 convictions for DUI. The court did not doubt that defendant had behaved well in prison because he did not have a history of being a violent person \u2014 the court found that defendant \u201cis an alcoholic who drinks and drives.\u201d The court recited defendant\u2019s criminal history for the record \u2014 41 misdemeanor convictions and three felonies. The court noted that defendant had driven on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>revoked or suspended license 17 times. The court mentioned defendant\u2019s 1985 conviction for vehicular manslaughter. The court thought that since defendant was sentenced to prison on that case \u2014 which involved driving under the influence \u2014 defendant might have learned his lesson and made a lifestyle change. The court noted that he had not because after he was paroled in 1991, defendant was found to be drunk in public in 1993, picked up two more DUI\u2019s, one in 1993 and one in 1994, and another in 1996 after he was paroled. Further, his most recent DUI offenses were in 1997. The court found that \u201c[pjrobably in the scheme of things\u201d defendant\u2019s prison record was \u201cthe most stellar\u201d the court had seen. The court concluded that defendant was \u201can alcoholic who cannot control himself in the community.\u201d \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The court went on to say that defendant had not started his AA meetings until \u201cApril of last year, so he didn\u2019t do anything with respect to trying to help himself with respect to his alcohol problem. And you can perhaps infer, and I don\u2019t know if this is a fact, but maybe you can infer that he did this simply because the law had changed and he would be eligible to be reconsidered under the law for resentencing because of the nature of the commitment, which is not a serious violent felony. But he didn\u2019t start [until] April of 2013. That\u2019s what the record reflects that was submitted to the Court.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Ultimately, the court concluded that it was \u201cnot willing to make a decision in this case that [defendant is] not a danger in the community. I have very grave concerns that ... in fact you would be a danger to the community because of your alcohol problem and because of your prior history.\u201d Accordingly, the court denied defendant\u2019s petition for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">At the outset, we note that in <em>Teal </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2014) 60 Cal.4th 595 [179 Cal.Rptr.3d 365, 336 P.3d 686], the California Supreme Court held that the denial of a motion for recall and resentencing is an appealable postconviction order. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 599-601.)</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">\n<em>Definition of Unreasonable Risk of Danger to Public Safety</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ABz\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender under Proposition 36, the inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of section 1170.126. \u201cAn inmate is eligible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>resentencing if: [\u00b6] (1) The inmate is serving an indeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12 for a conviction of a felony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7. [\u00b6] (2) The inmate\u2019s current sentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (1) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or clauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12. [\u00b6] (3) The inmate has no prior convictions for any of the offenses appearing in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">If the inmate satisfies all three criteria, as did defendant, he or she \u201cshall be resentenced [as a second strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (f).) In exercising this discretion, \u201cthe court may consider: [\u00b6] (1) The [inmate\u2019s] criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes; [\u00b6] (2) The [inmate\u2019s] disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated; and [\u00b6] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (g).)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Effective November 5, 2014, the voters approved Proposition 47, which, among other things, \u201c[r]equire[s] misdemeanors instead of felonies for nonserious, nonviolent crimes [such as] petty theft and drug possession, unless the defendant has prior convictions for specified violent or serious crimes.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text of Prop. 47, \u00a7 3, p. 70 (Voter Information Guide).) Proposition 47 added section 1170.18 to the Penal Code, under which \u201c[a] person currently serving a sentence for a conviction, whether by trial or plea, of a felony or felonies who would have been guilty of a misdemeanor under the act that added this section . . . had this act been in effect at the time of the offense may petition for a recall of sentence before the trial court that entered the judgment of conviction in his or her case [and] request resentencing . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (a).) If subdivision (a) of this provision is satisfied, subdivision (b) requires recall and resentencing \u201cunless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (b).) Subdivision (c) provides: <em>\u201cAs used throughout this Code, </em>\u2018unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u2019 means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (c), italics added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Defendant argues that Proposition 47\u2019s definition of unreasonable risk of danger to public safety necessarily governs the identical section 1170.126 standard.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Plainly, if considered solely as a matter of grammatical construction, Proposition 47\u2019s definition of \u201cunreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u201d undoubtedly is tied to the words \u201cAs used throughout this Code.\u201d However, such a literal construction is not to be adopted if it conflicts with the voters\u2019 intent shown in the official ballot pamphlet. <em>(People v. Briceno </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 451, 459 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 418, 99 P.3d 1007]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Osuna </em>(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1033-1034 [171 Cal.Rptr.3d 55].) Nothing in the official ballot pamphlet for Proposition 47 hints at any impact on the procedure for resentencing three strikes inmates. The explanation for that omission is plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Proposition 47 was intended to reduce penalties for \u201ccertain nonserious and nonviolent property and drug offenses from wobblers or felonies to misdemeanors.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, <em>supra, </em>analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35.) Those crimes were identified as \u201cGrand Theft,\u201d \u201cShoplifting,\u201d \u201cReceiving Stolen Property,\u201d \u201cWriting Bad Checks,\u201d \u201cCheck Forgery,\u201d and \u201cDrug Possession.\u201d (Ibid., italics omitted.) \u201cThis measure allows offenders currently serving felony sentences <em>for the above crimes </em>to apply to have their felony sentences reduced to misdemeanor sentences. . . . In addition, the measure states that a court is not required to resentence an offender currently serving a felony sentence if the court finds it likely that this offender will commit a specified severe crime.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>analysis by Legis. Analyst, p. 36, italics added.) This intent was echoed by the proponents of Proposition 47, who argued the measure \u201cis sensible\u201d in that it \u201cStops wasting prison space on petty crimes and focuses law enforcement resources on violent and serious crime by changing low-level nonviolent crimes such as simple drug possession and petty theft from felonies to misdemeanors.\u201d <em>(Id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>argument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38.) In sum, a key part of Proposition 47 is the resentencing procedure of section 1170.18, which is to some extent modeled on section 1170.126; however, there is no mention in the Voter Information Guide of the passage of the Act, which occurred only two years before.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Furthermore, in Proposition 47, as noted <em>ante, </em>the electorate redefined several felonies as misdemeanors and extended the benefits of the law to current inmates similar to Proposition 36. Under the retroactive part of Proposition 47, similar to the retroactive part of Proposition 36, relief can be denied to unreasonably dangerous inmates. The new, narrower definition of \u201cunreasonable risk of danger\u201d in Proposition 47 is appropriate because the inmates who stand to benefit from Proposition 47 are now considered misdemeanants, or they would have been if they had committed their crimes after the passage of Proposition 47. As misdemeanants, in general, they as a class are less dangerous than recidivist felons with prior strike offenses. It is axiomatic that a felony is a more serious type of crime than a misdemeanor. It would be illogical to believe that the electorate intended to change Proposition 36 when in Proposition 47 it redefined some felonies as misdemeanors; to do so would be to treat felons whose underlying third crime is still a felony if committed today as if they were now misdemeanants.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Moreover, Proposition 47\u2019s definition of \u201c \u2018unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u2019 \u201d applies to \u201cpetitioner[sj.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (c).) However, Proposition 36 has a sunset clause. Without a showing of good cause, a three strikes inmate had until November 7, 2014 (two days after Prop. 47 became effective), to file a petition for recall of sentence. (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (b) [an inmate may file a petition for a recall of sentence, <em>within two years after the effective date of the act </em>that added this section or at a later date upon a showing of good cause].) Without a showing of good cause, the only \u201cpetitioners\u201d who are able to petition for recall of sentence after November 7, 2014, are those who are eligible to petition for recall under section 1170.18. We must presume that the drafters of Proposition 47 were aware of this when they used the word \u201cpetitioner\u201d in subdivision (c) of section 1170.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Before we constrain a court considering whether to release a former three strikes offender back to the streets, which we would do if we accepted defendant\u2019s arguments, we would need the most compelling proof that the voters intended what we see as an unreasonable and counterintuitive result. Defendant has not satisfied that burden on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">\n<em>Right to a Jury Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">As noted, defendant filed his original recall and resentencing petition on November 14, 2012. Thereafter, the prosecution filed its opposition on March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>8, 2013. Defendant filed his request for a jury trial on March 25, 2013. Defendant\u2019s original petition was dismissed without prejudice on August 1, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">In essence, defendant argues that since there was only a court hearing on his petition for recall of sentence, the court deprived him of the jury trial he had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The People assert that because the request for a jury trial was filed in connection with defendant\u2019s first petition that was dismissed and he did not file a new request after he filed his new petition, the request for a jury trial was rendered moot by the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">We are not persuaded by the People\u2019s argument. At the status hearing on October 18, 2013, the court noted that the prosecution and the defense had already filed their respective papers and defendant\u2019s newly retained counsel requested to file supplemental papers, to which the court agreed. We take this to mean that the court considered everything that had been submitted prior to the dismissal of defendant\u2019s initial petition to be preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">That being said, defendant\u2019s argument that he was denied his right to a jury trial is premised on his assertion that section 1170.126 creates a new statutory presumption for a two strike sentence; he asserts that the statute mandates that the court impose the two strike sentence unless a factual finding of dangerousness is made. We do not agree with defendant that a second strike sentence is the presumptive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">As we have explained, the language of subdivision (f) of section 1170.126 reads that a petitioner who meets the eligibility criteria \u201cshall be resentenced [as a second strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\u201d It is not unreasonable to read this text to mean that a court \u201cshall\u201d impose a second strike sentence unless \u201cat the discretion of the court\u201d the petitioner\u2019s original sentence of 25 years to life appears more appropriate because of an unreasonable risk of danger to the public. However, it is equally reasonable to read the text to mean that a court may select one of the two penalties (a second strike sentence or the original life sentence) in the exercise of its discretion, with no presumption in favor of one or the other. \u201cThe latter reading accords with common usage. For example, if a teacher informed her students that \u2018you must take a final exam or, at your discretion, write a term paper,\u2019 it would be reasonable for the students to believe they were equally free to pursue either option.\u201d <em>(People v. Gutierrez </em>(2014) 58 Cal.4th 1354, 1371 [171 Cal.Rptr.3d 421, 324 P.3d 245] <em>(Gutierrez).) </em>The text of subdivision (f) of section 1170.126 does not plainly indicate that a second strike sentence is the presumptive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>In sum, we do not agree with defendant that Proposition 36 creates a presumption in favor of a second strike sentence. Such a conclusion comports with the plain language of the statute. Had voters intended to permit retention of an indeterminate term only in extraordinary cases, they would have said so in subdivision (f) of section 1170.126, rather than employing language that affords courts broad discretion to find dangerousness. In addition, they would not have afforded the trial court the power to consider any evidence it determined to be relevant to the issue as they did in subdivision (g)(3) of section 1170.126. (See <em>Gutierrez, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at pp. 1371-1372 [examining legislative history and voter intent in attempt to resolve statutory ambiguity].)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court has clarified that its opinions regarding a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to have essential facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt do not apply to limits on downward sentence modifications. <em>(Dillon v. United States </em>(2010) 560 U.S. 817, 828 [177 L.Ed.2d 271, 130 S.Ct. 2683] [taking the original sentence as given, any facts found by a judge at a modification proceeding do not serve to increase the prescribed range of punishment].)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Nothing in <em>Alleyne </em>v. <em>United States </em>(2013) 570 U.S. _, _ [186 L.Ed.2d 314, 133 S.Ct. 2151], cited by defendant, supports his views. As described by the California Supreme Court, in <em>Alleyne </em>\u201cthe United States Supreme Court held that the federal Constitution\u2019s Sixth Amendment entitles a defendant to a jury trial, with a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard of proof, as to \u2018any fact that increases the mandatory minimum\u2019 sentence for a crime.\u201d <em>(People v. Nunez and Satele </em>(2013) 57 Cal.4th 1, 39, fn. 6 [158 Cal.Rptr.3d 585, 302 P.3d 981].) The denial of a recall petition does not increase the mandatory minimum sentence for a defendant\u2019s crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">\u201cThe retrospective part of the Act is not constitutionally required, but an act of lenity on the part of the electorate. It does not provide for wholesale resentencing of eligible petitioners. Instead, it provides for a proceeding where the original sentence may be modified downward. Any facts found at such a proceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth Amendment issues.\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) </em>(2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1304-1305 [155 Cal.Rptr.3d 856] <em>(Kaulick).) </em>We agree with <em>Kaulick </em>on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">In <em>Kaulick, </em>the defendant argued that the standard of proof applicable to the determination of dangerousness under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) should be beyond a reasonable doubt, reasoning that \u201ca finding of dangerousness is a factor [that] justifies enhancing a defendant\u2019s sentence beyond a statutorily presumed second strike sentence.\u201d <em>(Kaulick, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>at p. 1301.) The defendant argued that once he was found eligible for resentencing under the Act, he \u201cwas subject <em>only </em>to a second strike sentence, <em>unless </em>the prosecution established dangerousness.\u201d <em>(Kaulick, supra, </em>at p. 1302.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The <em>Kaulick </em>court held that under the Act, effectively, a third strike indeterminate sentence is not recalled upon a finding of eligibility, before the trial court determines whether dangerousness is established. <em>(Kaulick, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1303.) The court explained: \u201c[Djangerousness is not a factor [that] enhances the sentence imposed when a defendant is resentenced under the Act; instead, dangerousness is a hurdle [that] must be crossed in order for a defendant to be resentenced at all. If the court finds that resentencing a prisoner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger, the court does not resentence the prisoner, and the petitioner simply finishes out the term to which he or she was originally sentenced.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>fn. omitted.) We agree with Kaulick\u2019s reasoning and conclusion. We conclude that defendant did not have the right to a jury trial on the issue of whether he would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if he were resentenced as a second strike defendant.

(f).)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Simply put, a denial of an inmate\u2019s petition does not increase the penalty to which that inmate is already subject, but instead removes the inmate from the scope of an act of lenity on the part of the electorate to which he or she is not constitutionally entitled. That the denial is based on a determination of dangerousness does not change that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">\n<em>Reasonable Doubt Standard of Proof</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Defendant argues that he was entitled to a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and his attorney\u2019s failure to assert that standard deprived him of the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">In essence, defendant maintains that dangerousness is a fact that must be found beyond a reasonable doubt. In <em>Kaulick, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.4th at pages 1301-1306, the court considered this issue at length. The <em>Kaulick </em>court concluded that dangerousness \u201cneed not be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1303.) The court held that \u201cthe proper standard of proof is preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1305.) As explained <em>ante, </em>the <em>Kaulick </em>court reasoned: \u201cThe retrospective part of the Act is not constitutionally required, but an act of lenity on the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>electorate. It does not provide for wholesale resentencing of eligible petitioners. Instead, it provides for a proceeding where the original sentence may be modified downward. Any facts found at such a proceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth Amendment issues. Thus, there is no constitutional requirement that the facts be established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1304-1305.) Defendant claims that \u201cthe <em>dictum </em>of <em>Kaulick </em>that speaks to this issue was flawed.\u201d We note that this \u201cwas not dicta because it was responsive to the issues raised on appeal and was intended to guide the parties and the trial court in resolving the matter following . . . remand. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Garfield Medical Center v. Belsh\u00e9 </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 798, 806 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 527].) In the introduction to its opinion, the <em>Kaulick </em>court said that it \u201cwill discuss several issues likely to arise on remand, including the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof on the issue of dangerousness.\u201d <em>(Kaulick, supra, </em>at p. 1286.)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">As the <em>Kaulick </em>court explained, the proper standard of proof is preponderance of the evidence. \u201cEvidence Code section 115 provides that, \u2018[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, the burden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\u2019 There is no statute or case authority providing for a greater burden, and [the defendant] has not persuaded us that any greater burden is necessary. In contrast, it is the general rule in California that once a defendant is eligible for an increased penalty, the trial court, in exercising its discretion to impose that penalty, may rely on factors established by a preponderance of the evidence. [Citation.] As dangerousness is such a factor, preponderance of the evidence is the appropriate standard.\u201d <em>(Kaulick, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1305, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">We agree with <em>Kaulick'\u2019&amp; </em>analysis. Similarly, we conclude that the proper standard of proof is preponderance of the evidence. Since defendant was entitled only to a standard of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, his counsel cannot be faulted for failing to assert that he was entitled to a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">\n<em>Burden of Proof</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">At the hearing on defendant\u2019s resentencing petition, after calling the case, the court indicated that the case had been assigned for hearing; that the People had filed opposition; that the court had read that opposition and defendant\u2019s reply; and that, unless there were any motions, the proceedings would start with the presentation of evidence. Immediately, the court told defendant\u2019s counsel to \u201c[g]o ahead.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel told the court that \u201cthe People have the burden, but I\u2019m happy to proceed this way.\u201d The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>responded, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to what?\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel told the court, \u201cI believe the People have the burden but I am happy to proceed in this matter. My client is not intending to testify but I would like to call my client\u2019s brother . . . .\u201d The court said that counsel could call a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">After defendant\u2019s brother Joel testified, the court asked defense counsel if she had any more witnesses. Defense counsel, Ms. Bucknell, said that she did not intend to present any other witness. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-5\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay. So you rest as far as the presentation of any further evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">\u201c[MS. BUCKNELL]: Yes, unless the Court wishes to address my client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: No. [\u00b6] On behalf of the People, Ms. Schon?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">\u201c[MS. SCHON]: No witnesses, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Okay, so that concludes the testimony. [\u00b6] Now is the opportunity of counsel to address the Court by way of any argument. [\u00b6] Ms. Bucknell.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Immediately, defendant\u2019s counsel began her argument to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">Defendant argues that implicitly the court imposed the burden of proof on him and required him to prove he had rehabilitated in violation of his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">The People argue that both defense counsel and the prosecutor recognized that the People have the burden of proof and the trial court is presumed to have known and applied the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">Certainly, \u201cEvidence Code section 664 provides that \u2018[i]t is presumed that official duty has been regularly performed\u2019 and scores of appellate decisions, relying on this provision, have held that \u2018in the absence of any contrary evidence, we are entitled to presume that the trial court. . . properly followed established law.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ross v. Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 899, 913 [141 Cal.Rptr. 133, 569 P.2d 727].)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">At the time of defendant\u2019s hearing, there was only one published case that had discussed who had the burden of proof in a recall and resentencing hearing. As we have explained, <em>Kaulick </em>found that the prosecution bears the burden of establishing \u201cdangerousness\u201d by a preponderance of the evidence against a claim the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases requires proof beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>doubt. <em>(Kaulick, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.) Thus, at the time of defendant\u2019s hearing it cannot be said that it was \u201cestablished law\u201d that the prosecution had the burden of proof in a recall and resentencing hearing. Furthermore, we reject the People\u2019s argument that since the court had read the parties\u2019 pleadings and the prosecution had no witnesses to present, the \u201ccourt\u2019s common sense approach\u201d for defense counsel to go first \u201cdid not demonstrate that \u2018it was operating as if [defendant] bore the burden of proof.\u2019 \u201d If that is so, we have to question why the court asked the prosecutor if she wished to present any witnesses <em>after </em>defendant\u2019s counsel rested; why the court directed defendant\u2019s counsel to address the court first \u201cby way of any argument\u201d; and why the court stated that it was \u201cnot willing to make a decision in this case that [defendant is] not a danger in the community.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Burden of proof, as distinguished from this court\u2019s scope of review, is an evidentiary concept. It means \u201cthe obligation of a party to establish by evidence a requisite degree of belief concerning a fact in the mind of the trier of fact or the court.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 115; see <em>id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 605, 606.) \u201cBurden of proof\u2019 encompasses two separate burdens. \u201cOne burden is that of producing evidence, satisfactory to the judge, of a particular fact in issue. The second is the burden of persuading the trier of fact that the alleged fact is true.\u201d (2 McCormick, Evidence (7th ed. 2013) Burden of Proof and Presumptions, \u00a7 336, p. 643, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Preponderance of the evidence means \u201c \u2018evidence that has more convincing force than that opposed to it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Glage </em>v. <em>Hawes Firearms Co. </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 314, 324 [276 Cal.Rptr. 430].) That standard is met when \u201cevidence on one side outweighs, preponderates over, is more than, the evidence on the other side, not necessarily in number of witnesses or quantity, but in its effect on those to whom it is addressed.\u201d <em>(People v. Miller </em>(1916) 171 Cal. 649, 652 [154 P. 468].) In light of this standard, the burden of proof becomes relevant to the determination only if the evidence is evenly balanced in the mind of the fact finder. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Plainly, the court did not view the relevant facts as supporting both positions equally. The court described defendant\u2019s criminal record \u2014 41 misdemeanors, three felonies, 17 times driving on a revoked or suspended license, and a manslaughter conviction. Although the court found defendant\u2019s prison record to be \u201cthe most stellar\u201d the court had seen for somebody who had been in prison for 16 years, it was the nature of the offenses that defendant committed that concerned the court; and the inference the court drew that defendant only started his AA meetings \u201csimply because the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>had changed and he would be eligible to be reconsidered under the law for resentencing because of the nature of the commitment, which is not a serious violent felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">The Act left the dangerousness determination to the court\u2019s discretion, considering defendant\u2019s criminal history, his conduct while incarcerated, and any other relevant evidence. (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (g).) Even though the trial court here failed to correctly assign the burden of proof, that failure does not amount to prejudicial error or a due process violation <em>if </em>the prosecution met its obligation under Evidence Code section 115 of proving the facts on which the court based its dangerousness determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Certainly, the prosecution produced documents from defendant\u2019s prison file, which included the probation report from his 1997 case. In that case, defendant was convicted of two counts of DUI with three or more prior DUI convictions (Veh. Code, 23152, subd. (b)), one count of resisting, delaying or obstructing a police officer, and one count of driving on a suspended license (Veh. Code, \u00a7 14601.2, subd. (a)). The probation report documented defendant\u2019s prior criminal record \u2014 three felonies,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which were drug and alcohol related, 41 misdemeanors, which included 13 DUI\u2019s, 17 driving with a suspended or revoked license and three drug-related charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Nevertheless, the court based its determination of current dangerousness not only on defendant\u2019s prior criminal record, but also on the fact that the court could infer from the evidence before it that defendant was not really sincere in his efforts in AA since defendant had only started his AA classes in April 2013. The prosecution failed to prove that fact. In fact, the records before the court showed that at the time of the hearing defendant had been attending AA meetings for nearly two years starting in the second quarter of 2012, not six months as the court found, and not at a time when it could be inferred that he did so because the law had changed \u2014 the Act was not passed until November 6, 2012, several months after defendant began his AA meetings. (See <em>Yearwood, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.4th at p. 167 [the voters approved Prop. 36 on Nov. 6, 2012].) Moreover, the prosecution presented no evidence that defendant\u2019s commitment to AA was insincere.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">In this case, the trial court\u2019s analysis became disconnected from the evidence presented. Whether we review this as a violation of defendant\u2019s due process rights because the prosecution failed to carry its burden,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> or abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>discretion by the trial court (see <em>People v. Cluff </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 991, 998 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 80] [trial court abuses its discretion when factual findings critical to decision find no support in record]), the result is the same. Defendant is entitled to a new recall and resentencing hearing at which the prosecution must present evidence that <em>currently </em>defendant poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. To do so, the prosecution must present substantial evidence that that is the case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> By definition, \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d requires <em>evidence </em>and not mere speculation. In any given case, one \u201cmay <em>speculate </em>about any number of scenarios that may have occurred .... A reasonable inference, however, \u2018may not be based on suspicion alone, or on imagination, speculation, supposition, surmise, conjecture, or guess work. [\u00b6] . . . A finding of fact must be an inference drawn from evidence rather than ... a mere speculation as to probabilities without evidence.\u2019 \u201d (Morris, <em>supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 21, disapproved on an unrelated point in <em>In re Sassounian </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 535, 543, fn. 5 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 446, 887 P.2d 527].)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">We make the following observations for the benefit of the trial court on remand. In discussing the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard applicable in parole cases, the California Supreme Court has stated: \u201cThis standard is unquestionably deferential, but certainly is not toothless, and \u2018due consideration\u2019 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>specified factors requires more than rote recitation of the relevant factors with no reasoning establishing a rational nexus between those factors and the necessary basis for the ultimate decision \u2014 the determination of current dangerousness.\u201d <em>(In re Lawrence </em>(2008) 44 Cal.4th 1181, 1210 [82 Cal.Rptr.3d 169, 190 P.3d 535] <em>(Lawrence).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Although we decline to decide how and to what extent parole cases inform the decision whether to resentence a petitioner under the Act or our review of such a decision, we believe that the proper focus is on whether the petitioner <em>currently </em>poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (Cf. <em>In re Shaputis </em>(2008) 44 Cal.4th 1241, 1254 [82 Cal.Rptr.3d 213, 190 P.3d 573] <em>(Shaputis); Lawrence, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at p. 1214.) Further, we believe that a trial court may properly deny resentencing under the Act based solely on immutable facts such as a petitioner\u2019s criminal history <em>\u201conly </em>if those facts support the ultimate conclusion that an inmate <em>continues </em>to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lawrence, supra, </em>at p. 1221.) \u201c \u2018[T]he relevant inquiry is whether [a petitioner\u2019s prior criminal and/or disciplinary history], when considered in light of other facts in the record, are such that they continue to be predictive of current dangerousness many years [later]. This inquiry is ... an individualized one, and cannot be undertaken simply by examining the circumstances of [the petitioner\u2019s criminal history] in isolation, without consideration of the passage of time or the attendant changes in the inmate\u2019s psychological or mental attitude. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Shaputis, supra, </em>at pp. 1254-1255.)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Writ Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In his writ petition, defendant claims that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he asserts that his trial counsel failed to adequately investigate and present a prison expert at his Proposition 36 resentencing hearing to explain to the court how extraordinary it was for defendant not to have had a single disciplinary infraction in 16 years; to explain how prevalent the use of alcohol and drugs are within the California prison system and in that context, for an alcoholic inmate not to have a single disciplinary infraction in 16 years, which reflects a commitment to sobriety; to explain why residential treatment at the initial phase of reentry would likely facilitate a relapse-free life for defendant; to explain how difficult it is in prison to regularly attend AA meetings; and to explain how his recent and regular attendance further bolsters the likelihood that defendant will remain clean and sober out of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>We sought and received informal opposition to defendant\u2019s writ petition and an informal reply from defendant on this issue. However, since we must reverse the lower court and remand for further proceedings, the issue raised is moot.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">As to defendant\u2019s other contention that the trial court\u2019s finding in his 1997 case that his priors were strikes violated his constitutional right to due process under <em>Descamps, supra, </em>570 U.S. at page _ [133 S.Ct. at p. 2288], this is an attempt to mount a collateral attack on a long-final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Without doubt, all courts in California have original jurisdiction in writ proceedings. Article VI, section 10 of the California Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court, courts of appeal, superior courts, and their judges have original jurisdiction in habeas corpus proceedings.\u201d This \u201coriginal jurisdiction\u201d means that a petition for writ of habeas corpus may be filed in the first instance in the superior court, Court of Appeal, or the California Supreme Court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Romero </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 728, 737 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 270, 883 P.2d 388].)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Having original jurisdiction and exercising it are two separate things. It has long been the law in California that, while a Court of Appeal may have original jurisdiction in a habeas corpus proceeding, it has the discretion to deny a petition without prejudice if it has not been first presented to the trial court. As the Fifth District Court of Appeal explained more than half a century ago: \u201cThere is no question but that this court has jurisdiction to issue the writ of habeas corpus [citation]. But this court has discretion to refuse to issue the writ as an exercise of original jurisdiction on the ground that application has not been made therefor in a lower court in the first instance.\u201d <em>(In re Hillery </em>(1962) 202 Cal.App.2d 293, 294 [20 Cal.Rptr. 759] <em>(Hillery).) </em>In <em>Hillery, </em>the petition, which was filed directly in the Court of Appeal, was denied because the petitioner did not show \u201cthat any extraordinary reason exists for action by this court, rather than by the Superior Court of the State of California.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The same can be said of this case. Since the appeal in this case is from the denial of a Proposition 36 resentencing hearing, it seems more appropriate that the superior court decide this issue in the first instance since it is collateral to the Proposition 36 resentencing hearing. Accordingly, as to this issue we deny the petition without prejudice to defendant\u2019s raising it in the superior court in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The order denying defendant\u2019s petition for recall of sentence is reversed and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b698-6\">Rushing, R J., and Premo, J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-8\"> All further unspecified statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b680-9\"> Originally, defendant filed his petition on November 14, 2012.

Furthermore, it appears that the prosecutor\u2019s argument is taken almost directly from the prosecution\u2019s opposition to defendant\u2019s request in his 1997 case for the court to exercise its discretion and strike one of his strike convictions. On this court\u2019s own motion we have taken judicial notice of the record in defendant\u2019s 1997 case <em>(People </em>v. <em>Esparza </em>(Feb. 8, 1999, H017413) [nonpub. opn.]). (See Evid.

On this point, the United States Supreme Court has undertaken different approaches depending on the context in which the violation occurs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>and the type of violation. One view is that there either is or there is not a due process violation, such a violation being generally understood, with regard to trial errors, to be a defect that rendered the trial fundamentally unfair. (See <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli </em>(1973) 411 U.S. 778, 790 [36 L.Ed.2d 656, 93 S.Ct. 1756] [fundamental fairness \u2014 the touchstone of due process \u2014 will require that the state provide at its expense counsel for indigent probationers or parolees].) Accordingly, if there is a due process violation, \u201c \u2018[i]t is unnecessary to add a separate layer of harmless-error analysis ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Kyles v. Whitley </em>(1995) 514 U.S. 419, 436, fn. 9 [131 L.Ed.2d 490, 115 S.Ct. 1555] [it is unnecessary to add a separate layer of harmless error analysis to an evaluation of whether a petitioner in a habeas corpus case has presented a constitutionally significant claim for ineffective assistance of counsel].) \u201c[0]nce a reviewing court applying [a review for materiality] has found constitutional error there is no need for further harmless-error review.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 435.) However, elsewhere, the high court has intertwined the consideration of prejudice and due process violations. \u201c[I]f [the defendant] succeeds in demonstrating \u2018cause and prejudice,\u2019 he will at the same time succeed in establishing the elements of his . . . due process claim.\u201d <em>(Banks v. Dretke </em>(2004) 540 U.S. 668, 691 [157 L.Ed.2d 1166, 124 S.Ct. 1256].) In <em>Bradshaw </em>v. <em>Stumpf </em>(2005) 545 U.S. 175 [162 L.Ed.2d 143, 125 S.Ct. 2398], the court implied that an inquiry into both a due process violation and prejudice is valid appellate procedure. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 187 [we express no opinion on whether the prosecutor\u2019s actions amounted to a due process violation, or whether any such violation would have been prejudicial].) The applicable standard may depend on the type of due process claim; for example, the due process claim addressed in <em>Kyles </em>contains a materiality component and so prejudice analysis may be superfluous. Here, it was fundamentally unfair for the court to place the burden of proof on defendant to show that he was no longer a danger to public safety and to then misconstrue the evidence presented by the prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\"> Evidence is substantial only if it \u201c \u2018reasonably inspires confidence and is of \u201csolid value.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v.
