J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVe\">Defendant Lionel Fredrick Johnson, Jr., while plainly drunk, admitted to the police that he had been driving an SUV that had just plowed into another SUV, injuring five people.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-11\">In a previous appeal <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(2013) 222 Cal.App.4th 486 [166 Cal.Rptr.3d 316]), we held, among other things, that the trial court erred by finding insufficient evidence to require a hearing on defendant\u2019s posttrial motion for disclosure of jurors\u2019 identifying information, because one of the supporting declarations did contain evidence of one instance of juror misconduct. Noting, however, that the declarations were in conflict, we directed the trial court to grant a hearing unless it found that that declaration was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-12\">On remand, the trial court found that the declaration was not credible. Accordingly, once again, it denied the motion without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-13\">In this second appeal, defendant\u2019s sole contention is that, in the previous appeal, we erred by directing the trial court to consider the credibility of the declarations on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1158\">*1158</page-number>In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we will hold that, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, the doctrines of forfeiture, stare decisis, and the law of the case do not prevent us from reaching defendant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">In the published portion of this opinion, we will hold that, in deciding whether to hold a hearing on a motion for disclosure of jurors\u2019 identifying information, the trial court must assume that the declarations supporting the motion are credible; we will overrule our previous opinion to the extent that it held otherwise. Accordingly, we will direct the trial court to hold an evidentiary hearing on defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-7\">A. <em>Conviction and Sentencing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-8\">Defendant was found guilty of driving under the influence and causing injury (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (a)) and driving with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 percent or more and causing injury (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23153, subd. (b)). On each count, one enhancement for personally inflicting great bodily injury (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)) and three enhancements for causing injury to an additional victim (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23558) were found true. Two \u201cstrike\u201d priors (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12), two prior serious felony conviction enhancements (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667, subd. (a)), and one 1-year prior prison term enhancement (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)) were found true. As a result, defendant was sentenced to a total of 41 years to life in prison, along with the usual fines, fees, and directives.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-9\">B. <em>Defendant\u2019s Motion for Disclosure of Jurors\u2019 Identifying Information.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-10\">The sentencing hearing was held more than 13 months after the jury returned its verdicts. One month before the sentencing hearing, defendant filed a motion for release of jurors\u2019 identifying information. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 237.) The motion was supported by declarations from defendant\u2019s mother and stepfather, Joy and Delvin Livingston.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-11\">According to defendant\u2019s mother, on the day after the jury returned its verdicts, \u201cas we were leaving the courtroom, three female jurors were standing outside the courtroom.\u201d One was crying. When the crying juror learned who defendant\u2019s mother and stepfather were, she said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. ... I want to talk to the judge.\u201d She then asked, \u201c[W]hy didn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1159\">*1159</page-number>[defendant] take the witness stand and defend himself[?] Why didn\u2019t he say something, we need to hear it from him.\u201d Defendant\u2019s mother and stepfather introduced her to defense counsel and told him what she had said. He gave her his card \u201cand told her to give him a call.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">According to defendant\u2019s stepfather, at a hearing on the day after the jury returned its verdicts, he and defendant\u2019s mother were sitting inside the courtroom; three female jurors were sitting behind them. When they learned who defendant\u2019s mother and stepfather were, one of them said she was sorry and started to cry. The other two jurors said \u201c \u2018it was hard for us to vote guilty. [Defendant] may . . . not [have] been the driver and it was possible that he was covering for someone else.\u2019 \u201d One of the two jurors \u201cfurther stated that most of them were thinking that if [defendant] was not the driver, why didn\u2019t he take the stand to defend himself during the deliberations.\u201d The crying juror \u201cstarted to cry more and said she needed to talk to the judge to do something about what happened.\u201d \u201cThe juror\u201d also said something that the jurors \u201cwrestled with\u201d was \u201cwhy isn\u2019t [defendant] taking the stand.\u201d Finally, \u201c[t]he three jurors indicated that they were at least half of the jurors who raised the question if he is innocent why didn\u2019t he take the stand to defend himself.\u201d When the hearing was over, all three jurors spoke to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">On the date set for sentencing, the trial court first heard argument on defendant\u2019s motion. The prosecutor conceded, \u201c[Ajssuming the facts as stated in the motion are correct, I believe there is good cause to disclose the juror information.\u201d However, he argued that the declarations were not credible because, if the facts stated in them were true, defense counsel would not have waited over a year to file the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">The trial court denied the motion because, in its view, the declarations fell short of showing any jury misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">C. <em>The First Appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">Defendant appealed, arguing (among other things) that the trial court had erred by denying his motion for disclosure of jurors\u2019 identifying information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-10\">As threshold matters, we held that (1) the declarations were not inadmissible hearsay <em>(People v. Johnson, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.4th 486, 493-494); (2) defendant did not have to show that he had made diligent efforts to contact the jurors by other means <em>(id. </em>at pp. 495-497); and (3) the motion was timely <em>(id. </em>at pp. 497-498).</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">We then held that, under Evidence Code section 1150, all of the evidence of purported juror misconduct in defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s declaration was inadmissible. <em>(People v. Johnson, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.4th at p. 495.) Similarly, all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>of the evidence of purported juror misconduct in defendant\u2019s stepfather\u2019s declaration was inadmissible, with one exception \u2014 the statement that \u201c \u2018at least half of the jurors . . . raised the question if he is innocent why he didn\u2019t take the stand to defend himself.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We explained: \u201c \u2018[B]y violating the trial court\u2019s instruction not to discuss defendant\u2019s failure to testify, the jury committed misconduct. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] Moreover, the mere making of such a statement in the jury room was an overt act of misconduct and admissible as such under Evidence Code section 1150. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">We then stated: \u201cFinally, we also consider whether the trial court should have denied defendant\u2019s motion because, as the prosecutor argued below, the declarations were not credible. Certainly there was room for skepticism. The mother and stepfather contradicted each other on several points. If one chooses to credit the mother\u2019s account over the stepfather\u2019s, then there is no admissible evidence of juror misconduct at all. Moreover, it is hard to believe that the jurors told defendant\u2019s parents that they wanted to talk to the judge but did not say this to defense counsel. Indeed, according to the mother, she told defense counsel what the juror had said. Even assuming this information was not volunteered, it is hard to believe that defense counsel did not take the opportunity to debrief the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">\u201cNevertheless, \u2018 \u201c[t]he power to judge the credibility of witnesses and to resolve conflicts in the testimony is vested in the trial court\u201d \u2019 [citation], even when the witnesses testify via declarations [citation]. Here, the trial court denied the motion, but not because the declarations were incredible. We cannot say that the declarations were incredible as a matter of law. Thus, we cannot affirm the denial on this ground. However, it will be open to the trial court to make such a determination on remand.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.4th at pp. 498-499.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">In our disposition, we ordered: \u201cThe judgment with respect to the conviction is affirmed, and the judgment with respect to the sentence is reversed, subject to the following conditions. On remand, the trial court must reconsider defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure of jurors\u2019 identifying information, and it must grant that motion, unless it finds that the evidence that otherwise supports the motion is not credible. If. . . the trial court denies the motion for disclosure of jurors\u2019 identifying information, . . . the trial court must resentence defendant.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Johnson, supra, </em>222 Cal.App.4th at pp. 499-500.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">The People filed a petition for rehearing, which we denied. Defendant did not file a petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>D. <em>Proceedings on Remand.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">On remand, the trial court duly held another hearing on the motion. The prosecution introduced defendant\u2019s stepfather\u2019s rap sheet. Defendant introduced a letter from an assistant United States attorney. Apparently,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> these exhibits showed that defendant\u2019s stepfather had been convicted in state court of domestic violence. He had also been convicted in federal court of drug distribution. He had been sentenced to life in prison; however, by providing information on other cases, he had gotten his life sentence \u201creduced to something that was less than life.\u201d In the opinion of the assistant United States attorney, he had shown himself to be \u201cabsolutely committed to telling the truth about others and most importantly about himself.\u201d If he were to be found guilty of perjury, he would be \u201cjeopardizing himself in a very big way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">After hearing argument, the trial court once again denied the motion. It specifically found that defendant\u2019s stepfather\u2019s declaration was not credible: \u201cI think the late filing certainly goes to the credibility of [defendant\u2019s stepfather]. And the prior convictions are admissible as impeachment, and the relationship with the defendant and ... the defendant\u2019s mother.\u201d Accordingly, it resentenced defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">II-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-9\">CONSIDERING CREDIBILITY IN DETERMINING WHETHER A PARTY HAS MADE \u201cA PRIMA FACIE SHOWING\u201d UNDER CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE SECTION 237</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-10\">Under Code of Civil Procedure section 237, any person may petition the trial court for access to personal juror identifying information. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 237, subd. (b).) The petition must be accompanied by a declaration (or declarations). <em>{Ibid.) </em>Subject to exceptions not applicable here, \u201c[t]he court shall set the matter for hearing if the petition and supporting declaration establish a prima facie showing of good cause for the release of the personal juror identifying information . . . .\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>\u201cGood cause, in the context of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1162\">*1162</page-number>petition for disclosure to support a motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct, requires \u2018a sufficient showing to support a reasonable belief that jury misconduct occurred . . . .\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Cook </em>(2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 341, 345-346 [186 Cal.Rptr.3d 459].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">If the trial court does set a hearing, it must provide notice to each of the jurors, either by personal service or by mail to his or her last known address. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 237, subd. (c).) \u201cAny affected former juror may appear in person, in writing, by telephone, or by counsel to protest the granting of the petition.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>\u201cAfter the hearing, the records shall be made available as requested in the petition, unless a former juror\u2019s protest to the granting of the petition is sustained. The court shall sustain the protest of the former juror if, in the discretion of the court, the petitioner fails to show good cause, the record establishes the presence of a compelling interest against disclosure . . . , or the juror is unwilling to be contacted by the petitioner.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">The issue before us is fundamentally one of statutory interpretation. \u201c \u2018In construing a statute, our task is to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent and purpose for the enactment. [Citation.] We look first to the plain meaning of the statutory language, giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning. [Citation.] If there is no ambiguity in the statutory language, its plain meaning controls .... [Citation.] \u201cHowever, if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation, courts may consider various extrinsic aids, including the purpose of the statute, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, and the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Yartz </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 529, 537-538 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 328, 123 P.3d 604].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">Under Code of Civil Procedure section 237, subdivision (b), the trial court\u2019s job is to determine whether the petitioner has \u201cestablished] a prima facie showing of good cause.\u201d The statute does not tell us, in so many words, whether it can consider credibility in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">We have considered the legislative history of the \u201cprima facie showing\u201d requirement, to the extent that it is available through the Legislative Counsel\u2019s Web site, but we have not found it particularly helpful. The Legislature was concerned about \u201cincidents where a defendant has received information about the jurors and has harassed or threatened them, by mail, from prison.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Criminal Procedure, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 508 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) Mar. 21, 1995, p. 4.) It therefore determined_to require \u201csome showing of good cause before the records are to be released.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 5.) After the bill was introduced, it was amended to require a prima facie showing of good cause before the trial court must hold an evidentiary hearing. (Sen. Bill No. 508 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended July 5, 1995, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1163\">*1163</page-number>\u00a73.) We have found no readily available legislative history materials relating to the intent behind this amendment. (See, e.g., Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 508 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended July 6, 1995.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">Normally, however, a \u201cprima facie showing\u201d connotes an evidentiary showing that is made without regard to credibility. For example, in the context of an anti-SLAPP motion, to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on the merits, \u201c \u2018the plaintiff \u201cmust demonstrate that the complaint is both legally sufficient and supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment <em>if the evidence submitted by the plaintiff is </em>credited.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Navellier </em>v. <em>Sletten </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88-89 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 530, 52 P.3d 703], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">This is particularly true when the prima facie showing merely triggers an evidentiary hearing, at which any necessary credibility determinations can still be made. <em>Spaccia v. Superior Court </em>(2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 93 [146 Cal.Rptr.3d 742] discussed some of these situations. There, the petitioner claimed the trial court had erred by denying \u2014 without an evidentiary hearing \u2014 her motion to recuse the district attorney. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 102, 108.) Under Penal Code section 1424, a motion to recuse a district attorney must be supported by affidavits; the district attorney may file affidavits in opposition. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1424, subd. (a)(1).) \u201cThe judge shall review the affidavits and determine whether or not an evidentiary hearing is necessary.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">The appellate court noted that the legal standard that applied in determining whether to hold an evidentiary hearing was an issue of first impression. <em>(Spaccia v. Superior Court, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.4th at p. 109.) Based on the legislative history <em>(id. </em>at pp. 110-111), it determined that the Legislature did <em>not </em>intend to require an evidentiary hearing <em>only </em>when there was a disputed issue of material fact <em>(ibid.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">It then stated: \u201cOne situation in which a trial court is called upon to determine whether to grant an evidentiary hearing on an issue is a petition for a modification of a dependency order, under Welfare and Institutions Code section 388. Welfare and Institutions Code section 388 permits a parent or other interested party to seek to modify an existing dependency order. If it appears to the court that the best interests of the child may be promoted by the proposed change of order, the court shall order that a hearing be held on the issue. [Citation.] The courts have concluded that a \u2018parent need only make a prima facie showing to trigger the right to proceed by way of a full hearing.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018A \u201cprima facie\u201d showing refers to those facts which will sustain a favorable decision if the evidence submitted in support of the allegations by the petitioner is credited.\u2019 [Citation.] Similarly, an inmate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>seeking habeas corpus relief must state a prima facie case in order to obtain an order to show cause. [Citations.] In our view, a similar test should apply when a party seeks a hearing on a recusal motion under Penal Code section 1424: the party seeking an evidentiary hearing must make a prima facie showing by affidavit; a prima facie showing refers to those facts demonstrated by admissible evidence, which would sustain a favorable decision <em>if the evidence submitted by the movant is </em>credited.\u201d <em>(Spaccia v. Superior Court, </em>supra, 209 Cal.App.4th 93, 111-112, italics omitted &amp; added, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">In our previous opinion, we relied on the general principle that the trial court, when deciding an issue of fact, can make credibility determinations even when the witnesses testify through declarations. (E.g., <em>People v. Hamlin </em>(2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1412, 1463 [89 Cal.Rptr.3d 402].) However, we overlooked the question of just what issue, exactly, the trial court was supposed to be deciding. Actually, because it was supposed to be deciding whether defendant had \u201cestablish[ed] a prima facie showing of good cause,\u201d credibility was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">Thus, we sent the trial court off on a wild goose chase, in which it obediently considered such matters as the belated filing of the petition, the stepfather\u2019s prior convictions, and the stepfather\u2019s likely bias. These matters were irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">As we held in the previous appeal, the stepfather\u2019s declaration contained admissible evidence that juror misconduct occurred. Arguably, if the mother\u2019s declaration contradicted his declaration on this critical point, that would mean that the declarations as a whole still failed to make a prima facie case. (See <em>D.C. v. R.R. </em>(2010) 182 Cal.App.4th 1190, 1222-1223 [106 Cal.Rptr.3d 399].) The declarations did contradict each other on a variety of details \u2014 with respect to where the conversation with the jurors took place, how many jurors spoke, and whether the jurors spoke to defense counsel. However, the mother did not specifically contradict the stepfather\u2019s statement that the jurors admitted having wondered out loud why, if defendant was innocent, he did not take the stand. She simply did not say (perhaps because she did not recall) whether this statement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">We therefore conclude that in the first appeal, we erred by remanding the case at all. Rather, we should have directed the trial court to hold an evidentiary hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure of jurors\u2019 identifying information. On the principle of \u201cBetter late than never,\u201d we will do so in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">The judgment with respect to conviction is affirmed, subject to any motion for new trial that defendant may bring on remand. The judgment with respect to sentence is reversed, subject to the following conditions. On remand, the trial court must set an evidentiary hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for disclosure of jurors\u2019 identifying information. If it denies the motion, it shall reimpose the original sentence. If it grants the motion, it shall set a date for sentencing that will allow defendant a reasonable time to use the jurors\u2019 identifying information in determining whether to file and in filing a motion for new trial. If defendant fails to file a timely motion for new trial, or if defendant\u2019s new trial motion is denied, the trial court shall reimpose the original sentence. If defendant\u2019s new trial motion is granted, the trial court shall proceed accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1107-7\">Miller, J., and Codrington, J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1103-11\"> The parties have not included these exhibits in the clerk\u2019s transcript (see Cal.
