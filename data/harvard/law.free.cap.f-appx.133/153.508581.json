Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Castillo-Martinez did not raise this issue in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). The district court erred in imposing Castillo-Martinez\u2019s sentence under the mandatory Guidelines scheme, and the error was obvious after <em>Booker. See United States v. Valenzuelcis-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733-34 (5th Cir.2005). However, Castillo-Martinez has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights as he has not shown that the record shows the district court judge would have imposed a different or lesser sentence under a <em>Booker </em>advisory regime. <em>See id. </em>at 733-34. Therefore, he has not met the requirements to show plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">Castillo-Martinez also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d sentencing enhancements under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Sarmiento-Funes, </em>374 F.3d 336, 346 (5th Cir.2004). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>\u201c \u2018unless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Manciar-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 935, 124 S.Ct. 358, 157 L.Ed.2d 245 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
