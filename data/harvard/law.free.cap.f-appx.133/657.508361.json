Aladin argues that the district court erred by applying a 12-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), based on her prior conviction for a drug trafficking offense, when the prior conviction was neither presented to a jury nor admitted by her, in violation of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d <em>403 </em>(2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 261 (2005). Aladin also argues that the district court committed reversible error by treating the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, in violation of <em>Booker. </em>The government concedes that the district court committed <em>Booker </em>non-constitutional error by applying the Guidelines as mandatory and states that remand for resentencing is appropriate because the district court did not indicate whether it would impose the same sentence if the Guidelines were advisory in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">Aladin raised her arguments in the district court and therefore is entitled to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948-49 (11th Cir.2005). We will reverse a <em>Booker </em>error only if the error was harmful, meaning that the error affected substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>The government bears the burden of establishing that an error did not affect a defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-15\">As a preliminary matter, we easily dispense with Aladin\u2019s argument that her case presents a <em>Booker </em>constitutional error because the district court enhanced her sentence for a prior drug-trafficking conviction, when the prior conviction was neither presented to a jury nor admitted by her. In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right to a jury trial. <em>See </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. at 749-50, 160 L.Ed.2d 621. \u201c[T]he Court left undisturbed its holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>that recidivism is <em>not </em>a separate element of an offense that the government is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1233, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998)). \u201cAny fact <em>{other than a prior </em>conviction), which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">\u201cThe reason for the exception for prior convictions is clear: \u2018a prior conviction must itself have been established through procedures satisfying the fair notice, reasonable doubt, and jury trial guarantees.\u2019 \u201d <em>Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960 (quoting <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 249, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 1227, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999)). Simply put, there is no Sixth Amendment violation when a defendant\u2019s sentence is enhanced based on a prior conviction. \u201c[Bjecause the prior-conviction exception remains undisturbed after <em>Booker, </em>a district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>404 F.3d 1283, 1290 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that, pursuant to <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>\u201cthe government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence\u201d); <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (holding that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cwas left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker, </em>\u201d and that \u201ca district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">However, as conceded by the government, Aladin is right that there was <em>Booker </em>non-constitutional error, based on the remedial holding of the case, because the district court treated the Guidelines range as mandatory and \u201cthe Supreme Court has now excised the mandatory nature of the Guidelines in <em>Booker.\u201d Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330 (reviewing <em>Booker </em>claim for plain error). In <em>Shelton, </em>we concluded that \u201cit was <em>Booker </em>error for the district court to sentence Shelton under a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cAs a result of <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial holding, <em>Booker </em>error exists when the district court misapplies the Guidelines by considering them as binding as opposed to advisory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">\u201cIn cases involving preserved <em>Booker </em>error, the Government must show that the mandatory, as opposed to the advisory, application of the guidelines did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1270-71 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948-49). A non-constitutional error is harmless \u201cif, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the [outcome], or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1315 (11th Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cIf one can say \u2018with fair assurance ... that the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 the judgment is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 764 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)); <em>see also United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1266 n.20 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc) </em>(\u201cErrors do affect a substantial right of a party if they have a \u2018substantial influence\u2019 on the outcome of a case or leave \u2018grave doubt\u2019 as to whether they affected the outcome of a case.\u201d (quoting <em>Kotteakos, </em>328 U.S. at 764-65, 66 S.Ct. at 1248)).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Here, the record does not indicate whether or not the district court would have given Aladin the same sentence under an advisory scheme. Moreover, the government concedes that the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>court\u2019s error was not harmless, and thus cannot meet its burden of showing that the error did not affect Aladin\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See Davis, </em>407 F.3d at 1271-72 (\u201cWe simply do not know what the sentencing court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory, and had properly considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Therefore, the Government cannot meet its burden of showing that the district court\u2019s erroneous application of the Guidelines as mandatory was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Accordingly, we vacate Aladin\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-17\">. We note that in this case, the district court correctly determined the Guidelines range for Aladin\u2019s conviction. On remand, pursuant to <em>Booker, </em>the district court is required to sentence Aladin under an advisory Guidelines scheme, and, in so doing, must consider the Guidelines range and \"other statutory concerns as well, <em>see </em>[18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp. 2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
