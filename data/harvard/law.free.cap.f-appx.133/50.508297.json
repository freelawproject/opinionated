This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The orders Curry seeks to appeal are neither final orders nor an appealable interlocutory or collateral orders. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and deny Curry\u2019s pending motion to remand. We deny Curry\u2019s motion for oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
