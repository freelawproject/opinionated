After review, we vacate Sanchez\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-24\">Sanchez, traveling with his wife and two minor daughters, arrived at the Miami Airport on a flight from Bogota, Colombia. After the inspectors noted inconsistencies in Sanchez\u2019s and his wife\u2019s statements concerning their visit to the United States, Sanchez admitted to swallowing an unknown number of pellets containing narcotics. An x-ray of Sanchez\u2019s abdominal area revealed the presence of the pellets. Sanchez was taken to the hospital and passed a total of 94 pellets. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration laboratory analysis, the 94 pellets contained a total of 826.8 grams of heroin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>The PSI recommended a base offense level of 30, with a two-level decrease under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6) (specific offense characteristic), a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.4 (using a minor child to commit the offense or to avoid detection or apprehension), and a three-level reduction under \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a) &amp; (b) (acceptance of responsibility). With a criminal history of I, the applicable guideline range was 70-87 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">The defendant objected to the \u00a7 3B1.4 enhancement, arguing that he did not use a minor child to commit the offense or to avoid detection or apprehension, and that the enhancement violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The defendant also objected to the district court\u2019s drug quantity calculation, arguing that, under <em>Blakely, </em>the district court could hold him accountable only for the 100 grams of heroin in the indictment and guilty-plea admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The district court sustained the defendant\u2019s objection to the enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.4, but overruled the defendant\u2019s objection as to the drug quantity calculation. Consequently, the defendant\u2019s adjusted offense level was 25, which rendered a guideline range of 57-71 months\u2019 imprisonment. As noted above, the district court sentenced Sanchez to the low-end of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">On appeal, Sanchez argues that his sentence violates the Sixth Amendment under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court held him accountable for a greater amount of drugs than he either pled guilty to or otherwise admitted. Because Sanchez raised a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court and in his initial brief on appeal, we review his sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948-49 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">In <em>Paz, </em>we explained that harmless-error analysis applies in <em>de novo </em>review eases and puts the burden on the government to show \u201c \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the [sentence] obtained.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 948-49 (quoting <em>United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1307 (11th Cir.2001)). In cases involving <em>Booker </em>error, the government must show that the mandatory, as opposed to the advisory, application of the guidelines did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 948-49; <em>see also United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1300-01 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">We first conclude that Sanchez\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated when the district court enhanced his sentence, under a mandatory Guidelines system, based on facts not found by a jury or admitted by the defendant. The Sixth Amendment violation, however, stems not from the district court\u2019s extra-verdict enhancement (drug amount), but from the district court\u2019s use of that extra-verdict enhancement in sentencing Sanchez in a mandatory Guidelines scheme. <em>See Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">Indeed, there is no error shown as to the district court\u2019s findings or the guideline calculations in this case, and the constitutional error is not the district court\u2019s fact finding as to drug quantity. Rather, the constitutional error is the district court\u2019s use of that drug quantity in a mandatory guideline regime. Further, the government concedes that the constitutional error in this case potentially contributed to Sanchez\u2019s sentence and is, therefore, not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>In addition, we recognize that the district court did impose an alternative sentence of 46 months\u2019 imprisonment. However, the district court imposed the alternative sentence if, under <em>Booker, </em>it was not permitted to determine drug quantity under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard. That is, the district court\u2019s 46-month sentence was based on a drug quantity of 100 grams of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">As noted above, under <em>Booker, </em>the district court is not limited to the 100 grams of heroin Sanchez pled guilty to. Rather, the district court may continue to use its fact-finding regarding the 826.3 grams of heroin, as well as its other previous guideline determinations, when resentencing Sanchez. That is, on remand, the district court is required to sentence Sanchez under an advisory Guidelines regime, and shall consider the guideline range of 57-71 months\u2019 imprisonment, and \u201cother statutory concerns as well, see [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp.2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757; <em>see United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005). Thus, we vacate Sanchez\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing under an advisory Guideline scheme.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-17\">. The DEA did not weigh each of the pellets. Rather, a certain percentage of the pellets were weighed and the total weight was extrapolated from the sample size. On appeal, Sanchez does not contest the validity of the sample size used by the DEA, <em>see United States v. Rivera-Maldonado, </em>194 F.3d 224, 230-32 (1st Cir.1999) (discussing scientifically significant sample size and collecting cases), nor does he allege that the district court\u2019s factual finding regarding drug quantity was not supported by a preponderance of the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>dence. Consequently, we do not address these issues. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>376 F.3d 1282, 1291 (11th Cir.2004) (issues not raised are waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b675-8\">. We do not know exactly what sentence the district court will impose on remand after consulting the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We will not attempt to decide now whether a particular sentence below the Guideline range might be reasonable in this case. If there is an appeal of the actual post-remand sentence which raises that issue, we can decide it then. Furthermore, we do not imply that on remand the district court must impose a lesser sentence, or any particular sentence for that matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
