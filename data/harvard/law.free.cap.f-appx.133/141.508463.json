He argues first that his sentence for violating his supervised release should be vacated because the district court deprived him of his right to allocution. He acknowledges that he was afforded the right of allocution on his illegal reentry sentence, which was imposed during the same hearing as his sentence upon revocation of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-20\">Because Garcia did not raise this issue in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Reyna, </em>358 F.3d 344, 353 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>541 U.S. 1065, 124 S.Ct. 2390, 158 L.Ed.2d 966 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-21\">Garcia\u2019s 18-month sentence represented the bottom of the guideline range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>applicable to the revocation of his supervised release. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 7B1.4(a), 7Bl.l(a)(2). Therefore, prejudice cannot be presumed on that basis alone. <em>See Reyna, </em>358 F.3d at 353. Furthermore, as defense counsel did not argue that Garcia should be sentenced below the 18-month range, and that issue was not in dispute, the question was not before the district court. Garcia was afforded an opportunity, prior to imposition of the sentence for illegal reentry, to address the only argument made in mitigation of his sentence. He responded with a promise not to return to the United States and an assertion that he had returned here to \u201cwork honestly,\u201d an allocution that arguably covered both offenses. Finally, the district court did not \u201creject[ ][an] argument[ ] by the defendant that would have resulted in a lower sentence\u201d as there were no genuinely disputed sentencing issues. <em>See Reyna, </em>358 F.3d at 353. The record does not support a finding of actual or presumed prejudice. Therefore, Garcia cannot show plain error. <em>See id. </em>at 350-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Garcia argues that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) has been undercut by later decisions and should be overruled. This court must follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>unless the Supreme Court overrules it. <em>See United States v. Rivera, </em>265 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2001). As Garcia recognizes, his argument is foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Garcia challenges the validity of his sentence after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Plain error governs this claim because Garcia did not raise it below. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 04-9517 (U.S. Mar. 31, 2005). The Government concedes that the first two prongs of the plain-error analysis are satisfied because the district court sentenced Garcia under the then-mandatory guidelines scheme. However, as in <em>Mares, </em>the record in this case does not indicate whether the sentencing judge might have imposed a lesser sentence had the guidelines been advisory. Thus, Garc\u00eda has not carried his burden of demonstrating that the result \u201cwould have likely been different\u201d under an advisory scheme. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b168-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
