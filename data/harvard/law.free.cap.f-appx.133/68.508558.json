Mendoza-Orellana appeals his conviction, alleging that the district court plainly erred in admitting a Certificate of Nonexistence of Record (\u201cCNR\u201d) allegedly in violation of Mendoza-Orellana\u2019s confrontation clause rights. He also alleges plain error relative to his sentence under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), when the district court enhanced his sentence pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(2)(A) (2003) (three levels), and USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 (two levels). In accordance with our discussion below, we affirm Mendoza-Orellana\u2019s conviction, but vacate his sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-22\">Mendoza-Orellana first challenges the district court\u2019s admission of evidence regarding the immigration status of Claudia Rodriguez-Beron, Cesar Augusto Bau<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>tista-Cornejo, Cesar Humberto Suarez-Salinas, William Fernandez, Fabrieio Froes-Santos, and Joel Salvo DaSilva. Given defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the introduction of this evidence in the district court, we review this issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Mendoza-Orellana specifically challenges the Government\u2019s introduction of a \u201cCNR\u201d (Exhibit 4A), bearing the seal of a United States agency, through Agent Chandler. This CNR reflected that Ms. Rodriguez-Beron held an illegal alien status at the time of MendozaOrellana\u2019s offense. In addition, later in his testimony, Agent Chandler testified that he and another agent interviewed other individuals, and that he determined that the other five individuals transported by Mendoza-Orellana likewise were present illegally in the United States on July 23, 2003. Mendoza-Orellana contends that Exhibit 4A was testimonial hearsay introduced in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, as was Agent Chandler\u2019s testimony as to the status of the other individuals, some of whom he did not personally interview. The underlying basis for Mendoza-Orellana\u2019s objection is <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Here, while the district court did not admit the CNR as a business record, the record was admitted as a self-authenticating public record based upon Fed. R.Evid. 803(10) and 902. As such, we find that it should not be considered testimonial hearsay under <em>Crawford. Id. </em>at 56, 76, 124 S.Ct. 1354; <em>see also United States v. Rueda-Rivera, </em>396 F.3d 678 (5th Cir.2005) (admission of CNR not violative of Confrontation Clause, CNR is official, non-testimonial public record admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, and CNR admission not included in testimonial documents barred by <em>Crawford). </em>Moreover, given the other evidence of Ms. Rodriguez-Beron\u2019s illegal status, we find that Mendoza-Orellana cannot show prejudice in the admission of the record. Finding no plain error in the district court\u2019s admission of the CNR, we affirm Mendoza-Orellana\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Next, Mendoza-Orellana claims error in the district court\u2019s enhancement of his sentence. Specifically, in determining the applicable sentencing range under the sentencing guidelines, the probation officer calculated a base offense level of twelve, and then applied a three level enhancement of Mendoza-Orellana\u2019s base offense level for transporting six or more unlawful aliens, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2Ll.l(b)(2)(A). The district court adopted this enhancement, and then further enhanced Mendoza-Orellana\u2019s sentence by two levels for giving false testimony concerning a material matter, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3C1.1. In full accordance with the law and procedure in effect at the time of sentencing, the district court applied the guidelines as a mandatory determinant in sentencing, and sentenced Mendoza-Orellana based on judicially-determined facts found by a preponderance of the evidence, rather than facts found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Ultimately, the district court sentenced Mendoza-Orellana to twenty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">On appeal, Mendoza-Orellana contends that the application of the enhancements, which increased his range of imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>under the guidelines, constitute plain error under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005), because it was based upon facts not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court applied the <em>Blakely </em>decision to the federal sentencing guidelines and concluded that the Sixth Amendment is violated when a district court imposes a sentence under the sentencing guidelines that is greater than a sentence based solely upon facts found by the jury. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 752-56. The Court remedied the constitutional violation by severing two statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (West Supp.2004) (requiring sentencing court to impose a sentence within the applicable guideline range), and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2004) (setting forth appellate standards of review for guideline issues), thereby making the guidelines advisory. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546 (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court)).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under. the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a), and impose a sentence. If a court imposes a sentence outside the guideline range, the district court must state its reasons for doing so. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. This remedial scheme applies to any sentence imposed under the mandatory sentencing guidelines, regardless of whether or not the sentence violates the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 547 (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court)).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">In this case, as in <em>Hughes, </em>the district court sentenced Mendoza-Orellana by applying the guidelines as a mandatory determinant in sentencing and based upon facts not authorized by the jury\u2019s findings. In light of the change in the law, we conclude that the district court erred in determining Mendoza-Orellana\u2019s sentence, that the error was plain and affected Mendoza-Orellana\u2019s substantial rights, and that we should exercise our discretion to notice the error. We therefore vacate Mendoza-Orellana\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">Accordingly, although we affirm Mendoza-Orellana\u2019s conviction, we vacate his sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker </em>and <em>Hughes. </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-5\">. Mendoza-Orellana\u2019s challenge to Agent Chandler's testimony as to the immigration status of the other individuals is a sentencing issue that relates to the three-level enhancement by the district court of Mendoza-Orellana\u2019s base offense level pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2L1.1(b)(2)(A), and is addressed in our discussion regarding his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\">. Although the sentencing guidelines <em>are no </em>longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \"consult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be 'within the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 547.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
