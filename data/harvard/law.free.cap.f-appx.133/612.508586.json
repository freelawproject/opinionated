After review, we affirm Crawford\u2019s convictions, but vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">This case is about an armed robbery at a Hardee\u2019s restaurant that was planned and executed by employees of that restaurant. A federal grand jury returned an indictment against defendants Crawford, Willie Watson, and Janita Jones, all of whom worked at Hardee\u2019s. Crawford was implicated in only two counts. Count One charged all defendants with aiding and abetting each other in the interference with commerce by threats or violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. Count Two charged that all defendants, aided and abetted by each other, during and in relation to the robbery, did knowingly use, carry, and possess a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Co-defendants Watson and Jones pled guilty and testified against Crawford at trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Other Hardee\u2019s employees also testified against Crawford. After a three-day trial, the jury found Crawford guilty of both counts. Because Crawford challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions, we recount some of the trial evidence here.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">A. Trial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">1. Nathan Wilson\u2019s testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b640-11\">At trial, Nathan Wilson, a Hardee\u2019s employee, testified that about five minutes before the store closing, a man whom Wilson did not recognize entered the store wearing a disguise. The man walked up to Wilson\u2019s cash register, pulled out a gun, threw a bag over the counter, and told Wilson to put all of the money in the bag.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Crawford, the Hardee\u2019s manager on duty, came around the corner and looked shocked. The robber then pointed the gun at Crawford, demanding money. Crawford opened the cash register and put the money in the bag. Based on the robber\u2019s demands, Crawford also opened the store safe and Crawford and Wilson put the money from the safe into the robber\u2019s bag. After the robber received the money, he ran out of the store. Crawford then called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">2. Co-defendant Watson\u2019s testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">Co-defendant Watson, another Hardee\u2019s employee, testified that he and Crawford socialized outside of work. About two weeks before the robbery, Crawford approached Watson and suggested that the two of them rob the Hardee\u2019s. Crawford told Watson that he wanted the robbery to look real, and that Watson should use a firearm during the actual commission of the robbery. The day before the robbery, Crawford provided Watson with a firearm to use during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Watson testified that the day of the robbery, Watson arrived at the Hardee\u2019s and waited at the dumpster behind the restaurant until Crawford gave him the signal to enter the restaurant and rob it.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Several hours after the robbery, Watson and Crawford discussed the robbery over the telephone. During the conversation, Crawford told Watson that he had already taken his share of the robbery proceeds before Watson entered the store. Crawford then told him that Crawford had given co-defendant Jones, another Hardee\u2019s employee, money to keep the robbery quiet. The day after the robbery, Crawford gave Watson a ride home from work in order to pick up the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Watson testified that he initially denied involvement in the robbery when interviewed by law enforcement ofScers. Later in the interview, however, he admitted that he and Crawford committed the robbery. Nonetheless, Watson falsely stated to officers that Crawford had threatened him and that he had given Crawford $600 of the robbery proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">On cross-examination, Crawford\u2019s attorney questioned Watson about his marijuana use at the restaurant and Crawford\u2019s knowledge of Watson\u2019s marijuana use at the restaurant. Watson testified that Crawford smoked marijuana and allowed Watson to smoke at work as long as it was not around the customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">While Watson was testifying about conversations he had with Crawford after the robbery, Watson remarked that Crawford stopped taking his calls \u201cthe day after [Crawford] refused to take [a] lie detector test.\u201d During an off-the-record colloquy with counsel, Crawford\u2019s attorney moved for a mistrial, which the district court agreed to consider during the next recess. Immediately after the colloquy, the district court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-9\">Members of the jury, that response was unresponsive and was not prompted by the question as I view it, and you should totally disregard that statement. It hasn\u2019t got anything to do with any of the issues in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">At the next recess, Crawford\u2019s attorney moved again for a mistrial, which the district court denied by implication. The district court and counsel discussed possible curative instructions. Crawford\u2019s attorney, however, informed the district court that Crawford did not seek a curative instruction because it was \u201ctoo late\u201d and he did not want to overemphasize the remark about the lie detector test.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">On cross-examination, Watson also testified about his agreement with the government. Watson stated that the government agreed that if Watson cooperated and testified truthfully against Crawford, the government would recommend to the state court that Watson receive a two-year sentence reduction. Further, because Watson had pled guilty to the state court charges, the government dismissed the federal charges against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">3. Co-defendant Jones\u2019s testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">Co-defendant Jones, another Hardee\u2019s employee, testified that a few days before the robbery, Crawford told her that he and Watson were planning to rob the restaurant the following Sunday. Crawford told Jones that Watson was planning to rob the store with an unloaded gun and that she was going to receive some money from the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">Jones worked the day of the robbery, and during the afternoon of the robbery, Crawford went to the store safe several times. At one point, Crawford left the restaurant in his car for approximately 35 to 40 minutes. Upon his return, Crawford gave Jones between $500 and $600 and told her: \u201cThis is yours. Here you go.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Jones stated that when Watson came in to rob the restaurant, she hid in the back room until the robbery was over.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Jones did not immediately confess to law enforcement officers that she knew about the robbery because she was afraid of going to jail. Jones eventually told officers everything she knew about the robbery because she \u201cfelt like [she] needed to do the right thing.\u201d After her indictment, Jones cooperated with the government. Jones testified that her agreement with the government did not require that she testify at Crawford\u2019s trial, and that she was testifying \u201cto make things right with [her]self.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">4. Brandon Davis\u2019s testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Brandon Davis, a Hardee\u2019s employee, testified that approximately one month before the robbery, Crawford approached him at work and suggested that they carry out a robbery, although Crawford did not state where or when. Davis declined. Davis also testified that he smoked marijuana with other employees while working at Hardee\u2019s, and that Crawford knew about it and smoked with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">5. Other testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">Janan Chandler, a senior security compliance analyst for Metro PCS, testified about several phone calls between Crawford and Watson based on cell phone records. Further, Paul Christensen, a district manager for the corporate franchisee of the Hardee\u2019s location, testified that Wilson looked \u201cquite upset\u201d and was \u201cshaking very badly\u201d after the robbery, but that Crawford looked \u201cquite calm\u201d after the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">At the end of all the testimony, the district court instructed the jury regarding the credibility of cooperating witnesses. In doing so, the district court stated that the jury should \u201cconsider[ ] with more caution\u201d the testimony of those witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">B. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">The PSI set Crawford\u2019s base offense level for Count One at 20. The PSI also recommended six other enhancements, including: (1) a two-level role increase pursuant to \u00a7 3Bl.l(e); (2) a two-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) because a threat of death was made; (3) a two-level increase pursuant to \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(4)(B) because a victim was restrained; and (4) a two-level increase for obstruction of justice. With a total offense level of 28 and a criminal history category of I, Crawford\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines range was 78-97 months\u2019 imprisonment, plus an 84-month, consecutive sentence for Count Two, the firearm count.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">Crawford objected to all enhancements in the PSI, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support them. Prior to sentencing, Crawford filed a sentencing memorandum arguing that under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the enhancements could not be applied because they were not proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-14\">At sentencing, Crawford also argued that based on <em>Blakely </em>his conviction on Count Two should carry a mandatory-minimum sentence of five years, not seven, because the indictment charged that he \u201cused, carried, and possessed a firearm\u201d and the jury did not find that he \u201cbrandished the firearm.\u201d The district court denied the motion to apply <em>Blakely </em>because it was \u201cpresently operating under the theory that <em>Blakely </em>does not set aside the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-15\">Ultimately, the district court sustained all of Crawford\u2019s objections to the enhancements, except for the \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>hancement for his role in the offense. The district court found that Crawford clearly was the person who devised the scheme, organized it, and recruited those who participated with him. The base offense level of 20, plus the two-level role enhancement, resulted in a total adjusted offense level of 22, which reduced Crawford\u2019s Guidelines range from 78-97 months\u2019 imprisonment to 41-51 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The district court sentenced Crawford to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count One, and 84 months\u2019 imprisonment on Count Two, to ran consecutively. The 84-month consecutive sentence represented the seven-year, statutory mandatory minimum under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii). The district court specifically stated that, because Crawford came to the \u201ccourt with no criminal record whatsoever and because of everything that has been said on his behalf by family members and friends, the court will impose the low end of [the Guideline range].\u201d The district court also stated that \u201c[i]t is the court\u2019s view, all things considered, based on the applicable guidelines, that a sentence at the low end of the guideline range for Count One, coupled of course with the mandatory penalty for Count Two meets the sentencing goals of punishment and deterrence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Apc\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">On appeal, Crawford argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his convictions because the credibility of two of the government\u2019s witnesses\u2014Jones and Watson\u2014was so questionable as to be unreliable as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree that their testimony was unreliable as a matter of law. Rather, their credibility was an issue for the jury to decide. Indeed, both Watson and Jones were extensively questioned on direct and cross-examination regarding their self-interest, including their plea bargains. Further, each witness\u2019s initial denials and false statements to law enforcement officers were thoroughly explored on both direct and cross-examination. The district court also instructed the jury regarding the credibility of cooperating witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">In addition, if the jury believed Watson, Jones, and the government\u2019s other witnesses, there was more than ample testimony to support Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 1951 conviction. \u201cTwo elements are essential for a Hobbs Act [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951] prosecution: robbery and an effect on commerce.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>218 F.3d 1243, 1244 (11th Cir.2000). At trial, the interstate-commerce requirement was undisputed. As to Crawford\u2019s role in the robbery, both Jones and Watson testified that Crawford was involved in the planning and execution of the robbery. Additionally, Davis testified that Crawford approached him at work and suggested that they carry out a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-11\">There also was sufficient evidence to support Crawford\u2019s firearms conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). To prove an aiding and abetting charge under \u00a7 924(c), \u201c \u2018the government must demonstrate that a substantive offense was committed, that the defendant associated himself with the criminal venture, and that he committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>some act which furthered the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>987 F.2d 697, 701-02 (11th Cir.1993) (quoting <em>United States v. Hamblin, </em>911 F.2d 551, 557 (11th Cir.1990)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Additionally, the conviction \u201cmust be supported by evidence directly showing [defendant\u2019s] knowledge that a gun would be used in the commission of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">In this case, while Crawford himself did not use the firearm, Watson admitted to using a firearm during the robbery, and testified that Crawford provided the firearm to Watson to use during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support Crawford\u2019s two convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">B. Denial of Motion for Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Crawford\u2019s motion for a mistrial because the district court timely gave a curative instruction directing the jury to disregard Watson\u2019s statement about the lie detector test as unresponsive and irrelevant to any issues in the case. <em>See United States v. Russo, </em>796 F.2d 1443, 1453 (11th Cir.1986) (concluding that any prejudice resulting from reference to polygraph was cured by district court\u2019s cautionary instruction); <em>see also United States v. Walton, </em>908 F.2d 1289, 1293 (6th Cir.1990) (\u201cEven the circuits which have held that polygraph evidence is generally inadmissible have allowed an inadvertent statement concerning the evidence to be remedied by a curative instruction.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">In light of the district court\u2019s curative instruction and the ample evidence in this case, Crawford has not shown that \u201cthe evidence is so highly prejudicial as to be incurable by the trial court\u2019s admonition.\u201d <em>United States v. Harriston, </em>329 F.3d 779, 787 n. 4 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Shenberg, </em>89 F.3d 1461, 1472 (11th Cir.1996) (noting that this Court presumes that the jury follows the district court\u2019s instructions). Because the district court\u2019s immediate curative instruction was sufficient to mitigate any prejudice that might have resulted from Watson\u2019s inadvertent remark regarding the lie detector test, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Crawford\u2019s motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">C. Evidence of Marijuana Use</p>\n<p id=\"b644-14\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion by allowing the government to examine Davis regarding Crawford\u2019s alleged use of marijuana at work.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defense counsel for Crawford first injected the marijuana use by cross-examining Watson about Watson\u2019s marijuana use at work and Crawford\u2019s knowledge of it. During Watson\u2019s testimony, Watson testified that Crawford knew that Watson used marijuana at work and also that Crawford himself smoked at work. Davis\u2019s testimony about the marijuana use at the restaurant, specifically Crawford\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>marijuana use, corroborated Watson\u2019s testimony, which Crawford\u2019s counsel elicited.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In any event, we conclude that any error was harmless and does not require reversal. \u201cWe find an error harmless where \u2018the purported error had no substantial influence on the outcome and sufficient evidence uninfected by error supports the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d 1036, 1048 (11th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. Fortenberry, </em>971 F.2d 717, 722 (11th Cir.1992)). As discussed above, there was ample evidence uninfected by the error to support the verdict. <em>See Dickerson, </em>248 F.3d at 1048; <em>Fortenberry, </em>971 F.2d at 722. In light of the evidence of Crawford\u2019s guilt, we conclude that the district court\u2019s admission of this evidence had no substantial impact on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">D. Sentencing Issue as to Count One</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Crawford also argues that his sentence violates <em>Blakely </em>because the district court applied a two-level enhancement for his role in the offense based upon impermissible judicial fact-finding. Because Crawford raised his <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court and in his initial brief on appeal, we review his sentence <em>de novo. United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948-49 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">In <em>Booker, </em>a majority of the Supreme Court concluded that the mandatory nature of the Guidelines made them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guaranty of the right to a jury trial where \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict [was not] admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. There was sufficient trial evidence to support the district court\u2019s fact-finding as to this role enhancement, and the district court correctly determined the proper Guidelines range for Crawford\u2019s conviction on Count One is 41-51 months\u2019 imprisonment. Nonetheless, Crawford\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated because Crawford\u2019s sentence was enhanced, under a mandatory Guidelines system, based on facts not found by a jury or admitted by Crawford. The Sixth Amendment violation stemmed not from the district court\u2019s extra-verdict enhancement, but from the district court\u2019s use of that extra-verdict enhancement in sentencing Crawford in a mandatory Guidelines scheme. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">After reviewing the record, we further conclude that the government has failed to meet its burden to show that the constitutional error as to the sentence in Count One was harmless. <em>See Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948-49.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, we vacate Crawford\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. On remand, the district court is required to sentence Crawford under an advisory Guidelines regime, and shall consider the Guidelines range of 41-51 months\u2019 imprisonment for Count One, and \u201cother statutory concerns as well, see [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp.2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">E. Sentencing Issue as to Count Two</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">Crawford also maintains that his mandatory minimum sentence on Count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Two violates <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>because the judge, not a jury, determined that his co-defendant Watson \u201cbrandished\u201d the firearm during the robbery. We first note that the trial evidence showed that co-defendant Watson pointed the firearm at Wilson during the robbery, and thus the district court\u2019s fact-finding that Watson brandished the firearm is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The more serious hurdle Crawford faces on appeal is that this 84-month sentence on Count Two is caused by a judicial fact-finding related to the statutory mandatory <em>minimum </em>set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(l)(A)(ii), which the United States Supreme Court has expressly held does not violate the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. <em>Harris v. United States, </em>536 U.S. 545, 568-69, 122 S.Ct. 2406, 2420, 153 L.Ed.2d 524 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">In <em>Harris, </em>the Supreme Court determined that whether or not a firearm was brandished for the purposes of the statutory mandatory <em>minimum </em>in \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) is a sentencing factor to be determined by the judge, and is not an element of the offense that must be charged in the indictment, submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Harris, </em>536 U.S. at 556, 122 S.Ct. at 2414. Specifically, the Supreme Court stated that \u201c[biasing a 2-year increase in the defendant\u2019s <em>minimum </em>sentence on a judicial finding of brandishing does not evade the requirements of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>536 U.S. at 568, 122 S.Ct. at 2420 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Because <em>Harris </em>is directly on point as to a judicial fact-finding about brandishing that triggers the statutory mandatory <em>minimum </em>sentence in \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii), it controls as to whether the Fifth or Sixth Amendment is violated by a judge, rather than a jury, determining whether a gun was brandished for the purposes of \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">We recognize that the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Harris </em>decision came after <em>Apprendi,</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but before <em>Booker. </em>However, <em>Booker </em>did not addresses mandatory <em>minimum </em>sentences or <em>Harris </em>and,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> at least at this juncture, we remain bound to apply <em>Harris. See United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 961-62 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe have held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains the law until the Supreme Court determines that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not controlling precedent.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">Additionally, two other circuits post-<em>Booker </em>have cited <em>Harris </em>and noted that pursuant to <em>Harris, </em>judicial fact-finding under \u00a7 924(e)(l)(A)(ii) is not error. <em>See United States v. Groce, </em>398 F.3d 679, 682 n. 2 (4th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Harris </em>and stating that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s application of the seven-year mandatory minimum sentence based on judicial fact finding thus did not result in a sentence above the otherwise-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>applicable statutory maximum and was not error\u201d); <em>United States v. Harris, </em>397 F.3d 404, 414 n. 5 (6th Cir.2005) (noting that \u201cin light of <em>Harris, </em>\u201d the mandatory minimum sentence related to brandishing \u201ccontinu\u00e9is] to bind sentencing judges\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Thus, being bound by <em>Harris, </em>we are required to conclude that there is no Fifth or Sixth Amendment violation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">This does not end our analysis because Crawford was sentenced under a mandatory Guidelines system and thus we must determine whether there is statutory <em>Booker </em>error in Count Two. Section 2K2.4 of the Guidelines provides that \u201cthe guideline sentence [for a \u00a7 924(c) violation] is the minimum term of imprisonment required by statute.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4(b). Thus, as to this \u00a7 924(c) offense, there was no Guidelines range binding the district court to create statutory <em>Booker </em>error. Rather, the statutory mandatory minimum sentence in \u00a7 924(c) governs Crawford\u2019s sentence on Count Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">However, even if this Court assumes <em>arguendo </em>that some statutory error exists under <em>Booker </em>because Crawford was sentenced under a mandatory guideline system that required the district court to apply \u00a7 2K2.4, any error is corrected by the fact that we are already remanding this case for re-sentencing under an advisory Guidelines scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Upon review'of the record, we find no reversible error as to Crawford\u2019s convictions. Thus, we affirm Crawford\u2019s convictions. Upon review of the record, we do find reversible error as to Crawford\u2019s sentence. Thus, we vacate Crawford\u2019s sentence in its entirety and remand for resentencing pursuant to <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-7\">.
