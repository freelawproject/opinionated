Because Harris has failed to establish error with respect to the January 5, 2005, order, we affirm. To the extent Harris desires to have this court review the August 31, 2005, order dismissing his complaint, we are without jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely as to that order. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4,</p>\n<p id=\"b932-23\">Accordingly, we affirm. We deny Harris\u2019 motion seeking a transfer to another prison. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
