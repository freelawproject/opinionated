He argues for the first time on appeal that, in light of <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number><em>Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his sentence should be vacated and his case remanded for resentencing because the district court plainly erred by enhancing his sentence based on facts not determined by a jury and which he did not admit. He also argues for the first time on appeal that his sentence should be vacated because the district court plainly erred by treating the guidelines as mandatory. Finally, Takajasi-Maldonado claims that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">Takajasi-Maldonado\u2019s claim that the district court plainly erred by enhancing his sentence based on facts not determined by a jury and which he did not admit is unavailing because he failed to show that \u201cthe sentencing judge\u2014sentencing under an advisory scheme rather then a mandatory one\u2014would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-522 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 04-9517 (U.S. Mar. 31, 2005). His argument that the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines as mandatory was plain error also fails because he did not show that the district court would have imposed a different sentence had the guidelines been advisory only. <em>See United States v. Valenzuelar-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733-34 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Takajasi-Maldonado\u2019s argument that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998).
