Citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), Griffin contends only that his Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was violated because the district court enhanced his sentence under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(C) and (b)(4) (2003), based upon findings by a preponderance of the evidence that thirty-four stolen firearms were involved in the offense. We affirm. In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Supreme Court held that \"the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentencing enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 746, 750 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). The Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty ... must be admitted by the defendant....\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). Our review of the record in this case convinces us that no Sixth Amendment violation occurred because, at the plea hearing, Griffin admitted the facts supporting the enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">Accordingly, we affirm Griffin\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b109-12\"> We decline to review the issue of whether the district court erred in sentencing Griffin under a mandatory guidelines regime, see <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756-67 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court), because he did not raise that issue on appeal. <em>See United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 216 n. 5 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
