Turner appeals his 188-month sentence, pursuant to his guilty plea, for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e). Turner was sentenced as an armed career criminal, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4, based on the district court\u2019s determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>that Turner had three prior violent felony convictions. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), Turner argues that the \u00a7 4B1.4 armed career criminal enhancement violated his constitutional rights to an indictment and to a jury determination beyond a reasonable doubt that he had been convicted of three prior qualifying felonies. Turner contends the district court thus made an improper fact finding that Turner\u2019s pri- or convictions satisfied the definition of a \u201cviolent felony\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). He also maintains that a mere reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e), in the indictment and at the guilty plea hearing, was not sufficient to evidence an intelligent waiver of his right to have a jury determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether his prior convictions qualified under \u00a7 4B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a preserved constitutional challenge to a defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Miles, </em>290 F.3d 1341, 1348 (11th Cir.2002). And we reject Turner\u2019s argument that a district court errs when it uses prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court opined \u201cthat the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had pri- or convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 637, 160 L.Ed.2d 480 (2004). In the light of <em>Blakely, </em>Turner suggests that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>no longer is good law. But recently we have written that the conclusion in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cwas left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi [v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000)], <em>Blakely, </em>or <em>[United States v.J Booker, </em>[\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)].\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see United States v. Guadamuz-Solis, </em>232 F.3d 1363, 1363 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(\u201cAlmendarez-Torres </em>remains the law until the Supreme Court determines that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is not controlling precedent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">And in <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court reaffirmed its decision in <em>Apprendi: </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact <em>(other than a prior </em>conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the district court did not err \u201cby relying on prior convictions to enhance [Turner]\u2019s sentence.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
