Jennings specifically attacks her conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860 for aiding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>and abetting the distribution of crack cocaine within 100 feet of a youth center. She argues that the evidence was insufficient to show that the TEEN F.L.O.W. Youth Center was a \u201cyouth center\u201d as defined by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860(e)(2). She does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence with respect to any other essential element of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Section 860(e)(2) defines youth center as \u201ca recreational facility and/or gymnasium (including any parking lot appurtenant thereto), intended primarily for use by persons under 18 years of age, which regularly provides athletic, civic, or cultural activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Our review of the record satisfies us that sufficient evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict. There was uncontroverted and unchallenged testimony that the TEEN F.L.O.W. Youth Center was a \u201cyouth center\u201d where children played basketball.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, as we must, <em>see United States v. Villarreal, </em>324 F.3d 319, 322 (5th Cir.2003), we conclude that the evidence was sufficient. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b178-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
