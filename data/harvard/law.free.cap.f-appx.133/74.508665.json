Brown, Jr., seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition as untimely.

R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The district court\u2019s judgment was entered on the docket on October 6, 2004. According Brown the benefit of Fed. RApp. P. 4(c), the notice of appeal was filed on December 10, 2004. Because Brown failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
