Yonkeu challenges the finding that he failed to meet his burden of proof to qualify for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the record and conclude Yonkeu fails to show the evidence compels a contrary result.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-21\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b98-18\"> Yonkeu does not challenge the denial of withholding from removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture. In any event, having failed to qualify for asylum, Yonkeu cannot meet the higher standard to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987); <em>Chen </em>v. <em>INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). Nor did he show it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if removed to Cameroon. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
