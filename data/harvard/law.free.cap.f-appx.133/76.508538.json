We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-23\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-24\">The district court\u2019s judgment was entered on the docket on November 30, 2004. The notice of appeal was filed on January 7, 2005.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because Graham failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we dismiss the appeal. We deny Gra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>ham\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel, to strike the disclosure statement, and for a transfer. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-16\">. For the purpose of this appeal, we assume that the date of the prison stamp on the envelope enclosing the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison authorities for mailing to the court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b102-25\">. The district court improperly construed Graham\u2019s bare notice of appeal as a motion for extension of time. <em>See Wilder v. Chairman, Cent. Classification Bd., </em>926 F.2d 367, 371 (4th Cir.1991). However, because Graham failed to respond to the district court\u2019s request for supplemental information sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>porting an extension of time, this error was harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
