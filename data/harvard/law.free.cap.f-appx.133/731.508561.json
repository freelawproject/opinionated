Smith argues on appeal that the district court committed reversible error when it refused to apply a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 SE1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b758-11\">A grand jury returned a three-count indictment against Smith, charging him with: (i) conspiracy to possess five or more kilogram of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2005); (ii) possession of fifty kilograms or less of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(d) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; and possession and utterance of counterfeit currency with intent to defraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 472. After Smith pled not guilty, his attorney repeatedly told the jury that Smith had accepted responsibility for his involvement in the marijuana, but had no involvement in the conduct charged in the other counts. The jury returned a verdict finding Smith guilty of the marijuana count, and not guilty of the cocaine and counterfeiting counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-15\">At sentencing, Smith objected to the pre-sentence investigation (PSI) report\u2019s recommendation that he be denied a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. The district court denied the downward adjustment, finding that Smith had not made an unequivocal demonstration of his acceptance of responsibility for the marijuana offense. Specifically, the district court found that statements Smith\u2019s counsel made at trial concerning the marijuana offense reflected only a tactical decision designed to boost Smith\u2019s credibility, which neither amounted to a clear-cut admission of guilt nor relieved the government of the expense of proving Smith\u2019s culpability on the marijuana count. The district court also found that Smith\u2019s initial offer to plead guilty to the marijuana charge in exchange for the government\u2019s agreement to drop the remaining charges, properly construed, was a negotiation tactic rather than a clear acceptance of responsibility. Without the downward adjustment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the guidelines range stood at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>one to seven months, and the district court sentenced Smith to six months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we review sentences for unreasonableness, guided by the sentencing factors found at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). This standard permits review for reasonableness not only of the ultimate length of the sentence, but also of legal errors in the method of the sentence\u2019s selection. <em>See United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 114-115 (2d Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Webb, </em>403 F.3d 373, 383-84 (6th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Though <em>Booker </em>excised the statutory provisions which made the sentencing guidelines mandatory and dictated de novo review of sentences on appeal, <em>Booker </em>left all other aspects of the sentencing guidelines in place. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 and n. 9 (11th Cir.2005). Those guidelines state that a reduction for acceptance of responsibility is appropriate where the defendant \u201cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his [or her] offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. The commentary to \u00a7 3E1.1 explains that because the sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate the defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, his or her determination is entitled to deference on appeal. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">In this case, the district court found that Smith\u2019s pre-trial offer to plead guilty to the marijuana count in exchange for the government\u2019s agreement to drop the remaining counts was merely a negotiation tactic, not an admission of guilt, where Smith in fact never pled guilty. Similarly, the district court found that statements which Smith\u2019s counsel made at trial concerning Smith\u2019s involvement in marijuana only reflected trial strategy and did not relieve the government of its burden of proof. The district court viewed these facts as insufficient to show the requisite clear demonstration of acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that either the district court\u2019s reasoning or its ultimate decision to deny a \u00a7 3E1.1 adjustment was unreasonable, and we affirm Smith\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-12\">. Separately, Smith objected to the PSI\u2019s recommendation of a firearms enhancement on the basis of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), arguing that any facts relating to a firearm had not been tried before the jury or admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>by Smith. The district court sustained this objection and did not impose a firearm enhancement. Smith has raised no Booker-related challenge to the district court\u2019s sentence on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
