Navas-Ralda contends that he received an eight-level enhancement for being previously deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony, and the enhancement violated the Fifth Amendment because it was not alleged in the criminal information. Navas-Ralda also contends, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738,160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that the district court erred when it sentenced Navas-Ralda under the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory. We conclude that the district court did not violate Fifth Amendment, but we agree with Navas-Ralda that the district court erred when it sentenced Navas-Ralda under the Guidelines as mandatory. Because the latter sentencing error was not harmless, we vacate Navas-Ralda\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-15\">As to Navas-Ralda\u2019s argument regarding the Fifth Amendment, the Supreme Court, in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), held that \u201cthe government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had pri- or convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence. This conclusion was left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker.\u201d United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). Because \u201ca district court does not err by relying on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence,\u201d Navas-Ralda\u2019s Fifth Amendment argument fails. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-16\">As to Navas-Ralda\u2019s <em>Booker </em>argument, the district court erred when it sentenced Navas-Ralda under the Guidelines as mandatory. As we held in <em>Shelton, </em>a <em>Booker </em>error occurs when a district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330-31. Navas-Ralda preserved a <em>Blakely/Booker </em>objection in the district court, so the government bears the burden to prove the error was harmless. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). A non-constitutional error \u201cis harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the [sentence], \u2018or had but very slight effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Hornaday, </em>392 F.3d 1306, 1315 (11th Cir.2004) (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 762, 763, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 1246, 1248, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946)). If we cannot \u201csay \u2018with fair assurance ... that the [sentence] was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>substantially swayed by the error/\u201d the sentence must be vacated. <em>See id. </em>at 1815-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The government cannot meet its burden. The error committed was not harmless. To the contrary, the sentencing transcript suggests that Navas-Ralda\u2019s sentence would have been shorter had the district court treated the guidelines as advisory. Based on that transcript, we cannot say \u201cwith fair assurance that [Navas-Ralda\u2019s sentence] was not substantially swayed by the error\u201d of treating the Guidelines as mandatory. <em>See id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">The district court gave an alternate sentence of six months\u2019 imprisonment without the enhancement for Navas-Ralda\u2019s previous conviction. The district court explained that the 15-month enhanced sentence imposed was consistent with our then-binding interpretation of <em>Blakely, </em>but the court also explained that \u201cif the Supreme Court of the United States in interpreting <em>Blakely </em>goes a different direction, then the lesser sentence is in the alternative. I think that\u2019s the way it ought to be and I agree with that.\u201d The district court further stated that it was \u201cpronouncing a primary sentence of 15 months, credit for time served, consistent with the guidelines. In the alternative, if the guidelines are determined to be inapplicable here, the sentence would be six months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Although the record evidences that the district court would have entered a less severe punishment had the Guidelines not been mandatory, it is unclear whether the alternative sentence of the district court would have been its choice under an advisory guideline system. The district court entered the alternative sentence based on the premise that the Guidelines were inapplicable, but Navas-Ralda should have been sentenced under the advisory guidelines system. On remand, the district court, \u201c \u2018while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1176 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at-, 125 S.Ct. at 767).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
