Oddo obliged. He also redirected those trying to visit Endata Corporation\u2019s website to a pornographic website. About a year later, the FBI searched Oddo\u2019s home. While the search progressed upstairs, FBI Agents Andrew J. Hayden and Sue Ellen Clark questioned Oddo\u2019s wife and then Oddo in the furnished portion of basement. Oddo confessed to deleting Endata\u2019s website and redirecting its visitors to the pornographic website.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-20\">Oddo was indicted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 for conspiring to damage a protected computer in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030(a)(5)(A)\u00ae. He moved to suppress his incriminating statements. The district court held a hearing on the motion at which Oddo, his wife, Agent Hayden, and Agent Clark testified. The district court denied Oddo\u2019s motion to suppress and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>motion to reconsider. The case went to trial and the jury was told about Oddo\u2019s incriminating statements. Further, Oddo took the stand and admitted to deleting Endata\u2019s website, which he considered to be Dillon\u2019s property because Endata had not paid her for her work on the website. Oddo was convicted. (Dillon had already pleaded guilty.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">In April 2004, the district court used the November 2008 guidelines manual to sentence Oddo to 17 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court\u2019s sentencing calculation was partially based on the court\u2019s determination of the amount of loss ($30,077) and its decision that Oddo used a special skill (his computer expertise) in committing his crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">On appeal, Oddo contends that he was in custody at the time he made the incriminating statements to the FBI and thus the statements should have been suppressed because he was not read his <em>Miranda </em>rights. He also contends that his base offense level should not have been increased based on judge-determined facts in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , and that the district court used the wrong sentencing guidelines manual in violation of the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause. After Oddo filed this appeal, the Supreme Court decided <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 746, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) , which clarified that the Sixth Amendment rule discussed in <em>Blakely </em>applies to the federal sentencing guidelines. Accordingly, we treat Oddo\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>challenge as a <em>Booker </em>challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">We will affirm Oddo\u2019s conviction and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Oddo contends that the district court erred in ruling that he was not in custody when he made incriminating statements to the FBI. Oddo relates his version of the interrogation, and maintains that agents surrounded his home, instructed him to remain on the couch, forbade him from using the telephone, observed him even when he went to the bathroom, situated themselves between him and the exit, and questioned him for nearly an hour. He also contends that a \u201cvery large, intimidating agent guarded him the entire time.\u201d In light of these circumstances, he argues, a reasonable person would have felt as though he was not free to leave. Oddo asserts, therefore, that he was \u201cin custody\u201d and interrogated without being apprised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and as a result, the statements he made to the agents should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-12\">\u2018Whether a person was in custody and entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings is a mixed question of law and fact; we review the district court\u2019s factual findings on the matter for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>United States v. McDowell, </em>250 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cCredibility determinations are typically the province of the fact finder because the fact finder personally observes the testimony and is thus in a better position than a reviewing court to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">In <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478-79, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), the Supreme Court held that, to comport with the Fifth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against compelled self-incrimination, a person taken into custody must be advised of his right to remain silent and his right to counsel prior to an interrogation. The Court defined \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d as \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>significant way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In determining whether Oddo was subject to a custodial interrogation, we look to \u201cwhether \u2018under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable man in [his] position would feel a restraint on his freedom of movement ... to such extent that he would not feel free to leave.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDowell, </em>250 F.3d at 1362 (quoting <em>United States v. Moya, </em>74 F.3d 1117, 1119 (11th Cir.1996)) (alternations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Here Oddo was not subjected to custodial interrogation as defined by <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny because he was not subjected to \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after [he was] taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612. Agents Hayden and Clark testified at the suppression hearing that Oddo was never handcuffed or physically secured, that he never asked to speak to an attorney, that he was not forced to accompany them to the basement or prohibited from returning upstairs, that the encounter was non-eonfrontational, and that they told Oddo that he was not required to speak with them or answer any of their questions. The district court credited the testimony of Agents Hayden and Clark over the contrary testimony of Oddo. In light of the agents\u2019 testimony, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Oddo was not \u201cin custody,\u201d and that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required. We will affirm Oddo\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Oddo\u2019s remaining two arguments challenge his sentence. He contends that the district court committed plain error by using the guidelines manual in effect at the time of sentencing instead of the manual in effect at the time of his crime, and that this error resulted in an increased sentence in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. He also contends that the district court committed plain error in violating his <em>Booker </em>rights by increasing his sentence on the basis of the amount of the loss ($30,077) and his use of special skill (his computer skills), facts which he did not admit and which were not found by a jury. Because we conclude that Oddo is entitled to resentencing based on his first argument, and because that resentencing will be conducted in accordance with the rule in <em>Booker, </em>we need not\u2014and do not\u2014 reach Oddo\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">Oddo did not object at sentencing to the court\u2019s use of the 2003 manual, and so this Court reviews only for plain error. To prevail under this standard, Oddo must show that there was an error, that the error is plain, that the error affected his substantial rights, and that the error seriously affects the fairness and integrity of the judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">In sentencing Oddo using the November 2003 guidelines manual, the district court began with a base offense level of 6 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Bl.l(a)(2) and 2Xl.l(a). The court increased that level by 6 steps based on the amount of loss, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(D), and by 2 more levels because Oddo used a special skill in the commission of the offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. That yielded a total offense level of 14. When applied to a criminal history category of I, the resulting guidelines range was 15-21 months. The court sentenced Oddo to 17 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">Under the November 2000 guidelines, which were in effect at the time that Oddo committed his crime in July 2001, the result would have been different. The district court would have started with a base <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>offense level of 4 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl(a). To that, the court would have added 6 levels for the amount of loss, U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2B1.3(b)(l) and 2Bl.l(b)(l)(G), and 2 more levels for use of a special skill, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. The result would be a total offense level of 12, which when combined with a criminal history of I, yields a guidelines range of 10-16 months. Hence, Oddo\u2019s 17 month sentence is in excess of the sentence which could have been imposed under the mandatory 2000 sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">With respect to the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause and the sentencing guidelines, we have explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">The Constitution\u2019s Ex Post Facto Clause ... prevents the Government from imposing additional penalties for crimes that have already been committed. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, art. I. \u00a7 9, cl. 3 (\u201cNo ... ex post facto Law shall be passed.\u201d); <em>Colder v. Bull, </em>3 U.S. (3 Dali.) 386, 390, 1 L.Ed. 648 (1798) (holding that \u201c[ejvery law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed\u201d is an \u201cex post facto law[], within the words and the intent of the prohibition\u201d). Consequently, although courts must presumptively apply the Guidelines as they exist at the time of sentencing, they may not do so where those Guidelines would lead to imposition of a harsher penalty than that to which the defendant was subject at the time of the offense. In such cases, the Guidelines applicable at the time of the offense must be applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-6\"><em>United States v. Simmons, </em>368 F.3d 1335, 1337-38 (11th Cir.2004) (alterations in original, except the first).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Accordingly, at the time Oddo was sentenced, it was plain error for the district court to use the 2003 guidelines instead of the 2000 guidelines, because the use of the mandatory 2003 guidelines resulted in an increased sentence. That is, there was error, that was plain, that affected Oddo\u2019s substantial rights, and that affected the fairness and integrity of the judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">We will vacate Oddo\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court with instructions to conduct, as soon as practical, a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-10\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED. SENTENCE VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
