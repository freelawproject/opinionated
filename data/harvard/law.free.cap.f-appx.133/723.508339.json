The district court granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), on the following issue: \u201cwhether the Florida trial court\u2019s closure of the courtroom during the 6-year-old child victim\u2019s testimony complied with the four-part test set out in <em>Waller v. Georgia, </em>[467 U.S. 39, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984) ], as applied in <em>Judd v. Haley, </em>250 F.3d 1308, 1314 (11th Cir.2001), Fla. Stat. \u00a7 918.16 notwithstanding.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition <em>de novo. See Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). In <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), the Supreme Court set forth the standard of review to be applied to a state prisoner\u2019s application for habeas relief brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. According to the Court, \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u201cprohibits a federal court from granting an application for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless that adjudication \u2018resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399, 120 S.Ct. at 1516 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">After thorough review of the record, including the pertinent transcripts, and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Laplante was tried and convicted of one count of sexual battery on a child less than twelve years of age and one count of lewd and lascivious acts in the presence of a child, all in violation of Florida law. Pursuant to Fla. Stat. \u00a7 918.16,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the state trial court closed the courtroom during the testimony of the six-year-old victim concerning her contact with Laplante. Upon the State\u2019s request for the closure, the trial court, without objection by Laplante, ordered the general public\u2019s exclusion during the victim\u2019s testimony. Over Laplante\u2019s subsequent objection, the trial court also excluded Laplante\u2019s family from the courtroom during the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-11\">On direct appeal from his conviction, Laplante argued that the trial court\u2019s closure of the courtroom did not comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Waller v. Georgia, </em>467 U.S. 39, 104 S.Ct. 2210, 81 L.Ed.2d 31 (1984), which, the parties agree, is the clearly established federal law, within the meaning of the AEDPA, on the issue of courtroom closures in circumstances such as those presented here. Thus, Laplante exhausted this claim in the state court proceedings prior to bringing this federal habeas action. The state appellate court affirmed Laplante\u2019s conviction in a <em>per curiam </em>summary decision. <em>See Laplante v. State, </em>736 So.2d 1190 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1999) (Table).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-12\">Laplante then filed this claim for federal habeas relief, again asserting a violation of <em>Waller </em>based on the closure of the courtroom, including exclusion of his family members, during the victim\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>In <em>Waller, </em>the state trial court closed a suppression hearing over the objection of the defendant on account of the privacy-interests of certain individuals who could be heard on the various wiretap recordings that were to be presented. <em>See </em>467 U.S. at 41-42,104 S.Ct. at 2212-13. The Supreme Court held that in order for the closure of the suppression hearing to be in accordance with the defendants\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-5\">the party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, [2] the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, [3] the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and [4] it must make findings adequate to support the closure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 48, 104 S.Ct. at 2216. The Court then determined that the closure in that case was plainly <em>not </em>justified because (1) \u201cthe State\u2019s proffer was not specific\u201d; (2) \u201cthe trial court\u2019s findings were broad and general\u201d; (3) \u201c[t]he court did not consider alternatives to immediate closure of the entire hearing\u201d; and (4) \u201cthe closure was far more extensive than necessary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 48-49,104 S.Ct. at 2216-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Here, in rejecting Laplante\u2019s argument based on <em>Waller, </em>the district court observed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-8\">Petitioner has not established that the trial court\u2019s decision to close the courtroom during the child victim\u2019s testimony was contrary to or an unreasonable application of the Supreme Court holding in <em>Waller, </em>and its progeny. The trial court made sufficient factual findings to enable a review of whether the decision to close the trial was appropriate and no broader than necessary to protect the child\u2019s interests, considering Supreme Court precedent. Those findings addressed the child\u2019s tender age, the sensitive and potential traumatic nature of her expected testimony and the necessity of protecting her interests over the Sixth Amendment rights of the Petitioner. The court appropriately weighed the competing interests, considered the manner in which the competing interests could best be served and found that the state had an overriding interest in the victim\u2019s welfare which outweighed Petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial. Petitioner has failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the state court\u2019s decision was contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court law or an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">We too conclude that the state trial court\u2019s closure of the courtroom during the victim\u2019s testimony, as well as the state appellate court\u2019s affirmance of that decision in Laplante\u2019s direct appeal raising this <em>Waller </em>claim, was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established Supreme Court law, as stated in <em>Waller. </em>On the first factor, the prosecutor stated that she wanted the courtroom closed so that \u201cthe child [could] testify in relative calm.\u201d The state trial court took this to mean the prosecutor was concerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>with \u201cthe protection of this child.\u201d The Supreme Court has recognized the protection of \u201cthe physical and psychological well-being of a minor\u201d is a \u201ccompelling\u201d state interest in the context of a courtroom closure during a criminal trial involving the forcible rape and forced unnatural rape of three minors. <em>Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court for Norfolk County, </em>457 U.S. 596, 607, 102 S.Ct. 2613, 2620, 73 L.Ed.2d 248 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">As for the second <em>Waller </em>factor, although the prosecutor sought a total closure during the trial, with the exception of the victim\u2019s advocate, the state trial court limited the total closure to the minor-victim\u2019s testimony. Laplante did not object to the initial request for a closure, and when he objected to the exclusion of members of his family, the trial court found that the protection of the child (a compelling state interest under <em>Globe Newspaper) </em>required the family members to be excluded along with the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">On the third factor, it is clear that the state trial court considered other alternatives, including whether to close the courtroom to everybody, including the defendant\u2019s family <em>and </em>the victim\u2019s advocate. The trial court ultimately concluded that the victim\u2019s advocate should be permitted to remain and, therefore, modified the original ruling excluding everyone. After considering further argument on why the defendant\u2019s family also should remain, the court concluded that \u201cin this particular instance the protection of this child outweighs any Sixth Amendment right that [Laplante] may have to have the members of his family present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Finally, on the fourth <em>Waller </em>factor, the trial court\u2019s findings were adequate to support its decision to close the courtroom. Some factors that are important to consider include \u201cthe minor victim\u2019s age, psychological maturity and understanding, the nature of the crime, the desires of the victim, and the interests of parents and relatives.\u201d <em>Globe Newspaper, </em>457 U.S. at 608, 102 S.Ct. at 2621 (footnote omitted); <em>see also Judd, </em>250 F.3d at 1319 (discussing the lack of evidence on some of these factors). Here, the state court considered: (1) the victim\u2019s age, commenting about \u201cthe young age of the child,\u201d and also noting that she was \u201ca six-year-old\u201d; (2) the psychological maturity and understanding of the victim when the court expressed its understanding that she was going to testify concerning \u201careas that are going to be extremely sensitive to the child and possibly traumatic\u201d; (3) the nature of the ci\u00e1me and the resulting testimony that would be elicited, noting more than once that this was a \u201csexual battery\u201d case, and also that the testimony would concern \u201cextremely sensitive\u201d facts; and (4) the interests of the victim\u2019s relatives when it allowed for the victim\u2019s aunt, who was also acting as the victim\u2019s advocate, to remain present during the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">On this record, neither the state trial court\u2019s decision to close the courtroom nor the state appellate court\u2019s rejection of Laplante\u2019s <em>Waller </em>claim was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Waller. </em>Although the state trial court did not explicitly state it was applying the <em>Waller </em>test, we readily conclude that it was not objectively unreasonable for the state appellate court to affirm the trial court\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b749-16\">. The COA is limited to this issue. Laplante filed a motion to expand the COA, which we previously denied, both on initial consideration and on reconsideration. Accordingly, we will consider Laplante\u2019s argument <em>only </em>on the COA's issue, and not on additional arguments that are beyond the scope of the COA. <em>See Dorsey </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>262 F.3d 1181, 1185 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>n. 3 (11th Cir.2001) (declining to address issues not included in the COA granted by the district court).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">We also note that Laplante's assertion that the trial court\u2019s closure of the courtroom violated Florida law does not provide a basis for federal habeas relief. <em>Cf. Branan v. Booth, </em>861 F.2d 1507, 1508 (11th Cir.1988) (\"a habeas petition grounded on issues of state law provides no basis for habeas relief\u201d). Thus, in addition to being beyond the scope of the COA, that argument is not an appropriate ground for federal habeas relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-8\">. The applicable version of \u00a7 918.16 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-9\">In the trial of any case, civil or criminal, when any person under the age of 16 ... is testifying concerning any sex offense, the court shall clear the courtroom of all persons except parties to the cause and their immediate families or guardians, attorneys and their secretaries, officers of the court, jurors, newspaper reporters or broadcasters, court reporters, and, at the request of the victim, victim or witness advocates designated by the state attorney\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-14\">Fla.
