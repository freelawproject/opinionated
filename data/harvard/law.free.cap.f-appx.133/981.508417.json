He renews his argument, preserved in the district court, that his constitutional rights were violated when the district court assessed a four-level adjustment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) (firearms possessed in connection with another felony offense), based on judicially determined facts, citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">Pursuant to the recent decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), for sentencing errors preserved in district court, \u201cwe will ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand, unless we can say the error is harmless under Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\u201d. <em>United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 375 (5th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (U.S. 31 March 2005) (No. 04-9517)). As the Government concedes, the four-level adjustment violated Walker\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury. The Government further concedes it cannot demonstrate that the error was harmless. Accordingly, Walker\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and this case is REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING. <em>See Mares, </em>402 F.3d at 520 n. 9; <em>Akpan, </em>407 F.3d at 376. Because resentencing is required based on the Sixth Amendment violation alone, we do not address the other sentencing issue raised by Walker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED FOR RESEN-TENCING</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1008-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
