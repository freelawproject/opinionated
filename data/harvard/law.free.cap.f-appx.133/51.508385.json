We affirm with modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-18\">Coleman was convicted of armed bank robbery and use of a firearm during a crime of violence in federal district court in Oklahoma. He was sentenced to 322 months in prison and was ordered to pay restitution in full immediately in the amount of $5528. His conviction and sentence were affirmed by the Tenth Circuit. Coleman subsequently filed two \u00a7 2255 motions in the Tenth Circuit, both of which were denied. Coleman then filed a motion in a federal district court in Oklahoma for remission of the restitution imposed at sentencing, which was construed as a \u00a7 2255 motion and denied. Coleman next filed a motion labeled as filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000) in the Eastern District of Virginia, which the court construed as a successive \u00a7 2255 motion and dismissed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-19\">In his motion, Coleman raised five claims: (1) that he is actually innocent; (2) the evidence at trial was insufficient to satisfy the \u201cuse\u201d standard in \u00a7 924(c); (3) his sentence was improperly enhanced; (4) the order of restitution was improper; and (5) the BOP is improperly executing his order of restitution. We find that claims (l)-(4) attack the legality of Coleman\u2019s conviction and subsequent sentence. Because these claims do not meet the standard set out in <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2000), we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to construe claims (l)-(4) as brought pursuant to \u00a7 2255. <em>See United States v. Glass, </em>317 F.2d 200, 203 (4th Cir.1963) (finding court has discretion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>reclassify an improperly labeled pleading). Further, under \u00a7 2255, this court lacks jurisdiction to grant authorization to file a successive petition. Such a request must be made in the jurisdiction that imposed the sentence at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Coleman\u2019s fifth claim, that the BOP is improperly executing his order of restitution, requires a separate analysis. In his motion, Coleman asserts that the district court had improperly delegated its authority to set the amount and timing of his restitution payments to the BOP in violation of <em>United States v. Miller, </em>77 F.3d 71, 78 (4th Cir.1996). Because this claim does not challenge the legality of Coleman\u2019s conviction or sentence, we find that it was properly brought as a petition for habeas corpus relief arising under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000). <em>See Blaik v. United States, </em>161 F.3d 1341, 1342-43 (11th Cir.1998) (collecting cases holding that a \u00a7 2255 motion may not be used for challenging fines or restitution orders).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">However, we further find that Coleman\u2019s claim fails on the merits. Participation in the Inmate Financial Responsibility Program (\u201cIFRP\u201d) does not establish a violation of <em>Miller. </em>\u201cThe immediate payment directive is generally interpreted to require payment to the extent that the defendant can make it in good faith, beginning immediately.\u201d <em>Matheny v. Morrison, </em>307 F.3d 709, 712 (8th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted) (holding that \u201cBOP has the discretion to place an inmate in the IFRP when the sentencing court has ordered immediate payment of the court-imposed fine\u201d) (citing <em>McGhee v. Clark, </em>166 F.3d 884, 886 (7th Cir.1999), and <em>Montano-Figueroa v. Crabtree, </em>162 F.3d 548, 549-50 (9th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The BOP therefore is properly using the IFRP as an avenue to collect Coleman\u2019s restitution, just as it would any other debt owed by him. <em>See McGhee, </em>166 F.3d at 886 (\u201cNothing barred the BOP from ensuring pursuant to the IFRP that [defendant] make good-faith progress toward satisfying his court-ordered obligations.\u201d); <em>see also </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 545.11 (2004) (requiring inmates to make payments towards court-ordered obligations, including fines). Therefore, although this claim was properly asserted under \u00a7 2241, and the district court erred in concluding otherwise, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of relief because the claim is merit-less. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b78-20\"> Coleman is incarcerated in Virginia.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
