He argues that (1) the district court clearly erred in enhancing his sentence for obstruction of justice pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (2003); (2) the district court clearly erred in enhancing his sentence for an aggravating role pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c) (2003); (3) the district court erred in upwardly departing; and, for the first time on appeal, (4) his sentence was violative of <em>Blakely v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2581, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">We hold that the record supports the district court\u2019s findings that (1) Sarinas obstructed justice when he unlawfully influenced Alan August by asking August to lie to law enforcement regarding August\u2019s acquisition of the passports at issue and (2) Sarinas played a supervisory role in the offense based on, inter alia, his recruitment of August and his (Sarinas\u2019s) degree of participation in the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.4(a)), 3Bl.l(c); <em>United States v. Fullwood, </em>342 F.3d 409, 415 (5th Cir.2003), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1111, 124 S.Ct. 1087, 157 L.Ed.2d 899 (2004). Therefore, the district court did not clearly err in enhancing his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3C1.1 or 3Bl.l(c), respectively. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 n. 9 (5th Cir. Apr.27, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">For the first time on appeal, Sarinas argues that the district court\u2019s decision to upwardly departure pursuant to application note three of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1 is insupportable because the false passports at issue were not used to commit an \u201cespecially serious\u201d felony offense. Review is therefore for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 830 (5th Cir.1998). We hold that the district court did not plainly err in finding that the felony offense of aiding in the international flight of an individual charged with murder-for-hire was \u201cespecially serious\u201d and, therefore, justification for its decision to depart. As this basis is, standing alone, sufficient to support the departure, we do not reach the propriety of the district court\u2019s alternative bases in support thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Finally, the record indicates that Sarinas admitted under oath at his rearraignment the facts used to support the obstruction of justice and aggravating role enhancements. Therefore, these enhancements did not implicate the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>- U.S. -,-,---, 125 S.Ct. 738, 752, 755-56, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2537. With regard to his upward departure, Sarinas cannot show that the district court would have reached a significantly different result had he been sentenced under an advisory Guidelines regime because the decision to upwardly depart was within the district court\u2019s discretion; therefore, he cannot show plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 521 (5th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 04-9517 (U.S. Mar. 31, 2005); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L2.1, comment. (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b176-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
