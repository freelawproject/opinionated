Jimenez contends that his sentence must be vacated in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court was under the mistaken impression that the Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory rather than advisory. He maintains that this was a \u201cstructural\u201d error that affected the \u201cframework\u201d of the entire proceeding against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-28\">We review Jimenez\u2019s contention for plain error because he did not raise the issue in the district court. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005). We agree with Jimenez that the district court plainly erred when it sentenced him pursuant to a mandatory guidelines system. <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 750, 768-69. Jimenez has not met his burden of establishing plain error, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>er, because the record does not suggest that the district judge would have imposed a different sentence had she been aware that the sentencing guidelines are merely advisory. <em>Valenzuela-Quevedo, 407 F.3d </em>at 733-734.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1010-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
