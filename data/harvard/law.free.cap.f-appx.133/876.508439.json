Umeugo sought rescission of a final order of removal entered in absentia. She claimed reopening was warranted because her absence was due to exceptional circumstances beyond her control. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-20\">We review the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2004); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Yanez-Popp v. INS, </em>998 F.2d 231, 234 (4th Cir.1993). A denial of a motion to reopen must be reviewed with extreme deference, since immigration statutes do not contemplate reopening and the applicable regulations disfavor motions to reopen. <em>M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 308 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc). We find the Board did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-21\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
