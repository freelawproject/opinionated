Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We will only reverse \u201cif \u2018the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)). To qualify for withholding of removal, Naser must show a clear probability of persecution because of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <em>Rusu, </em>296 F.3d at 324 n. 13 (citing <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 430, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984)). We find substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Protection under the CAT is generally granted in the form of withholding of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c) (2004). An applicant must establish it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2). Again, we find the Board\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b925-8\"> Naser does not challenge the finding that she was not eligible for asylum because the application was not timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
