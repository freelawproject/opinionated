The district court sentenced Daniels to 168 months in prison and five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-26\">Daniels\u2019s conditional plea agreement permits him to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the cocaine base that was seized from his car on November 4, 2002, in Winnsboro, Louisiana. On that night, police officers acting pursuant to the tip of a confidential informant (\u201cCl\u201d) followed Daniels\u2019s car as he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>drove among several towns in northern Louisiana. Approximately two hours after officers stopped Daniels\u2019s car in Winnsboro for a traffic violation, a Franklin Parish District Judge signed a search warrant authorizing a search of the car. The search resulted in the seizure of approximately 222 grams of crack cocaine and 20 grams of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Daniels now argues that the court erred in denying his motion to suppress, primarily because the affidavit on which the search warrant was based was insufficient within its \u201cfour corners\u201d to establish probable cause to search. He argues that the affidavit was \u201cbare bones.\u201d Daniels contends that the search thus did not fall with in the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception announced in <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. 897, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984). Even if the <em>Leon </em>good-faith exception does not apply, we may affirm the denial of Daniels\u2019s suppression motion if we conclude that a warrantless search would have been supported by probable cause. <em>See United States v. Gbemisola, </em>225 F.3d 753, 759 (D.C.Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>3A Wright, King, <em>&amp; </em>Klein, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 666. The testimony at Daniels\u2019s state-court suppression hearing and at a supplemental hearing in federal district court showed that probable cause for the search did exist under the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement. <em>See United States v. Saucedo-Munoz, </em>307 F.3d 344, 351 (5th Cir.2002). Construing the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable\u201d to the Government, <em>see United States v. Laury, </em>985 F.2d 1293, 1314 (5th Cir.1993), we hold that the district court did not err in concluding that the totality of the circumstances established probable cause to believe that Daniels was transporting drugs in his car. <em>See Saucedo-Munoz, </em>307 F.3d at 351. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Daniels\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Daniels contends that the district court erred in denying his pre-sentencing motion for additional testing of the cocaine seized from his car. In that motion, Daniels argued that, although testing had confirmed that the substance was cocaine base, his attorney had not informed him that, as a legal matter, \u201call cocaine base is not crack cocaine.\u201d Daniels\u2019s motion was essentially a motion to conduct discovery. Daniels has established neither a relevant legal distinction between \u201cbase\u201d and \u201ccrack\u201d nor that the substance in his case was \u201ccrack\u201d but not \u201cbase.\u201d The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. <em>United States v. Webster, </em>162 F.3d 308, 339 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">For the first time on appeal, Daniels argues that the Government presented no evidence at sentencing that the substance found in his car was \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. This claim is reviewable for plain error only. <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc); <em>see United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Daniels\u2019s Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) stated that testing of the substance showed that it was cocaine base (or \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine) weighing 231.30 grams. This unrebutted PSR information bore sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d to support the district court\u2019s determination that crack cocaine was involved. <em>See United States v. Cothran, </em>302 F.2d 279, 286 (5th Cir.2002). No error, plain or otherwise, is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">We AFFIRM the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b172-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
