Spears was assigned to work on a heat exchanger in the fluid catalytic cracking (\u201cFCC\u201d) unit of the refinery. After concluding his work on the heat exchanger, Spears began toting his tools to the PSC tool shed, located south of the FCC unit. He tripped on steel-braided hoses lying across his path and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-27\">Spears and his wife sued Crown, alleging state law causes of action; jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship. Crown subsequently moved for summary judgment, claiming that, under chapter 95 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Code, it cannot be liable for any injuries to Spears. The district court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Enacted in 1995, chapter 95 reflects just one aspect of the Texas legislature\u2019s recent so-called \u201ctort reform\u201d efforts. Generally, Texas law imposed a duty on premises owners to inspect their premises and warn invitees of dangers that are not open and obvious. <em>See Coastal Mar. Serv. v. Lawrence, </em>988 S.W.2d 223, 225 (Tex.1999). With the passage of chapter 95, however, that duty is abrogated in certain circumstances. According to the statute,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\">A property owner is not liable for personal injury, death, or property damage to a contractor, subcontractor, or an employee of a contractor or subcontractor who constructs, repairs, renovates, or modifies an improvement to real property, including personal injury, death, or property damage arising from the failure to provide a safe workplace unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">(1) the property owner exercises or retains some control over the manner in which the work is performed, other than the right to order the work to start or stop or to inspect progress or receive reports; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">(2) the property owner had actual knowledge of the danger or condition resulting in the personal injury, death, or property damage and failed to adequately warn.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">Tex. Civ. Prac. Rem.Code \u00a7 95.003. Furthermore, the code clarifies,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-13\">This chapter applies only to a claim:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-14\">(1) against a property owner, contractor, or subcontractor for personal injury, death, or property damage to an owner, a contractor, or a subcontractor or an employee of a contractor or subcontractor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-15\">(2) <em>that arises from the condition or use of an improvement to real property where the contractor or subcontractor constructs, repairs, renovates, or modifies the improvement.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-16\">Tex. Civ. Prac. Rem.Code \u00a7 95.002 (emphasis added). It is the italicized portion that is at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-17\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-18\">Spears contends that chapter 95 is not applicable here because his injury and claim did not arise from the condition or use of the improvement to real property on which he worked. He does not deny that the heat exchanger on which he was working is an improvement for statutory purposes. Nevertheless, he posits that his injury and claim arose from the hoses left on the pathway outside the FCC unit in which the \u201cimprovement\u201d on which he was working was located. Consequently, goes the argument, his claim cannot have arose from the \u201ccondition or use of\u2019 the improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-19\">At first blush, Spears\u2019s argument is persuasive. Although Crown Central points to an abundance of Texas cases concluding that any injury relating to the work done on the premises is covered under chapter 95,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201crelating to\u201d is a much broader propo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>sition than is \u201carising from the condition or use of the improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">This case is illustrative. The injury undoubtedly was related to the work Spears was doing, because it occurred while he was leaving his work site. Nevertheless, the alleged cause of the injury (i.e., the hoses) was neither a condition nor a use of the heat exchanger, which was the improvement on which Spears worked. The district court acknowledged as much, noting that \u201cthe injury-producing defect, a hose stretched across a walkway, was not the object of [Spears\u2019] toils.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">None of this is to say, however, that the district court erred in concluding that chapter 95 shields Crown from liability. The Texas Supreme Court has yet to decide a case interpreting the language of chapter 95 and elucidating the extent of its limitations on premises liability. The intermediate Texas courts, on the other hand, have repeatedly concluded that claims such as Spears\u2019s are barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The best example is <em>Fisher, </em>on which the district court substantially relied. In <em>Fisher, </em>the court used legislative history to conclude that where a defect in a ladder used to reach an air conditioning unit that was the object of the plaintiffs work caused the injury, chapter 95 protected the premises owner. The ladder \u201cprovided appellant a means to reach his work site. It was not the object of his work. Nevertheless, appellant\u2019s injuries arose from \u2018the failure to provide a safe workplace.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fisher, </em>16 S.W.3d at 202 (quoting Tex. Civ. Prac. Rem.Code \u00a7 95.003).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">In cases where federal jurisdiction is predicated solely on diversity, we are charged with making our best <em>\u201cErie </em>guess\u201d and \u201cdetermmjmg] as best as [we] can\u201d what the Texas Supreme Court would decide were the question before it. <em>Howe v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., </em>204 F.3d 624, 627 (5th Cir.2000). Where, as here, the state\u2019s highest civil court has yet to rule on the question, we look to the decisions of intermediate courts of appeals for guidance. <em>See id. </em>Those decisions represent \u201cdat[a] for ascertaining state law which is not to be disregarded by a federal court unless it is convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Given that the Texas intermediate courts of appeals have unanimously<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> construed chapter 95 broadly, to preclude liability in instances such as this, we must respect those decisions as the best, and only, indicator of how the Texas Supreme Court would rule. Consequently, summary judgment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b155-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
