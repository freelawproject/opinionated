We re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>view the denial of disability benefits \u201conly to ascertain whether (1) the final decision is supported by substantial evidence and (2) whether the Commissioner used the proper legal standards to evaluate the evidence.\u201d <em>Newton v. Apfel, </em>209 F.3d 448, 452 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cSubstantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept to support a conclusion. It is more than a mere scintilla and less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Sarabia argues that the administrative law judge\u2019s assessment of her residual functional capacity is not supported by substantial evidence because the administrative law judge mis-charaeterized the degree of the mental limitations indicated in the psychological consultative report. She argues that because the psychologist reported that she had only a \u201cfair\u201d ability with respect to certain assessments, and because the term \u201cfair\u201d is defined in the report as meaning that \u201cthe ability to function in this area is seriously limited but not precluded,\u201d the administrative law judge could not determine that her mental impairments were not severe without obtaining testimony from a vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The use of a vocational expert is discretionary. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1566(e). However, if the claimant suffers from nonexertional impairments, or a combination of exertional and nonexertional impairments which significantly affect his RFC, the Commissioner must rely on a vocational expert to establish that suitable jobs exist in the economy. <em>Newton, </em>209 F.3d at 458; <em>Loza v. Apfel, </em>219 F.3d 378, 399 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Research reveals no authority supporting Sarabia\u2019s assertion that the psychologist\u2019s \u201cseriously limited\u201d findings mandated a finding that her RFC was \u201csignificantly affected\u201d by nonexertional impairments, thus requiring the testimony of a vocational expert. Moreover, the ALJ properly considered other evidence in the record that conflicted with Sarabia\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cfair\u201d notations made on the medical-assessment form. \u201cConflicts in the evidence are for the [Commissioner] and not the courts to resolve.\u201d <em>Newton, </em>209 F.3d at 452. Finally, we note that Sarabia asserts that her argument is not that she \u201cwas disabled, <em>per se,\u201d </em>but rather that the ALJ erred in finding no disability without obtaining the testimony of a vocational expert. \u201cThis [c]ourt will not reverse the decision of the ALJ for failure to fully and fairly develop the record unless the claimant shows that he or she was prejudiced by the ALJ\u2019s failure.\u201d <em>Carey, </em>230 F.3d at 142. The judgment affirming the denial of disability benefits is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b166-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
