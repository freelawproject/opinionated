On appeal, Ortiz argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion without a hearing. He maintains that he has provided substantial assistance to the government, but nevertheless, the government refuses to move for the sentence reduction it promised because it suspects him of hiding assets. He asserts that the government\u2019s unwillingness to request a sentence reduction is the result of bad faith, and he also maintains that the district court denied him due process of law when it refused to grant him an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">Ortiz also argues that the government breached the terms of his plea agreement when it failed to moved for a sentence reduction. He argues that the government\u2019s failure to mention its dissatisfaction with his financial disclosures, while nevertheless continuing to solicit assistance from him, indicates that it was acting in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court can compel the government to make a substantial assistance motion. <em>United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1498 (11th Cir.1993). We review the district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Gay, </em>251 F.3d 950, 951 (11th Cir.2001). We review <em>de novo </em>the issue of \u201c[w]hether the government has breached a plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Mahique, </em>150 F.3d 1330, 1332 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, a district court may impose a sentence below the minimum required under the guidelines if the government files a \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d motion when the defendant is sentenced. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b) provides that, after a sentence has been imposed, upon motion of the government, a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence below the statutory minimum based on substantial assistance. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">In <em>Forney, </em>the defendant\u2019s plea agreement vested the decision of whether the defendant\u2019s cooperation amounted to substantial assistance solely with the government. We held that the government did not breach the plea agreement by failing to move for a downward departure based upon substantial assistance, because the plea agreement only stated that the government would consider whether the defendant\u2019s aid amounted to substantial assistance and that such determination was solely the government\u2019s. <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1499-1501. We stated that, in the context of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, the government has \u201c \u2018a power, not a duty, to file a motion when a defendant has substantially assisted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1500 (quoting <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">In <em>Wade, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cfederal courts have authority to review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>unconstitutional motive,\u201d like \u201crace or religion.\u201d Wade, 504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-44. A defendant who merely claims to have provided substantial assistance or who makes only generalized allegations of improper motive is not entitled to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 186, 112 S.Ct. at 1844. Thus, judicial review is appropriate only when \u201cthere is an allegation and a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation.\u201d <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1502.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In the instant case, Ortiz\u2019s claim is without merit, because he has failed to allege an unconstitutional motive for the government\u2019s decision not to file a motion for a reduction in his sentence. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-44. Ortiz alleged that the district court denied him due process of law by refusing to grant him an evidentiary hearing, but this constitutional claim concerned the district court\u2019s decision, and did not attribute the government\u2019s decision not to request a sentence reduction on his behalf to an unconstitutional motive, such as race or religion. <em>Id. </em>at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-44. In regard to the government, Ortiz made only general allegations of bad faith. In light of Ortiz\u2019s failure to allege an unconstitutional motive, the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the matter. <em>See id. </em>at 186, 112 S.Ct. at 1844.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Finally, although Ortiz maintains that the government breached the plea agreement by declining to request a reduction in his sentence, this claim is unconvincing, because the plea agreement provided only for the possibility that the government might, in its sole discretion, file such a motion. <em>See Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1499-1500.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Ortiz\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
