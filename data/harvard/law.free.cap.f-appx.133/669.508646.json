On appeal, Brooks argues that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision was erroneous because there was no substantial vocational evidence to support the conclusion that a significant number of jobs existed in the national economy that she could perform in her impaired condition. Brooks relies on the Vocational Expert\u2019s (\u201cVE\u201d) responses to the ALJ\u2019s two hypo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>thetical questions, namely, that the 840 jobs that existed in the north central Alabama region she could perform was not a significant number.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">We review a social security case to determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and whether the correct legal standards were applied. <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997). We do not reweigh evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the Commissioner, but instead review the entire record to determine if the decision reached is reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. <em>Cornelius v. Sullivan, </em>936 F.2d 1143, 1145 (11th Cir.1991). Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Hale v. Bowen, </em>831 F.2d 1007, 1011 (11th Cir.1987) (stating that substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla, but less than a preponderance\u201d \u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">When evaluating whether a claimant is disabled, the Social Security Regulations establish a five-part test. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. First, the Commissioner determines whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a). If the claimant is not engaged in substantial activity, the next step is to determine whether the claimant has a severe impairment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c). If the claimant is not severely impaired, then the claimant is not disabled; however, if the claimant has a severe impairment, then the next question is whether the impairment meets or equals one of the impairments in the listings. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(c) &amp; (d). If the claimant\u2019s impairment fails to meet or equal an impairment in the listings, then the next step is to determine whether the impairment prevents past relevant work. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Once the claimant proves that she cannot return to her past relevant work, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to show that the claimant can perform other jobs that are significant in number in the national economy, considering age, education, and work experience. <em>Gibson v. Heckler, </em>762 F.2d 1516, 1518-19 (11th Cir.1985). The burden is on the ALJ to provide evidence about the existence of other work in the national economy that a claimant can perform. <em>Reeves v. Heckler, </em>734 F.2d 519, 525 (11th Cir.1984); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(g). The ALJ may satisfy this burden and provide this evidence through a VE\u2019s testimony. <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1566(e). In order for a VE\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments. <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1240 n. 7. Further, the ALJ must articulate specific jobs that exist in national economy that a claimant can perform. <em>Allen v. Sullivan, </em>880 F.2d 1200, 1202 (11th Cir.1989). A claimant must show that she could not perform those jobs in order to prove disability. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). Work exists in the national economy when it exists in significant numbers either in the region where the claimant lives or in several other regions of the country. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1566(a). The ALJ, relying on the VE\u2019s testimony, and not the VE, determines whether a specific number of jobs constitutes a significant number. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(g); <em>see also Martinez v. Heckler, </em>807 F.2d 771, 775 (9th Cir.1986)(whether there are a significant number of jobs is a question of fact to be determined by a judicial officer); <em>see also Barker v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>882 F.2d 1474, 1480 (9th Cir.1989)(an expert\u2019s <em>opinion </em>about what constitutes a significant number of jobs is not relevant)(emphasis in original). We have upheld the ALJ\u2019s finding that 174 small appliance repairman position in the area in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>which the claimant resided established the existence of work in significant numbers. <em>Allen v. Bowen, </em>816 F.2d 600, 602 (11th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">The ALJ\u2019s finding that 840 polisher, document preparer, and bonder jobs constituted a significant number in the national economy is supported by substantial evidence. It is the ALJ, relying on the VE\u2019s testimony, who determines whether 840 jobs constituted a significant number; the VE\u2019s determination is not binding. Accordingly, the ALJ based its finding on the VE\u2019s testimony, even though the finding was contrary to the VE\u2019s opinion. The ALJ, by relying on the VE\u2019s testimony, properly found that Brooks was not disabled because she could perform specific jobs that existed in significant numbers in the national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Upon review of the administrative proceedings, the medical record, and the proceedings in the district court, and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
