We will reverse the Board\u2019s asylum ruling \u201conly if \u2018the evidence presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Huaman-Cornelio v. Bd. of Immigration Appeals, </em>979 F.2d 995, 999 (4th Cir.1992) (internal quotation marks omitted)). We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s decision, and conclude that Bako fails to demonstrate that the evidence compels a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">Bako also complains that the immigration judge denied his due process rights by refusing to allow him to present evidence that might entitle him to asylum based solely on the severity of past persecution, under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)(A) (2005). We conclude that this claim entitles Bako to no relief because he has failed to demonstrate any prejudice. <em>Rusu, </em>296 F.3d at 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-14\">Accordingly, we deny Bako\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-15\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b110-11\"> As Bako does not challenge the denial of withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture on appeal, those iss\u00faes are not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
