Because Thomas\u2019 notice of appeal and request to reopen the appeal period was received in the district court after the expiration of the appeal period, we remanded the case to the district court for a determination of the timeliness of the request to reopen the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6) <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988) (notice considered filed as of the date Appellant delivers it to prison officials for forwarding to the court).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">On remand, the district court found that Thomas\u2019 motion to reopen was not timely filed. Thus, the district court had no authority to reopen the appeal period. Accordingly, we dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed. Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on March 16, 2004. The notice of appeal was filed on June 21, 2004. Because Thomas failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we deny his motion to reopen his case and dismiss this appeal as untimely. His motion to reserve argument on issues is denied as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b928-7\"> Rule 4(a)(6) allows the district court to reopen the appeal period if a party did not receive notice of the judgment or order and that party files a motion to reopen within 180 days after entry of the judgment or within seven days of receiving notice of the entry, \"whichever is earlier.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
