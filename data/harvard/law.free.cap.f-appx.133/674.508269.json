Appellant, an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employee, claimed that the EPA discriminated against her by failing to promote her and ultimately awarding a higher paying position to a younger employee. The district court rejected her claim on two grounds: (1) she had not suffered an adverse employment action and thus could not make out a <em>prima facie </em>claim of age discrimination under the ADEA, and (2) if she established a <em>prima facie </em>case, she failed to show that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>EPA\u2019s non-discriminatory reasons for its action were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination based on circumstantial evidence (which is what appellant had to do here), the evidence must show that (1) the plaintiff is a member of the protected group, (2) adverse employment action was taken against her, e.g., failure to hire or promote; (8) she was replaced by a person outside the protected group; and (4) she was qualified for the position for which he was rejected. <em>Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Once the plaintiff establishes a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the employer to provide a \u201clegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.\u201d <em>Turlington v. Atlanta Gas Light Co., </em>135 F.3d 1428, 1432 (11th Cir.1998). Importantly, this burden is one of production, not persuasion, <em>Perryman v. Johnson Prods. Co., </em>698 F.2d 1138, 1142 (11th Cir.1983), and the proffered justification need only be one that \u201cmight motivate a reasonable employer.\u201d <em>Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">If the employer satisfies its burden of production, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff who must establish that the employer\u2019s reason was a \u201cpretext to mask unlawful discrimination.\u201d <em>Turlington, </em>135 F.3d at 1432. In this final step, the plaintiff carries the \u201cultimate burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that a discriminatory intent motivated the employer\u2019s action.\u201d <em>Perryman, </em>698 F.2d at 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">The EPA was entitled to summary judgment because (1) prior to 1997 appellant could not have been promoted to a position that did not exist, and (2) after 1997 she was promoted as soon as a higher-paying position was created and became available. Therefore, she was unable to establish that she suffered an adverse employment action, and hence, could not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. Moreover, if, like the district court, we assume that appellant made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, summary judgment was still appropriate because she failed to show that the EPA\u2019s articulated reasons for not promoting her amounted to a pretext of unlawful age discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
