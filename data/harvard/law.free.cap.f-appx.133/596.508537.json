Agredo Munoz, a native and citizen of Colombia, petitions for review of the April 13, 2004 final order of the Board of Immigration Appeal (\u201cBIA\u201d) denying her motion for reconsideration of her asylum appeal. First, Munoz argues that the BIA erred in its August 26, 2003 final order of removal, in which it vacated the decision of the immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) granting her asylum. We note at the outset that Munoz never sought review of the August 26, 2003 Order in this Court. Second, Munoz urges us to order the BIA to remand her case back to the IJ in order to allow her to establish eligibility for withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) and the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (\u201cCAT\u201d). She raises her eligibility for withholding for the first time in this appeal. Finally, Munoz argues the BIA erred by denying her motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">We are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction sua sponte whenever it may be lacking.\u201d This Court has jurisdiction to review \u201cfinal order[s] of removal.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). We \u201cmay review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as a matter of right.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). The exhaustion requirement is jurisdictional and precludes review of a claim that was not presented to the BIA. <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1285 n. 14 (11th Cir.2001); Fern<em>andez-Bernal v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cA petitioner cannot obtain review of procedural errors in the administrative process that were not raised before the [BIA] merely by alleging that every such error violates due process.\u201d <em>Sundar v. INS, </em>328 F.3d 1320, 1325-26 (11th Cir.) (quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1006, 124 S.Ct. 531, 157 L.Ed.2d 412 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-11\">While we generally have jurisdiction to review exhausted claims arising from a final order of removal, the petition for review of that final order must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The statutory time limit for filing a direct petition for review in an immigration case is \u201c \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 and [is] not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (citation omitted) (construing the former 90-day period for filing a petition for review under INA \u00a7 106(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)). Moreover, a motion to reconsider filed with the BIA does <em>not </em>suspend the finality of the underlying BIA order and does not toll the review period. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405-06, 115 S.Ct. at 1549.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-12\">In this petition to review the denial of Munoz\u2019s motion to reconsider, we have no jurisdiction to consider the underlying asylum or withholding-of-removal claims because Munoz did not timely seek review of the August 26, 2003 order. We also lack jurisdiction to order the BIA to remand Munoz\u2019s case for consideration of withholding under wither the INA or CAT because Munoz never presented this argument to the BIA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we must dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Munoz\u2019s petition to the extent it challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of her underlying asylum claim and requests this Court to order a remand for the IJ to determine her eligibility for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">As for the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion for reconsideration, we review that decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Assa\u2019ad v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003), <em>cert. </em>denied, - U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 38, 160 L.Ed.2d 200 (2004). Our review is limited to determining \u201cwhether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (addressing a motion to reopen) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe application of an abuse-of-discretion review recognizes the range of possible conclusions the trial judge may reach.\u201d <em>See United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 2516, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005). Thus, we will affirm the district court even on \u201c \u2018occasions in which ... we would have gone the other way had it been our call.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Rasbury v. I.R.S. (In re Rasbury), </em>24 F.3d 159, 168 (11th Cir.1994)). When employing this standard, \u201cwe must affirm unless we find that the district court has made a clear error of judgment, or has applied the wrong legal standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">Under the regulations, a motion for reconsideration must specify \u201cthe errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). \u201cA motion to reconsider asserts that at the time of the Boards\u2019 previous decision an error was made.\u201d <em>Matter of Cerna, </em>20 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 399, 402 (BIA 1991). When the BIA reconsiders one of its prior decisions, it takes itself \u201cback in time and considerfs] the case as though a decision in the case on the record ... had never been entered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Motions to reconsider are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, \u201cwhere, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (addressing a motion to reopen).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-15\">In her motion to reconsider, Munoz primarily argued that the BIA failed to consider her reasons for fleeing Colombia. In its final order, the BIA specifically addressed and rejected all of these arguments. We cannot find that the BIA abused its discretion in denying reconsideration of arguments that it previously had considered and rejected. Moreover, Munoz failed to <em>specify </em>errors of law or fact in her motion to reconsider, as required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). Accordingly, we deny her petition for review as to the denial of her motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-16\">In sum, we dismiss Munoz\u2019s petition for review to the extent it challenges the BIA\u2019s August 26, 2003 order and requests that we remand the case, and we deny the petition as it relates to the motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-17\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-8\">. Because Munoz\u2019s removal proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L.
