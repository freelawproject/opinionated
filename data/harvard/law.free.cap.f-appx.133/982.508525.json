He contends the district court committed reversible plain error in imposing his sentence pursuant to the mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Ayesta did not raise this issue in the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">The district court erred in imposing Ayesta\u2019s sentence under the mandatory Guidelines scheme, and the error was obvious after <em>Booker. See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005). Ayesta has not shown, however, that the error affected his substantial rights. Restated, he has not shown the district court would have imposed a different or lesser sentence under a <em>Booker </em>advisory regime. <em>See id. </em>at-, 125 S.Ct. 738. Therefore, he has not shown reversible plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">Ayesta also contends the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d sentencing enhancements under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are facially unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He acknowledges this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but seeks to preserve it for possible Supreme Court review. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>United States v. Sarmiento-Funes, </em>374 F.3d 336, 346 (5th Cir.2004). This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Mancia-Perez, </em>331 F.3d 464, 470 (5th Cir.) (internal quotation and citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 935, 124 S.Ct. 358, 157 L.Ed.2d 245 (2003). Accordingly, Ayesta has not established error with respect to his sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1009-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
