Dean, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for habeas relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. In his petition, Dean contests his 240-month sentence for distributing cocaine and cocaine base, arguing that it should be reduced because of the vacatur of two of the state court convictions that were used to enhance his federal sentence. On appeal, Dean argues that the district court erred when it dismissed his petition because the state\u2019s vacatur of those two convictions meets the second and third prongs of the test enunciated in <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). Further, he argues, the Supreme Court cases of <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994), and <em>Daniels v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 374, 121 S.Ct. 1578, 149 L.Ed.2d 590 (2001), fulfilled the first prong of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-22\">We review de novo the denial of \u00a7 2241 relief. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). Section 2255 of Title 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>provides a vehicle for a federal prisoner to challenge a conviction and sentence by filing a motion to vacate, correct, or set aside the sentence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In order to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the movant must file an application with the appropriate court of appeals \u201cfor an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(8)(A). However, under limited circumstances, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255. That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">[a]n application for writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally-imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">We have held that a prisoner may not use \u00a7 2241 to circumvent the restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). In addition, we set forth a three-part test, which provides that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause applies to a claim when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aru\">1) that claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; 2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense; and, 3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhJ\"><em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. In order for a prisoner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2255 remedy under <em>Wofford, </em>all three criteria must be satisfied. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">Two years ago, we rejected Dean\u2019s efforts to file a successive \u00a7 2255 on this very issue. <em>See In re Dean, </em>341 F.3d 1247 (11th Cir.2003). There, we noted that to file a second \u00a7 2255, a petitioner had to show that the petition presented newly discovered evidence that \u201cwould be sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found the movant guilty of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1248 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255). Because his application only challenged his sentence and not his guilt, we held that he could not satisfy this test and denied his application. <em>Id. </em>at 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">Despite his arguments, the claim that Dean raised in his \u00a7 2241 petition was cognizable under \u00a7 2255 because his assertion concerned the sentence he received. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1571, 161 L.Ed.2d 542 (2005) (recognizing propriety of petitioner\u2019s attack on sentence in a first \u00a7 2255 petition because of underlying convictions\u2019 vacatur).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, a \u00a7 2255 motion was an adequate and effective remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Applying <em>Wofford\u2019s </em>three part test, Dean fails to satisfy the first and second prongs and was therefore not entitled to bring his claim under \u00a7 2241. Dean cites <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994), as his retroactively applicable Supreme Court case law. In <em>Custis, </em>the Court held that, except for convictions obtained in violation of the right to counsel, a defendant cannot collaterally attack, in federal proceedings, a previous state conviction that was used to enhance his sentence. 511 U.S. at 496, 114 S.Ct. at 1738. The Court also noted that if the defendant was successful in attacking his state court convictions through habeas review, he could apply for the reopening of any federal sentence that was enhanced by the state convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 497, 114 S.Ct. at 1739. However, this decision predated Dean\u2019s sentencing and so did not provide any new case law unavailable to Dean at the time that he filed his initial petition. Dean also relies upon <em>Daniels v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 374,121 S.Ct. 1578, 149 L.Ed.2d 590 (2001), but no cases have held that <em>Daniels </em>has retroactive application. At any rate, these two cases did not \u201cestablish[] the petitioner was convicted for a nonexistent offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Because Dean has not satisfied the three-part test found in <em>Wofford, </em>he has not satisfied \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause requirements. Therefore, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-8\">. In <em>Johnson, </em>the petitioner successfully challenged his underlying state court convictions and had them vacated. He then attempted to file his first \u00a7 2255 petition but it deemed untimely. Although the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 2255\u2019s one year statute of limitations began to run when the convictions were vacated, Johnson had not been diligent in pursuing the vacaturs and thus his petition was denied. This case is not helpful to Dean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>because the language in \u00a7 2255 \u00b6 6 governing the statute of limitations that the Court interpreted in <em>Johnson </em>does not contain the \"actual innocence\u201d requirement found in \u00b6 7, the provision governing second and successive petitions. Additionally, Dean was even less diligent in pursuing the vacaturs of his state convictions than Johnson was.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
