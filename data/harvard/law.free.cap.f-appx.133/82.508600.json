We have reviewed the record and we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Under Seal v. Under Seal, </em>No. CA-04-1212-WDQ (D.Md. Sept. 27, 2004). We also grant the Appellant\u2019s motion to modify the sealing of materials in this case so that only personal identifiers, including social security numbers, dates of birth, and financial information specific to account numbers, salaries, and finances are sealed. We deny the Appellant\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel and for a transcript at the Government\u2019s expense. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
