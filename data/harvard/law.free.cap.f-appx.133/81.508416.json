Mwinkeu\u2019s petition for review is timely only as to the Board\u2019s order denying reconsideration. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (2000) (petition for review must be filed within thirty days of final order of removal); <em>see Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394-95, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (holding order of removal and denial of motion to reconsider are separate final orders, each subject to relevant time limit for seeking review).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-24\">We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2004). Therefore, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-25\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
