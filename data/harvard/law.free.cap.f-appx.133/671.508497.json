On appeal, Santiestevan argues that his due process rights and right to a jury trial were violated when the district court enhanced his sentence based on a quantity of drugs not charged in the indictment or admitted by him. Because, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court erred in sentencing Santiestevan under a mandatory sentencing guidelines regime, and Santiestevan has established a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence but for the mandatory guidelines, we VACATE Santiestevan\u2019s sentence and REMAND for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b698-13\">Santiestevan was indicted for, among other things, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute five or more kilograms of cocaine on board a vessel subject to United States jurisdiction, in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7\u00a7 1903(g) and 1903\u00ae. At the hearing where he pled guilty, the plea agreement and the Factual Basis for Plea were introduced. R1-60, 67, 68. The plea agreement did not include a waiver of appellate rights. <em>See </em>Rl-67. The Factual Basis, which Santiestevan signed, stated that 428 kilograms of cocaine were recovered from the water near the vessel from which Santiestevan and his co-defendants were rescued. R1-68 at 1-2. The probation officer recommended that Santiestevan receive a base offense level of 35 and a criminal history category of I, resulting in a sentencing guidelines\u2019 range of 168 to 210 months. Santiestevan objected to the probation officer\u2019s recommendation and argued that he was entitled to reductions under the safety valve provision and for his minor role in the offense. R1-107. The government responded in opposition to both reductions. R1-108.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-15\">At sentencing, the government and Santiestevan indicated that the parties had reached an agreement in which the government would not oppose the safety valve reduction, and Santiestevan would withdraw his request for a minor role reduction. R2 at 6-7, 8. Based on the safety valve reduction, the probation officer then advised that Santiestevan\u2019s offense level would be 33, with a sentencing range of 135 to 168 months. <em>Id. </em>at 9. The district judge endorsed the agreement regarding the safety value reduction and indicated that he would sentence Santiestevan \u201cat the low end of the guideline range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He commented that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-16\">particularly in circumstances such as these, I would impose a lower sentence had I the discretion to do so, the discretion to depart. I don\u2019t find the basis for that, but I am not in agreement with the sentencing guidelines as they are admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>istered, but there is nothing I can do about that. I must uphold the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 13. The district judge sentenced Santiestevan to 135 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. <em>Id. </em>at 14, 17. Santiestevan did not otherwise object to the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">On appeal, Santiestevan contends that under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>524 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the district court plainly erred by applying a six-level upward enhancement to his sentence based on a quantity of drugs greater than that charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines and its application of the guidelines to the facts\u201d <em>de novo. United States v. Gunn, </em>369 F.3d 1229,1237-38 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 324, 160 L.Ed.2d 244 (2004). When a defendant fails to make an objection or argument in the district court, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d-(2005). Under the plan error analysis, we may correct an error only where</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-13\">there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-18\"><em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-19\">The district court did not err by enhancing Santiestevan\u2019s sentence based on the quantity of drugs because Santiestevan\u2019s sentence was not enhanced as a result of a judicial finding that went beyond the facts admitted by Santiestevan. Therefore, there is no Sixth Amendment violation under <em>Booker. See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). However, because the district court sentenced Santiestevan under a mandatory guidelines scheme, his sentence constitutes a <em>Booker </em>error, which is plain at the time of appellate review. <em>See id. </em>at 1330-31. Because the district court expressed that it would depart from the Guidelines if it had the discretion to do so and sentenced Santiestevan at the lowest possible sentence under the Guidelines, 135 months, there is a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence if the Guidelines were not considered mandatory.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 1332-33. Therefore, Santiestevan has satisfied the first three prongs of the plain error analysis. Where a district court has expressed the desire to impose a sentence less than that available at the low end of the Guidelines, and the Supreme Court has held that the district court has the discretion to impose such a reasonable sentence upon consideration of the factors provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the fourth prong of the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>error analysis is satisfied. <em>See id. </em>at 1333-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">For the reasons stated above, we vacate Santiestevan\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-14\">. Although Santiestevan only referenced <em>Blakely, </em>the holding in <em>Blakely </em>was applied to the federal sentencing guidelines in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Therefore, we will treat Santiestevan\u2019s claim as one raised under <em>Booker. See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b699-20\">. Based on the quantity of drugs to which Santiestevan's pled, Santiestevan faced a statutory minimum sentence of 10 years, or 15 months less than the guidelines sentence he received. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903(g), 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
