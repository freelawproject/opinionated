No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996), govern this petition. We deny the petition and affirm the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">At the hearing before the IJ, Petitioner testified that she was a catechist at a church in Bucamaranga, Santander province, Colombia. As a catechist, she taught catechism and \u201cChristian doctrine\u201d to groups of 10 to 12 children aged 9 to 12 years old. Petitioner taught catechism from 1997 until February 2000, with a four-month break at some point before that time. She claimed that she had been persecuted by guerillas, particularly the ELN (Ejercito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional), because of her religious beliefs and her teaching. Petitioner indicated that she encouraged the children to resist the recruiting efforts of the ELN: she told them not to do \u201canything that was against their family or against the country\u201d and characterized the ELN as \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201cassassins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>According to Petitioner, beginning in March 1999, the ELN contacted her daily by telephone and (1) demanded that she stop teaching the children about religion, (2) told her to leave the country, (3) threatened to kidnap her and make her \u201cdisappear\u201d, and (4) threatened to \u201cput an end\u201d to her and her family. Petitioner claimed that several times the callers identified themselves as ELN members, and on a couple of occasions, the callers indicated that they were calling on behalf of ELN commanders.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Petitioner testified that she tried to avoid the ELN by moving in with her sister in a small town 15 minutes away from Bucamaranga. She later returned to work at the church, and the threatening calls resumed. She asked for help from the parish priests, but they told her they could do nothing and that their lives were at risk. She also reported the threatening calls to the police, who were unhelpful. Petitioner attempted to relocate within Colombia, but stated that none of her friends took her because they were afraid to get involved with her. Petitioner feared that the ELN could find her anywhere because it has cells throughout Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In March 2000, Petitioner moved in with her sister for two months and came to the United States in May 2000. Petitioner received the last threatening calls immediately before she moved in with her sister. Petitioner has three adult children: two daughters living in Cartagena, Colombia, and one son believed to be in Venezuela. Petitioner submitted a letter from a priest at her church verifying that she had worked as a catechist from 1997 to 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The IJ denied asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief: Petitioner\u2019s testimony was not sufficiently detailed to provide a plausible account of the basis of her fears. The IJ acknowledged that Petitioner\u2019s testimony was consistent with her asy-</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">lum application, but stated that the asylum application and addendum contained significantly more detail than her testimony. The IJ concluded that Petitioner\u2019s testimony lacked specific detail about (1) the name, organizers, and place and time of the catechism meetings, and whether others involved received threats, (2) the students she taught, (3) the advice she gave the children on the attempted recruitment by guerillas, and (4) the substance of the threatening calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The IJ also noted that Petitioner failed to mention when she took the four month break from teaching. And, the IJ expressed concern about (1) why Petitioner continued with her work, despite the threatening calls, (2) why the ELN did not follow through with its threats and act against her, (3) why Petitioner wrote in her addendum that her daughters had been mentioned in the threatening calls, but then failed to mention this fact at the hearing, (4) why Petitioner could not relocate within Colombia and why her daughters were not in danger, (5) why Petitioner did not attempt to move or change her phone number immediately after the threats began, and (6) why the priest did not mention the threatening calls in his letter, despite Petitioner\u2019s testimony that the parish priests were aware of the threats. And the IJ pointed to the U.S. State Department\u2019s Asylum Profile and Country Report on Colombia: the IJ noted that these documents mentioned that religious personnel occasionally were targeted for persecution, but that it necessarily did not follow that Petitioner was targeted.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">Petitioner argues that her asylum application, her hearing testimony, and the Asylum Profile and Country Report, contain enough evidence to compel a finding that she had a well-founded fear of perse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>cution based on her religious beliefs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">\u201cThe BIA\u2019s factual determination that [an alien] is removable and not entitled to asylum must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. Office of the U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). The substantial evidence standard is \u201chighly deferential\u201d: we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s reasons for denying Petitioner\u2019s requests for asylum and withholding of removal: we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA\u2019s. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">An alien may obtain asylum if she is a \u201crefugee\u201d: a person unwilling to return to his country of nationality \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(a)(1), (b)(1). To establish asylum eligibility, Petitioner must show (1) past persecution (in this case on account of religion), or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that her religion will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b)(1). A showing of past persecution creates a presumption of a \u201cwell founded fear\u201d of persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Petitioner failed to demonstrate asylum eligibility. First, the IJ did not err in determining that Petitioner failed to prove that she showed past persecution. Petitioner testified only that she received threatening phone calls from persons identifying themselves as ELN members. She did not allege that she was visited in person or that the ELN attempted to follow through on these threats. These unfulfilled threats do not rise to the level of \u201cpersecution.\u201d <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (writing that persecution is an \u201cextreme concept\u201d: it requires \u201cmore than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u201d and \u201cmere harassment does not amount to persecution\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Second, the evidence does not compel the conclusion that Petitioner has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on her religious beliefs. The IJ correctly noted that Petitioner\u2019s testimony lacked detail. And given Petitioner\u2019s allegations, the IJ elicited valid and reasonable concerns about the improbability of (1) Petitioner\u2019s daughters not having received threats while continuing to live in Colombia, (2) Petitioner\u2019s failure to attempt to move or change her phone number after the threats began, and (3) the ELN\u2019s failure to follow through on its threats. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287 (stating that alien must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts\u201d showing reasonable fear that she will be targeted for persecution on account of protected ground) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">Petitioner contends that, if the IJ was not satisfied with the level of detail she provided in her testimony, the IJ had a duty to elicit the necessary details. But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>Petitioner\u2014not the IJ\u2014bears the burden of proving eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Petitioner maintains that the INA does not require an asylum applicant to present corroborating evidence: the IJ erred in requiring her to present evidence corroborating her testimony. But when an alien presents testimony lacking in detail, the need for corroborative evidence is great. <em>See In re Y-B-, </em>21 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 1136, 1139, 1998 WL 99554 (1998). And the only evidence Petitioner presented to corroborate her claims was the letter from the priest, which did not mention the threats to Petitioner. Petitioner argues that the priest did not mention the threats because he told Petitioner he was worried that his letter would end up in the ELN\u2019s possession. But Petitioner did not advance this position to the IJ: it is outside the scope of the evidence we may review. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7'1252(b)(4)(A) (court of appeals may decide petition \u201conly on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Also, the Asylum Profile provided scant support for Petitioner\u2019s claims: that document indicated that religious-based asylum claims are rare. And while the Country Report stated that religious personnel often are threatened by guerillas, this does not compel a conclusion that Petitioner herself was threatened.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In sum, we affirm the denial of asylum relief and withholding of removal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-11\">. Petitioner offers no substantive argument on the IJ's and BIA's denial of CAT relief. This issue is abandoned. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1286 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003) (deeming an issue waived where a party fails to include argument and only makes a passing reference to the order appealed from).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\">. Petitioner argues that the IJ departed from the Federal Rules of Evidence in determining that her testimony was not credible. But the record does not show that the IJ \"impeached\u201d her testimony or found it wholly incredible: the IJ determined that Petitioner\u2019s testimony lacked the requisite detail and corroboration to establish asylum eligibility. We need not further address this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b638-9\">. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Petitioner did not establish asylum eligibility: she offers no reason why she has met the higher standard for showing that the IJ\u2019s denial of withholding of removal was in error. <em>See Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
