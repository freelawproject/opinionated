As the IJ concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>the asylum application was untimely, we find that consideration of Lin\u2019s asylum claim is barred. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). Lin next asserts that he was denied due process at the asylum hearing because his testimony was rushed due to the interpreter\u2019s need to leave early for a medical appointment. We reject this claim because Lin fails to show that he was prejudiced by the alleged violation. <em>See Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 320 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
