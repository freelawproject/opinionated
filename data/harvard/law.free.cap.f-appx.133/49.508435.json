Izac, Jr. was indicted on one count of unlawful possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony. Before trial, the Government filed a motion <em>in limine </em>seeking to preclude Izac from presenting a justification defense. The district court initially denied the motion. The Government later renewed its motion, and after conducting a hearing the district court ruled that Izac did not meet the standard of proof required to present a justification defense. Izac then entered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the district court\u2019s ruling on the availability of the justification defense. The district court accepted the plea and sentenced Izac to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment. Izac now appeals the district court\u2019s order granting the Government\u2019s motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">We recently held that a conditional guilty plea is not valid if it purports to preserve for appeal a non-case-dispositive issue. <em>United States v. </em>Bundy, 392 F.3d 641, 647 (4th Cir.2004). The issue sought to be preserved for appeal in this case\u2014 whether the defendant was entitled to present a justification defense\u2014is not case-dispositive. A favorable ruling for Izac would not necessarily result in dismissal of the charge against him; rather, such a ruling would merely allow him to make an additional argument at trial. <em>See id. </em>at 648. Accordingly, Izac\u2019s purported conditional guilty plea is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The record makes clear the parties\u2019 understanding that Izac pled guilty only on the condition that he be permitted to appeal the district court\u2019s ruling on the Government\u2019s motion <em>in limine. </em>Thus, we cannot say that Izac\u2019s plea was unconditional. <em>See id. </em>at 649. \u201cBecause there is no valid plea\u2014conditional or unconditional\u2014to support the judgment of conviction, that judgment must be vacated\u201d and the case remanded for further proceedings. <em>Id. </em>On remand, Izac must decide whether to enter another guilty plea or proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the dispositive issue has been authoritatively decided, and argument would not aid the decisional process. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
