He now appeals his sentence, contending that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>403 (2004), and the Sixth Amendment precluded the district court from enhancing his offense level based on a fact that he did not admit as true. In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621, (2005), the Supreme Court made <em>Blakely\u2019s, </em>rationale applicable to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The presentenee report (PSI) set appellant\u2019s base offense level at 20 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4), and, based on information provided by the ATF\u2014that the firearm appellant possessed had been stolen\u2014the report added two points to the base offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4). Citing <em>Blakely, </em>appellant objected to this upward adjustment on the ground that he had not admitted, and would not admit, that the firearm was stolen. The ADDENDUM to the PSI noted the objection. Appellant repeated his <em>Blakely </em>objection at the sentencing hearing, Record, Vol. 2 at 2, and the court noted that he had \u201cpreserved [the objection] for appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>At 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\"><em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269 (11th Cir. (Ga.)), teaches that \u201cwe [must] reverse [the defendant\u2019s sentence] and remand [the case for resentencing] unless the Government can demonstrate that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt ... that the error complained of did not contribute to the sentence.\u201d Id. In this case, the Guidelines sentence range\u2014 including the challenged two-level upward adjustment\u2014called for a term of imprisonment of 63 to 78 months; appellant\u2019s sentence falls one month below the midpoint of this range. The sentencing transcript informs us that the <em>Blakely/Booker </em>error did not contribute to the sentence in this case. After taking appellant\u2019s considerable criminal history into account, the court stated: \u201cI have imposed the sentence because I do believe, under all the facts and the history, this whole situation, that this meets the sentence objective of punishment, deterrence and incapacitation.\u201d Record, Vol. 2 at 12. Although the court did not cite 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), its sentence reflected the sentencing purposes \u00a7 3553(a)(2) sets forth, i.e., the very sentencing purposes the court would have to consider anew if we vacated appellant\u2019s sentence and remanded the case for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
