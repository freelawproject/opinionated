Pitts\u2019 counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating there were no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issue of whether the district court erred in sentencing Pitts. Although informed of his right to do so, Pitts has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">We will reverse a district court\u2019s order imposing a sentence after revocation of supervised release only if it is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742(a)(4). Pitts\u2019 offense has a recommended guidelines range, and the district court imposed a sentence within that range. We conclude that Pitts\u2019 sentence was not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Pitts\u2019 sentence. This court requires counsel inform their client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United State for further review. If the client requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
