The BIA accepted the IJ\u2019s determination, in light of the discrepancies between Tuqan\u2019s first and second applications, as well as his testimony at the immigration hearing, that Tuqan\u2019s testimony was not credible. The BIA also found that Tuqan had failed to meet his burden of proof to present a believable and sufficiently supported claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-25\">Tuqan argues that the BIA and the IJ erred in determining that certain statements were inconsistent, and he blames any inconsistencies on translation errors or bad advice that he was given by a translator who allegedly assisted him in preparing his first application for asylum and withholding of removal. He also asserts that his supporting documentation did not undermine his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-26\">We review the BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not entitled to asylum or withholding of removal for substantial evidence and will not reverse the BIA\u2019s determination unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>F.3d 899, 905 (5th Cir.2002). Additionally, we will not substitute our \u201cjudgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to the credibility of the witnesses or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). There is substantial evidence in the record to support the determination that Tuqan did not credibly or sufficiently support his applications for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 79; <em>see also In re Y-B, </em>21 I <em>&amp; </em>N Dec. 1136, 1139 (BIA 1998). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1005-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
