That assumption we cannot accept. Had the railroad owned the barge, clearly it could not have recovered interest, for the implied contract did not expressly provide for interest; and it could not have recovered costs against the United States anyway. All recoveries from the United States must be upon contracts \u201cimplied in fact\u201d; hence we must suppose: (1) that whoever acted for the United States in this instance, knew that the barge did not belong to the railroad, and that the railroad was a charterer who would be liable for interest and costs; (2) that for this reason he made a contract to include interest and costs, if the railroad were forced to pay them to the owner; and (3) that he was authorized to make such a contract. None of these three conditions is shown to have been fulfilled. Indeed, the result was implicit in our decision in Conners Marine Co., Inc., v. Petterson Lighterage &amp; Towing Corporation, 2 Cir., 152 F.2d 657, although we did not spell it out.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-16\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
