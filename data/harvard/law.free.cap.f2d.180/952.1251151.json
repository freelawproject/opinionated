Commissioner, 5 Cir., 89 F.2d 474, answered the first question in the affirmative, and, upon the finding that the petitioner had not sustained its burden of showing, the propriety of the claimed deduction, gave a negative answer to the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">The taxpayer, meeting head on the Tax Court\u2019s determination of the first question, is here insisting that, upon the plainest principles, one-half, at most, of the income from the whole property, that is the income from the estate\u2019s one-half of it, was taxable to the estate, and that in citing the Barbour case as authority for its contrary conclusion, the Tax Court has completely misread and misapplied that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Taxpayer\u2019s approach to the second question is different. It does not claim that it carried the burden of proving that the salary increase claimed as a deduction was reasonable. Its position is: that the claim to deduction was disallowed by the commissioner not on the ground that the amount was unreasonable, but on the ground that the salary increase was not allowed by the Probate Court; that this question was the only one at issue before the Tax Court, and that the taxpayer prevailed on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">Finding ourselves in complete agreement with the taxpayer upon the first question, and in as complete disagreement with it on the second, we pass the second question, without further discussion, to consider and briefly discuss the first question, pointing out the Tax Court\u2019s error in answering it as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">This error lies in, it springs from, the fact that the Tax Court, confessedly deciding the case not upon what appeared to it to be the simple truth and right of the taxpayer\u2019s position, but upon the supposed compulsion of the Barbour case, has completely misread, and as completely misapplied, that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">Nothing said -\u2022or decided in the Barbour case supports or even tends to support the holding for which the Tax Court cites it. The question posed here, whether all or one-half of the income from the community of a deceased wife and the surviving husband who, as surviving member of the community and as her administrator, continues to manage the business, should be taxed to her estate, was not, it could not have been, presented in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-12\">There the husband, the manager of the community, had died, and his independent executors were in charge of, and were managing, the whole of the community estate, \u201cthe executors retaining possession and controll of the wife\u2019s undivided one-half community property and managing and operating the entire estate as a unit\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-13\">All that was there presented for decision, all that was decided, was whether, the whole property being in the hands of the husband\u2019s executors for administration, the claim of the commissioner, that the surviving wife had come into the receipt of one-half of the income so as to be taxable upon it, could be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-14\">In support of our view that the whole of the property being administered by the husband\u2019s executors for community purposes, no part of the income could be said to have been received by the wife so as to make her taxable upon it, we cited Lovejoy v. Cockrell, Tex.Com.App., 63 S.W.2d 1009, 1010. Quoting from that case: <em>\u201cNeither the surviving wife, as such, </em>has authority under the statutes, to sell community property for the purpose of paying community debts of her husband, <em>nor, in case she do not survive, does that authority appertain to the administration of her estate. Authority in that respect appertains exclusively to the pending administration of the estate of the deceased husband.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) We concluded that income received by the executors of the husband, as executors and statutory trustees, during the administration, was not re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>ceived by the surviving wife so as to make it taxable to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-4\">In order to leave in no doubt that we were narrowly deciding only the one question, whether the wife had received her one-half' of the community income so as to make it taxable to her, and not any other question, we took pains to say: \u201cWe are not concerned here with the form of return which the executors should have made, whether the profit should have been treated by them- for the purposes of their administration as income of the husband\u2019s estate, or as partly income to the executorship and partly to the trusteeship. It is sufficient for us to hold, as we do, that either as executors of the husband or as statutory trustees for the benefit of the creditors and others entitled to it, the executors, and not Mrs. Barbour, received the profit, and the executors, \u00e1nd not Mrs. Barbour should have returned it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-5\">Here, unlike in the Barbour case, it is the wife who is dead, and the husband who is administering the property. In such a situation, as carefully stated in Lovejoy\u2019s case, supra, there is no passage of control or management to her executors or administrators. The Supreme Court of Texas has repeatedly held that in such case the husband\u2019s power and control, with respect to the common property are undiminished by the wife\u2019s death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Here, unlike in the Barbour case, no claim is being made on behalf of the wife\u2019s estate, that she did not receive her portion of the income from the property. On the contrary, her estate admits receipt of, and has paid taxes upon, one-half of the income.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-10\">The controlling case 'here is not the Barbour case. It is our case of Henderson\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 155 F.2d 310, 164 A.L.R. 1030. There, where the question was whether .the widow individually was entitled to have taxed to her in a separate return one-half of the income, arising in the pertinent period, from the property of the previously existing community, it was held that she was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">The decision of the Tax Court, that petitioner was entitled to the deduction claimed, is affirmed. Its decision, that petitioner was taxable not on one-half, but on the whole, of the income is reversed, and the cause is remanded with directions to redetermine the tax accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1008-16\">. Catherine Cox Blackburn, the decedent, died on September 7, 1944. All of the property owned by her and her husband, E. A. Blackburn, was held in community under the laws of Texas. The value of the decedent\u2019s one-half interest in the community estate was $127,649.70 and the amount of the debts of the community at the date of her death was $36,731.54. Income tax returns for the estate for the periods here in controversy were filed with the collector of internal revenue for the first district of Texas. The estate was in the process of administration at all times material hereto. There is no evidence of any payment or crediting of income from the communitj property. One-half of the net income trom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>the entire community property was reported as income of the estate. The Commissioner, in determining the deficiency, held that the entire income from the community property during the period of administration is taxable to the petitioner- estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">. Moody, Administrator v. Smoot, 1890, 78 Tex. 119, 14.S.W. 285; Stone v. Jackson, 1919, 109 Tex. 385, 210 S.W. 953; Levy v. W. L. Moody &amp; Co., Tex.Civ.App. 1905, 87 S.W. 205 error refused.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1010-12\">WALLER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Az50\">(specially concurring) .</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-13\">I concur in the result but it seems to me that the Commissioner and The Tax Court were well justified in their constructions of the holdings of this Court in Barbour v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 89 F.2d 474. Moreover, it seems to me that in view of the fact that community property is subject to the payment of community debts, and since community debts in the Barbour case were reduced or paid by the Executor out of community income, and liabilities against the share of the surviving spouse were thereby diminished, <em>pro tanto, </em>it could not rightly be said that the surviving widow, from an income tax standpoint, received no income, or taxable benefits from income, whereby she ought to have been freed from the obligation to pay the tax to the extent of the benefit thus received. I do not discern any recognition of this principle in the opinion of this Court in the Barbour case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
