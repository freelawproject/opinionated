Prior to the repeal of the former \u201cgood time\u201d sections, Nos. 710, 711 and 713 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of Title 18, the practice followed in petitioner\u2019s case was uniformly followed under the equally uniform judicial construction of those sections.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Unless, then, the new sections 4161, crediting good time monthly as earned, 4165, limiting forfeiture to earned good time, and 4166, providing for restoration of time forfeited, operate retroactively, the judgment was wrong and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">That they do not so operate, we think is clear. Whether a statute operates retroactively or prospectively is one of legislative intent. In gathering this intent, certain settled rules of statutory construction apply. Some of these are: that a statute should not 'be given retroactive effect where another construction is fairly permissible ; \u201cthat all statutes are to be considered prospective, unless the language is express to the contrary, or there is a necessary implication to that effect.\u201d Fullerton-Krueger Lumber Co. v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co., 266 U.S. 435, 45 S.Ct. 143, 144, 69 L.Ed. 367, and cases cited; that in considering statutes, \u201cThe initial admonition is that laws are not to be considered as applying to cases which arose before their passage unless that intention be clearly declared.\u201d Shwab v. Doyle, 258 U.S. 529, 42 S.Ct. 391, 392, 66 L.Ed. 747, 26 A.L.R. 1454;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that \u201cRetroactivity, even where permissible, is not favored, except upon the clearest mandate.\u201d Claridge Apts. Co. v. C. I. R., 323 U.S. 141, at page 164, 65 S.Ct. 172, at page 185, 89 L.Ed. 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-15\">A further and specific reason against giving the new section retroactive effect is to be found in the. ge'neral savings statute, Title 1 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 109, which provides that no .penalty, forfeiture, or liability incurred under a repealed statute, shall be affected by the repeal, \u201cunless the repealing Act shall so expressly provide\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-16\">Here, as is pointed out in note 3, supra, the repealing act, Sec. 21 of the Act of June 25, 1948, in this instance not only did not so expressly provide, but expressly provided that \u201cany rights or liabilities now existing * * * shall not be affected by this repeal\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-17\">The petition for habeas corpus should have been denied. Petitioner should not \u2022have been released from, but remanded to, custody. The order appealed from is reversed with directions to remand petitioner to the warden\u2019s custody and to dismiss his petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\">. Sentenced to imprisonment for a term of 10 years, appellee, on Oct. 29, 1941, began service of sentence. At the ten days per month rate of commutation for good conduct authorized by Sec. 710, Title 18 \u00dc.S.C.A., the ten-year sentence could be shortened by 1200 days. Pursuant to procedure then followed this credit was .set up. If earned by uninterrupted .good behavior.it would have entitled Hilliard to release on July 15, 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"AIl\">' While serving this sentence in Atlanta Penitentiary Hilliard was r\u00e9ported ' for misconduct with the result that 730 days of the 1200 day credit was forfeited on Feb. 8, \u25a0 1943. \u25a0 Service of this forfeiture began- on- July 15, 1948, when, barring the .forfeiture, he would have become eligible for - discharge, . Service thereof would . have been completed on July 11, 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"A3y\">\u2018 On Sept. 1, 1948, Title 18 U.S.C.A., as amended, went into effect. Sec. 4161 thereof made a significant change from the language of its predecessor (710, Title 18). Without changing the graduated scale of allowances for good conduct, it directs that such allowances are \u2019\u201cto be-credited as earned and computed monthly.\u201d .The companion statute Sec. 4165, Title 18 .(based on former Section 713), provides that for misconduct during service of sentence \u201call or any part of his earned good time' may be forfeited.\u201d This legislation is in contradiction to the former practice whereby the entire earn-able allowance was credited when service of sentence began and forfeiture of the whole or any part thereof (for misconduct) made at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Based upon the amended statute the Bureau of Prisons, Department of Justice, issued regulations to govern computation of sentences and the crediting and forfeiture of good conduct time. These are contained in Manual Bulletin No. 259, dated Oct. 6, <em>1948, </em>and Manual Bulletin No. 264, dated Nov. 15, 1948. These regulations, among other things, prescribe that allowances for good conduct should be rateably allocated to the period of 'actual imprisonment and, further, called for recomputation of sentence in all cases where the forfeiture previously made exceeded the good time which could have been earned up to Sept. 1, 1948. In applying these regulations to Hilliard\u2019s situation Warden Hiatt ascertained that the ten year sentence required no recomputation because- the 730 days forfeited in 1943 were not in excess of the good time earned up to Sept. 1, 1948. Before the forfeiture, with 1200 days good time earnable, Hilliard\u2019s release date was July 15, 1948. From and after the latter date he was serving the forfeited time.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-19\">On or about April 8, 1949, the appellee herein filed a petition for a writ of habeas coi'pus alleging that more good time had been taken from him in Feb., 1943, than was then earned, and that giving effect in his case to Secs. 4161 and 4165, limiting credit and deduction of good time to time earned, he was eligible for, but would not be given, release on April 15, 1949.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-20\">. Sec. 4161, Title 18 (in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-21\">\u201cEach prisoner * * * whose record of conduct shows that he has faithfully observed all the rules and has not been subjected to punishment, shall be entitled to a deduction from the tex-m of his sentence <em>*' * * to be credited as earned and, computed monthly\", </em>etc. (Emphasized part new.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-22\">Note \u2014 Sec. 4161 continues the graduated scale of allowances of its predecessor<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, See. 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Sec. 4165, Title 18.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">\u201cIf during the term of imprisonment a prisoner commits any offense or violates the rules of the institution, all or any part of his earned good time may bo forfeited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">Note \u2014 The Revisers Notes, Title 18, p. 2654, state that section 4165 is based on former section 713, Title 18.
