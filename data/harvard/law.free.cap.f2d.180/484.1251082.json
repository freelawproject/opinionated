The judgment denied further equitable relief, refusing to order the landlord to pay to her tenant the sum of $1100.00 alleged excess rentals charged her tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The court, in denying the equitable relief, held that the premises were not within the Expediter\u2019s jurisdiction for the fixing of this maximum rent because they were additional housing accommodations created by conversion after February 1, 1947, and hence were not controlled housing accommodations within the Housing and Rent Act of 1947,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hereinafter called the Act. Section 202 of that act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-11\">\u201cAs used in this title\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-13\">\u201c(c) The term \u2018controlled housing accommodations\u2019 means housing accommodations in any defense-rental area, except that it does not include\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-14\">\u201c(1) those housing accommodations, in any establishment which is commonly known as a hotel in the community in which it is located, which are occupied by persons who are provided customary hotel services such as maid service, furnishing and laundering of linen, telephone and secretarial or desk service, use and upkeep of furniture and fixtures, and bellboy service; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-15\">\u201c(2) any motor court, or any part thereof; or any tourist home serving transient guests exclusively, or any part thereof; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-16\">\u201c(3) any housing accommodations (A) the construction of which was completed on or after February 1, 1947, or which are additional housing accommodations created by conversion on or after February 1, 1947,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-17\">The grounds of the Expediter\u2019s appeal are (A) the landlord failed to exhaust the administrative remedy prescribed by the Expediter\u2019s regulations and hence could not raise the question of the latter\u2019s control of the premises, and (B) the court erroneously decided that the premises were not under the Expediter\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-18\">A. <em>The landlord, having the option either to seek an administrative ruling as to the Expediter's control of the premises or to wait and defend a suit by the Expediter on the ground of absence of such control, was entitled in this suit in equity to waive the continuance on the administrative proceeding created solely for his benefit and defend on that ground.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-19\">The regulation of the Expediter for this jurisdictional question was promulgated on August 22, 1947, (12 F.R. 5697). Unlike those for other issues under the Act, it gave to the landlord <em>the option to pursue or not to pursue </em>an administrative procedure in determining whether the premises were under the Expediter\u2019s control. Title 24, Part 825.1(b) (8) C.F.R. Cum.Supp. 1947, provides as to \u201cHousing accommodations the construction of which was completed on or after February 1, 1947, or which are additional housing accommodations created by conversion on or after February 1, 1947,\u201d that \u201cEvery landlord of housing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>accommodations referred to in this subparagraph (8) may, <em>at his option, </em>file in the area rent office a report of decontrol on a form provided by the Expediter.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">This option given' the landlord must be deemed to have controlling significance. Up to August 22, 1947, the landlord had no such option, the regulation prior thereto (12 F.R. 4331) being \u201cThat all housing accommodations referred to in this paragraph (8) shall be subject to this regulation unless the landlord files in the area rent office a report of decontrol on a form provided by the Expediter within 30 days after July 1, 1947, or within 30 days after the date of first renting, whichever is the later: and <em>Provided further, </em>That if a landlord fails to file said report of decontrol within the applicable specified period, such housing accommodations shall be and remain subject to the provisions of this regulation until the date on which he files said report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The landlord started to exercise his option. He filed the application for decontrol, which the area rent director denied. He sought a reconsideration by the ar\u00e9a rent director under the advice of the Area Rent Board. The latter advised against decontrol. The area director then sua sponte fixed the rent at $180.00 per .month and ordered the repayment of the $1100.00. An informal appeal from denial of the decontrol was taken to and considered by the \u2018Regional Administrator. While the jurisdictional question was so under consideration the Expediter, - on January 24, 1948, began this suit on the rent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The Emergency Price Control Act of 1942<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> required such an issue of jurisdiction to be decided by the Emergency Court of Appeals after pursuing an administrative procedure provided by the Expediter\u2019s regulations. The district court then had no power to determine that issue. Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 433, 64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834; Woods v. Kaye, 9 Cir., 175 F.2d 886, 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Under the instant Act of 1947, the Expediter agrees, the jurisdictional question ultimately is to be decided by the district court. That is to say, the landlord, having the option under regulation 825.1(b) (8), supra, not to pursue the administrative remedy, could have raised the issue as a defense to the Expediter\u2019s present suit, filed on January 24, 1948, without any other action on the former\u2019s part, or he could pursue his administrative proceeding to the decision of the 'litigating Expediter.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">In this situation the Regional Administrator on February 10, 1948, decided the appeal on the jurisdictional question before 'him adversely to the landlord and advised that the \u201cdecision in this case rests with the court.\u201d This appears in the letter of February 10,, 1948, to the landlord as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">\u201cThis is in further reference to our letter to you dated January 2, 1948.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-11\">\u201cUpon investigation, we find that the proceedings in the area rent office were 'handled in accordance with the Rent Regulations and an interpretation of the regulation by the Regional Rent Attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-12\">\u201cAs suit has now been filed, <em>decision in this case rests zvith the court</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUc\">\u201cYours very truly,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-13\">\u201cWard Cox</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-14\">\u201cRegional Rent Administrator\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At1\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-15\">Nine days after this letter, on February 19, 1948, the landlord -appeared in this action and moved to dismiss it on the ground, inter alia, \u201cThat it does not appear on the face of the 'Complaint that the premises in question fall within the Act Definition \u2018Controlled Housing Accommodations\u2019 as defined in Act and Regulation sued upon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-16\">The motion was denied, and the landlord\u2019s answer then raised the same issue of the Expediter\u2019s jurisdiction. The expediter contended, in effect, that the landlord could not waive his right to continue to pursue his optional choice of obtaining the Expediter\u2019s decision in an administrative proceeding, despite the Regional Administrator\u2019s statement that the administrative process had ceased and the decision rested in the instant proceeding. The district court ruled against the Expediter, holding that the administrative process had terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>and that the issue of decontrol was before it. The Expediter then vigorously contested the 'landlord\u2019s contention that the premises were not under the former\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The Expediter\u2019s briefs here treat the situation as if his regulations gave no option to the landlord. He cites Supreme Court decisions like the Yakus case, supra, stressing the value of regulations created by experts like the Expediter, whose subordinates in the administrative process, skilled in housing needs and requirements can best serve the purposes of Congress in determining rental amounts. Here the exact reverse is the view of the Expediter. He sees no necessity for the administrative process, and creates it only for the benefit of the landlord. One must respect an Expediter\u2019s views on expedition.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">While we cannot agree with the letter of the Regional Administrator that the commencement of this suit deprives the landlord of the right to pursue his administrative remedy, we agree that the decision of the case is with the district court if the landlord waive the further pursuit of his optional administrative remedy and submit to the decision of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Such a disposition of the case facilitates the purpose of Congress for a prompt decision of the rights of both the landlord and tenant. It would be defeating this purpose to follow the suggestion of the Expediter\u2019s brief that \u201cthe defendant might properly have applied to the District Court for a stay of the enforcement action pending completion by her of the prescribed administrative procedure.\u201d Such a stajr would, merely have prolonged the uncertainty of both landlord and tenant. Success of the landlord before the Expediter himself would have caused the dismissal of the Expediter\u2019s suit, hut his more likely adverse decision merely would transfer the jurisdictional issue to that suit. The short and certain expeditious method was to determine that question in this suit and not run the time risk in an adverse decision on the administrative appeal to the Expediter.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">We are fully in accord with our opinion in Babcock v. Koepke, <em>9 </em>Cir., 175 F.2d 923 concerning the necessity of exhausting a <em>prescribed </em>administrative remedy, but in that case the optional right of the landlord did not exist. Before the Babcock proceeding commenced in September, 1948, this optional regulation under the 1947 Act had been omitted in the amendments of April 1, 1948, of the regulations for the 1948 Act. (13 F.R. 1862.) It is well established that one need not proceed with optional administrative processes before seeking relief at law from error of the administrator. Levers v. Anderson, 326 U.S. 219, 233, 66 S.Ct. 72, 90 L.Ed. 26; Tucker v. Alexander, 275 U.S. 228, 231, 48 S.Ct. 45, 72 L.Ed. 253; United States v. Abilene and Southern Ry. Co., 265 U.S. 274, 282, 44 S.Ct. 565, 68 L.Ed. 1016; Prendergast v. New York Tel. Co., 262 U.S. 43, 49, 43 S.Ct. 466, 67 L.Ed. 853. It is elemental that equity abhors the doing of unnecessary acts. The Expediter having invoked equity, we think that the district court\u2019s decision does equity in holding no merit in his claim that the question of decontrol was not before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">B. <em>The landlord\u2019s housing was additional housing accommodations created by conversion after February 1, 1947, within Sec. 202(c) (3) of the Housing and Rent Act of 1947.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">The landlord owned a duplex dwelling building, she living in one and leasing the other. In one unit there were two bedrooms, in the other, one bedroom. Beginning December, 1946, and ending after February 1, 1947, the landlord reconstructed Ihe entire building, tearing out internal partitions, extending the foundations and total area covered by the structure and building up therefrom. The extent of the additions atid alterations offered in evidence to the district court appears in the footnote.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Among other additions, the reconstructed building contained three additional single bedrooms to he rented to individual boarders. On August 1,1947, appellant leased the premises for a \u201cboard and rooming house,\u201d the lease providing: \u201c * * * for the sole purpose of conducting therein a Guest House (specializing in board and room), and the said Lessees hereby agree that they shall conduct such business herein mentioned in an orderly and peaceful manner, strictly within the city ordinances and state laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Upon these facts, the district court found that \u201cthe housing accommodations leased by defendant to Matthews S. Weiser and Helen A. Weiser in July, 1947, are additional accommodations created subsequent to February 1, 1947.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">We agree that the \u201cconversion\u201d of the building is within regulation 825.1(b) 8, that is, it is \u201ca structural change in a residential unit or units involving substantial alterations or remodeling and resulting in the creation of additional housing accommodations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">The court was entitled to infer that a dwelling room is a housing accommodation, and that the addition of three such rooms is an increase in such accommodations. It would be irrational and plainly erroneous and inconsistent with the Act and regulations<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to hold that there is no decontrol if one own a steel building to consist of five stories, of which but two are first constructed to accommodate a family of four people on each floor, and the owner then add three floors above and converts the structure into a single room boarding house accommodating fifty boarding house tenants, each room to be occupied, say, by unmarried returned veterans.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-19\">We do not agree with the suggestion of the Expediter that 'Congress intended in the Act of 1947 to confine the phrase \u201cadditional housing accommodations\u201d to housing accommodating families only. There must then have been at least a million returned veterans attending school or seeking employment away from their homes and housed as individuals.' It is inconceivable that Congress did not then have them in mind. It was not until the Housing and Rent Act of 1949,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in Section 201(c), that Congress amended the Act of 1947 to confine such decontrol to conversion resulting in \u201cadditional self-contained family units as defined by regulations issued by\u201d the Expediter. It is apparent that Congress thought that the huge building activity between 1947 and 1949 lessened the need for individual housing rooms.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-20\">The judgment denying the equitable relief sought by the Expediter is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-20\">. 61 Stat. 193, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7\u00a7 1881-1908.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b542-17\">. 156 Stat. 23, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7\u00a7 901-946.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b543-7\">.
