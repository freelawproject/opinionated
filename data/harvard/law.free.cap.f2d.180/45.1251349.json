S. \u00a7 480 authorizes the Commissioner of Patents to strike from the files a patent application filed by a former employee of the Patent Office, after his resignation, where the idea for the invention was conceived during the employee\u2019s tenure of office, but where there is no suggestion that he has appropriated any materials available to him in the Patent Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-21\">The facts and the pertinent legal considerations are set forth in the opinion of the learned District Judge, reported in Fox v. Kingsland, D.C., 81 F.Supp. 433, 437, answering the stated question in the negative. We wish to quote, in particular, the following passages from that opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-22\">\u201cThe prohibition in \u00a7 4 of Title 35 is specifically against an employe of the Patent Office \u2018during the period for which they hold their appointments\u2019 taking any \u2018right or interest in any <em>patent issued </em>by the office.\u2019 (Emphasis supplied.) The plaintiff has, by his creative ability, developed an interest in an invention \u2014 a conception of an invention \u2014 which, apart from the question as to his rights as an employe of the Patent Office, he might, if a private citizen, assign under \u00a7 44 of T. 35, or which under \u00a7 46 of T. 35, supra, would pass to his heirs at law. This interest, it appears, is clearly in an <em>invention </em>and not in a <em>patent. </em>The fact that the plaintiff drew up his application prior to his removal from the Patent Office payroll but did not then file it with the Patent Office does not change his interest from one in an invention to one in a patent. An executed but unfiled application is only evidence of conception. King v. Young, 100 F.2d 663, 670, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 762. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>\u201cThis Court is not unmindful of the potential danger involved in allowing Patent Office employes to resign and immediately thereafter to file an application for a patent. Whether there should be an express statutory restriction establishing the time which should elapse before ex-employes of the Patent Office may apply for patents is a question for Congressional consideration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">We affirm the judgment of the District Court, which required the Commissioner to restore plaintiff\u2019s application to the files,, on the basis of the opinion of that Court</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
