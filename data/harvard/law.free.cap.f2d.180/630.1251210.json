Exception is taken to the sufficiency of the evidence and to the charge of the court on the question of scienter, but the questions raised are without merit. There is no dispute as to the automobile\u2019s having been stolen or as to its having been transported by appellant in interstate commerce; and we think that the proof was amply sufficient to take the case to the jury on the question of appellant\u2019s guilty knowledge. There was evidence that the automobile was purchased by defendant at an inadequate price; that he had it driven away in the night time from the section in which it was stolen; that the front and rear license tags were different; and that when apprehended appellant told the officers that he was merely a \u201clittle wheel\u201d in the automobile theft ring and that the \u201cbig wheel\u201d was one Allen, the man who had introduced to him the person from whom he claimed to have purchased the stolen car. There were other circumstances, but it is not necessary to go into them here. From those which we have mentioned, there can be no question but that the verdict of the jury was amply justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-21\">There is as little merit in the exception to the charge. The trial judge stressed that the question being tried was whether appellant knew that the car had been stolen; and, when counsel for appellant asked him to charge that circumstances sufficient to put a man on inquiry would not be sufficient, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-22\">\u201cGentlemen of the jury, it may or may not. Facts or circumstances which would put a reasonable person on notice that the car was stolen might be so conclusive that there couldn\u2019t be any possible doubt about his knowing. It might be. I\u2019m not saying that that is the case here. That is for you to determine. That isn\u2019t the criterion however. The criterion is what I have already told you; whether or not the evidence points so conclusively to the guilt of the accused as to exclude every other reasonable hypotheses except his guilt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-23\">When the court had so charged, counsel for appellant said \u201cThank you. That\u2019s correct\u201d. Surely, after this, appellant should not be heard to question the correctness of the charge as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
