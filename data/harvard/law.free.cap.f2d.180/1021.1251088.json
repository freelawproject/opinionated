The points involved were argued at length by able counsel. There was substantial evidence in the record to support the conclusions of the National Labor Relations Board that the petitioners coerced their employees in t'he exercise of rights guaranteed to them by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 157, and discriminated in their employment to the end that membership in the union might be discouraged. The Board\u2019s order is correct in every respect. A decree, in the usual form, enforcing the Board\u2019s order in full may be submitted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
