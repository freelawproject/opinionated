Under this section these employees, through their counsel, implored us to allow them to retain their Union despite all imputations of the illegitimacy of its birth, but the authority to grant that request has been placed in' the National . Labor Relations Board by Congress according to impelling judicial construction, and this Court cannot usurp the functions of the Board as to- the means whereby to purge or prevent unfair labor practices found by the Board under substantial evidence to exist. A union that is conceived in iniquity is denied the privilege of reforming and returning accorded to the vilest sinner under Biblical standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-21\">Nor does time, that heals many wounds and cures many ills, and that generally allows \u201cthe dead past to bury its dead\", serve either to dilute .or to destroy the erstwhile domination, interference, or over-exuberance of an employer in the matter of the formation, <em>support, </em>and control of an independent union. But like the longevity of other evil that men do, interference, domination, and control seem to live even after the perpetrator\u2019s bones have been interred. See N. L. R. B. v. Pennsylvania Greyhound Lines, 303 U.S. 261, 58 S.Ct. 571, 82 L.Ed. 831, 115 A.L.R. 307; N. L. R. B. v. Falk Corporation, 308 U.S. 453, 60 S. Ct. 307, 84 L.Ed. 396; N. L. R. B. v. Southern Bell Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., 319 U.S. 50, 63 S.Ct 905, 87 L.Ed. 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>We cannot say that there is not substantial evidence in the record to support the Board\u2019s findings that in the dawn of this Union, some ten or twelve years ago, the employers took an all-too active part\u2014 not coercively, not threateningly, but by means which, perhaps, more effectively let it be known that it was the pleasure of such employers that the employees should associate themselves with the independent Union which Craig, a highly placed employee, had devised.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">We are not prepared to say that the cacophony of clamorous circumstances which the Board has heard and heeded, and upon which its orders have been predicated, was without substantiality. Whether same was without preponderant weight, contrary to good labor relations, devoid of justice, the aider and abettor of a ruthless raid on this Union by one larger and more powerful, were matters committed to the wisdom and conscience .of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Nor is it within the province of this Court to prescribe an election wherein the name of the independent union shall be on the ballot by which democratic process the employees might select the union of their choice as their bargaining agent. N. L. R. B. v. Falk Corporation, supra; N. L. R. B. v. Southern Bell Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">There appears, however, to have been no employer intimidation or coercion in the formation of this Union for it is quite clear that the men formed it: (a) after talking to the Regional Director in Texas of the N. L. R. B., who advised them that they could do so; (b) after making inquiries as to whether or not they could join one of the transportation unions; (c) and after visiting a meeting of a local union in the A. F. of L.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">The deficiencies in the complaint, of which the Respondents complain, are without merit. We do not believe that it was the intention of Congress to require the strictness of common law pleading in either the charges or the complaint in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Let the order of the Board be enforced in its entirety.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-19\">. Title 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 157 is as follows: \u201cEmployees shall have the right to self-organization, to , form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in * * * concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection\u2019\u2019.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
