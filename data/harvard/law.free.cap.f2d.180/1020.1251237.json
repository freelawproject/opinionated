Appellee has filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the issues presented have heretofore been adjudicated by this court. It appears that the only genuine issue raised on this appeal concerns the sufficiency of the indictment under which appellant was convicted and sentenced upon his plea of guilty. In Taylor v. Squier, 9 Cir., 179 F.2d 640 (rehearing denied February 9, 1950), we held that the indictment sufficiently charged a violation of 26 U.S. C. A. \u00a7 145(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-22\">Appellant contends that this appeal raises other and new issues which were not presented on his former appeals. Taylor here presents lengthy arguments which are a mere repetition of arguments made on previous appeals. They are entirely devoid of merit. They are neither \u201cnew\u201d nor do they present justiciable issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-23\">Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-24\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
