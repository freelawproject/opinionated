A careful examination o'f the record shows conclusively that the petition was without merit and that, in making the determination he did, the district judge proceeded in complete accordance with the mandate of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-7\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"APq\">.
