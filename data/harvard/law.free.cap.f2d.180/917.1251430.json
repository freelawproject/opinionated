HAND, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b974-20\">This is an appeal, by leave of this court, of \u201cPrudence Bonds Corporation (New Corporation)\u201d and Reconstruction Finance Corporation, from an order in bankruptcy, awarding allowances to four sets of attorneys for services performed in the reorganization of the Debtor, Prudence Bonds Corporation, begun in 1934 under \u00a7 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 207. The active appellant is the \u201cNew Corporation,\u201d which was organized to takeover and complete the liquidation of the property ' of the Debtor; the Reconstruction Corporation \u2014 the other appellant \u2014 we shall disregard, for its interests' and- positions are identical with those- of the \u201cNew Corporation.\u201d The allowances were for services rendered in what for convenience \u25a0 we shall call the \u201cConstruction Proceeding,\u201d which we decided in December, 1947, and for the details of which we refer to our reported opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A master made the allowancesin question which the district judge affirmed, and we gave leave to appeal, \u201climited to- the question of conflict of interest represented.\u201d Those series of \u201cPublicly Held-\u2019 Bonds\u201d whose stipulated interest we allowed in, full, so far as the collateral sufficed, we shall call the \u201cSurplus Series\u201d, the other series we shall call the \u201cDeficit Series.\u201d The allowances were awarded out of the -collateral of all the \u201cSurplus Series\u201d, and were allocated roughly in proportion to the amounts by which these series profited by the appeal. The attorneys to whom allowances were awarded were Samuel Silbiger; Arthur Miller; Weil, Gotshai and Manges; and Joseph Nemerov; and the objections are that these attorneys either represented conflicting interests in the \u201cConstruction Proceeding,\u201d or that their clients had violated \u00a7 249 of Chapter X, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 649. Since the facts in the case of Silbiger are different from those in that of Miller, or of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, we will consider the appeals separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Silbiger\u2019s Allowance</p>\n<p id=\"b975-6\">Silbiger was retained in the reorganization by one, Eddy, who held bonds in several \u201cSurplus Series\u201d and even more bonds in several \u201cDeficit Series.\u201d Since the collateral securing each \u201cSurplus Series\u201d was no more than enough to pay that series in full, principal and interest, the result of Silbiger\u2019s appeal in the \u201cConstruction Proceeding\u201d was to take from the \u201cDeficit Series\u201d what the district court had awarded to them and give it and more to the \u201cSurplus Series.\u201d Because Eddy held bonds in both \u201cSurplus\u201d and \u201cDeficit Series,\u201d his individual interest in the \u201cConstruction Proceeding\u201d was conflicting; if the final decision was for the \u201cSurplus Series,\u201d he would receive interest in full upon the bonds which he held in those series, but he would lose any dividend out of the collateral of the \u201cSurplus Series\u201d upon the bonds which he held in the \u201cDeficit Series,\u201d although it does not appear in the record whether on the final balance he would have won or lost, if the decision of the district court had been affirmed. Silbiger swore that he explained the situation to Eddy, who told him to take the position which he did upon the appeal. He maintains he did take it at the hearings before the master and the district court; and, although the \u201cNew Corporation\u201d denies this, and argues that Silbiger\u2019s briefs in the lower court are not plain, the issue is of no importance, and we may assume that from the outset his position was unchanged. We accept the master\u2019s finding as not \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d that he explained to Eddy the \u201crespective rights of the Public Bondholders,\u201d and that Eddy \u201cchose to claim that each Series of bonds must stand on its own feet.\u201d As will appear when we discuss the objections to the allowances of Miller and of Weil, Gotshal and Manges, we think that a creditor who holds conflicting claims in a reorganization is free to file both and select which one he prefers even though its success will be to the detriment of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-8\">Although Silbiger is to be acquitted of any disloyalty to Eddy personally, we cannot say the same as to his two other clients, Mrs. Born and Mrs. Reilly, who held bonds only in \u201cDeficit Series,\u201d and whom Silbiger had represented in proceedings to surcharge the accounts of the \u201cindenture trustees\u201d of those series. These proceedings had resulted in recoveries; but, since they had all been completed before the \u201cConstruction Proceeding\u201d was begun, and since \u2014 as Silbiger argues \u2014 they were suits separate from the reorganization, the first question is whether his relation, as attorney for Mrs. Born or Mrs Reilly, ended with the entry of the final order in each accounting. We hold that it did not. The accountings were part of the reorganization itself; indeed, it was the foundation of our decision in Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. President and Directors of Manhattan Company<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that they were a step in the collection of the Debtor\u2019s assets; and it was only for that reason that they were justiciable in bankruptcy at all over the vigorous protest of the \u201cindenture trustees.\u201d True, it does not necessarily follow, because the accountings were part of the reorganization, that Silbiger\u2019s retainer extended beyond their conclusion; but that was in fact the case. The recoveries from the \u201cindenture trustees\u201d produced a fund to which the bondholders of the \u201cDeficit Series\u201d claimed to be entitled, so far as they were not necessary to pay off the \u201cSurplus Series\u201d and any other prior claims; and the \u201cConstruction Proceeding\u201d was necessary precisely to decide the questions so arising. It is immaterial whether the possibility of a surplus had arisen before or after the accountings had been completed; whenever it did arise, the claim of the \u201cDeficit Series\u201d arose with it, and it would put an unreasonable limit upon the retainer of an attorney for \u201cDeficit Series\u201d bondholders to say that he did not under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>take to collect his clients\u2019 share of whatever the \u201cSurplus Series\u201d and other claimants did not absorb. At the very least, if he wished to take the side of the \u201cSurplus Series,\u201d it was his duty to make sure that the interest of the \u201cDeficit Series\u201d was protected by competent and disinterested persons. Indeed, it is plain that Silbiger himself thought that he continued to represent the \u201cDeficit Series\u201d in the \u201cConstruction Proceeding,\u201d for on pages two and three of his reply brief in this court he argued that, if the interest of a \u201cSurplus Series\u201d were to be limited to the earnings of the collateral the \u201cindenture trustee,\u201d the Manhattan Bank, should nevertheless not receive the surplus, but that it should go to the \u201cDeficit Series.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">He asserts, however, that he explained fully to Mrs. Born and Mrs. Reilly the situation and got leave to- press the claims of the \u201cSurplus Series.\u201d As to Mrs. Reilly, this was certainly not true. She was Eddy\u2019s sister and Eddy acted for her under a power of attorney by virtue of which Silbiger mistakenly supposed that Eddy might do so. In ordinary circumstances that would have been true; but, since Mrs. Reilly held only \u201cDeficit Bonds\u201d and was -certain to lose by the success of the \u201cSurplus Bonds,\u201d Eddy was not in a position to speak for her, for his interest and hers were in conflict. This must have been plain to Silbiger; and, if it was not, it should have been. Mrs. Bom\u2019s husband acted for her; and the master found that Silbiger stated to him \u201chis opinion as to the priority rights of the Public Bondholders in each Series and his intention to advocate such rights on behalf of Mr. Eddy.\u201d Also, that Born accepted the opinion of Silbiger as to the respective \u201crights\u201d of the bondholders, and did not ask him to assert for his wife \u201cany claim to a share in money which did not legally belong to her,\u201d but was satisfied to let him \u201cproceed according to his (Silbiger\u2019s) opinion of what the legal rights of the bondholders were.\u201d If we accept Born\u2019s testimony, he left everything to Silbiger, who did not explain to him the conflict between his wife\u2019s bonds and Eddy\u2019s and, even though Silbiger\u2019s memory be more reliable \u2014 as the master apparently thought \u2014what he told Born was far from definite enough to authorize him to take sides against Mrs. Born. If anything could justify doing so \u2014 which we do not suggest \u2014at least a clear explanation was necessary that, if the \u201cSurplus Series\u201d won, she was sure to lose. For the foregoing reasons we hold that Silbiger\u2019s retainer by Mrs. Born and Mrs. Reilly still bound him to represent them in the \u201cConstruction Proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">But his duty was not confined to these two individuals. When he appeared for any of his three clients in any of the accounting proceedings, he appeared on behalf of all the bondholders of the series concerned in that accounting. That follows from his being paid for his services in each such proceeding out of the pockets of all those bondholders; for it is obvious that he could not lawfully take money from those to whom he had rendered no services.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, Silbiger became the attorney for all bondholders of those \u201cDeficit Series,\u201d in whose accountings he had appeared ; and when he argued the side of the \u201cSurplus Series\u201d in the \u201cConstruction Proceeding,\u201d it conflicted with his duty to all the bondholders of any \u201cDeficit Series.\u201d Thus, the conflict in his duty was not limited to Mrs. Reilly and Mrs. Born, but extended to all bondholders of those \u201cDeficit Series\u201d for which he had at any time appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">Certainly by the beginning of the Seventeenth Century it had become a -common-place that an attorney must not represent opposed interests;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the usual consequence has been that he is debarred from receiving any fee from either, no matter how successful his labors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>the court hear him urge, or let him prove, that in fact the conflict of his loyalties has had no influence upon his conduct; the prohibition is absolute and the consequence is a forfeiture of all pay. Therefore Silbiger must be denied any allowance whatever, unless there is a distinction between a corporate reorganization and an ordinary suit <em>inter partes. </em>We think that there is such a distinction. The purpose of the prohibition is to insure the advantage to the client of the undivided allegiance of his attorney; and in situations in which the client is otherwise adequately protected, and the attorney is not paid in any part by the party whose side he has opposed, the result is inevitably a penalty. It must be confessed that in Loew v. Gillespie, supra,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the 'interests of the city appear to have been protected, and yet Judge Lehman denied the attorney any pay whatever; nevertheless, we think that in a corporate reorganization proceeding it is reasonable not to impose an entire forfeiture of the allowance, when it comes in no part out of any group that can have been prejudiced by the attorney\u2019s divided allegiance. In the case at bar the allowance will come out of the \u201cSurplus Series,\u201d which won all it could; hence the only question is as to possible prejudice to the \u201cDeficit Series.\u201d How far should that effect a penalty? The \u201cNew Corporation\u201d represented the interests of the \u201cDeficit Series\u201d in the \u201cConstruction Proceeding,\u201d and it is at least doubtful whether, if Silbiger had presented the situation to the district court, and asked to be freed of his duties to those series in order to espouse the side of the \u201cSurplus Series,\u201d the judge would have thought it necessary that an attorney should be appointed in addition to him who represented the \u201cNew Corporation.\u201d We agree that Silbiger failed in his duty when he did not present this matter to the court and learn its pleasure; and we agree that for that failure he may not have a full allowance; but we are disposed to make an exception from the usual consequence which imposes forfeiture of all pay. It appears to us an adequate penalty, if we follow the course we took in Berner v. Equitable Office Building Corporation, supra,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> where, although the evidence did not show that Berner, who was also an attorney, had violated \u00a7 249 of the Bankruptcy Act by himself buying any of the Debtor\u2019s shares, he had given information to a relative on which the relative had bought them. How far the penalty should be mitigated, we leave to the district court, although there is authority for our exercising our own discretion in the first instance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We will, lowever, say now \u2014 all the issues having been fully argued \u2014 that we should regard it as an abuse of discretion not to cut the allowance by at least one-third. If the \u201cNew Corporation\u201d wishes, it may go before the district court, and seek a still further cut. We do not wish to indicate that we think a cut of one-third is enough, for we recognize that we are departing from a doctrine that has been applied with great severity. Within the limit we have set, we leave the decision to the district court, although the question must not be referred to a master. If the <em>\u201cNew </em>Corporation\u201d does not wish to press the matter further, the allowance will stand at two-thirds of the sum awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">The Allowances of Miller and of Weil, Gotshal and Manges.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">The objections to the allowances of Miller and of Weil, Gotshal and Manges are the same, and we may consider them as one. The clients of each held no bonds in the Debtor in 1934, when the organization petition was filed, but bought and sold bonds of this series indiscriminately from time to time, as any seemed to them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>to offer opportunities for speculative profit. Miller\u2019s clients always held and traded in more bonds of \u201cSurplus Series\u201d than of \u201cDeficit Series\u201d; Weil, Gotshal and Manges\u2019 clients\u2019 dealings were more in bonds of \u201cDeficit Series.\u201d When the \u201cConstruction Proceeding\u201d began, the clients of both these attorneys retained them to intervene on their behalf in the Fifth Series \u2014 a \u201cSurplus Series\u201d \u2014 ; and before the master, and in the' district court they pressed the claims of these bonds for full interest out of the collateral. \u25a0 When they were unsuccessful in that court, Miller did not appeal, but Weil, Gotshal and Manges did; and the allowances .awarded to both were apportioned against : all \u201cSurplus Series,\u201d as in. the case of Silbiger. The \u201cNew, Corporation\u201d raises two objections to these allowances. First, it argues that, since the clients held bonds in both \u201cSurplus Series\u201d and \u201cDeficit Series,\u201d and filed claims in each, they assumed a fiduciary relation to the creditors in both series, in spite of the conflict between them. \u2022 The attorneys made no effort to ascertain whether such a conflict existed, but they were chargeable with notice that it existed, and by acting for the \u201cSurplus Series\u201d became a party to their clients\u2019 breach of trust. Second, the \u201cNew Corporation\u201d argues that, when their clients retained the attorneys to intervene in the Fifth Series, they became \u201crepresentatives\u201d of all the bonds in that series, and that \u00a7 249 forbade their trading in the bonds of that series upon pain of losing anj right to be reimbursed for their expenses, including the fees of their attorneys. - Miller had an understanding with his clients that they were to pay him for his services, so .far as he was not fully paid by any allowance; although there is no evidence of such' an agreement in the case of Weil, Gotshal and Manges.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">We think it plain that the. first objection is not valid. The creditor of a corporation in reorganization who holds two conflicting claims is warranted in filing both of them in the alternative; for by merely filing them, he does not assume any duty to either of the classes among which his claims are included. To hold otherwise would force him to choose at his peril which claim should win and forfeit the other if he turned out to be wrong; we can conceive of no reason which should put him in such a predicament. Moreover, after he has decided which one of his claims offers- him the larger dividend, we' can equally see no reason- why he should not press that claim to a successful issue at the expense of the other claim. True, in .so doing he assumes a fiduciary duty towards the members of the class whose position he adopts as his own; but he does not do so as to the members of the other-class. Therefore, the clients of Miller, and of Weil, Gotshal and Manges assumed no duty to the bonds of any \u201cDeficit Series\u201d; and in' consequence their attorneys may be paid by allowances out of the \u201cSurplus Series.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Although the second objection of the \u201cNew Corporation\u201d is more plausible, we think that it too is not valid. So far as the second sentence of \u00a7 249 is directed against any \u201ccommittee or attorney\u201d who trades in securities of the corporation, it does not cover the case at bar, because the clients were not members of any \u201ccommittee,\u201d and the attorneys did not themselves trade in the bonds. If the clients were within the section at all, it was' because they were \u201cacting * * * in a representative or fiduciary capacity,\u201d \u201cother\u201d than as a \u201ccommittee\u201d; and, sincq, by retaining attorneys to press their claims in the Fifth Series, they did assume some sort of \u201cfiduciary\u201d relation towards all the bondholders of that series, we will assume for argument, that they acted \u201cin a representative or fiduciary capacity\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 249. However, although upon that assumption the clients lost any right to compensation or reimbursement, we see no reason why their disability should extend to their attorneys, even though we assume \u2014 what is certainly open to debate \u2014 that an attorney is charged with notice when his client trades in securities of the corporation. Judge Coleman has decided that the disability is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>so extended,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and we agree. The section does not expressly impute any fault to the attorney for his client\u2019s misconduct\u2014 assuming that that is not too strong a word. It only declares what his own disability shall be, if on his own account he buys and sells. To charge him with his client\u2019s dealings would compel him, at the risk of losing all his labor, either to keep an eye upon those dealings (which in practice would be so irritating as to imperil the continuance of their relations); or blindly to put any right to be paid at his client\u2019s mercy. Attorneys repeatedly accept retainers in such cases in reliance upon the allowances they will get from the courts, and no doubt often from clients of whose financial responsibility they are not sure. Why should they be compelled to run the chance that the client, over whom they can exercise no control, may find it profitable to speculate in the corporation\u2019s securities? Indeed that speculation is in itself one to which Congress attached no further disability than the loss of compensation or reimbursement, which is a far milder consequence than attends the breach of full-fledged fiduciary duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">On the other hand, we will not foreclose the possibility that there may be recourse against the client if he has agreed, as Miller\u2019s client did, to pay the attorney so far as the attorney\u2019s allowance does not do so.10 Were no such recourse available, the result would be that the client would secure the services of that attorney at the expense of those who pay the allowance; and it would follow that the client benefited by the amount he would have paid the attorney, if the attorney were denied any allowance, less so much of the allowance as is in fact deducted from the client\u2019s dividend. Assuming that the client is a \u201cperson in a representative or fiduciary capacity,\u201d and assuming that that result is within the words, \u201creimbursement for costs and expenses incurred,\u201d perhaps it would be proper to deduct the amount we have mentioned from the client\u2019s dividends, so far as these will suffice; and, so far as they will not, to proceed against the client by subrogation of the attorney\u2019s claim, if any, against him. Upon these possibilities we do not pass, for the clients are not parties to this proceeding and have not been heard. The allowances to Miller and that to Weil, Gotshal and Manges were proper and should be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">Nemerov\u2019s Allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">The leave to appeal was \u201climited to the question of conflict of interest represented\u201d; and the \u201cNew Corporation\u201d concedes that Nemerov did not \u201cserve conflicting interests.\u201d Hence, although it is hard to see why he should have been entitled to this largesse, we have no jurisdiction over his allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">The disbursements on this appeal of Miller and those of Weil, Gotshal and Manges will be allowed; so far as any disbursements were occasioned by the appeal from Silbiger\u2019s allowance, the \u201cNew Corporation\u201d may collect them out of his allowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">Order modified; and cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b974-21\">.
