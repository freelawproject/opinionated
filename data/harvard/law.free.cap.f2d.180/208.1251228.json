I therefore request that the usual procedure be instituted making the present beneficiary Miss Mary Elizabeth Reeves \u2014 (my Sister) the recipient in the event anything happens to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-24\">On two previous occasions the decedent had changed the beneficiary in this same policy by the execution of \u201cChange of Beneficiary\u201d forms which he transmitted to the insurance company. After forwarding decedent\u2019s letter of January 7, 1946, to the company\u2019s home office, the agent wrote decedent that he was \u201cordering the -beneficiary forms for change to your sister, as per your request.\u201d On January 16, 1946, the agent\u2019s secretary wrote decedent enclosing a 'beneficiary form \u201crecently requested,\u201d and instructed decedent: \u201cIf this is in accordance with your wishes please sign both copies as indicated, having your signature witnessed, and -return -both to us. After certification at the Home Office the duplicate will be sent to you to be attached to the policy.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The forms were never signed by decedent and were retained in his possession until his death by accident on April 11, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Appellant contends that the letter of January 7, 1946, automatically constitutes the designation required under the policy and that its forwarding to the Home Office was the filing required. The District Court held that decedent\u2019s wife was still the duly designated beneficiary of the policy at the time of decedent\u2019s death <em>and rendered </em>judgment in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Under Ohio law, controlling here, where the insured has the unconditional right to change the beneficiary, a change may be effected even if the provisions of the policy setting forth the manner of effecting the change are not complied with exactly. Atkinson v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 114 Ohio St. 109, 150 N.E. 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">But it must appear (1) that the insured had determined to change the beneficiary and (2) that he had done everything to the \u25a0best of his ability to effect the change. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada v. Secoy, D.C., 72 F.Supp. 83; Union Central Life Ins. Co. v. Macbrair, 66 Ohio App. 144, 31 N.E.2d 172; Glen v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 73 Ohio App. 452, 56 N.E.2d 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Tested by these rules, the judgment of the District Court must be affirmed. Decedent\u2019s letter of January 7, 1946, did not constitute an unequivocal designation of change of beneficiary. It merely embodied a request to institute the usual procedure for change of 'beneficiary, with which the decedent was familiar, namely, the sending and -receipt of the beneficiary forms, their execution, and their filing in the home office. The decedent was an educated man, an assistant professor of medicine at Ohio State University, and no doubt understood the meaning of the words he used when he deliberately requested the agent to institute \u201cthe usual procedure.\u201d The forms were sent, received, but never executed, and the contemplated change was not effected. Decedent failed to do all that he could to effectuate the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Appellant contends that the judgment of the District Court is contrary to the holding of this court in Schwerdtfeger v. American United Life Ins. Co., 6 Cir., 165 F.2d 928. There, however, the insured had signed a formal insurance company application designating his daughters as beneficiaries. The evidence of the insured\u2019s determination to make the change was complete. Fie did the exact thing that the decedent here failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
