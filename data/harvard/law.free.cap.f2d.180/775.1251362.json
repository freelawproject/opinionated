Four counts related to one female, three to another. Here, on appeal from the judgment and sentence, she complains as to: (1) joinder of offenses; (2) refusal of the court to direct acquittal on all counts for insufficient proof; (3) admission of evidence as to conditions at her house when she was arrested; (4) presence of government employees and women on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-26\">We think there is no merit to any point raised. 1. The offenses charged in the several counts were of the same character, therefore, joinder was permissible. Rule 8(a), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C.A. Failure to object to the joinder before trial constituted a waiver. Rule 12(b) (2), Federal Rules of Crim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>inal Procedure. \u25a0 2. The record reve\u00e1is ample evidence to justify submission of the seven counts to the jury. 3. Evidence of conditions at appellant\u2019s \u25a0 house (details omitted here) at the time of her arrest, which established presence of the two women referred to in the indictment, was competent and relevant in proof of an element of each offense, i. e., their \u201cengagement\u201d in prostitution. 4. Government employees \u2022and women are legally qualified for' jury .service. As to government employees, see: D.C.Code (1940) \u00a7 11 \u2014 1420; U. S. v. Woods, 1936, 299 U.S. 123, 57 S.Ct. 177, 81 L.Ed. 78; Frazier v. U. S., 1947, 82 U.S.App.D.C. 332, 163 F.2d 817, affirmed 1948, 335 U.S. 497, 69 S.Ct. 201, 93 L.Ed. 187. As to women jurors, see: DJC.Code (1940) \u00a7 11 \u2014 1418. Bias was not to be implied as to either class of. jurors. Bias in fact was not shown as to any juror. So far as appears from the record, the panel fulfilled constitutional requirements of an impartial jury. United States Constitution, Sixth Amendment. See above cases. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
