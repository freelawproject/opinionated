HAND, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b545-25\">This is an appeal by an alien from an order dismissing a writ of habeas corpus to release him from custody under an order of deportation. The question involved is the extent to which the district court has power to review the exercise of a discretion of the Attorney General, conferred upon him by the Immigration Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The facts are as follows. Kaloudis, the relator, is a Greek merchant seaman who entered the United States on April 22, 1944, for shore leave only, not to exceed twenty-nine days. Nevertheless, he obtained extensions of time until 1946, when his application for further leave was denied, as he was informed by letter on July 3, 1946. He was, however, allowed to make a voluntary departure on or before October 1st,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> instead of which on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>September 21, 1946, he married a citizen, and they have now had a child, born on June 18, 1949. Having refused to avail himself of the privilege of voluntary departure, deportation proceedings were started against him on May 9, 1947, upon the ground that he had remained in the United States longer than was permitted by law; and the presiding inspector found that he was a deportable alien for that reason. Although the inspector also found that deportation would result in \u201cserious economic detriment\u201d to his wife and child, and that he was therefore eligible for a suspension of deportation under the statute,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he recommended that no suspension should be granted. The Commissioner adopted this recommendation on June 2, 1949; and the alien appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which on July 20, 1940, dismissed the appeal and affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s order. The Board gave, as its reason for refusing \u2022 a suspension, that \u201cthe alien was a member of an organization appearing on the proscribed list issued by the Attorney General, the International Workers Order.\u201d Although the record does not expressly say so, we shall dispose of the writ on the assumption that the Board refused to grant the relator any hearing as to whether the activities of the \u201cOrder\u201d were in any way inimical to the interests of the United States. Further, in spite of the Board\u2019s statement that its decision was upon \u201call of the evidence upon record,\u201d we shall also assume that its action was based only upon the relator\u2019s membership in the \u201cOrder\u201d; with which he had severed his connection at the time of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"> The interest which an alien has in continued residence in this country is' protected only so far as Congress may choose to protect it; Congress may direct that all shall go back, or that some shall go back and some may stay; and it may distinguish between the two by such tests as it thinks appropriate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The relator does not challenge the test here applied, so far as concerns the deportation order itself; he agrees that, so far as his interest in residing in this country was protected by statute \u2014 in so far as it was \u201ca legally protected interest\u201d \u2014 it had been forfeited. His position is that, being concededly eligible for suspension of deportation, he was entitled to the exercise of the Attorney General\u2019s discretion, and that it appears that this has not been in fact exercised in accordance with the limitations, which must be assumed to confine it. Unless he is to be permitted a hearing to show that it has not been so exercised, he says that he will be denied \u201cdue process of law.\u201d It does not appear from the record that the Attorney General \u2014 through the Board, his delegate \u2014has exercised his discretion in disregard of any implied limitations. We will assume <em>arguendo </em>that the edntrary might appear: <em>i. e., </em>that the reason given might be so clearly irrelevant that a court could say that the Attorney General had transgressed the statute. Suppose, for example, that he denied suspension because the alien had-become too addicted to attending baseball games, or had bad table manners.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But membership, even past membership, in an organization which the Attorney General has \u201cproscribed\u201d may make an alien\u2019s continued residence prejudicial to the public weal. True, without an inquiry we cannot know whether membership in the \u201cOrder\u201d is prejudicial; for we cannot tell whether the Attorney General had adequate grounds for \u201cproscribing\u201d it. On the other hand we cannot say that he did not; and, if the relator has the privilege of inquiring into the grounds, he has been wronged, and the writ should have gone. An alien has no such privilege; unless the ground stated is on its face insufficient, he must accept the decision, for it was made in the \u201cexercise of discretion,\u201d which we have again and again declared that we will not review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Nor has the relator any constitutional right to demand that we should. As we have said, any \u201clegally protected interest\u201d he ever had has been forfeited by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u201cdue process of law\u201d; forfeited as completely as a conviction of crime forfeits the liberty of the accused, be he citizen or alien. The power of the Attorney General to suspend deportation is a dispensing power, like a judge\u2019s power to suspend the execution of a sentence, or the President\u2019s to pardon a convict. It is a matter of grace, over which courts have no review, unless'\u2014 as we are assuming \u2014 it affirmatively appears that the denial has been actuated by considerations that Congress could not have intended to make relevant. It is by no means true that \u201cdue process of law\u201d inevitably involves an eventual resort to courts, no matter what may be the interest at stake; not every governmental action is subject to review by judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-16\">. \u00a7155(c) (2) (a), Title 8 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b545-26\">. \u00a7 155(c) (1), Title 8 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b546-5\">. \u00a7 155(c) (2), Title 8 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b546-6\">.
