Because of failure to file such agreement the referee in bankruptcy .held that the local statute, N.Y. Personal Property Law, Mc.K. ConsoLLaws, c. 41, \u00a7 65, invalidated the reservation of title, and the district court confirmed the referee\u2019s order. The decision is \u2019 affirmed on the authority of Empire State Chair Co., Inc. v. Beldock, 2 Cir., 140 F.2d 587, certiorari denied 322 U.S. 760, 64 S.Ct. 1278, 88 L.Ed. 1587. The appellant\u2019s attempt to distinguish the Beldock case because there the unfiled portion of the contract was a description of the goods while here it was a specification' of tie price and terms of payment, furnishes n\u00f3 rational basis for distinction. The statute requires \u201cthe contract or copy thereof\u201d to be filed for record. We cannot doubt that the failure to file so substantial a part of the contract as gives notice of the price and terms of payment is a fatal defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The appellant argues at length that the trustee has failed to prove that' all creditors of the bankrupt lacked notice of the conditional vendor\u2019s title. So to argue misconceives the nature of the trustee\u2019s status under section 70, sub. c, the \u201cstrong-arm clause\u201d of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 110, sub. c. That section, as has been repeatedly held, confers the status of an ideal lien . creditor on the trustee, whether such a creditor exists or not. Accordingly, it makes no difference to the trustee\u2019s claim of title that any or all <em>actual </em>creditors had notice of the conditional vendor\u2019s title. The trustee by operation of law has the status of a creditor without notice and need make no showing as -to lack of notice on the part of actual creditors. See 4 Collier on Bankruptcy, \u00a7 70.53 and cases there cited. Intimations that proof as to lack of notice was relevant, which appear in In re Master Knitting Corp., 2 Cir., 7 F.2d 11, at page 12, and White v. Steinman, 2 Cir., 120 F.2d 799 at page 803, certiorari, denied 314 U.S. \u25a0659, 62 S.Ct. 113, 86 L.Ed. 528 are disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
