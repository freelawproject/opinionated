The question presented is whether petitioner\u2019s excess profits tax for 1942 was correctly computed by the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-27\">Petitioner\u2019s excess profits tax for 1942 was a tax equal to whichever of the following amounts was the lesser: (A) 90% of petitioner\u2019s adjusted excess profits net income for 1942, or (B) an amount which, when added to petitioner\u2019s income tax<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (normal and surtax) for 1942, equaled 80% of petitioner\u2019s corporation surtax net income for 1942, computed under 26 U.S.C.A.

Petitioner\u2019s gross income for 1942 included income from long-term contracts \u2014 contracts the performance of which required more than 12 months. Petitioner was entitled to- elect, and did elect, in its excess profits tax return for 1942, for the purposes of that tax, to compute its income from long-term contracts upon the percentage of completion method of accounting provided by 26 U.S. C.A.Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 736(b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For all other purposes, petitioner\u2019s income from long-term contracts was computed upon the completed contract method of 'accounting, that being the method regularly employed in keeping petitioner\u2019s books of account.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-15\">In computing petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 710(a) (1) (B) corporation surtax net income for 1942, the Tax Court computed petitioner\u2019s income from long-term contracts upon the percentage of completion method of accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-16\">Petitioner contends that, in computing its \u00a7 710(a) (1) (B) corporation surtax net income for 1942, its income from long-term contracts should have been computed upon the completed contract method of accounting \u2014 a contention based on the following language of \u00a7 710(a) (1) (B) : \u201c * * * the corporation surtax net income, computed under section IS * * * but without regard to the credit provided in section 26(e) * * <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-17\">Respondent contends that, in computing petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 710(a) (1) (B) corporation surtax net income for 1942, petitioner\u2019s income from long-term contracts was properly computed upon the percentage of completion method of accounting \u2014 a contention based on \u00a7 736(b) and a regulation prescribed thereunder (\u00a7 35.736(b)-3 of Treasury Regulations 112).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-18\">Petitioner\u2019s actual corporation surtax net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>income for 1942 \u2014 the corporation surtax net income upon which its surtax for 1942 was imposed \u2014 differed from its \u00a7 710(a) (1) (B) corporation surtax net income for 1942, in that its actual corporation surtax net income for 1942 was required by \u00a7 15 to be -computed under \u00a7 15, including that part of \u00a7 15 which allowed the credit provided in \u00a7 26(e),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> whereas its \u00a7 710(a) (1) (B) corporation surtax net income for 1942 was required by \u00a7 710(a) (1) (B) to be computed under \u00a7 15, but without regard to the credit provided in \u00a7 26(e).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There was no other difference between petitioner\u2019s actual corporation surtax net income for 1942 -and its \u00a7 710(a) (1) (B) corporation surtax net income for 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">As indicated above, the Tax Court, in computing amount (B), had to compute, and did compute, petitioner\u2019s income tax (normal and surtax) for 1942, In computing petitioner\u2019s surtax for 1942, the Tax Court had to compute, and did compute, petitioner\u2019s actual corporation surtax net income for 1942. In computing petitioner\u2019s actual corporation surtax net income for 1942, the Tax Court computed petitioner\u2019s income from long-term contracts upon the completed -contract method of accounting. Petitioner and respondent agree that this was a proper computation.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">It follows that, in computing petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 710(a) (1) (B) corporation surtax net income for 1942, its income from long-term contracts should have been computed upon the completed contract method of accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Section 736(b) did not authorize petitioner to elect, for the purpose of -computing its \u00a7 710(a) (1) (B) -corporation surtax net income, to compute its income from long-term contracts upon the percentage of completion method of accounting, nor did petitioner make any such election. Petitioner\u2019s election under \u00a7 736(b) applied to the computation required by \u00a7 710(a) (1) (A) . It did not apply to any of the computations required by \u00a7 710(a) (1) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Section 35.736(b)-3 of Treasury Regulations 112, in so far1 as it provided that \u00a7 710(a) (1) (B) corporation surtax net income should \u201cbe determined by computing the income from long-term contracts upon the percentage of completion method of accounting,\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> was inconsistent with \u00a7 710 (a) (1) (B) and hence was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">Amount (B), as computed by the Tax 'Court, was greater than amount (A). -Consequently petitioner\u2019s excess profits tax for 1942, as computed by the Tax Court, was a tax equal to amount (A).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">Because of the failure to- compute petitioner\u2019s income from long-term contracts upon the completed contract method of accounting, the Tax Court\u2019s computation of petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 710(a) (1) (B) corporation surtax net income for 1942 w-as incorrect. Consequently its computation of amount (B) was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-15\">Amount (B), properly computed, was less than amount (A). Consequently petitioner\u2019s excess profits tax for 1942, properly computed, was a tax equal to amount (B), properly computed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-16\">It follows that the Tax Court\u2019s computation of petitioner\u2019s excess profits tax for 1942 was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-17\">The decision is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Tax -Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b337-15\">.
