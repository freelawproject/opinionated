The defendants moved<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to dismiss the action because the corporation had never done enough business in the Southern District of New York to become \u201cpresent\u201d there for purposes of a suit <em>in personam, </em>and because the treasurer was not a resident. In support of this motion the defendants showed that the only business, ever done in New York by either defendant, was one trip of the treasurer to that city for a day and a half, during which he had called upon four prospective customers and showed them the little gadget, which the corporation makes and sells. He made no contracts and secured no more from those whom he interviewed than a promise to \u201cdiscuss\u201d the matter \u201cwith their buying departments.\u201d The judge did not dismiss the action, but, <em>sua sponte, </em>transferred it to the District of Minnesota, Fourth Division, by virtue of the power conferred under \u00a7 1406(a) of the Judicial Code.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff has appealed, and has filed a petition for a <em>mandamus </em>to compel the judge to revoke this -transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The infirmities of the appeal are exceeded only by the hardihood of the plaintiff in taking it. It has never been \u25a0suggested in any court at any place or at any time, so far as we are aware, that a -corporation becomes \u201cpresent\u201d so as to be subject to suit <em>in personam, </em>unless it has pursued some more or less \u201ccontinuous\u201d activity within the jurisdiction. The single excursion of the treasurer was utterly insufficient to give the district court any power to proceed against it; and the action has abated against the treasurer personally, because of failure to serve him within three months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> True, the defendants did not ask for a transfer under \u00a7 1406(a); but for a dismissal. However, the plaintiff cannot complain because he has not suffered the dismissal which he so richly deserved. If he is not content with the favor of an opportunity to try his case in Minnesota, he has only to consent to a dismissal under the Rule,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the defendants have not yet answered. A transfer under \u00a7 1406(a) did not depend upon the inconvenience of trying the action where it has been brought; it presupposed that the judge shall transfer the action, because it has been brought in the wrong place. Whether we should have any jurisdiction, either by appeal, or by <em>mandamus, </em>to review such an order, we need not decide. We dismiss the appeal and deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">As for the appeal from the denial of the motion for a temporary injunction, the judge had of course no alternative but to refuse to decide it, and his order will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Appeal from the order of the transfer dismissed; petition for <em>mandamus </em>denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Order denying motion for temporary injunction affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-16\">.
