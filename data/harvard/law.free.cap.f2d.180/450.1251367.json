For the purposes of the Nationality Act <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a \u201cnational of the United States\u201d is either a \u201ccitizen\u201d or \u201ca person who, though not a citizen * * * owes permanent allegiance to the United States.\u201d The word \u201cdoes not include an alien.\u201d The word \u201calien\u201d in the Immigration Act means \u201cnot a native-born or naturalized citizen\u201d; <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and presumably that is its meaning in the Nationality Act. In any event the relator is an alien and an alien is not a \u201cnational of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-31\">Second: The order, deporting the relator, was signed by the Chairman of the Board of Immigration Appeals on May 31, 1945; the second warrant issued on June 21, 1945. The order finally disposed of the proceeding; if this was on an incomplete record, the relator has not suggested anything which he could add that would be relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-32\">Third: The offence of which the relator was found guilty<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> subjected him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>to deportation;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the statute makes the conviction the occasion for deportation, not the commission of the crime charged. Even were we to assume that it would be an answer if the court had had no jurisdiction over the crime, still the irregularity of the grand jury \u2014 the only jurisdictional defect asserted \u2014 did not affect and could not affect, the court\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Fourth: There were no relevant issues of fact to be tried at the hearing on the traverse to the writ; and all the \u201coffers of proof\u201d were therefore properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Fifth: This objection is identical with the Fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-19\">. \u00a7 501, chapter XI, Title 8 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b506-20\">. \u00a7 173, Chapter VI, Title 8 U.S.C.A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b506-34\">. \u00a7 233, Title 22 U.S.C.A.
