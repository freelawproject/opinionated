The order of the court was based upon a finding by the judge that the order of the Immigration Inspector was not supported by substantial evidence. We think that the finding of the judge was unquestionably correct; and it therefore becomes unnecessary to decide whether the order of the Immigration Inspector was not void on the additional ground that there was failure to comply with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, which would seem to be applicable under the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 70 S.Ct. 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
