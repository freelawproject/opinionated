It was stipulated that the Board\u2019s Exhibit 7 contained a list of all employees of the respondent on the date in question. This list contains the names of seventy-five employees, of which it was stipulated that five were supervisory employees and nine were clerical and office employees. After deducting fourteen from the list there remained sixty-one employees named on the list, but it is observed that the name of Mrs. J. C. Lewis is included \u2022in the sixty-one names. Mrs. Lewis was then Vice-President of the Company and until March 11 of the year in question had been its President. Oviously her name should be excluded from the list of the employees in the bargaining unit. Of the sixty names remaining on the list it is noted that three employees are listed as \u201cshop foreman\u201d. This exhibit, put in evidence by stipulation of the parties, seems to constitute an admission that these men were what the term \u201cforeman\u201d ordinarily implies and without more should be characterized as supervisory employees. It is noted that neither of them signed any application for membership in the Union and we think that the stipulation showing these three men with the classification of \u201cshop foreman\u201d supported the Trial Examiner\u2019s and the Board\u2019s conclusion that the total number of employees eligible for inclusion in the unit was less than sixty and, therefore, thirty constituted a majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Let the order of the Board be enforced in its entirety.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
