Standards Act of 1938, as amended, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 201-219. The claims sought to be enforced were those of Glenn O. Prickett, H. F. Winans, S. E. Whitney, Luther M. Walters, Samuel D. Tinker, Frank Hemminger, Oliver H. Raftery, Fred M. Koehler, Charles R. Cobb and Charles E. Smith-Sanford. Prickett, Win-ans and Whitney brought the action \u201con behalf of themselves and all other employees similarly situated.\u201d Walters, Tinker, Hemminger, Raftery, Koehler, Cobb and Smith-Sanford claimed to be \u201cemployees similarly situated.\u201d They were not specifically named as parties plaintiff in the original complaint, but were so named in an amended complaint filed on April 6, 1949.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-19\">On May 23, 1949, appellee made (1) a motion \u201cTo dismiss the amended complaint and the pending action in its entirety\u201d and (2) an alternative motion \u201cTo dismiss the amended complaint and pending action to the extent that it purports to assert claims on behalf of [Walters, Tinker, Hemminger, Raftery, Koehler, Cobb and Smith-Sanford].\u201d Thus the first motion was one to dismiss the action in its entirety, and the second (alternative) motion was one to dismiss the action as to Walters, Tinker, Hemminger, Raftery, Koehler, Cobb and Smith-Sanford.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-20\">The first appeal was taken on June 22, 1949. It purports to be an appeal by Walters, Tinker, Hemminger, Raftery, Koehler, Cobb and Smith-Sanford \u201cfrom the judgment of dismissal as to each of them, entered in this action on May 23rd, 1949.\u201d There was no such judgment. The first appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>On September 8, 1949, the District Court entered an order the pertinent parts of which were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">\u201cIt is ordered and adjudged, that the motion to dismiss certain claimants named in the amended complaint is hereby granted as to the following named claimants, to wit: [Walters, Tinker, Hemminger, Raftery, Koehler, Cobb and Smith-Sanford],</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">\u201cIt is further ordered and adjudged, that the motion to dismiss the amended complaint as to [Prickett, Winans and Whitney] is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Thus, in effect, the order of September 8, 1949, denied the motion to dismiss the action in its entirety and granted the motion to dismiss the action as to Walters, Tinker, Hemminger, Raftery, Koehler, Cobb and Smith-Sanford.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The second appeal was taken on September 8, 1949. It purports to be an appeal by all the plaintiffs \u201cfrom that portion of the order of * * * September 8, 1949, which dismisses the claims of [Walters, Tinker, Hemminger, Raftery, Koehler, Cobb and Smith-Sanford].\u201d The order of September 8, 1949, did not contain any such \u201cportion.\u201d It did not dismiss the claims of Walters, Tinker, Hemminger, Raftery, Koehler, Cobb and Smith-Sanford, nor did it dismiss the action as to them. It merely granted a motion to dismiss the action as to them. Such an order is not a final decision, within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.A \u00a7 1291, and is not appealable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-14\">No final judgment having been entered, the action is still pending as to all the plaintiffs. However, the District Court may hereafter direct the entry of a final judgment \u2014 a judgment which will be a final decision, within the meaning of \u00a7 1291, and hence will be appealable \u2014 dismissing the action as to Walters, Tinker, Hemminger, Raftery, Koehler, Cobb and Smith-Sanford, without dismissing it as to Prickett, Winans and Whitney. This -can be done by following Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as amended, effective March 19, 1948, 28 U.S.C.A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Whether it can be done without following Rule 54(b), as amended, we need not and do not now decide.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-15\">Because the order of September 8, 1949, did not contain the \u201cportion\u201d from which the second appeal was purportedly taken, and because that order was not a final decision, within the meaning of \u00a7 1291, and was not appealable, the second appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b65-10\">.
