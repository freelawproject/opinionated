Ser. P. 2729, and the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States in Commissioner v. Church\u2019s Estate, 335 U.S. 632, 69 S.Ct. 322; Estate of Spiegel v. Commissioner, 335 U.S. 701, 69 S.Ct. 301\",</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">And it appearing that the granting of such motion would be superfluous and unnecessary, since the judgment of this court did not direct the entry of judgment for appellant but merely reversed the judgment of the District Court on the law as it then stood, and the mandate of this court \u201ccommanded that such further proceedings be had in said cause, in conformity with the aforesaid judgment of this court, as according to right and justice, and the laws of the United States, ought to be had, the said appeal notwithstanding\u201d, thereby leaving the District Court free to consider the applicability of a supervening Act of Congress before entering a final judgment upon remand,</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Now, therefore, without determining whether this court has power to recall its mandate issued at a prior term of court, it is ordered that the motion for recall of mandate be, and the same is hereby, denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
