It appears from the complaint that the act complained of was done under judicial authority.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-21\">Plaintiff is here insisting that in so ruling the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-22\">Appellees, urging that it did not, insist that, whether it was properly dismissed on the merits, it was certainly properly dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-23\">We agree with appellees that no case for federal jurisdiction was made out and that the judgment of dismissal should be affirmed, not upon the merits but for want of federal jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
