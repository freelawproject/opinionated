Accordingly it <em>held </em>that the proceeds in <em>question </em>form a part of the gross estate. It rejected as unfounded the taxpayer\u2019s contention, again urged here, that there was an oral agreement between the decedent and his wife to change the community insurance to separate property. We think these findings and conclusions are supported by the record. Apart from the contention predicated on the supposed oral agreement the result must be the same in view of the finding that at the time of his death the decedent had incidents of ownership in all of the policies exercisible either alone or in conjunction with his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">The reasons for these views are adequately developed in the brief opinion rendered by the trial court <em>on taxpayer\u2019s </em>motion to amend the findings and judgment. 87 F. Supp. 982. With this opinion wc are in full accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
