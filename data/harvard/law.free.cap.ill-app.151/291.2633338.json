Eight days later it is said the car reached Streator, Illinois, on its way eastward. Before the car reached Streator and on September 5, 1903, the plaintiff went to the office of the commercial agent of the defendant at Los Angeles and signed an order, which is in evidence and is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-6\" pgmap=\"328\">\u201cSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RAILWAY COMPANY.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-7\" pgmap=\"328\">Request for Changes in Shipping Instructions or Delivery Without Surrender of Original Bill of Lading.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-8\" pgmap=\"328\">Santa Fe.</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-9\" pgmap=\"328\">------ 9\u20145--1903.</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-10\" pgmap=\"328\">Southern California Railway Company.</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-11\" pgmap=\"328\">Dear Sir:\u2014</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-12\" pgmap=\"328\">On the 29th day of August, 1903, car No. 4656, initial S.

These telegrams were sent September 5, 1903. The telegram was received by the agent of defendant at Chicago, but the copy sent to the agent at Streator, whose business it was to see to the diversion, was not received at all, and this agent knew nothing of it until the car had passed Streator and was on its way to New Tork, where it arrived in due time in accordance with the original shipping directions given when the fruit was delivered to the defendant for shipment. The plaintiff seeks to recover for the alleged difference between the value of the goods in sound condition at Chicago, the place to which they were ordered to be delivered, at the time when they should have reached that place and the value of the goods at New Tork, the place to which they were shipped. The case was tried in the Municipal Court before a jury and a verdict returned in favor of the plaintiff. Judgment was entered in plaintiff\u2019s favor for $220.55, from which this appeal is prosecuted.</p><attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b330-5\" pgmap=\"330\">Egbert Dunlap, Lee F.

It appears that under sections 2174-5-6 of the California civil code a common carrier is permitted to limit its liability by special contract for ordinary negligence. That there was an effort made in good faith to \u201cendeavor to accomplish\u201d the transfer is, we think, apparent from the evidence. One copy of the telegram directing the transfer reached the agent in Chicago in due time. The duplicate copy attempted to be sent to the agent at Streator failed to reach its intended destination; but so far as appears the same effort was made and purpose shown to send it as in the ease of the copy which reached the Chicago agent. The effort having been made in good faith to endeavor to accomplish the diversion of the car as requested by the plaintiff, the question is whether these agreements made in California, and valid under the provisions of the civil code of that State, are enforceable in the case at bar in this State. . The sections of the California civil code referred to have been considered by the Supreme Court of that State. Among such cases are Michalitschke v. Wells Fargo &amp; Co., 118 Cal. 683-689; Coit v. Western Union Tel. Co., 130 Cal. 657-661, and cases there cited, and Donion Bros. v. Southern Pacific Company, 151 Cal. 763-768. We are of opinion that these cases are conclusive as to the validity in California of contracts such as are here under consideration. It is said in the last of these cases above cited (p. 768) that section 2175 of the California civil, code \u201cprohibits the carrier from entering into any contract in anticipation of gross negligence exonerating itself from liability therefor,\u201d but that (p. 770) \u201cso far as ordinary negligence is concerned the rule at common law has been abrogated by our code (sec. 2174) to the extent that the shipper and carrier may now contract for the purpose of limiting the liability of the latter therefor. The prohibition of the common law against a carrier limiting his liability for any kind of negligence is declared in this State by section 2175 only to apply to the limitation for gross negligence.\u201d The construction by the California court of its civil code is we think applicable in the case at bar and controlling here as to the validity in that State of the agreements under consideration. The plaintiff\u2019s assent thereto was manifested, as section 2176 of the California civil code requires it to be, when the instrument makes such \u201cmodification of the carrier\u2019s obligations as in the present instance, by his signature to the same.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b332-5\" pgmap=\"332\">Such being the law of the State in which the contract was made, and not having been made so far as appears \u201cwith a view to the laws of any other State, it must be governed by the law of the State where it was made.\u201d Coats v. C. R. I. &amp; P. Ry. Co., 239 Ill. 154-161. In that case the question is carefully considered and the cases in this State applicable are reviewed. The conclusion of the court on this matter is thus stated (p. 164): \u201cInasmuch therefore as the contract under the construction contended for by appellant, was partly to be performed in Iowa, it must, as to its validity, nature, obligation and interpretation be governed by the law of Iowa. \u2019 \u2019 In the case at bar the contract must in like manner be governed by the law of California, which exempts the defendant from liability under contracts such as those here involved.</p> <p id=\"b332-6\" pgmap=\"332\">Other questions are presented in the briefs, but in view of the conclusions stated, it is not necessary to consider them. The judgment of the Municipal Court must be reversed with a finding of facts.</p> <p id=\"b332-7\" pgmap=\"332\">Reversed loith finding of facts.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
