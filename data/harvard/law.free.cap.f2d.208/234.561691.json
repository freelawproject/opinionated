Birdsall refused to bargain with the Union on the ground it was not engaged in interstate commerce. After appropriate proceedings the Board ordered Birdsall, \u201cits officers, agents, successors and assigns\u201d to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices in which the Board found it had engaged; to post appropriate notices; and to bargain with the Union upon request.</p>\n<p id=\"Aktg\">Thereafter, the Board and Birdsall entered into a stipulation by which Birds-all agreed it would be bound by the decision in National Labor Relations Board v. Conover Motor Company, then pending in this court. On November 5, 1951, this court handed down its decMon in the Conover case (10 Cir., 192 F.2d 779), \u201e <em>, </em>* ,, t-\u00bb <em>i, </em>directmg the enforcement oi the Board s order in that case. On December 27, 1951, Birdsall posted the required notices and on February 12, 1952, met with te Union, as the representative of such employees, in a bargaining conference. At that meeting Birdsall advised the Union that its business might be sold. The second bargaining conference was set for February 26, 1952, but that meeting was fruitless, because in the meantime Birdsall had sold its business to, Johnson Pontiac, Inc.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Birdsall advised lts employees that further negotiations would have to be had with Johnson. On February 29, 1952, Birds-ay entered into a sales contract with Johnson, under which the latter acquired certain physical properties and assets of Birdsall, such as new and used cars, accessories, machinery and shop equipment, accounts receivable, work in progress and leases on certain property theretofore occupied by Birdsall. There was no transfer of intangibles, such as \u00a3\u00b0od will or trade name and no assumption of liabilities. Johnson neither had nor acquired any interest in Birdsall and Birdsall neither had nor acquired any interest in Johnson. The relationship was purely that of a bona fide seller and buyer. Birdsall was dissolved on June 30, 1952. Johnson went into occupation of certain quarters theretofore occupied by Birdsall. Birdsall\u2019s used car lot, body shop and warehouse were excluded from the sale. Johnson discontinued a storage business previously carried on by Birdsall and opened a garage for servicing cars belonging to army personnel stationed at Camp Carson near Colorado Springs, Colorado \u2014 a new operation, Johnson also obtained a franchise for General Motor trucks and the distributorship for Dayton tires \u2014 lines which ^ad not been handled by Birdsall. The resulting expansion necessitated the em- , , \u201e ,,.A. , , , T u ploymentoiadditionalsalesmenDyJohn- , ,, . .... son and the shlftmg of Personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"aaj-dedup-0\">Birdsall\u2019s franchise from Pontiac Motor Division of General Motors Corporation was not transferrable, but on Feh-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>ruary 28, 1952, Johnson acquired a franchise directly from Pontiac.</p>\n<p id=\"AdoD\">Johnson took applications from each of Birdsall\u2019s former employees and advised them that they would be retained if they were able to perform their work satisfactorily. Birdsall\u2019s employees were transferred to Johnson\u2019s payroll.</p>\n<p id=\"AU8\">On February 26, 1952, the Union wrote Johnson, requesting it to continue the negotiations with the Union as the certified representative of the employees. Johnson took the position that it was not bound by the Board\u2019s order against Birdsall</p>\n<p id=\"Al4\">\u201e r , <em>, ir,\u2122 </em>n , , , On July 14, 1952, the Board granted .. . \u2019 . , a motion to reopen the record and re- ... <em>j. </em>, ,, <em>* \u25a0 </em>, \u2022 mand the proceeding to the Regional Di- , . <em>\u201e </em>,, . . , . rector for further hearing. The hearing was set for Julv 29 1952 before a trial was set ior July \u00bf9, before a trial examiner. Written notice of the hear- .. . , _\u2022 i i, t i i mg was mailed to Birdsall, Johnson and ,, TT . T t io me\u00f3 tvt \u00a3 \u2022 the Union on July 18, 1952. No unfair labor charge had been filed against Johnson and no complaint had been issued by the Board against Johnson, charging it with unfair labor practices, and no finding was made by the trial examiner or the Board that Johnson was engaged in interstate commerce within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq. Instead, the Board elected to proceed against Johnson upon the doctrine of the responsibility of a successor to remedy the unfair labor practices of its predecessor, announced in the Alexander Milburn case, <em>78 </em>N.L.R.B. 747.</p>\n<p id=\"Aor\">At the hearing Birdsall moved to quash the notice of hearing and to dismiss the proceeding as to it, on the ground that it was a defunct and nonexistent corporation. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"ARJ\">On September 11, 1952, the trial examiner handed down a supplemental intermediate report and findings of fact. He found that Birdsall was a defunct corporation, no longer having capacity to comply with the Board\u2019s decision and order directing it to bargain with the Union; that the policies of the Act could effectuated only if the Board\u2019s decisi\u00b0n and order imposed such a duty on Johnson as successor to Birdsall, and that Johnson&gt; as Birdsall\u2019s successor, by \u00b0Perati\u00b0n of law, was bound to cooperate dissipating the unfair labor practices \u00ae wdsall, its predecessor, by recogniz- and bargaining with the Union. The Board aPProved the supplemental intermediate report of the trial examiner and issued an amended order directing .

National Labor Relations Board, 315 U.S. 100, 62 S.Ct. 452, 86 L.Ed. 718 and Walling v. James V. Reuter, Inc., 321 U.S. 671, 64 S.Ct. 826, 88 L.Ed. 1001, but the Supreme Court, in the Regal Knitwear case, made it clear that those decisions were predicated, not merely on suecession, but on a consideration of the relationship between the defendant and the successor which might of itself establish liability within the terms of Rule 65 (d),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a relationship not present in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"AEW\">It is important, of course, that the policy of the National Labor Relations Act be effectuated. But Johnson, the successor here, was not an instrumentality through which Birdsall sought Jo evade the Board\u2019s order; Johnson Jad aot bee? \u201c ^ con\u00bfert Par' ticipation with BirdsaU m the violation of such \u00b0rder\u00a1 ^d Johnson s operations were not merely a disguised continuance \u00b0f f\u201c operations by Birdsall. the contrary, Johnson was a bona fide successor, in no wise associated with and actmg wholly independently of its predecessor, Birdsall. Under such circumstances, equally important considerations of public policy require that Johnson should not be charged with the wrongs of its predecessor and should not jje adjudged of wrongdoing on its part without complaint, notice, full opportunity to present its defense and the other essential requirements of due process of 9*law.</p>\n<p id=\"Aero\">,, . . , In the light of the principles an- , . .. . . .

Armato, 7 Cir., 199 F.2d 800 is not in conflict with the conclusion we have reached. There the Board had certified a Union as a bargaining agent of a group of employees. The business passed to a successor who became the employer of such group. A complaint charging unfair labor practice by such successor was issued. It defended on the ground the change in employer terminated certification. The court held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>the certification remained in effect. The order in that case was predicated on a finding of unfair labor practices by the successor, itself, and did not undertake to impose responsibility on the successor for the acts of its predecessor or to require the successor to dissipate the unfair labor practice of its predecessor, See 97 N.L.R.B. 971.</p>\n<p id=\"A68_\">Enforcement is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-23\">.
