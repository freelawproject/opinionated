She was ordered to cease and desist; to offer said employees reinstatement and to make them whole for loss of pay; to disestablish the Modern Cleaners Employees as a collective bargaining representative of any of her employees and to post the usual notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-24\">The respondent has opposed this petition to enforce the order on the-ground that the evidence in the record is insufficient to support the findings. A review of the record considered as a whole shows, however, that there is substantial evidence in support of the-Board\u2019s findings though it is true that there was also conflicting evidence tending to show that at least the discharge of Zirkelbach was for cause. That be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>ing so, the findings are now conclusive as the Taft-Hartley Act provides. 61 Stat. 148, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">That, in effect, disposes of the respondent\u2019s resistance to the petition to enforce the order since the acts of the respondent, as found, were violations of the Act as held by the Board.
