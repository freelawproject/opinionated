He charged that his removal pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 652(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cfor such cause as will promote the efficiency of such service\u201d was effected (1) through fraud, bad faith and collusion of certain disciplining officials, and (2) in violation of the \u201cperformance-rating plan\u201d provisions of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellee moved to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">With the complete record of the administrative removal proceedings before it as an exhibit to the complaint, the District Court held the sort of charges of fraud, bad faith and collusion involved here insufficient to warrant judicial review on the merits of the administrative action. It also decided, despite appellant\u2019s failure to raise the issue in the administrative proceedings, that \u00a7 2005 was inapplicable to a case of this kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s disposition of the issues of fraud, bad faith and collusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We cannot agree, however, with its disposition of the issue relating to \u00a7 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Appellant was removed under 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 652(a) which authorizes removal from the classified Civil Service \u201cfor such cause as will promote the efficiency of such service.\u201d Section 2005 of the same title of the code provides that while an \u201cunsatisfactory performance\u201d rating \u201cshall serve as a basis for removal,\u201d no such rating shall be given \u201cwithout a ninety-day prior warning and a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate satisfactory performance.\u201d The \u201cNotification of Personnel Action\u201d issued to appellant ambiguously stated: \u201cReason for Removal : Unsatisfactory services\u201d and \u201cPerformance Rating: Satisfactory.\u201d Appellee contends that disciplining officials are not bound to apply \u00a7 2005 to all cases. He says, in effect, that even if the words \u201cunsatisfactory performance\u201d used in \u00a7 2005 and \u201cunsatisfactory services\u201d given as the reason for appellant\u2019s removal are synonymous and the specific basis for removal consists of the sort of matter usually associated with the quality of an employee\u2019s performance or services, \u00a7 2005 is inapplicable unless the disciplining officials wish to retain the employee\u2019s services; that since they did not wish to retain appellant\u2019s services, his removal could be effected under \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>652(a) without observing the provisions of \u00a7 2005 for warning and \u201ca reasonable opportunity to demonstrate satisfactory performance.\u201d Appellant vigorously contends that appellee has no such choice and condemns this view as plainly contrary to the statutory command.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Appellee did not object to the District Court\u2019s consideration of the \u00a7 2005 issue on the ground that appellant had failed to raise it in the administrative proceedings. On this appeal, however, appellee insists such failure is fatal to judicial review, upon the familiar principle stated by the Supreme Court in Hormel v. Helvering that \u201c[o]r dinar ily an appellate court does not give consideration to issues not raised <em>below.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But in that case, the Supreme Court also warned that \u201c[t]here may always be exceptional cases or particular circumstances which will prompt a reviewing or appellate court, where injustice might otherwise result, to consider questions of law which were neither pressed nor passed upon by the court or administrative agency below. See Blair v. Oesterlein Machine Co., 275 U.S. 220, 225 [48 S.Ct. 87, 72 L.Ed. 249.] \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">It might fairly be argued that this is one of those \u201cexceptional cases or particular circumstances\u201d to which the Supreme Court referred. The issue raised for the first time in the District Court involves a substantial question of law \u2014 construction of a statute which appears to require disciplining officials to follow certain specific procedural directions. If appellee has acted illegally by ignoring these statutory directions to him, our failure to decide the issue might result in serious injustice to appellant. Although we believe the issue must be resolved, we think it inadvisable to do so in this case without benefit of a prior ruling by the administrative agency involved. The issue is of major importance in the administration of civil service laws. Yet, it has never, to our knowledge, been considered in this or any other case by the administrative agency. In such circumstances, to decide it now would be unwise for the court, and unfair not only to the present parties but to those who would inevitably be affected by the outcome. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment appealed and remand to the District Court with instructions to provide appropriate opportunity for an administrative determination of the issue involved in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">PROCTOR, Circuit Judge, died before the decision in this case and took no part in its consideration.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\">. 62 Stat. 355 (1948), 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 652 (a).
