On September 8, 1950, plaintiff made application to reopen her case on a showing that she had then obtained an annulment of her prior marriage from a state court. After hearing, the defendant Deputy Commissioner rejected her application as not having been filed within one year of the last payment of compensation, as required by 33 U.S.C, \u00a7 922. Plaintiff brought this action to set aside the latter order, and appeals from a summary judgment for defendants. D.C.S.D.N.Y., 105 F.Supp. 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-14\">The applicability of the limitation section is clear. Hence to prevail here plaintiff must show either compliance' or waiver. She attempts to show both. First she urges that certain letters written by her counsel in 1946 constituted timely application to reopen. These letters, however, contain only mere general inquiry as to the status of her case. Next she relies on a letter of the insurance carrier dated February, 13, 1946, which she urges as a stipulation to waive-the limitation: The letter states merely that the carrier is forwarding to the Deputy Commissioner \u201ca request that we be permitted to suspend further payments of death benefits to you until such time as either yourself or we may be in a position to prove or establish the dissolution of your first marriage * * This is altogether too vague to constitute an \u201cintentional relinquishment of a known right\u201d under the standard definitions of waiver, as in Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461, or S. &amp;. E. Motor Hire Corp. v. New York Indemnity Co., 255 N.Y. 69, 72, 174 N.E. 65, 81 A.L.R. 1318. Furthermore, a claims examiner\u2019s memorandum of a conference with plaintiff on March 13, 1946, is quite conclusive that plaintiff was then informed of her right to take action for further consideration of her claim \u201cwithin one year from the date of the order of rejection which is to be filed vt ry shortly\u201d and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>in fact filed six days later. Since plaintiff had retained counsel by May 2, 1946, we do not think that any undue hardship has been imposed by the operation of the statutory principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
