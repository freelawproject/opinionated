In holding the typical claims of the patent in suit to be invalid, he applied conscientiously the doctrine of the Supreme Court in Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company v. Super Market Equipment Corporation, 340 U.S. 147, 71 S.Ct. 127, 95 L.Ed. 162, in which case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>he had been the trial judge. He held that no invention inheres in the claims of the Weeks\u2019 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The claims in suit define the aggregation as a package comprising a soft, limp cellophane bag, filled with nuts and sealed, and having flat ends or tails, and an outer paper wrapper or backing surrounding and protecting the cellophane bag. In the prior art, the bag described in Weeks\u2019 patent was plainly anticipated by Zwoyer No. 1,986,422. As to the wrapper, it was anticipated in the prior art by several patents, including Krohn 1,028,888, Childs 1,249,328, and Emrich 1,491,088. In the prior art, the Weeks\u2019 patent was anticipated, in respect of the protection and stiffening of wrappers for numerous articles for display, by a number of patents, among which may be listed the three Crupain patents, Nos. 1,436,238, 1,446,836, and 1,452,363; Em-rich No. 1,491,088; Krohn No. 1,028,-888; and Childs No. 1,249,328.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">All the patentee did was to place together segments of the prior art, which he claims to constitute invention. We are not in accord with his contention. All, at most, the patentee did was to make an advance step in combination of known elements, not rising to the dignity of invention. This case falls plainly within the ambit of the Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Company case, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">In our opinion, the adjudication by the able and experienced district judge that appellants had failed to sustain by evidence the charge of unfair competition leveled against appellees was not clearly erroneous but was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">We think the record fails to show that the device of appellants had acquired a \u201csecondary meaning,\u201d or that appellees attempted to \u201cpalm off\u201d their goods as those of appellants, which sustains the conclusion of the district judge that appellants failed to establish their charge of unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
