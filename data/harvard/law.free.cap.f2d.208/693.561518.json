The Tax Court, in a memorandum opinion by Judge Murdock, found that \u201cThe disposition of 5860 and the acquisition of 5820 were parts of a single inseparable deal in which the petitioner transferred 5860 as a part of the consideration for 5820\u201d. This finding has adequate support in the evidence and it compels the conclusion which the Tax Court reached that the petitioner did not realize a taxable loss on the disposition of 5860.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
