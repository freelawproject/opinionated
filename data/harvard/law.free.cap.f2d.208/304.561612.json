The agreement provided that the licensee should never contest validity and would not infringe or aid others to infringe; it also provided that, if the licensee made default in the payment of agreed royalties and failed to remedy the default within fifteen days after written notice, \u201cthe licensors may, at their option, cancel this agreement and revoke the license.\u201d The corporate defendant was a sub-licensee. After paying royalties for some time (in the aggregate amount of some $17,000), there was a default, and, after the required notice of default, the. plaintiffs notified Sebo in writing on March 25, 1949, that they \u201chereby cancel the agreement of December 14, 1944, and hereby revoke the licenses therein granted.\u201d Some five months later, on August 30, 1949, plaintiffs brought this suit for infringement of the patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\"> 1. The trial <em>judge held, </em>in effect, that there was no infringement. We think there was none. The judge did not pass on the patents\u2019 validity. But he held defendants estopped to deny both infringement and validity, and it is suggested that impliedly he found defendants guilty of unfair competition. See his opinion, 115 F.Supp. 555. On the basis of his findings and conclusions, he perpetually enjoined defendants from directly or indirectly making, using or selling the cameras which they had been making and selling and which did not infringe plaintiffs\u2019 patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-16\">2. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint contains no suggestion of either infringement-estoppel or unfair competition. The pre-trial order, although it specifies validity-estoppel as an issue to be tried, is utterly silent concerning those other two issues. Since the pre-trial order was not expressly \u201cmodified at the trial,\u201d pursuant to Rule 16, it is arguable that neither of those issues was open. But as plaintiffs\u2019 counsel during the trial made at least a brief reference to the issue of estoppel re infringement, and as defendants\u2019 counsel did not then object or ask an adjournment, we think that the trial judge was at liberty to consider that issue, for we read Rule 16 in the light of Rule 15(b), Fed.Rules Civ.Proc., 28 U.S.C. (We shall take up later the matter of unfair competition.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-17\">3. We think, for the following reasons, the judge erred in respect of estoppel concerning infringement: During the existence of a patent license, the licensee may be estopped to contest validity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But even this estoppel usually vanishes when the license terminates, either because of lapse of time or through complete repudiation of the li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>cense by the licensee or by act of the licensor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This is the more true as to infringement. For it is well settled that, even during the existence of the license, the licensee is not estopped to prove that his product is not within the claims of the patent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">True, some cases hold that, when the license still endures and the licensor sues for royalties under the license agreement, the licensee is estopped to deny infringement in special circumstances such as these: (a) The license agreement specifically designates as included in the license the specific product on which the licensee has refused to pay royalties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (b) The patent has become widely associated with a name by which the licensee continues to label his product.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We have found no case in which any such estoppel doctrine has been applied after termination of the license. Little wonder. For it'would be peculiarly improper to apply it when \u2014 as here - \u2014 the licensor has elected not to sue for royalties due under the license, but, instead, to cancel it and to sue on the patent for infringement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-13\">4. It is suggested, however, that some of the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions add up to a determination of unfair competition. Although no mention of unfair competition was made in the pleadings or in the pre-trial order or at the trial, we would be disposed to hold that the trial judge or we could consider it, subject to the right of defendants to ask an oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>tunity to present further evidence to the trial court on that issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">There are findings which, if sufficiently supported by the evidence, might perhaps justify, not the permanent injunction which the judge ordered, but one enjoining the sale of defendants\u2019 cameras unless accompanied by appropriate notification that these cameras are unrelated to plaintiffs\u2019 and their patents.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> These findings are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The plaintiff, Gustav Bucky, \u201cfirst dealt with Carl J. Sebo, the father of the individual defendant, concerning the manufacture and production of cameras under the patents. After experimentation with Sebo, Sr., a model of a commercial structure was built, Bucky organized a corporation called Consolidated Research Corporation; in trade, he abbreviated the name to Coreco; and sold the first commercial product brought forth in collaboration with Sebo, Sr. under the patents in suit as the \u2018Coreco-Bucky Camera.\u2019 \u201d The license agreement \u201cprovides that \u2018the licensee will use the name Coreco-Bucky to designate products which he makes and sells under this agreement, and will so mark, label and describe all such products, which practice shall continue during the full term of this agreement unless amended in writing by the parties hereto.\u2019 It was never so amended.\u201d A \u201cbrochure published in 1948 by defendants to the number of 10,000 or 15,000 was distributed until March 1949 when the licensing agreement was cancelled, to hospitals, clinics, doctors and men of scientific pursuits. The brochure presents the defendants\u2019 product as the Bucky camera, developed by Bucky and protected by the patents in suit. About 600 or 700 cameras were sold by defendants at a price of $750 a camera, each with a limited number of attachments. The accused product has been the only model manufactured and sold since the beginning of operations by the defendants under the license. All the cameras sold during the license period had a small plate affixed with the legend \u2018Coreco-Bucky\u2019 and a plate bearing the numbers of the Bucky patents in suit; since-filing of suit the plate with the patent, numbers has been no longer affixed and the legend on the remaining plate has. been changed to read \u2018Coreco.\u2019 Save for these changes, the defendants have continued to market cameras of identical construction as before cancellation. No notice was sent to prospective customers, that the license from Bucky had been cancelled; to the contrary, the defendants continued to represent their product, as the Bucky camera, made under his patents.\u201d \u201cPlaintiffs called a pathologist who testified that the accused product was known in the medical profession as the \u2018Bucky\u2019 camera, and that it was put on the market with a small plaque affixed to it which read either \u2018Bucky-Coreco\u2019 or \u2018Coreco-Bucky.\u2019 He also testified that the camera had been displayed in an exhibit of Coreco at the Atlantic City meeting of the American Medical Association held in June 1949, and that it had then been orally represented to him as the Bucky camera or an \u2018outgrowth of it\u2019 and that the manufacturers \u2018had bought out the rights of Dr. Bucky.\u2019 Plaintiffs also called an internist who testified that defendants\u2019 product was shown again in June 1951 at a technical exhibit of Coreco, that it was then orally represented by defendants as the \u2018Bucky\u2019 camera and that Coreco \u2018have now acquired the rights to the Bucky camera and are now manufacturing it.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>We turn to the evidence which might be said to support these findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">(1) Gustav Bueky testified that the few cameras sold before the license agreement were \u201cexperimental models\u201d and \u201cnot a production model.\u201d He had no recollection as to \u201cany details\u201d of such sales. This evidence does not support any inference that any \u201ccommercial product\u201d had been so sold before the license agreement as to create any public impression that Coreco-Bucky meant a camera made by Bucky or under the plaintiffs\u2019 patents. Accordingly, that defendants\u2019 cameras, after the cancellation, have been labeled Coreco did not, on that score, constitute unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">(2) The brochure published in 1948 related to the Coreco-Bucky cameras and indicated that they were made under plaintiffs\u2019 patents. Sebo testified that in March 1949, when the license was can-celled, there were on hand three or four thousand copies of this brochure but that most of them were dumped although \u201ca few might have gotten out. They were not distributed in any mass quantity.\u201d For a short time after the cancellation, defendants substituted \u201csales sheets\u201d until 1950, when they put out a new brochure which omitted any reference to plaintiffs\u2019 patents and which related solely to Coreco cameras without any mention of Coreco-Bucky.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">(3) Plaintiffs\u2019 own witnesses stated that the camera sold during the period of the license agreement and before its termination was known as \u201cthe Bucky camera.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">(4) The sole testimony as to oral representations consisted of the following: Plaintiffs\u2019 witness, Janoff, testified that he had seen cameras exhibited under the name Coreco at the American Medical Association meeting at Atlantic City in June 1951. The following colloquy then ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">\u201cQ. Did you have a conversation with any person at that exhibit? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">\u201cMr. Posnack: Your Honor, I am going to offer the same objection as to any testimony with respect to a conversation about these cameras.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-14\">\u201cThe Court: Overruled. I am not giving it much weight because it is not shown who this man is he spoke to. It is not shown that he was authorized to speak on behalf of the defendants. It is not shown that the defendants knew what this man at the exhibit was saying or representing. But I will take it. Standing alone, it has no weight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-15\">\u201cMr. Kolisch: I understand your Honor. One of my purposes is to give the defendants a chance to put in such evidence as they have on the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-16\">\u201cThe Court: The defendants do not have to put in any evidence on this if they don\u2019t want to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-17\">\u201cMr. Kolisch: If they don\u2019t, that is where we stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-18\">\u201cA. I asked the man who was exhibiting the camera if this was anything like the Bucky camera, which seemed to resemble it superficially to my eyes, anyway, and he said \u2018This is the Bucky camera.\u2019 I said, \u2018How do you have it here?\u2019 He said, \u2018We have now acquired the rights to the Bucky camera and are now manufacturing it.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-19\">Plaintiffs\u2019 witness Ehrenreieh testified that at an American Medical Association meeting in June 1949, he saw the camera in the booth of the Coreco Company, that there were two men in the booth, demonstrating the camera, and that he spoke to one of them. The testimony and colloquy continues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-20\">\u201cQ. Will you relate to the Court what the substance of that conversation was ? A. Briefly, it was this: I had been impressed, knowing the camera that I used at Seaview, which I knew as the Bucky camera, or the Bucky-Coreco camera, and I saw this, and it seemed to me it was essentially the same. I then asked the man whether this was the Bueky camera.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>\u201cMr. Posnack: I object to this testimony. There is no relevancy to the issue of infringement here. You don\u2019t charge here a palming off, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">\u201cMr. Kolisch: The decisions to which I called attention in the trial brief say that even in the absence of any contractual relations, where the defendant held itself out to be operating under the patents, that will either operate as an estoppel against the defendant to deny infringement and validity or will be taken into account by the Court when the defendant comes to court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">\u201cThe Court: You offer this in anticipation of a defense that they may offer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">\u201cMr. Kolisch: The defense that was stated to be one of the defenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">\u201cMr. Posnack: Your Honor, there is nothing in record at all to justify it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">\u201cThe Court: We will take it. We will shorten the trial perhaps.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">\u201cA. I asked him whether this was the Bucky camera. He said yes, it was. Then I asked him why, if it was the Bucky camera, the plaque did not state so, because, as I recall, the camera that I used, the plaque stated the Bucky-Coreco camera, and the man said this was the same camera, or an outgrowth of it, and they had bought out the rights of Dr. Bucky.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-6\">In the light of the judge\u2019s comments at the trial and the vagueness and slight character of this testimony and the other evidence, we think there is insufficient foundation in the record for the conclusion that unfair competition has occurred and that an injunction on that ground is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-17\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-11\">.

McLouth Steel Corp., 6 Cir., 170 F.2d 369, 378-380. There the plaintiff, a patent-owner, entered into a license agreement with the defendant. Subsequently the parties made a supplemental agreement providing that a specific machine, to be purchased by the licensee from someone other than the licensor, was nevertheless to be covered by the original license agreement and that the licensee was to pay royalties thereon. The licensee, in connection with the issuance of some of the shares of stock, then stated in a published prospectus that it was obligated to pay royalties to the licensor on this machine. The court held, in a suit by the licensor for royalties under the license agreement and its supplement, that the defendant was obliged to pay royalties on the specific machine even if it was not covered by the patent. The court said it was not deciding what the situation would have been if the licensee had \u201copenly repudiated the applicability\u201d of the patent \u201cbefore the date of the suit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b354-16\">.

Clearly not in point are cases where the patentee, as grantor of a license, is estopped to deny that a product is infringing when, in connection with the grant, he had represented that the license covered that product and the grantee had relied on this representation. See Westinghouse Co. v. Formica Co., 266 U.S. 342, 350-351, 45 S.Ct. 117, 69 L.Ed. 316; Piaget Novelty Co. v. Headley, 2 Cir., 108 F.2d 870. Cf. Collis Co. v. Consolidated Machine Corp., 8 Cir., 41 F.2d 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-19\">Likewise not in point is Collis Co. v. Consolidated Machine Tool Co., 8 Cir., 41 F.2d 640, 641. It was a suit for unfair competition in the use of a trade-name; the court held the defendant was not guilty of laches since its delay had been induced by reliance on plaintiff\u2019s false public representations that certain articles were protected by plaintiff\u2019s patent which in fact had expired.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b355-7\">. We reject defendants\u2019 contention that the district court had no jurisdiction of that issue: There was substantial basis for assertion of the claims based upon the patents, and accordingly the court had jurisdiction of those claims, with pendent jurisdiction of an unfair competition claim. See The Fair v. Kohler Die &amp; Specialty Co., 228 U.S. 22, 33 S.Ct. 410, 57 L.Ed. 716; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(b); Schreyer v. Casco Products Corp., 2 Cir., 190 F.2d 921.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"A0ev\">. If there were unfair competition, damages however would be singularly difficult to compute because plaintiffs have not produced and sold, and are not now producing and selling any cameras, commercially.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b357-18\">CLARK, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A8DR\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"A2RI\">While exactly parallel cases are hard to discover, I think the rationale of the decisions holding a patent licensee es-topped to deny the validity of the patent supports also the grant of remedies to prevent such sharp business practices as defendants here indulged in.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-19\">There are two lines of pertinent authority. Absent any elements of \u201cpassing off,\u201d or other unfair conduct, a licensee, though he cannot deny the validity of the patent, is free to assert non-infringement and to show prior art in support of his defense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But where a patentee has forestalled competition by holding himself out to the world as operating under the protection of a patent, he will not be heard to assert that the patent did not in fact apply.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Where a licensee has thus claimed protection, the same considerations are applicable and the resulting appropriation of the pat-entee\u2019s good will raises additional equities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As against his patentee the case for estopping a licensee is even stronger, for by paying royalties on the license agreement and thus signifying his acquiescence he not only has gained patent protection against the world, but also has forestalled the licensing of potential competition with himself. Accordingly, where the licensee purports to operate under the license and the patentee elects to sue on the agreement, the li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>censee is estopped to deny infringement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">As my brothers point out, existing authority for the estoppel doctrine involves situations where the license remains in effect and the licensee continues to assert a connection with the patentee. But I do not see why the presence of these factors should weaken the powerful thrust of the doctrine. Thus the second factor surely is not an absolute condition (nor does the opinion so claim). Or if it is, it is in substance satisfied here. Plaintiff, Dr. Bucky, was an expert of international renown in the field of roentgenology. His fame was largely responsible for the rapid acceptance of the accused camera. The similarity between \u201cCoreco-Bucky,\u201d the original trade name, and \u201cCoreco,\u201d the name in use when suit was brought, coupled with the trial court\u2019s finding of \u201cpassing off,\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> refutes any contention that defendants have announced to the world that the relationship is severed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Nor can plaintiffs\u2019 cancellation of the license agreement be deemed controlling (except perhaps to indicate the appropriateness or duration of injunctive relief) where, as here, the cancellation was induced by the licensee\u2019s breach. From December, 1944, until March, 1949 (a few months before the commencement of this action), defendants held an exclusive license under the patent and paid royalties thereon. Plaintiffs were completely precluded from seeking alternative means of exploiting their monopoly, and any doubts as to the desirability of this arrangement were lulled by defendants\u2019 acquiescence in the relationship. Defendants have gained a four-year lead over any competitor Dr. Bucky may now seek to license. The injustice of now letting defendants disclaim the relationship is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Furthermore, until 1949, defendants asserted to the world that their camera was protected by Dr. Bucky\u2019s patents and avoided competition from outsiders. They have sought and received substantial benefits from the very relationship which they now assert is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">True, it was plaintiffs who technically cancelled the agreement. Because of this, my brothers deem it \u201cpeculiarly improper\u201d to allow relief. In my opinion, so to hold is to reward defendants\u2019 recalcitrance. It was they who first repudiated the relationship and refused to-pay royalties. Thus this decision is an invitation to all in defendants\u2019 shoes to-do their utmost to provoke a patentee to-cancel his license.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">I would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-12\">.
