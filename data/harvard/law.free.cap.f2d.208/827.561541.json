By a notice dated July 3, 1950, stated therein to be \u201cin accordance with Section 14 of the Veterans Preference Act of 1944,\u201d a \u201ccharge\u201d was filed against appellant, a veteran preference eligible, with a view toward separating him from his civilian employment with the Department of the Army. Appellant was advised that he had until July 13, 1950 to submit \u201creason in writing\u201d as to why the proposed action should not be taken. Within the time so fixed, on July 12, 1950, appellant filed an answer denying the \u201ccharges\u201d and protesting against alleged deficiencies in the notice of separation in that the notice had failed to state \u201creasons, specifically and in detail\u201d for the proposed action. On July 27, 1950 the Department of the Army rejected appellant\u2019s protest, advised appellant that his reply did not justify a change in the proposed action and that accordingly, appellant was to be separated from the service as of August 4, 1950. Appellant was so separated from the service, and from the order of separation appeal was taken. The Civil Service Commission\u2019s chief law officer sustained the action taken by the Department of the Army, and the Commission\u2019s Board of Appeals and Review affirmed. Appellant sued for declaratory and affirmative relief: The District Court granted the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">From that judgment appellant has brought his case here and still protests that the notice of separation was deficient in its failure, within the requirements of Section 14 of the Veterans Preference Act, supra, to state any and all reasons \u201cspecifically and in detail\u201d for the action proposed to be taken. His complaint on the record in this case and in view of the nature of the \u201ccharge\u201d against him, is well founded, and in our opinion, appellant was entitled to the particulars he sought. Cf. Money v. Anderson, 1953, 93 U.S.App. D.C. -, 208 F.2d 34; Deak v. Pace, 88 U.S.App.D.C. 50, 185 F.2d 997. The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-15\">. 58 Stat. 390 (1944), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 863 (1946).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
