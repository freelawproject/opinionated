The United States District Court appointed a Special Master, Fred H. Kruse, who, after attentive hearing of the evidence and intelligent consideration of the points involved, filed an elaborate and well reasoned seventy-page report in which he reviewed comprehensively the problem presented, the subject matter of the patents, the issues and mechanics involved, the prior art, and the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-24\">The Special Master recommended that the cause be dismissed for the reasons stated in his report and upon the basis of his findings of fact and conclusions of law that no invention inheres in any of the three patents. The United States District Judge fully concurred in the report of the Special Master, approved and adopted his findings of fact as the findings of the District Court, and dismissed the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-25\">We, too, are in accord with the reasoning of the Special Master\u2019s report and with his findings of fact and conclusions of law. We consider it unnecessary, therefore, to write an opinion merely repeating the logical reasoning of the Special Master, in which the District Court concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-26\">Accordingly, the order dismissing the complaint of appellants is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
