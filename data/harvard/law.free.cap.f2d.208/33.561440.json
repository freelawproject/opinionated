The grantee-appellants answered, alleging inter alia that decedent\u2019s sister, the sole beneficiary under his will, was an indispensable party and without her the action should be dismissed, under Rule 19 (a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqpu\">Before trial, the parties entered into a settlement stipulation which was filed with the court and then embodied in an order directing its consummation. The arrangement was that, in circumstances such as those which undisputedly developed, the appellants should pay to the appellee the sum of $2,500 and should then retain the realty conveyed to them by the challenged deed.</p>\n<p id=\"Aeg\">When the appellants\u2019 admitted refusal to make <em>the </em>Payment was shown to court judgment for the sum of $2, was entered against them. On this aPPeal therefrom, they argue that the settlement was merely permissive and not mandatory. We think the contrary that the appellants were bound by their stipulation and the enforcing order. As they cannot now urge the absence of an indispensable party, we exPress no opinion as to whether the sister actually was such,</p>\n<p id=\"am-dedup-0\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
