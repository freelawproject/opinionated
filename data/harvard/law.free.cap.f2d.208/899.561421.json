In his complaint the plaintiff alleged unseaworthiness of the vessel and negligence on its part. The case was tried to the Court below without a jury. It found that (1) the vessel was seaworthy and (2) there was no negligence on the part of the defendant which was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s skin disease, and accordingly, by Order, entered judgment against the plaintiff and in favor of the defendant. Our review of the record discloses that the findings of the Court below and its Order are fully supported by the evidence. For the reasons stated the Order of the Court below will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-23\">. 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7688.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
