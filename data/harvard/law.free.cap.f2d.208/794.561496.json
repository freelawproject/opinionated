We have carefully examined the evidence. No useful purpose would be served by recounting it in detail. It is sufficient to state that we are in complete accord with the conclusion of the district court that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur was not applicable and that the evidence offered by the plaintiff was insufficient to establish negligence on the part of the defendant which was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-23\">The order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
