In support of this view their brief discusses and relies on the Constitution of Texas, Art. VIII, \u00a7 15, Vernon\u2019s Ann.St., and the Texas Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>utes, Art. 7172 et seq. dealing with the levy, assessment and collection of taxes generally.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag8\">Appellee insists that general taxes and the constitutional and statutory provisions pertaining thereto are completely irrelevant here. Its claim is that Section 59(c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> providing for the creation of indebtedness necessary to achieve the purpose of the amendment and \u201call such indebtedness may be evidenced by bonds\u201d of the district and \u201csuch indebtedness shall be a lien upon the property assessed for the payment thereof\u201d, and Art. 8012, Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, Vernon\u2019s Ann.Civ.St., providing for the levy of taxes for the payment of bonds issued by any levee improvement district, and that \u201csuch levy may be made for or at the time of the issuance of said bonds for each year throughout the life of the bond issue which shall be the rate of levy for each of said years until modified\u201d, establish beyond question that the bonds were a lien on the land as claimed and found.</p>\n<p id=\"AdXY\">We are in no doubt that this is so. A reading of the provisions of the Constitution and statutes which appellee invokes and the decisions <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> construing and applying these provisions makes this plain.</p>\n<p id=\"AEvH\">The judgment was right. It is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b444-23\">. State of Texas v. Moody\u2019s Estate, 5 Cir., 156 F.2d 698; U. S. v. 111,000 Acres of Land, 5 Cir., 155 F.2d 683; C/o U. S. v. Greer Drainage Dist., 5 Cir., 121 F.2d 675.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b445-10\">. \u201c(c) The Legislature shall authorize all such indebtedness as may be necessary to provide all improvements and the maintenance thereof requisite to the achievement of the purposes of this amendment, and all such indebtedness may be evidenced by bonds of such conservation and reclamation districts, to be issued under such regulations as any (may) be prescribed by law and shall also, authorize the levy and collection within such districts of all such taxes, equitably distributed, as may be necessary for the payment of the interest and the creation of a sinking fund for the payment of such bonds; and also for the maintenance of such districts and improvements, <em>and such indebtedness shall be a lien upon the property assessed for the payment thereof; </em>provided the Legislature shall not authorize the issuance of any bonds or provide for any indebtedness against any reclamation district unless such proposition shall first be submitted to the qualified property tax-paying voters of such district and the proposition adopted.
