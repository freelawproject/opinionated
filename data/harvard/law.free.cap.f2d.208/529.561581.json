The result may be harsh, but that is a matter for Congress. At the time this suit was brought, Rev.Stat. \u00a7 4915 provided that \u201cIn all cases where there is no opposing party a copy of the bill shall be served on the commissioner; and all the expenses of the proceedings shall be paid by the applicant, whether the final decision is in his favor or not.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here there was in substance no opposing party.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The \u201cproceedings\u201d in a suit must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>be held to include an appeal, by whichever party taken. And \u201cexpenses\u201d are not limited to costs.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Reasonable printing expense must be deemed includable. A reasonable rate for printing is fixed, for purposes of allowing costs in this court, at $3.25 per page. See Rule 17 (h) of our General Rules. Though that Rule has no direct application here, the scale it sets should not be exceeded in the present context. As the record does not show whether or not the sum allowed by the District Court exceeded that scale, we will remand so that it may be applied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-16\">. Suit was brought under Rev.Stat. \u00a7 4915 (1875), as amended, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 63 (1946). That section was repealed by Section 5, Act of July 19, 1952, c. 950, 66 Stat. 815, and is now replaced by 66 Stat. 803, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 145, 146.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-18\">. Marzall v. Cook, 1952, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 423, 196 F.2d 241.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b578-19\">. By the Act of July 19, 1952, supra note 1, at c. 950, \u00a7 1, 66 Stat. 803, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 145, this language was changed to read simply: \u201cAll the expenses of the proceedings shall be paid by the applicant.\u201d The parties argued their case in the District Court and in this court on the basis of the old wording, and we rule on that basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b578-28\">. Mrs. Cook sued not only the Commissioner of Patents but also the Newark Jewelry Company. That Company had been named by the Patent Office when it set up an opposition proceeding during the course of Mrs. Cook\u2019s attempt to obtain registration of her trademark. Newark Jewelry Company did not at any time, however, regard Mrs. Cook\u2019s trademark as being in conflict with its own mark. After Mrs. Cook\u2019s suit was brought that Company filed an answer in which it stated that it did not consider a conflict to exist, and that it joined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Mrs. Cook\u2019s prayer that registration of her mark be granted. The Jewelry Company and Mrs. Cook were in fact represented by the same attorney, who entered appearances for both in the District Court. Under these circumstances, we do not believe that there was an \u201copposing party\u201d in Mrs. Cook\u2019s suit, within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b579-6\">. Robertson v. Cooper, 4 Cir. 1931, 46 F.2d 766, 769.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b579-7\">. Appellant urges that the District Court was without jurisdiction to enter its order. We cannot agree. This court made no ruling as to expenses when the case was here previously. We denied appellant\u2019s motion, made after the rendition of our prior opinion affirming the District Court\u2019s grant of registration, that costs be not assessed against her. This was a ruling as to costs, and was not a determination of the present controversy. In any event, it was adverse to appellant, and cannot aid her here. After the\" amount of the Government\u2019s expenses (as distinguished from costs) had been ascertained, it could properly go to the District Court for relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
