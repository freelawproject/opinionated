Peckham, Jr., under the abortion statute of the District of Columbia, Dorsey K. Offutt, Esq., was defense counsel. At the end of the trial the presiding judge summarily found Offutt guilty of criminal contempt of court and ordered him committed for 10 days to the custody of the United States Marshal. Offutt appeals from that order. We quote from the order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-24\">\u201cPursuant to Rule 42(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure [18 U.S.C.A.], I hereby certify that I saw and heard the con-tempts of court hereinafter described, and that they were committed by Dorsey K. Offutt in the actual presence of the court during the trial of a criminal proceeding before me entitled, United States v. Henry L. Peckham, Jr. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b890-25\">\u201cI find that said Offutt was guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>of the following breaches of decorum and offensive, contumacious, and unethical conduct in open court during the trial; and that said breaches and course of conduct constituted contempt of court. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-5\">\u201c1. On numerous occasions, he made insolent, insulting and offensive remarks to the court, and was guilty of gross discourtesy to the court. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-6\">\u201c2. On numerous occasions, he persisted in repeating questions, previously excluded by the court, in order to evade the court\u2019s rulings, in spite of admonitions by the court to the contrary. Many of these questions were obviously intended to besmirch a witness. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-7\">\u201c3. On numerous occasions he persisted in talking boisterously after the court had made a ruling, and failed to desist when ordered to do so by the court, at times even continuing to talk while the court was speaking. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-8\">\u201c4. On numerous occasions he used a boisterous, belligerent, discourteous and offensive tone of voice in addressing the court. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-9\">\u201c5. On several occasions, he made false statements to the court, which he could not help knowing to be untrue, particularly concerning what the court had done or said. * * -\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-11\">\u201c6. On several occasions he asked of witnesses questions that were highly prejudicial to the witness and for which there was no foundation. Thus, he asked Mary Ott, the victim of the abortions charged against the defendant,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-15\"><em>\u2018When </em>were you arrested in this case?\u2019 As a matter of fact she never had been arrested and when called to account by the court, Offutt only answered that he had a right to enquire <em>whether </em>the witness had been arrested in this case. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ab4-dedup-0\">\u201c8. On numerous occasions, he created a noise and commotion in the courtroom by boisterous interruptions and irrelevant remarks, such as objecting to a quiet conversation between two spectators in the courtroom, one of whom had been a witness in the case. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-16\">\u201c11. He abused the process of the court by issuing a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>to the mother of Mary Ott, and compelled her to come here from Erie, Pennsylvania, pursuant to a subpoena; and by issuing a subpoena to one Donohower. When called as witnesses, he was unable to elicit any relevant testimony from either of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-17\">\u201c12. He constantly tried to create an episode that might lead the court to direct a mistrial. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqr-\">Most of these findings are followed by several references to the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-18\">The record amply supports the quoted findings numbered 1, 2, 6, and 12<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the ultimate finding of contempt. But we think the record does not support the penalty imposed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s conduct cannot fairly be considered apart from that of the trial judge. Each responded to great provocation from the other. The judge\u2019s treatment of appellant, examples of which are included in an appendix to our opinion in Peckham v. United States, U.S.App.D.C., \u2014 F.2d \u2014, and which is the chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>factor in leading a majority of this court to conclude that Peckham\u2019s conviction cannot stand, leads us all to conclude that appellant\u2019s sentence should be reduced from 10 days to 48 hours. The order will be modified accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Modified and affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b891-12\">. Finding 1 makes findings 3, 4, and 8 credible, but we do not pass upon them since the record necessarily fails to show boisterousness, belligerent tones, etc. We think finding 5 lacks adequate support. The question of the correctness of the finding that appellant was in contempt of court in issuing the subpoenas referred to in finding 11 is not before us and we express no opinion on it, for he does not appear to have issued the subpoenas \u201cin the actual presence of the court\u201d and therefore was not on their account summarily punishable by the presiding judge. Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 42(a, b). We have not considered findings 7, 9, and 10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AFe_\">. United States v.
