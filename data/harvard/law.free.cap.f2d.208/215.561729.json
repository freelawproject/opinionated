The indictment was predicated on Section 8 of the Immigration Act of 1917, as amended by Public Law No. 283, approved March 20, 1952, 66 Stat. p. 26, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 144(a) (2) [now 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1324(a) (2).] The facts are stipulated, and the conviction is assailed only on grounds having to do with the validity of the statute. The contentions are, first, that the statute is void for vagueness, and second, that it constitutes an arbitrary and capricious form of class legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-22\">Public Law 283 is entitled \u201cAn Act To assist in preventing aliens from entering or remaining in the United States illegally.\u201d House Report No. 1377, 82nd Cong., 2nd Sess., indicates that the purpose of the legislation was to \u201covercome a deficiency in the present law making it an offense to harbor or conceal aliens who have entered this Country illegally, <em>and to strengthen the law generally in preventing aliens from entering or remaining in the United States illegally.\u201d </em>[Emphasis supplied.] The legislation appears to have been an outgrowth of the decision in United States v. Evans, 333 U.S. 483, 68 S.Ct. 634, 92 L.Ed. 823, in which it was held that the existing statute contained no penalty provision for a person convicted of harboring or concealing an alien illegally in the United States. The amended \u00a7 8(a) is copied on the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>The claim of vagueness and uncertainty is bottomed on the employment in paragraph numbered (2) of \u00a7 8(a)\u2014 under which the indictment was drawn\u2014 of the pronouns \u201che\u201d and \u201chis.\u201d It is said that this paragraph is susceptible of two radically different interpretations, depending upon whether the pronouns \u201che\u201d and \u201chis\u201d refer back to the phrase \u201cany person\u201d as used at the beginning of subdivision (a), or forward to the phrase \u201cany alien,\u201d found in paragraph (4). The argument proceeds on a holding in United States v. De Cadena, D.C., 105 F.Supp. 202, 207, to the effect that the legislation is in this respect unconstitutional for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"A4L\">TTT, ., ,, , , , \u201e ,, While the verbal arrangement of the , , , , , , , , statute may be thought awkward, we are of opinion that a reading of it as a whole in light of the congressional declaration of purpose leaves no rational doubt as to what was intended. That part of subsection 8(a), ending with the word \u201cwho,\u201d specifies the persons whose activities are the subject matter of the legislation. Paragraph (1) following relates to the activity of smuggling aliens into the United States; paragraph (2) to the transportation of aliens within the United States by one who knows they are unlawfully here and who knows or has reason to believe that the alien\u2019s last entry occurred within three years prior to the transportation; paragraph (3) to the concealing, harboring or shielding of aliens unlawfully in the United States; and the first part of paragraph (4) is aimed at those who aid, abet or encourage the smuggling of aliens into this country. Except for the proviso at the end of paragraph (4) the whole of the subsection constitutes a single sentence, divided into paragraphs which are in the interest of clarity separated from each other by semicolons. The penalty pro-vision is not separately stated in the paragraphs but is set forth in the last, The several types of conduct banned are all made subject to the same punishment there specified, namely, fine or imprison-ment \u201cfor each alien in respect to whom any violation of this subsection occurs\u201d. The words \u201cthis subsection\u201d can only re- <em>, </em>, , ,. . . ... . fer to subsection (a). Thus it is mam-feflt that the ,&lt;he\u201e and \u201ehis\u201e Qf para_ graph (2) refer to the phrase \u00abany alien/&gt; which final]y ghows up in para_ gfaph (4) after the several prohibited activities in respect of the alien have been specifje(j,</p>\n<p id=\"al8-dedup-0\">The argument that the statute is arbitrary and capricious to the point of invalidity is made on two grounds, but one of which merits attention. This is that the proviso of paragraph (4), for convenience again quoted on the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cestablishes an unconstitutional preferred class,\u201d namely <em>employers </em>of aliens known to be unlawfully in the United States. The proviso relates only to \u201charboring,\u201d which is a practice condemned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>in paragraph (3) of the law. Harboring is thus treated in the statute as an offense separate and distinct from that of transportation, which latter is the concern of paragraph (2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Assuming, without consideration of the point, that the classification is unreasonable, we are unable to see how appellant is in position to take advantage of the circumstance. He was charged, not with harboring, but with transporting. It is a familiar rule that a party can be heard to question a statute\u2019s validity only when and in so far as it is being applied to his disadvantage. Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, 257 U.S. 282, 42 S.Ct. 106, 66 L.Ed. 239. Cf., also, Berea College v. Com. of Kentucky, 211 U.S. 45, 29 S.Ct. 33, 53 L.Ed. 81. Whether, in view of the problems with which Congress was confronted in the enactment of this legislation, the proviso of paragraph (4) is a reasonable one is a matter best left to be considered when decision of it becomes essential. If believed necessary to the preservation of the statute the courts would in all likelihood give only narrow scope to the proviso.</p>\n<p id=\"AhN\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b264-12\">.

If this were a state law I would have some doubts about a classification which punishes the man who gives a couple of \u201cwetbacks\u201d a ride, and yet entirely excuses those whose employment of such aliens is primarily responsible for the whole Mexican alien problem, But the Fifth Amendment contains no equal protection clause, Detroit Bank v. United States, 317 U.S. 329, 337, 63 S.Ct. 297, 87 L.Ed. 304, and the discrimination here cannot be said to be so arbitrary and injurious in character as to make the statute wanting in due process.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
