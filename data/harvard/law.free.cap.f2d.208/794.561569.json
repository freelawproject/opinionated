The case was tried before a jury which returned a general verdict in his favor in the sum of $79,250 with costs. Judgment was entered on this verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">Pursuant to defendant\u2019s motion under Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C., the District Court, by order, 112 F.Supp. 209, set aside the jury\u2019s verdict and directed judgment in favor of the defendant. The District Court\u2019s action was premised on its determination that plaintiff\u2019s patent was invalid and moreover that it was not infringed by the defendant\u2019s device.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">After examining the briefs and the record and having considered the arguments of counsel, we are convinced that the District Court did not err. We need add nothing further to what has been so well stated by Judge Marsh in his analysis of the evidence and the applicable law, and accordingly, the order of the court below will be affirmed upon his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">Each party to bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
