In September of 1949, he filed his Selective Service Classification Questionnaire <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in which he gave his occupation as a premedical student, stated that he was not a minister nor a student minister, and made no claim to exemption as a conscientious objector. On October 10, 1950, Schuman was classified as 1-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Schuman sent Local Board No. 40 a letter on August 14, 1950, advising that body that in November of 1949 he had begun studies of the Bible with the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses; that he was enrolled in the Theocratic Ministry School; that he was engaged in various religious activities; and that he spent many hours in study at home and requested classification as IV-D (minister 'or student minister). On November 30, 1950, he was advised that his classification in 1-A would continue. When it was determined in July of 1951 that Schuman had been registered with the wrong local board, his files were transferred to Local Board No. 38, from which he ultimately received his orders to report for induction. This board classified Schuman anew, again in 1-A, in September of 1951. In a personal appearance, sought by Schuman and granted by the board, he requested classification either as an ordained minister or as a conscientious objector. The local board refused to change his classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-10\">Schuman appealed from the decision of the local board, requesting the appeal board to classify him as an ordained minister who is also a conscientious objector opposed to all forms of service in the Armed Forces. The appeal board, after receiving a report from a Department of Justice Hearing Officer<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> continued Schuman in Class 1-A. Schuman finally received orders to report for induction, went through the induction process up to the point where he was asked to take the step forward which signifies induction into the Armed Forces, but refused to take this final step. The indictment and the trial below followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">Schuman stipulated at the trial that he had been classified 1-A by the proper local board, that he had been ordered to report for induction, that he had so reported, but that he had refused to take the step forward which signifies induction into the Armed Forces. Thus the only question presented in this case is whether there was a basis in fact for the classification of Schuman in 1-A rather than in IV-D (minister or student minister) or 1-A-O or 1-0 (conscientious objector). See Cox v. United States, 332 U.S. 442, 448-452, 68 S.Ct. 115, 92 L.Ed. 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-15\">While it is true that we have no power to weigh the evidence which the board considered in making its classification, Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 122, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567, we have recently been instructed by the Supreme Court that our task (at least insofar as the claim to exemption as a minister is concerned) is \u201cto search the record for some affirmative evidence to support the local board\u2019s overt or implicit finding that a registrant has not painted a complete or accurate picture of his activities. * * * [T]he courts may properly insist that there be some proof that is incompatible with the registrant\u2019s proof of exemption.\u201d Dickinson v. United States, 74 S.Ct. 152, 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-17\">All of the evidence bearing upon Schu-man\u2019s claim for exemption as a minis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>ter<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that is contained in the Selective Service file was placed therein by Schu-man. This evidence tends to prove the following: At the time Schuman was requesting classification as a minister, he had given up all secular work and studies because they interfered with his religious studies; that his position in the Witnesses\u2019 sect is that of a \u201cpresiding minister\u201d or \u201coverseer\u201d whose job it is to \u201cdirect others\u201d in their religious work, to give public lectures on the faith, to perform marriages, and to speak at funerals. These latter functions, he claimed, are what makes him a \u201cminister\u201d within the Act \u2014 e. g., that while all members of the sect claim to be ministers ordained by God, he is a leader of ministers, with a position analogous to the ministers or pastors of the more orthodox religions. The only activity to which Schuman adverted that was not strictly a religious one was the study of philosophy in San Francisco City College in order to <em>\u201caid </em>[him] in [his] ministry and to give [him] a better understanding of [his] fellow man.\u201d Affidavits in support of the above assertions were filed by superiors in the sect as well as a letter signed by sixty-two persons attesting to the fact that Schuman preaches and participates in all phases of the ministry.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">In arguing that the local board and appeal board had basis in fact for denying Schuman\u2019s claim as a minister, the Government points out that all members of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses sect claim to be ministers ordained by God, and that Congress obviously did not mean to exempt all members of a religious sect when it provided that \u201cregular <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or duly ordained <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> ministers of religion * * * shall be exempt from training and service.\u201d 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 456(g). In this we agree, for as stated in Martin v. United States, 4 Cir., 190 F.2d 775, 777: \u201cCongress undoubtedly intended to exempt such persons as stand in the same relationship to the religious organizations of which they are members, as do regularly ordained ministers of older and better known religious denominations.\u201d However, it does not follow that no member of such a sect may qualify as a minister. Those who preach and teach the principles of the sect as a regular vocation and who are recognized by the sect as regular ministers are entitled to exemption under the Act. 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7\u00a7 466(g) (2), 456(g); see Smith v. United States, 4 Cir., 157 F.2d 176, 181, certiorari denied 329 U.S. 776, 67 S.Ct. 189, 91 L.Ed. 666; Id., 329 U.S. 831, 67 S.Ct. 367, 91 L.Ed. 704. The undisputed evidence in the file shows that Schuman devoted his entire life<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to spreading the gospel as interpreted by the Witnesses and that he is recognized as a minister by the other members of the sect.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>The Government has also attempted to show that only those members of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses who bear the title \u201ccompany servant\u201d are entitled to exemption as a minister. The Selective Service file does not show the exact position of a \u201ccompany servant\u201d in the hierarchy of the sect, but since the uncontroverted evidence clearly supports Schuman\u2019s claim that he is a minister, we do not need to consider the position of these \u201ccompany servants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">There is nothing inconsistent with Schuman\u2019s claim to exemption as a minister in the fact that he is attending San Francisco City College with a view to obtaining a degree in philosophy. The study of philosophy seems to us to be a valuable addition to the field of religion. This fact does not amount to independent evidence that Schuman has not painted a complete picture of his activities. See Dickinson v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Schuman also claimed and was denied exemption as a conscientious objector.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In his application for such exemption, Schuman stated that he believed in a Supreme Being and that his duties to this Being superseded any duties to man. In answer to the question, \u201cUnder what circumstances, if any, do you believe in the use of force?\u201d, Schuman stated: \u201cOnly if personally aggessed (sic) or if a loved one is aggressed I would use force; <em>but </em>never carnal weapons.\u201d (Emphasis Schuman\u2019s.) At the hearing before the local board, Schuman stated: \u201cI respect the Government of the United States, I will do everything the Government orders except fight,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t believe killing is the right thing to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">In view of the statutory language of 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 456(j), the denial of the exemption as a conscientious objector amounted to a finding that Schuman was not, \u201cby reason of religious training and belief, * * * conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form.\u201d Yet Schuman\u2019s statements as to his religious beliefs are uncontradicted, and one of the two members of the local board who were present at the hearing stated to Schuman, \u201cYour veracity of your faith is unquestionable.\u201d We cannot find in the proceedings before the local board any affirmative evidence which controverts Schu-man\u2019s claim. There are only the suspicions raised by the fact that Schuman did not begin his religious studies until after he had registered for the draft and by the fact that he had not sought exemption until after the Korean War broke out. As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201cwhen the uncontroverted evidence supporting a registrant\u2019s claim places him prima facie within the statutory exemption, dismissal of the claim solely on the basis of suspicion and speculation is both contrary to the spirit of the Act and foreign to our concepts of justice.\u201d Dickinson v. United States, supra, 74 S.Ct. at page 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-11\">Nor does the report of the Department of Justice Hearing Officer show that it, together with the file, gave the appeal board any better basis in fact for its conclusion. The Hearing Officer stated, inter alia, in his \u201cstatement of facts\u201d that \u201cThe Registrant devotes considerable time to his religious practices and wants to spend his life in the propagation of the faith of the Jehovah Witnesses.\u201d As a \u201cConclusion,\u201d the Hearing Officer stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>\u201cThe Hearing Officer wishes to emphasize that the Registrant became actively identified with the Jehovah Witnesses in 1949 and although apparently, sincere in his religious beliefs, he has not been identified with the faith a sufficient length of time to convince the undersigned that he is entitled to exemption from military duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b853-4\">\u201cAccordingly it is recommended that his appeal be not sustained and that he be classified 1-A.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The length of time one has been connected with a faith has no bearing upon whether one is entitled to exemption as a conscientious objector. The only question to be considered is whether the registrant has a sincere (i. e., \u201cconscientious\u201d) religious opposition to participation in war in any form. The Hearing Officer concluded that Schuman was \u201csincere in his religious belief\u201d but because he had not been \u201csincere\u201d long enough<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> recommended that exemption be denied. This is but another example of relying upon suspicion rather than on affirmative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Evidence that Schuman stands in relation to the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses as do ministers of the more orthodox religions to their congregations and that Schuman sincerely believes the teachings of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses religious sect and because of such beliefs and teachings is conscientiously opposed to service in the Armed Forces stands unimpeached and uncontradicted in the record. There is no affirmative evidence in the record sustaining the findings of the board either that Schuman was not a minister, see Dickinson v. United States, supra, or that he was not conscientiously opposed by religious belief to participation in war in any form, see Taffs v. United States, 8 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The judgment of the district court is reversed and the cause is remanded with instructions to dismiss.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-11\">. 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 462(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b850-12\">.
