HAND, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b608-18\">The defendant appeals from a final judgment, permanently enjoining it from infringing the plaintiff\u2019s trademark, used in the sale of small nuggets of candy covered chewing gum of various flavors; and dismissing the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, for the cancellation of the mark. The registration described the mark as follows: \u201cThe trade-mark consists of an O shaped figure colored red having a parallelogram of light shade, usually white, extending horizontally from the central right portion of such figure, together with parallel bands, over and under such figure and parallelogram, of a dark color contrasting with that of the parallelogram, as shown in the drawing. The lining on the 0 shaped figure denotes the red color, and the lining on the bands indicates shading only. No claim is made to the representation of a carton apart from the other features of the mark shown on the drawing.\u201d The only issue on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is whether the defendant infringes; the issues on the counterclaim are that the mark is invalid, as it does not serve to distinguish the plaintiff\u2019s goods and that the plaintiff has abandoned it. We do not find it necessary to discuss either of these contentions; and the judgment dismissing the counterclaim will be affirmed. The facts were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-19\">Since 1939 the plaintiff has used the trade-mark in suit on cardboard boxes (three and five eights inches by one and three quarters), holding ten or twelve nuggets, the nuggets in each box being of a single flavor. There are a number <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>of different flavors, each flavor being in a box of a different color. One box is for peppermint nuggets, and on it the color of the \u201cparallel bands over and under\u201d the O \u201cfigure and parallelogram\u201d is yellow. The \u201c0 shaped figure colored red\u201d appears at the left on all the boxes, its opening being cut through the cardboard so as to show some of the nuggets within. The \u201cparallelogram of light shade\u201d \u2014 in practice always white \u2014 bears the word \u201cChiclets,\u201d written in large black letters, and is the most arresting feature of the \u201cmake-up\u201d as a whole. In later boxes the \u201cparallelogram of light shade\u201d has been extended far enough to the left to break the circle of the \u201c0 shaped figure,\u201d and change it into a sort of \u201cC.\u201d Up to 1949 the defendant had been selling similar chewing gum nuggets of peppermint flavor in packages, each containing about two nuggets, several packages being inclosed in, and sold from, a containing canister. The \u201cmake-up\u201d of these packages was altogether unlike the plaintiff\u2019s; but in 1949 it began to market its peppermint nuggets by the dozen in boxes (four inches by two), that have at their left end a broken \u201c0,\u201d the upper half of which is colored green, the lower half red. From the broken \u201c0\u201d a white \u201cparallelogram\u201d extends to the right end of the box, flanked above and below by \u201cparallel bands\u201d of yellow, giving the box a predominant tone of the same shade of that color as the plaintiff\u2019s. Upon the white \u201cparallelogram\u201d appears in large letters the word, \u201cTopps,\u201d in place of \u201cChiclets\u201d on the plaintiff\u2019s boxes; but there is no other substantial difference between the \u201cmake-up\u201d of the box except for the defendant\u2019s break in the \u201cO\u201d and its upper green half.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Although Judge Byers found no evidence of any \u201cactual confusion on the part of purchasers,\u201d he did find that \u201ca brief visual observation by a customer might well fail to apprise him of the different sources of manufacture of the nuggets.\u201d Also that \u201cin the usual retail purchase * * * the similarity in appearance * * * is such as to be likely to cause confusion * * * of an appreciable number of ordinarily prudent purchasers.\u201d Again, that \u201cthe use by the plaintiff of its trade-mark Chiclets * * * does not affect the issues in this case.\u201d These findings were supported by the following testimony. The plaintiff\u2019s assistant secretary testified on cross-examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">\u201cQ. Now Mr. Helms has suggested that Chiclets, the word Chiclets, may indicate to some people a candy coated gum. Do you subscribe to that? A. I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">\u201cQ. Is it your opinion that Chiclets is no longer a good trade-mark? A. It is not my opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-13\">\u201cQ. In other words you think it is a good trade-mark? A. I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-14\">\u201cQ. And you think that to most people it indicates the product of the American Chicle Company, do you not? A. To the majority of people, yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">The plaintiff\u2019s advertising manager testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-16\">\u201cQ. Have you observed any tendency on the part of the public to call various names (makes?) of candy coated gum Chiclets ? A. Very definitely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-17\">\u201cQ. And that has extended over how many years, if any, to your knowledge ? A. It has been a problem for many years to our company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-18\">\u201cQ. Have you been in stores or in a store where a customer called for Chiclets? A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-19\">\u201cQ. More than once? A. On many occasions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-20\">\u201cQ. What have you observed in those instances? A. On occasions a retailer might question the customer by saying \u2018What kind of Chiclets do you want? Beechies Chiclets? P.K. Chiclets?\u201d\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-21\">In contradiction of this testimony Davis, a neutral witness called by the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>ant, testified that in his experience, when a buyer asked for \u201cChiclets,\u201d the salesman always gave him the plaintiff\u2019s gum; and that he never heard a salesman ask \u201cDo you want P.K. Chiclets or Beechies Chiclets?\u201d He had never \u201cobserved that there is a tendency on the part of the public to use the term Chiclets for candy coated gum generally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aq_W\">Upon this dispute we accept the finding that \u201cthe similarity in appearance * * * is likely to cause confusion * * * of an appreciable number of ordinarily prudent purchasers,\u201d in spite of the word \u201cTopps\u201d replacing \u201cChiclets.\u201d The situation is therefore one where, although \u201cthe majority of people\u201d do not suppose that the word \u201cChiclets\u201d is generic, there is a \u201ctendency\u201d to read it so ; and it follows that to these buyers, who are numerous enough to become \u201ca problem for many years to our company,\u201d the word has ceased to denote any definite \u201csource of origin.\u201d How far this may have affected the validity of the trade-mark, \u201cChiclets\u201d (for that too is registered), is not important here. What is important is that to those buyers, who think \u201cChiclets\u201d to be a descriptive term, the \u201cmake-up\u201d that accompanies it may well be what assures them that they were getting the \u201cChiclets\u201d they have become used to; and the word, \u201cTopps,\u201d would not in that event tell them of any new \u201csource of origin.\u201d It is reasonable to believe that the fabulous sum \u2014 $11,000,00(1\u2014that has been spent in \u201cpublicizing\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s nuggets as \u201cChiclets\u201d has fixed the word in the minds of many buyers as meaning no more than a candy coated gum nugget ; and to some degree destroyed it as a trade-mark. That is a peril to which all such advertising is subject; its very success may prove its failure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">We may properly assume, therefore, that, although the defendant\u2019s \u201cmakeup\u201d is not \u201clikely to cause confusion\u201d among attentive buyers, there is a substantial minority, \u201clikely\u201d to be misled. If we were to read the statute <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> literally, such a minority would be enough, for the text does not limit infringement by the number of those who may be misled. However, we do not read this statute as <em>tabula rasa; </em>we construe it in the background of the law as it stood in 1946 ;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that law defined the issue of infringement less literally. On all but the most extreme occasions it involved a balance of two conflicting interests: that of the \u201cowner\u201d of the mark to prevent the diversion of prospective customers as opposed to that of the putative infringer to be free to compete for them. In the case at bar this becomes a balance between the plaintiff\u2019s prospective loss of a not insignificant number of customers \u2014 i. e., the more careless ones\u2014 and the defendant's interest in continuing the use of a \u201cmake-up\u201d that in itself has no conceivable value. For the defendant has not suggested even the most diaphanous reason for selecting for its peppermint box out of all possible permutations of color and design, just the plaintiff\u2019s \u2014 or at least almost the plaintiff\u2019s \u2014 combination, except for the substitution of \u201cTopps\u201d for \u201cChiclets.\u201d It would be absurd to see in this anything but a hope to bring to its own net just those buyers who are on the fringe of the plaintiff\u2019s possible customers. In the language of Judge Byer, the imitation \u201crevealed an apparent purpose to come as close to the plaintiff\u2019s package as the law might close its eyes to, so long as Topps is used instead of Chiclets.\u201d What we said in Miles Shoes, Inc., v. R. H. Macy &amp; Co., 2 Cir., 199 F.2d 602, 603, applies to the letter, <em>mutatis mutandis: </em>\u201cWhy it should have chosen a mark that had long been employed by Macy and had become known to the trade instead of adopting some other means to identify its goods is hard to see unless there was a deliberate purpose to obtain some ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>vantage from the trade which Macy had built up.\u201d Indeed, it is generally true that, as soon as we see that a second comer in a market has, for no reason that he can assign, plagiarized the \u201cmake-up\u201d of an earlier comer, we need no more; for he at any rate thinks that any differentia he adds will not, or at least may not, prevent the diversion and we are content to accept his forecast that he is \u201clikely\u201d to succeed. Then we feel bound to compel him to exercise his ingenuity in quarters further afield.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The defendant relies upon Life Savers Corp. v. Curtiss Candy Co., 7 Cir., 182 F.2d 4; and it is true that in that case there was evidence that, in spite of the defendant\u2019s name, \u201cCurtiss,\u201d plainly appearing on its wrapper, there were customers, who bought the defendant\u2019s goods, thinking them to be the plaintiff\u2019s; moreover, the court, 182 F.2d at page 8, cited a number of decisions to the effect that a new competitor \u201cis not obligated to protect the negligent and inattentive purchaser from confusion resulting from indifference.\u201d It cannot be denied that courts have at times reasoned as though a second comer were free to divert a first comer\u2019s customers, if he confined himself to those who were unduly careless. If the issue were whether such buyers could complain that they did not get what they wanted, it might be an answer in the second comer\u2019s mouth that they had themselves to thank for their failure to look more closely at the \u201cmake-up\u201d; though even that is a doubtful answer. Be that as it may, the issue becomes altogether different when it is between a first, and a second comer, for the first comer\u2019s careless customers are as valuable to him as any others; and their carelessness can hardly be charged to him. Why they should be deemed more legitimate game for a poacher than his careful buyers, it is hard to see, unless it be on the ground that he should have made his mark so conspicuous that it would serve to hold even the most heedless. Surely that is an inadequate defence. We are not committed to the doctrine in this circuit, and we know of no decision of the Supreme Court that precludes our following our own judgment. We do indeed distinguish the question how far a second comer is to be charged <em>ah initio </em>with the duty of anticipating that there will be careless buyers whom his \u201cmakeup\u201d may divert. That is one thing; we are speaking of a patent effort to catch such buyers, even though the effort be limited to them. The following excerpts from the Restatement of Torts seem to us, at least by implication, to bear us out. Section 729, Comment f: \u201cBut if he\u201d (the second comer) \u201cadopts his designation with the intent of deriving benefit from the trade-mark or trade name his intent may be sufficient to justify the inference that there is confusing similarity * * * his judgment manifested prior to the controversy is highly persuasive. His denial that his conduct was likely to achieve the result intended by him will ordinarily carry little weight.\u201d Again, \u00a7 729, Comment g: \u201cThe buying habits of the purchasers of the particular goods in question are also significant. If the goods are bought by purchasers who exercise considerable attention and inspect fairly closely, the likelihood of confusion is smaller than when the goods are bought by purchasers who make little or no inspection.\u201d We are by no means sure that Life Savers Corp. v. Curtiss Candy Co., supra, 182 F.2d 4, is to the contrary; but, if it must be so construed, with great deference we must leave the last word to the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\">.
