Benton, the alleged endorser of said notes, was taken and returned. These witnesses prove, substantially, that the defendant, Munroe, was the brother-in-law of Harrison, and that Benton married the sister of Harrison\u2019s wife: that some time prior to and at the date of said notes, Harrison was a merchant in Aleiandria, and so continued until the latter part of 1857, or early in 1858, when he quit business and fled, to avoid arrest on a charge of forgery; that the body of said notes and the names of Harrison <em>as well as that of Munroe, </em>thereto signed, are in the handwriting of Harrison; that prior to and about the date of said notes, Harrison had issued a large number of notes with the names of Munroe and Benton attached 1 hereto, as drawers or endorsers, upon many of which the name of Munroe was signed or endorsed by Harrison, and that he (Munroe) knew that his name had been so used by Harrison on some of such notes, and at first admitted or did not deny, but afterwards did deny the genuineness of his signatures thereto, and his liability thereon;' some of them, however, were paid or satisfied by him. The witnesses do not prove any express authority given by Munroe to Harrison to sign his name; most of them say they know nothing of any such authority; one of them, however, states that he often heard Harrison say, after a warrant was issued for his arrest, that he had Munroe\u2019s consent to use his name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-5\">The deed of trust referred to by the witnesses, and offered in evidence in the course of the trial, is dated the 9th of January 1.858, and is between George W.

Which instruction, as asked, the court refused to give, and to this ruling the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-6\"><em>4th Exception. </em>After the evidence in the preceding exceptions, made part of this, the plaintiff proved, by a competent witness, that he did not know whether the signature of Benton, as endorsed on said note for $750, was genuine or not, although he would say, from his knowledge of his handwriting, having seen him write, it was genuine, were it not for the transaction detailed by him in his answer under the commission, but if he were now permitted to state his belief, it is that the endorsement is in the handwriting of Harrison, and then asked the court to instruct the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-7\">1st.

Which instruction, as asked, the court refused to give, and to this ruling the plaintiff excepted, and the verdict and judgment being in favor of the defendant, the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-7\">The cause was argued before Le Grand, O.

Pratt, </em>for the appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-9\">1st. The deed of trust specifies and describes the $750 note with sufficient accuracy to embrace it. This deed was made to secure Benton, Munroe and Elizabeth Harrison for their <em>liabilities </em>on notes and drafts, which Geo. W. Harrison, the grantor, had used and <em>negotiated </em>\u2014 they are the only <em>cestui que trusts </em>for whose benefit the deed was made. Now the note specially described as No. 17, is for the <em>same </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>amount, and payable at the <em>same </em>bank as the \u00a1|750 note sued on, and the <em>same </em>parties are <em>liable </em>upon it. The only difference is, that, the <em>date </em>of the one is the 20th of July, and of the other the 29th of July, of the <em>same year, </em>and in the one Harrison <em>alone </em>is the drawer, while Benton and Munroe are endorsers, in the other, Harrison and Munroe are <em>joint </em>drawers and Benton is endorser. The <em>same parties, </em>however, are <em>liable </em>in each case, and when we consider that the deed provides for any notes which may be given in <em>renewal </em>of those specially described, and also for <em>minor inaccuracies </em>in <em>dates, </em>amounts, or <em>otherwise, </em>it is submitted that this note comes directly within the terms of the deed: \u2014 that, in the words of the deed, \u201cthe correspondence between the note <em>described </em>and this note, is sufficient to <em>establish </em>their <em>identi</em>ty.Again, the deed not only secures these parties for <em>liability </em>on the notes specially described, but for <em>all other liabilities </em>on <em>other notes-. </em>\u2014 \u201cany <em>other notes </em>or <em>drafts, </em>if any there be,\u201d upon which the said parties or either of them <em>umay have become </em>liable\u201d for Harrison\u2019s accommodation. The proof, moreover, shows that the execution of the deed Was <em>procured, </em>from Harrison <em>by the defendant, </em>to secure him as surety upon these notes, and that he admitted that the security was ample for such purpose, and this <em>estops </em>him from denying his signature as joint drawer with Harrison of the note in controversy. He gets this deed from Harrison of all his property, for the purpose of securing his liability of these notes, which he <em>insists were forged; </em>he <em>takes </em>the security, and this is a <em>sufficient </em>admission of Harrison\u2019s <em>authority </em>to sign his name; he is <em>estopped </em>from denying his liability; it makes that <em>legitimate </em>which was before illegitimate. The same doctrine of estoppel, upon the hypothesis of the <em>sixth </em>exception, is equally applicable to Benton, even assuming him to have been intended by the drawers as the <em>real payee, </em>for whose benefit the note was given. If these views are correct, then, it is submitted, the deed was evidence of the defendant\u2019s liability as one of the signers of the $&gt;750 note, or, in connection with the other proof, was evidence to be weighed by the jury, of the <em>ratification </em>by Munroe of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>signatures of his name by Harrison, and the rulings of the court below, in the <em>first, second, third </em>and <em>sixth </em>exceptions were erroneous.

Benton was an incompetent witness, because of his interest in the fund created by the deed of trust. The deed describes Benton as security on the notes specified, and if he could get rid of <em>any one </em>of them, as was the effect of his testimony, it would increase the fund applicable to <em>the others. </em>It is submitted, therefore, that he was incompetent on the ground of interest, and that the ruling of the court below in the <em>fifth </em>exception was erroneous. 1 <em>Greenlf\u2019s Ev., sec. </em>392, and cases referred to in <em>notes </em>thereto. 8 <em>Gill, </em>138, <em>Smith vs. Morgan.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b152-6\">3rd. But in this case the <em>payee, </em>Benton, had, in fact, no <em>interest </em>in the notes sued on, and he was not <em>injured </em>by the transfer. The forgery of his name does not affect the liability of the <em>maker, </em>and where the payee has no interest in the note, the principle, that the holder cannot make title through a forgery, does not apply. The drawer of a note payable to a fictitious person, is liable to the holder of the note to whom it is passed; it will be considered as a note payable to bearer. The drawer of a note, where the payee\u2019s named is <em>forged, </em>will be liable to the holder if the forged endorsement was on the note when passed by the drawer to the holder. So where the payee named in the note has no interest in it, or where it was not intended he should endorse or have any thing to do with it, the same principle applies, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>drawer is liable precisely as if the note were payable to bearer. Proof of the payee\u2019s endorsement is not necessary where the maker of a note makes it payable to a fictitious person, or to a real person and forges his endorsement or procures it to be done, and then puts it in circulation. For these reasons it is submitted, the rulings in the <em>fourth, sixth </em>and <em>seventh </em>exceptions were erroneous. See 1 <em>H. Bl. Rep., </em>321, <em>Collis vs. Emett. 2 Yeates, </em>480, <em>Hunter vs. Blodgett. </em>21 <em>Eng. C. L. Rep., </em>116, <em>Cooper vs. Meyer. </em>3 <em>Hill S. C.

The fact established by the proof in the case, that Harrison was in the habit of signing the name of Munroe to notes, as joint, drawer with himself, or as endorser upon notes drawn by him, and putting the same in circulation, which fact was known to Munroe, was evidence to go to the jury from which they might find his, Munroe\u2019s, assent to his name being placed on these notes by Harrison. The opposite position would operate as a fraud upon all persons taking such notes upon the implied liability of Munroe. The ruling, therefore, in the <em>eighth </em>exception was erroneous. <em>Bailey on Bills, (2 Am.

There are fatal objections to many of the <em>prayers </em>on the part of the appellant, because, of their <em>assuming facts </em>which should have been left to the jury to find, because of there being <em>no evidence </em>upon which to base them, and because they submit <em>questions of law </em>to the jury. The prayer in the <em>first </em>exceptions <em>assumes </em>that Munroe was <em>one of the signers </em>of the $750 note, and this, as well as the prayer in the third exception, leaves to the jury the <em>construction of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>deed </em>which was a <em>question of law, </em>to be decided by the court. These prayers also, as well as those in the <em>second, fourthT sixth </em>and <em>seventh </em>exceptions, are defective, because there-was no evidence to support them, but on the contrary, were in direct conflict with the evidence. 11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>367, <em>Abell vs. Harris.

The deed of trust does not show <em>upon its face, </em>that either of the notes sued on was included in it, and there is-no <em>parol evidence </em>even to show that it does. The variance between the description of note No. 17, in the deed, and the $750 note sued on, is too broad to admit of reconcilement;. The <em>dates </em>are different, and the liabilities of the parties are <em>different. </em>In the one, Munroe was liable only as <em>endorser, </em>while in the other he is sought to be made liable as <em>joint maker. </em>These discrepancies are <em>fatal; </em>the two notes are not the same; their <em>identity </em>is not established. The court could not, therefore, leave it to the jury to find that this $750 note was <em>mentioned in the deed, </em>or intended to be secured by it. Nor is there any thing in the general provisions of the deed which can make it evidence in this case: \u2014 a deed executed by Harrison to indemnify Munroe, on <em>genuine </em>endorsements, is no evidence of the latters recognition of <em>forged </em>endorsements or signatures.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-6\">3rd. Benton was a competent witness. He had no interest in the suit, and there is no evidence that he had anything to do with procuring the deed. But even if he had, the fund is not, or at least, may not be discharged from the payment of these notes. Besides, the appellant had himself offered in evidence <em>all </em>the testimony taken under the commission, including that of Benton, and it was too late for him, after-wards, to object to his competency on the ground of interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b154-7\">4th. The rulings in the <em>fourth, sixth </em>and <em>seventh </em>exceptions raise, the question, whether title can be made to a note by the holder through a <em>forged </em>endorsement? It is submitted, that the law upon this subject, and as applicable to this case, is correctly stated in the court\u2019s instruction in the <em>fourth </em>exception, viz: That to entitle the plaintiff to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>5ie must prove Munroc\u2019s signature to have been genuine, or that he authorised Harrison to sign his name, or sanctioned such signature, and <em>that </em>the endorsement of Benton, the payee, was his <em>genuine endorsement. </em>The present case is distinguishable from all those cited on the other side, on this point, which were cases of <em>contract </em>or <em>agreement in </em>reference to the endorsement, at the time the notes were made and put in circulation. Here there is no proof of such an agreement, and this being so, the payee is supposed to be the <em>owner </em>of the note, and to have passed it over to the holder for value, and in such a case his endorsement must be proved, aud if it be <em>is. forgery </em>the holder cannot recover. 7 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>468, <em>Lancaster vs. Baltzell. </em>9 <em>G. </em>&amp; J., 342, 361, <em>Key vs. Knott &amp; Wife.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b155-6\">5th. The ruling in the <em>third </em>and <em>eighth </em>exceptions was also correct. There was no evidence of any <em>general </em>authority given by Munroe to Harrison to sign his name to notes, nor that Munroe was <em>in the habit </em>of recognizing bis liability upon, or <em>paying </em>notes so signed and put in circulation by Harrison. .But even if he had previously paid <em>forged notes </em>without objection, it is no reason why he should be held liable on <em>these, </em>nor was his habit, even if proved, of endorsing \u2022notes for Harrison, and recognizing his liability on notes so \u25a0endorsed, any reason why he should be obliged to pay notes that were forgeries in fact.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b155-7\">Goldsborough, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Adg\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The,appellant instituted this suit in the circuit court for Prince George\u2019s county, against the appellee, as the joint drawer, with one George W. Harrison, of two promissory notes, one dated the 29th day of July 1857, for $750, and the other dated the 21st day of September 1857, for $450, payable respectively sixty days after date, to the order of James M. Benton, negotiable and payable at the Merchants Bank of Baltimore, with the name of James M. Benton endorsed on them, and passed to the appellant by Harrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">The appellee pleaded that he did not promise as alleged, \u2022and payment, and these pleas were put in issue by the replication of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>At the instance of the appellant, a commission to take testimony was issued and directed to two commissioners in Alexandria, Virginia; the commission was executed, and the testimony taken thereunder returned to the court from whence it issued. .</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">At the trial of the cause, the appellant took eight exceptions to the rulings of the court below, and the verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">We approve of the ruling of the court on the prayer of the plaintiff in the first exception, because by this prayer, the construction of the deed referred to, is submitted to the jury, when it ought to have been decided by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The court was also right in rejecting the prayer in the second exception; because, (hough the construction of the deed is reserved to the court, we find no sufficient identification of the notes, for the amount of which the suit was brought. The note for $750, it was urged by the appellant\u2019s counsel, was so nearly described by No. 17 in the deed; as to render the deed operative as to that note. But we cannot concur in this view. The note sued on is a joint and several note, signed by Harrison and Munroe and payable to Benton, dated the 29th of July 1857. The note referred to in the deed is anote dated the 2Glh July 1857, drawn <em>by </em>Harrison, and endorsed by Benton and Munroe. And it will not be contended, that if suit, were brought for such a note, the note in the plaintiff\u2019s nar. could be given in evidence to support it. The second note for $450, part of the appellant\u2019s cause of action, is nowhere, in terms, mentioned in the deed; and although the general provisions might, entitle the holder of these notes to participate in the fund, (upon which, however, we mean to express no opinion,) yet they cannot be construed so to include these notes, as to make the deed itself any evidence of a recognition by Munroe, of his liability upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The prayer in the <em>third </em>exception is liable to the same objection as that in the first, and, for the same reason, (he court was right in rejecting it.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"ATB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>(Decided March 27th, 1861.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The <em>first </em>prayer in the <em>fourth </em>exception was properly refused, because there is no evidence So sustain the theory of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The <em>second </em>prayer in the same exception couid not be granted, because, assuming as it, does, that Beaton\u2019s endorsement is not genuine, then, in order to bind Munroe, it. was necessary to find, not only that his name was signed by his authority or sanction, but also that Benton\u2019s name was endorsed with Munroe\u2019s knowledge and consent, of which, the record furnishes no evidence. We are of opinion, that the appellant cannot complain of the instruction granted by the circuit court, as sot forth in this exception. It afforded him an opportunity to introduce the evidence which would enable him to recover, if the case admitted of such proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">We approve of the court\u2019s ruling, contained in the <em>fifth </em>exception \u2014 we can see no objection to the admissibility of Benton\u2019s evidence. An endorser, when offered as a witness by the maker, is competent, because, although his testimony may defeat the action, and discharge the defendant, he might, nevertheless, be liable on the endorsement, and would lose the benefit of the judgment against the maker, to whom he would have a right to look for reimbursement. And, as to his <em>supposed interest </em>in the trust funds, it must be remembered, that the deed conveys the property of Harrison, and although Munroe ma]? escape this liability, it does not follow that the fund would be released from these notes as debts of Harrison.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">We also concur with the court below in rejecting the prayers of the appellant in the <em>sixth </em>and <em>seventh </em>exceptions, there being no evidence to show the complicity of the appellee in placing the name of Benton, as endoiser on the notes, in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The prayer in the <em>eighth </em>exception was, in our opinion, properly overruled. This part of the case was argued as if it presented a question of implied authority; but that is not the point of the prayer. A party cannot be held liable upon paper, on which his name has been <em>forged, </em>merely because he may have paid other forged notes without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"A-K\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
