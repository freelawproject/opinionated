That the evidence objected to in the first exception was inadmissible, as its only object was to influence the damages, and the matter of aggravation sought to be proved is not covered by the declaration. It comes within the principle decided in 13 Md. <em>Rep., </em>429.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b12-9\">2nd. There was error in granting the prayer of the appellee; 1st, because it overlooks or ignores the facts proved by the defendant, and which, being proved, constituted a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery within the opinion of this court, as expressed in 7 <em>Md. Rep., </em>366, 367. 2nd, because it entitled the plaintiff to,the verdict, in the event of the jury finding that the fence supposed to have been erected in March 1852, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Viobstructed the plaintiff in a <em>reasonable </em>enjoyment and use of said bank as a roadway,\u201d and is therefore inconsistent with the ruling of this court in 7 <em>Md.

That the ruling in the first exception was correct. 'The use made by the appellee of the mill, and the manner thereof, was a part of the history of the case, and with the \u25a0other facts in the cause, contribute to shed light upon the motives of the appellant, and enable the jury properly to estimate the conduct of the appellant, and the character of the case, with a view to fix the damages. And, besides, the allegations of the present declaration are broader than those in the previous case, in 13 <em>Md. Rep., </em>and cover just such evidence as this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-8\">2nd. That the court was right in its action in regard to the appellee\u2019s prayer, in submitting to the jury whether, under the circumstances given ia evidence, the fence was or was not an obstruction to the <em>reasonable enjoyment of </em>his right of way by the appellee. It <em>was </em>a question of fact, and properly left to the jury for their determination.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b13-9\">3rd. The court was also right in its rejection of the appellant\u2019s prayer, because it tabes from the jury the determination of the fact whether, under all the circumstances of the case, the erection of the fence on the banks of the race, by the appellant, was not an obstacle to the reasonable enjoyment of his right of way thereon by the appellee, to enter and clean out. his race, and repair its banks.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b13-10\">Le Grand, C. Jm</author>\n<p id=\"A-\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b13-11\">This case is before this court for the third time. Tins former decisions in regard to it may be found in 7 Md. <em>Rep., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>352, </em>and in 13 <em>Md. Rep., </em>429. Et is an action on the caso for obstructing a road running from the mill of the appellee to his mill-dam, which dam, and the portions of the road obstructed, are on the land of the appellant. The particular damage alleged in the declaration, as resulting to the plaintiff from the obstruction placed in the bod and across the road, is thus described: \u201cWhereby the said mill became, and was, during all the time aforesaid, idle and incapable of being worked, by reason of the said race and its banks being broken down and out of repair, so that the water could not flow through it from the same dam to the said mill, wherefore the plaintiff'lost all benefit and profit, which otherwise he would have had and made from the working of the said mill, and the custom and trade thereof, and the use of the same for grinding his own grain, and was, therefore, at great expense, obliged to carry it to other mills, that is to say, at the county aforesaid, whereby the said plaintiff saith he hath damage,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-5\">In the report of the first decision of this court in this case, the kind, extent and nature of the easement to which the plaintiff is entitled over the land of the defendant, are distinctly laid down. And, in the second decision, the kind of evidence on the question of special damage which is admissible, is pointed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-6\">Damages are claimed, because of the alleged obstructions, from the 27th day of August 1852.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-7\">After giving evidence of the titles under which the parties respectively claimed, the plaintiff offered to prove that the plaintiff was the owner of a large body of land around said mill, and that he was accustomed to grind his grain raised on said land at said mill for his cattle and horses as well as for the use of his hands and family, and that in consequence of the stoppage of said mill he had been compelled to carry his grain to another mill, at a greater distance. The defendant objected to the admissibility of this evidence, but the court overruled the objection and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b14-8\">We think the court properly overruled the objection to the admissibility of the testimony. It clearly related to the dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>nge alleged. Had the declaration in the case under consideration, been the same as that in the one reported in 13 Maryland, under the decision in that case it would have been inadmissible; but it is not, but broader and much more comprehensive in its specification of damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-5\">The circuit court must also be sustained on the second ex ception. The deposition of the witness Cecil, not being in the record, this court cannot be informed of its contents, and must, therefore, assume that it, was properly admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">The plaintiff'submitted a prayer which was granted, and the defendant another which was refused: to tiie granting of the one and the refusal of the other, the defendant excepted, and this constitutes the third exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-7\">Under the decision in 7 <em>Maryland, </em>the plainiiiPs prayer is clearly error. It is due to the learned judge who granted it to say, that his ruling was before the case in 7 <em>Maryland </em>was made known to him. We attach no importance to the use of the words, \u201cin a <em>reasonable enjoyment </em>and use of said bank,\u201d inasmuch as we regard such an use as the kind to which the plaintiff was entitled. In the decision in 7 <em>Maryland, </em>it was held, that to enable the plaintiff to maintain his action, it was incumbent upon him to show, that the obstruction of which he complained was a <em>material </em>one. If, therefore, it was of a character not to interfere with the <em>reasonable </em>enjojmient of the plaintiff of the use of the bank, it could not be a <em>material </em>obstruction to such use. In the connection in which they are used, the words must be taken as meaning the same thing. The error in the prayer, if the jury should believe the evidence of the defendant, consists in the fact, that the prayer authorises a recovery on the part of the plaintiff for the time subsequent to the removal of the obstruction, or rather its modification, so as fo render it not a <em>material </em>one within the meaning of this court in 7 <em>Maryland, </em>366. It was there said, \u201cthe plaintiff was not entitled to a verdict, if the jury believed the truth of the defendant\u2019s evidence in regard to the manner in which the road had been used, and in reference to the nature, character and structure of the ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>slructions, and the willingness and readiness of the defendant to have the obstructions removed, whenever the plaintiff had occasion to repair the dam and race, and that the plaintiff was informed of such readiness and willingness, and that he or his agents might remove them, if he or they thought proper to do so; which obstructions were so constructed as to be easily removed.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A6\">(Decided February 20th, 1861.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b16-5\">We are of the opinion the court improperly rejected the defendant\u2019s prayer. It merely denies the right of the plaintiff, <em>after </em>the 29th of July 1852, to recover damages for any obstruction. If the jury believed the evidence offered by the defendant as to the character of the fence, and as to the notice of the same given to the plaintiff, and the willingness of the defendant to remove the fence whenever he should be requested to do so, then the plaintiff was not entitled to recover for any alleged damage accruing after the 29th of July 1852, the time when the purpose of the defendant was communicated to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
