A. </em>Pearre, for the appellants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-8\">The testimony of the witnesses, Waltz, Smith and Bosley,&gt; states that Howard, in the year 1831 or 1832, took possession of \u201cElk Garden;\u20191 that he cleared some portion of the land,about sixty acres, deadened a small portion of timber, built two-houses, and <em>claimed </em>the <em>whole </em>tract. Howard died in 1834,- and there is no evidence that those claiming title under him Were themselves in possession of this land, or that <em>they claimed </em>the whole. The first and main question in this case is, whether the possession of Howard was adverse or not? Howard and the appellants were tenants in common at the time he took possession, and so continued, unless they are barred by adversary possession, continuing for twenty years.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-9\">1st. The law is well settled, that the possession and seisin of one tenant in common is- the possession and seisin of the other, because such possession is- not adverse to the right of his companion, but in support of their common title. He has the legal right to enter upon the common property, to cultivate it, to build upon it,, and to exercise every act of ownership. 4 <em>Kent, </em>387. One tenant in common cannot bring an action of trespass against another, for entry upon and enjoyment of the Common property; hence acts of ownership, cultivating land, building houses, &amp;c., are not facts from which an adverse possession may be inferred. It is entirely different with a- wrong doer, with one who enters without any right or title, he is a trespasser <em>ab initio, </em>and his acts sf user and ownership are adverse, because wrongfully done. A mere silent possession and perception of profits, will- not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>constitute an ouster. The tenant in common, who takes possession of property, does so rightfully. The title which he holds justifies his possession. He is equally entitled to lake possession of the common property, to use it, to exercise' acts of ownership over it, to inclose it, to cultivate it, as would be a sole owner. His rights are as extended, so far as the possession of the common property is involved, as they would be over property held in severalty. Who can arrest a tenant in common in the enjoyment of the common property?' If he incloses it, is he guilty of trespass? and who can arrest him in his acts of ownership and user? He enters upon the land rightfully, his possession is lawful, his acts of ownership are authorised. How then can an <em>inference </em>of adverse possession be made from such facts? For the profits derived he may be called to an account <em>in equity.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b450-5\">2nd. Whenever one tenant in common is in possession, his co-tenant is, in <em>contemplation of law, </em>in possession also, and it is necessary to prove an actual <em>ouster </em>to rebut this presumption, and the <em>onus </em>of proving this <em>actual ouster </em>is on the party alleging it. <em>Adams on Eject., </em>54. 4 <em>Kent, 387, Empsom vs. Shackleton, 5 Burr., </em>2604. It is true that an actual ouster need not be accompanied by actual force, but it must be proved by acts, or by declarations, brought home to the knowledge of the co-tenant. The mere fact that one tenant m common has been in exclusive possession of the property for more than twenty years, and that he has in that time received all of the profits, <em>will not constitute an actual ouster </em>or <em>adverse possession. Fisharr vs. Prosser, Cowp., </em>217. <em>Lloyd vs. </em>Gordon, 2 <em>H. &amp; McH., </em>260. <em>McClung vs. Ross, </em>5 <em>Wheat., </em>124. 3 <em>Met., </em>99, <em>Parker vs. Proprietors. </em>Why is it that the possession of one tenant in common for more than twenty years, receiving all of the profits, is not adverse? could any act be more adverse to the right of the co-tenant? It is because before an actual ouster exists it must be brought home to the knowledge of the co-tenant that his title is denied'. The presumptions of law are all in his favor, the law will not presume, without evidence, that any man intends to d:o an unlawful act, but will presume that every man,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>having a right of entry or possession, enters or occupies according to his title. An actual ouster may be proved by evidence, that a party refused to suffer his companion or his agent to enter, and <em>denied </em>his title, retaining exclusive pos. session' \u2014 or where his co tenant claims possession, denies his title. <em>Bracket vs. Norcross, </em>1 <em>Greenlf., </em>91. <em>Hellings vs. Bird, </em>11 <em>East., </em>48. So also where the interest of one tenant in common was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale, and the purchasers conveyed to others, who were in possession for twenty-seven years, <em>without acknowledging </em>the title of the other co-tenants, it was held <em>not </em>sufficient to create a presumption of an ouster-. <em>Northrop vs. Wright, </em>24 <em>Wend., </em>224, 225. In the language of Chief Justice Marshall in <em>McClung vs. Ross, </em>there must be some \u201cact which can amount to an ouster, or give <em>notice </em>to his co-tenant that his possession is adverse\u201d \u2014 and in the language of the Court of Appeals in <em>Lloyd vs. Gordon, </em>the co-tenant must be <em>\u201cactually put out, </em>or his title to hold in common uniformly denied.\u201d The language used by Lord Mansfield in <em>Fishar vs. Prosser </em>is, that a refusal to pay a co-tenant his part of the rent or profits, without <em>denying </em>his title, is not sufficient. The facts proved by the witnesses, (supposing, for the present, that a <em>continuous </em>possession had been proved, which we deny,) were acts of user and ownership, by Howard, such as cultivating the land, building two houses, and a <em>claim, </em>by Howard to the whole tract. The acts of ownership are not facts legally sufficient to warrant an ouster, and the only testimony which can go to show this actual ouster, is the claim of Howard to the whole tract. There is no testimony to show that Andrew A. Van Bibber, under whom tiie appellants claim, knew of this claim of Howard; on the contrary, the witnesses state that they were <em>ignorant </em>of Van Bibber\u2019s title, and there is no testimony to show that Howard had any knowledge of it. One of the elements of title by adverse possession is, that it is a <em>hostile </em>invasion of another\u2019s rights. <em>Armstrong vs. Risteau, </em>5 <em>Md. Rep., </em>257. Some positive act must show it, <em>Matthews vs. Ward, </em>10 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>457. We have in this case nothing but the statement of one or two witnesses ignorant themselves of Van Bibber\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>title, stating, that Howard claimed the whole \u2014 can a bare claim, not brought to the knowledge of another, a claim of which he was ignorant, a declaration made in a mountainous region, unfrequented almost by man, be considered a hostile invasion of a right? The land was then worthless almost, being nearly 6000 acres of wild land. Howard living but three years after he purchased, his declaration of claiming the whole, to two or three visitors, unsupported by any other fact, cannot warrant a jury in finding an actual ouster, or adverse possession. <em>To be a '\u25a0\u2019\u25a0hostile invasion\u201d of Tan Bibber\u2019s right, he must know it, </em>else it would be in the power of every tenant in common, by a simple declaration of his claim to his neighbors, to oust his companion. The analogies of the law will sustain this position. Take the case of a party who loans or hires a slave to another; it makes no matter how long the borrower or hirer may continue in possession, and although he may claim title to the property and claim to hold adversely to the owner, yet it will be no bar to an action of replevin on the part of the owner, unless the party who claims adversely can bring the <em>fact </em>of the adverse <em>cXoAm to \\he knowledge of </em>the owner. <em>Callis vs. Tolson, 6 G. &amp; J., </em>92. <em>Cole vs. Hebb, 7 G. &amp; J., </em>20. So with the tenant in common; he takes possession of the property under the sanction of law; possession is his right, he may rightfully continue that possession, and if he claims adversely, he must establish by positive proof, or by facts, which will justify the jury in finding that his co-tenant, out of possession, knew that the one in possession, claimed to hold adversely. It cannot be compared to the possession of a wrong doer, to (he possession of one who enters without any claim or title \u2014 in the latter case the wrong doer takes possession fortiously, the possession itself is adverse, and the burthen of proof is on the party claiming to show that it was not. The testimony also shows, that Howard was ignorant of the Yan Bibber title. The witnesses state that they never heard of it, and there is no testimony to show that Howard knew it. The case of <em>Cresap vs. Hutson, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>269, decides, that where one is ignorant of another\u2019s title there can be no adverse holding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>The very nature of an adverse holding is, that it is a denial of another\u2019s rights, there can be no denial of a right of which a party is ignorant. The fact that one tenant in common is in possession, ignorant of the title of a co-tenant, but believing the whole is vested in him, cannot constitute that possession an adverse holding; something positive must exist, an intention to oust his co-tenant must be in his mind; that, intention cannot be existing when he is <em>ignorant of the </em>co-tenancy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b453-5\">3rd. To give a title by possession it must be adverse, exclusive and <em>continuous </em>for twenty years. In <em>Stump vs. </em>Henry, 6 <em>Md. Rep., </em>201, the court say, \u201cthat where a right of possession exists, such right could not be barred by possession alone, unless it should be adverse, exclusive and continuous, for at least twenty years. And any recognition or acknowledgment of such right by the party in' possession, will prevent his possession from operating as a bar to such right, until <em>twenty </em>years <em>after </em>the acknowledgment has been made.\u201d The adverse holding may have begun, yet a recognition of a right will arrest the statute, and it must <em>again </em>begin from tile time of the recognition. In other words, <em>it </em>must be continuous \u2014 no break in it. It can not be inferred but must be proved in the case of co-tenants. We have in this case no such proof; there is nothing from which to infer it \u2014 Howard took possession in 1831, he died in 1834. The single fact upon which his adverse holding is based, is his claim to the whole. There is no proof to show that those immediately claiming under him, ever claimed it. Smith simply states, that Howard claimed it, but states nothing of those claiming under Howard. Waltz says, he \u201c'never heard of any claim by the Tan Bibbers, or any other persons, except Bruce and Armstrong the agents of the devisees of Howard.\u201d Bosley does not state that those claiming title from Howard claimed the whole. Supposing that Howard\u2019s claim to the whole was a fact to justify the jury in finding adverse possession, can an inference be made that those succeeding, also claimed the whole, and hence held adversely in the absence of all proof? No inference of the kind can be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>against a co-fenant. <em>Prima facie </em>the possession of one is the possession of all, unity of possession is the distinguishing feature of a co-tenancy. It must be positively proved not only that Howard held adversely, (by claiming the whole,) but that his devisees also so held without any interruption for twenty years. The case of <em>Russell vs. </em>Baker, 1 <em>H. &amp; </em>J., 71, establishes this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b454-5\">Bosley did not rent until Waltz\u2019s lease had expired. If the testimony of Waltz was admissible, yet he did not lease or take possession until <em>at least </em>six months after Howard\u2019s death. Here is a <em>hiatus, </em>a breach in the adverse possession. Bruce was not in possession; and continued <em>actual </em>possession must exist. Bosley was not in possession until the lease of Waltz expired, which was not until 1838 or 1840. Although in the statement of Bosley\u2019s testimony it is set forth, \u201cthat on Howard\u2019s death, Bosley rented from Howard\u2019s devisees,\u201d it is reo\u00ed stated that he rented from such agent <em>immediately </em>after the death of Howard. Waltz says, he occupied it as lessee until 1838 or 1840, and that Bosley did not rent the property until his lease expired. There is no contradiction, but it is established without any conflict, that Bosley was not in possession until certainly 1838, four years, at feast,, after the death of Howard. If Waltz\u2019s testimony was inadmissible, then the only possession of the appellees, or of those under whom they claim, was that of Bosley in 1838 or 1840, destroying the <em>continuity </em>of the <em>adverse possession.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b454-6\"><em>Henry Bruce </em>and <em>Thos.

The original entry in this case was under color of title, viz., the deed from the sheriff to Howard, which, in its<em>habendum </em>clause, conveys the <em>whole tract </em>to the grantee therein. The possession, therefore, need not be by actual enclosures of the entire tract, but being under color of title, it extended to the entire boundaries of the tract, and this would be so even though the writing which constituted the color of title was void and good for nothing, which is not the case here, and, <em>a fortiori, </em>this case is much stronger. <em>5 Md.

It is true that the possession of one tenant, in common <em>recognizing the title </em>of his co-tenant, is, in legal contemplation, the possession of all, yet it is equally true that one tenant can oust his co-tenant, and hold adversely against him. The question of ouster is not one of law, but of fact for the jury, and it may be inferred by the jury from the facts and circumstances. <em>Adams on Eject., 55, </em>56, and <em>notes. </em>8 <em>Smedes </em>&amp; <em>Mar., </em>90, <em>Grafton vs. Grafton. </em>4 <em>Grattan, </em>22, <em>Purcell &amp; Wife, vs. Wilson. </em>10 <em>Verm., </em>593, <em>Hall vs. Dewey, </em>10 <em>Mass., </em>468, <em>Cummings vs. Wyman. </em>2 <em>Greenlf., </em>242, <em>Little vs. Libby.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-6\">3rd.

Mere silent possession,recognizing title of co-tenant,, or bare receipts of rents and profits, are not. sufficient to authorize a jury to presume or find an ouster; nor will the <em>mere-running </em>the lines of a tract, where the party claims no title. The cases on the part of the appellant, go to this extent, and no further. In 5 <em>Burr., </em>2608, the party always admitted the other\u2019s title. In <em>Stump vs. </em>Henry, 6 <em>Md. Rep., </em>202, Richie admitted the title, and it is placed on that ground. In <em>Matthews vs Ward, </em>10 <em>G. </em>&amp; <em>J., </em>457, it was held, there must be some <em>positive </em>act, and not a <em>mere </em>failure to recognize the other\u2019s title.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b455-7\">4th. What facts are sufficient to authorize the jury to find an ouster? 1st. Long continued possession, without any demand of rents, or acknowledgment of title or claim made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>plaintiff. <em>Cowp., </em>218, <em>Fishar vs. Prosser. </em>9 <em>Watts, </em>363, <em>Mehaffy vs. Dobbs. </em>6 <em>Cowen, </em>633, <em>Jackson vs. Whitbeck. </em>1 <em>Caines' Rep., </em>84, <em>Van Dyck vs. Tan Buren. 5 Day, </em>188, <em>Bryan vs. Atwater. </em>1 <em>Greenlf., </em>91, <em>Bracket vs. Norcross. </em>6 <em>Dana, </em>432, <em>Chambers vs. Pleak. </em>2nd. The entry of one claiming the <em>whole </em>to himself, is adverse. <em>Adams on Eject., 56. 5 Day, </em>188. 8 <em>B. Munroe, </em>186, <em>Gill, et al., vs. Fauntelroy's heirs. </em>4 <em>Dev., </em>291, <em>Cloud vs. Webb. </em>3rd. So if one sell the whole, and possession be held adversely for .twenty years, the sale and possession amount to an ouster. 13 <em>Sergt. &amp; Rawle, </em>358, <em>Culler vs. Motzer. </em>17 <em>Pick., </em>246, <em>Rittredge vs. Locks &amp; Canals. </em>13 <em>Johns., </em>406, <em>Jackson vs. Smith. </em>10 Pick., 161, <em>Bigelow vs. Jones. </em>4th. The making of improvements, such as buildings, fences, &amp;c., is another circumstance from which, with others, ouster may be inferred, 10 <em>Mass, </em>468, <em>Cummings vs. Wyman. </em>3 <em>Strob., </em>498, <em>Gray vs. Bates. </em>3 <em>How., </em>689, <em>Clymer vs. Dawkins. </em>4 <em>Mason, </em>329, <em>Prescott vs. Nevers, et al. </em>5th. One tenant in common cannot maintain ejectment against his co-tenant, unless there be an actual ouster. 7 <em>Cranch., </em>456, <em>Bar nitz</em>\u2019 <em>lessee, vs. Casey. Adams on </em>Eject., 91. Now if the facts proved do-not authorize the jury to infer an ouster, the plaintiff could not maintain ejectment. When did this ouster arise? If it ever existed at all, it was more than twenty years before suit brought..</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-6\">5th. No' <em>actual </em>notice was necessary to be proved of an adverse holding. In this case the original entry was not by <em>permission </em>or consent of plaintiff. It was adverse in its inception, being made under claim of title to the whole. Being hostile at the start, no actual knowledge was necessary to ber proved, for its notoriety, &amp;e., in law, brings it home to the lessors of the plaintiff. 2 <em>Greenlf. on Ev., sec. </em>430. 6 <em>Pick., </em>178, <em>Poignard vs. Smith. </em>The cases in <em>G. &amp; J., </em>92, and 7 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>20, cited on the other side, were cases in which possession commenced by <em>consent; </em>of course it could not. become adverse except by notice, but that is not the case' here, for it was hostile in its inception.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b456-9\">It is.submitted,, therefore,.upon these authorities, that thsa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>two prayers of the defendant were properly granted. They submit the question of <em>ouster </em>to the jury, as one of fact, to be found by them; and the authorities cited show that from these facts they <em>might </em>find the ouster. If they did not find it, of course the plaintiff could not recover; but still it was competent for them so to find.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-5\"><em>Note. </em>\u2014 The arguments on other points oil both sides are omiited.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b457-6\">GoLDsnoRooun, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AdY\">delivered the opinion of this court:</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">This is an action of ejectment, brought in the circuit court for Allegany county by the appellants, on the 18th day of December 1856, to recover one undivided fourth part of a tract of land called \u2018-'Elk Garden,\u201d containing about six thousand acres of land lying in Allegany county.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">The lessors of the plaintiff claim this undivided fourth part of the said tract, as the heirs at law of Andrew Van Bibber, and concede that the defendants are entitled to the other three-fourths, tracing their title through Henry P, Van Bibber and a certain Brice W. .Howard.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">The defendants came into court and having under the consent rule, confessed lease, entry and actual ouster, pleaded the general issue, and prayed the court for a warrant of resurvey. The warrant was accordingly issued, and the surveyor returned his certificate of resurvey. There being no question as to location, the plats and certificates form no part of this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">While the defendants concede that the plaintiff has the paper title to the property in controversy, they yet maintain, that the plaintiff\u2019s lessors are barred from recovery by the adverse possession of the defendants, and of those under whom they claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">At the trial below, trie defendants to sustain the issue on their part, offered sundry deeds mentioned in the record, to the admissibility of which the plaintiff excepted. They also offered the evidence of Thomas Dovocmon and William Waltz, to which the plaintiff also-excepted. The plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>lessors then presented to the court nine prayers, and the defendants two prayers. The court rejected each of the plaintiff\u2019s prayers, and granted those of the defendants; to which ruling of the court, the plaintiff excepted. And the verdict and judgment being for the defendants, the plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The lessors of the plaintiff, and the defendants or those under whom they claim, standing in the relation of tenants in common, it would have been necessary for the plaintiff in the absence of the confession by the defendants, of lease, entry and actual ouster, to prove the ouster to entitle him to recover. In the case of <em>Tongue vs. Nutwell, </em>(ante 212,) decided by this court at the present term, the rule laid down in <em>Dorsey on Eject., page </em>16, sustained by <em>Adams on Ejectment, </em>263, was recognized-and approved; that \u201cthe defendant ought to have applied to the court upon affidavit for a special rule to confess lease, entry and not ouster. And if the tenant in common, &amp;c., acknowledges the ouster, he will be precluded from denying, or, in other words, of showing, that the plaintiff has not been injured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Regarding this case as dependent on the question of adverse possession alone, and conceding that the written and parol evidence excepted to, was properly permitted to go to the jury; yet we are of opinion, that the court below erred in rejecting the prayers of the plaintiff, and as the prayers of the defendants are but the converse of those of the plaintiff, they ought to have been rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The witnesses Waltz, Smith and Bosley, upon whom the defendants rely to show an adverse possession, state that Howard, in the year 1S31 or 1832, took possession of \u201cElk Garden,\u201d that he cleared some portion of the land, about sixty acres, deadened a small portion of the timber, built two houses, and <em>claimed </em>the <em>whole </em>tract; yet there is no evidence that those claiming title under him, were ever in possession or that they claimed the whole, nor is there any evidence to show, that Howard\u2019s claim was ever brought to the knowledge of the lessors of the plaintiff, or to the knowledge of those under whom they claim.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Af1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>(Decided Oct. 29th, 1861)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">It is a familiar principle of law, that a tenant in common enters upon land held in common, rightfully, that his possession is lawful, and his acts of ownership are authorised, and no <em>inference </em>of adverse possession can be made from such facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Whenever one tenant in common is in possession, his co-tenant is, in contemplation of law, in possession also, and it is necessary to prove an actual ouster to rebut this presumption, and the <em>onus </em>of proving the <em>achual </em>ouster, is on the party alleging it. <em>Adams on Eject., </em>54. 4 <em>Kent, </em>387. The actual ouster need not be proved to have been accompanied by positive force, but must be established by acts or declarations, <em>brought home </em>to the knowledge of the co-tenant. The mere fact that one tenant in common, has been in exclusive possession of property for more than twenty years, and that he has in that time, received all of the profits, will not constitute ail actual ouster or adverse possession. <em>Lloyd vs. </em>Gordon, 2 <em>H. &amp; McH., </em>260. <em>McClung vs. Ross, 5 Wheat., </em>124.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">In <em>Northrop vs. Wright, </em>24 <em>Wend., </em>224, 225, it was held, that where the interest of one tenant in common was sold at sheriff\u2019s sale, and the purchasers conveyed to others, who were in possession for twenty-seven years, without acknowledging the title of the other co-tenants, it was not considered sufficient to create the presumption of an ouster. Chief Justice Marshall, in <em>McClung vs. Ross, </em>5 <em>Wheat., </em>124, says, there must be some \u201cact which can amount to an ouster, or notice must be given to his co-tenant that his possession is adverse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">One of the elements of title by adverse possession is, that it is a <em>hostile </em>invasion <em>of </em>another\u2019s rights. <em>Armstrong vs. Risteau\u2019s lessee, 5 Md. Rep., </em>257. Some positive act must show it. 10 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>457.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">We regard these principles of law as applicable to this case, and the prayers of the plaintiff fully sustained hy them and the authorities cited. They ought therefore to have been granted, and the defendants\u2019 rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"ACD\"><em>Judgment reversed and procedendo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
