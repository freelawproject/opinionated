Plea, no promise as alleged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-9\">The protests of these notes, purporting to be made as they respectively matured, by Gardiner Spring, Jr., Notary Public in the city of New York, are in the usual form, stating that at the request of the Mechanics Bank of that city, the holder of said notes, he duly presented, each of them, to the paying teller of the Bank of the Republic in said city, and demanded payment thereof, which was refused, &lt;fcc. A commission was issued to the city of New York, under which testimony in reference to the protests and notices of protests of these notes, was taken and returned, from which it appears the witnesses testified in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>Spring, </em>the notary, says he protested the notes as they respectively matured, through the agency of George Ireland, Jr., <em>his clerk, </em>who was also a notary, acting as such for said Mechanics Bank; that none of these notes were presented by witness personally, but the presentments were made, as appears by his notarial register, either by George Ireland, Jr., John Hickson, Jr., or William C. Ford, <em>who loere all at that time acting in his employment.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-5\"><em>Hickson, </em>says, he presented, on the days they respectively matured, two of the notes, which he specifies, to the said Bank of the Republic, and demanded payment thereof, which was refused, and on the days respectively following the protests of each of said <em>five notes, </em>he deposited in the post office in the city of New York <em>\u201cnotices of </em>protest,\u201d postage prepaid, of each of said notes, severally addressed to James M. Benton, Elizabeth Harrison and John H. Munroe, Alexandria, Ya.; that every one of these notices so mailed by him was filled up from a printed form, signed by said Spring, as notary, similar in every respect to the following.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-6\"><em>New </em>York,--1857.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-7\">$--Please take notice that a promissory note made by-for f&gt; \u2014 dated--payable --and endorsed by you, is this day dishonored and duly protested for non-pay; ment, and that the holders look to you for the payment thereof;\u201d that said printed form was in each case filled up with the amount, date of protest, and place of payment of each note; and that the said Mechanics Bank was the agent of the plaintiffs at the time of these protests.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-10\"><em>Ireland </em>and <em>Ford, </em>prove, that <em>as clerks </em>for said Spring, (the former being also himself a notary,) they presented the other three of said notes, on the days they respectively matured, to said Bank of the Republic, and demanded payment thereof, which was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-11\">This commission to the city of New York was directed to Jonathan S.

The defendant objected to the sufficiency of said proof for the purpose for which it was offered, but the court (Crain, J.) overruled this objection and permitted said proof to go to the jury as sufficient evidence to prove a demand and notice to the defendant to bind him as endorser. To this ruling the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-6\"><em>2nd Exception. </em>After the evidence detailed in the preceding exception, made part of this, the defendant proved by Benton, the first alleged endorser on all of said notes, (who, after objection sustained to his competency, was restored thereto by a release of the defendant from all liabilities on account of his said alleged endorsements, made in open court and reduced to writing,) that his own name, as payee, and first alleged endorser of said notes, was not in his own proper handwriting, but was a forgery made by the maker of said notes, and that the names of Elizabeth Harrison and of the defendant was also not in. their handwritings respectively, but were attempted imitations thereof. (The residue of this exception is fully set out in the opinion of this court.) The verdict and judgment were in favor of the plaintiffs and the defendant appealed.

It directs that it shall be returned under the hand' and <em>seal </em>of the <em>commissioner; </em>he signs it as <em>Notary Public, </em>and without a seal. It also directs that the witnesses shall be sworn \u201con the Holy Evangelist of Almighty God,\u201d whereas the return states simply that the witnesses were \u201cduly sworn.\u201d For these reasons the return was defective, and the court below was wrong in admitting the evidence taken under it, as <em>sufficient </em>evidence to prove demand and notice, upon objection being made to <em>\u201cthe sufficiency of said </em>proof.\u201d 4 <em>Md. Rep., </em>368, <em>Young &amp; Wife vs. Mackall.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-6\">2nd. But even if the evidence was admissible, it was not sufficient to prove <em>demand </em>and <em>notice. </em>The notary proves that he neither made the demands, nor even the protests, but that he did it through <em>his clerks. </em>One of such clerks only sent the <em>notices, </em>whilst the demands were made, some by one, and some by others of such clerks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-7\">3rd. The rulings in the second exception was also erroneous. There is no evidence embraced in the exception, upon which the instruction of the court could be based, and besides it omits to put to the finding of the jury material facts necessary to entitle <em>th&amp; plaintiffs to recover. </em>But besides the doctrine contended for on the other side, upon this exception, that the last endorser admits the signatures of the previous endorsers, does not apply to cases where he did not know that such previous endorsements were forgeries.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-8\"><em>C.

There can be no valid objection to the return of the commission, for though the return in the body of the commission is signed by Ely as <em>Notary Public, </em>yet he signs and <em>seals, </em>as <em>convmissioner, </em>the endorsement thereon, which states: \u201cThe execution of this commission appears in a certain schedule hereunto annexed.\u201d This is a sufficient authentication and return.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b170-10\">2nd. The evidence was sufficient to show a demand and <em>notice of protest </em>to the defendant; it clearly shows that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>demands were properly made 5 that the protests were made by a notary public, and that due notices of these protests was given to the defendant, and it can make no difference that fel such a large commercial city as New York, that a part of this duty was done by the <em>notary\u2019s clerks.

The instruction of the court in the 2nd exception was also correct, the proposition of that instruction being, that if the name of Munroe, the last endorser, was placed upon these notes, by him or by his authority, then that he thereby admits the endorsements by the preceding parties to the notes to be genuine and cannot deny them. <em>Story on Prom.

Harrison was the drawer, and the appellant, together with James M. Benton and Elizabeth Harrison, were endorsers.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">The appellant pleaded that he did not promise as alleged, and the appellees, by their replication, joined issue thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">At the trial of this cause, the appellees offered in evidence to the jury, the testimony taken under a commission to Jonathan S. Ely, of the city of New York, for the purpose of showing a sufficient demand of payment and notice of dishonor to the appellant, as endorser, but the appellant\u2019s counsel objected to the sufficiency of said proof for the purpose for which it was offered, but the court overruled the objection and permitted the proof to go to the jury as sufficient evidence to prove a demand and notice, to bind the appellant, as endorser. The defendant then offered the evidence of James <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>M. Renton, contained in the second exception, and prayed the court to instruct the jury that if they should find from the evidence that the names of James M. Benton and of Elizabeth Harrison, as alleged endorsers, on said notes, were not in their proper handwriting respectively, but were forgeries, and made by the said maker of the notes, without their knowledge or consent, that then they must find a verdict for the defendant, but the court refused said prayer of the defendant, but instructed the jury, that notwithstanding they may find that the names of James M. Benton and Elizabeth Harrison, the alleged first and second endorsers on said notes were forgeries, yet if they found from <em>theevidence </em>that the signature of John H. Munroe, the defendant, the alleged last endorser, was in his own proper handwriting, or made by his authority, that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover in this action. To which opinion of the court, and to its instruction to the jury, the defendant excepted, and the verdict and judgment being against him, he appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The ruling of the court below in the first exception, we approve. By reference to the commission and the testimony taken under it, and which was submitted to the jury, it will appear that the several notes in controversy in this suit, were regularly protested, and the several protests, under the notarial seal of the notary, contain every material allegation of a proper protest. It was objected by the appellant\u2019s counsel that the notary employed clerks to perform part of the duties incident to his office. We cannot regard this as a valid objection. In a commercial community so extensive as New York, it would be almost impossible for a notary to execute every portion of his duty without aid, and the custom of merchants, and the current of authorities upon this subject, sanction the employment of such aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">It was also objected that the commission, when executed, was not properly authenticated and returned. This objection, we conceive, has no weight. It will be seen by reference to the record, that the commissioner, Jonathan S. Ely, returned \u201csaid commission together with his return thereto, and sundry other papers connected therewith, which are in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the words following, to wit,\u201d &amp;c., and at the conclusion of the commission, though he signs his name as Notary Public, yet the commission is endorsed, \u201cthe execution of this commission appears in a certain schedule hereunto annexed. Jonathan S. Ely, Oommr. <em>Seal.\u201d</em></p>\n<decisiondate id=\"ANq\">(Decided March 27th, 1861.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The second exception seems to have been very hastily and imperfectly drawn, and does not present the question upon which, we suppose, the circuit court decided. If the evidence taken under the commission in Alexandria had been embraced or referred to in this exception, we should be prepared to affirm the action of the circuit court upon the defendant\u2019s prajmr. But we are compelled to deal with the exception as it is brought before us, and must reverse the judgment both upon the refusal of the defendant\u2019s prayer and the instruction granted by the court. This last is liable not only to the objection, before stated, of having no evidence to support it, set out in the exception, (to which we are confined in passing upon the prayer,) but it is also liable to the objection that it informs the jury that the plaintiffs <em>are entitled, to </em>recover, upon the finding only that the signature of the defendant was in his proper handwriting or made by his authority. Thus omitting, entirely, material facts which were necessary to the maintenance of the action, and however clear the evidence may have been to prove the facts, it was necessary for the jury to pass upon it. See 10 <em>Md. Rep., </em>346, and 16 <em>Md. Rep., </em>445, and the cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
