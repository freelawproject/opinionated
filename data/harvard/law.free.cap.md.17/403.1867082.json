The obvious intent and purpose of the deed was, that the trust <em>should continue </em>for the benefit of the child or children of the wife, and the title of the trustee was meant to continue, with the obligation and duty to preserve the property for their benefit, at least until they should become <em>sui juris.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-7\">By the common law, a <em>cestui que trust </em>has no standing in' court <em>in propria persona; </em>he can only assert his rights in a court of chancery; at law the trustee, though clothed with the mere dry legal title, is regarded as the real owner, and his name must be used in any action or other proceeding affecting the title te the property.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-8\">Personalty is not within the statute of uses, and the legal title to such property, under a deed of trust, is unaffected by the operation of that statute.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b411-9\">When a trust has been created in personalty, and all the purposes of the trust have ceased or at an end, the absolute estate is in the person entitled to the last use, hut this must depend on the plain intent and meaning of the instrument.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b411-10\">Appeal from the Circuit Court for Calvert county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXY\"><em>Assumpsit, </em>brought on the 8th of October 1857, by the appellants against the appellees, to recover the hire of certain negro slaves, alleged to be the property of the plaintiffs\u2019 ward.

Wood; that Charlotte died in September 1846, <em>leaving </em>an only child, the ward of the plaintiffs, who are admitted to be her guardians, and that James D.

They further proved the value of the annual hires of said negroes during the period they so remained in the sole possession of the surviving husband.

Charlotte, then to hold the same to the use of such person or persons, or for such intents and. <em>purposes </em>as the said Charlotte, whether covert or sole, at any time or times hereafter, ;during her life, by any deed or instrument of writing to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>executed by her, or by her last will and testament in writing, or any writing purporting to be her last will and testament, executed as such, shall, notwithstanding her coverture, limit, direct or appoint, <em>and in default of any such limitation, direction or appointment by </em>her, <em>the said </em>Charlotte, <em>then to use of the said </em>Charlotte, <em>her heirs and assigns forever-, </em>and whereas the said Charlotte is possessed of a considerable personal estate, and by this agreement the said James hath agreed to relinquish the whole interest which the law would give him therein, in case the intended marriage takes place, now, in consideration thereof, the said Charlotte doth hereby covenant and agree to take the provision hereby made for her, as and for her jointure, and in lieu and satisfaction of all such dower or thirds at law which she could or might have claimed or been entitled to, should the intended marriage take place, out of or from any of the lands or personal estate whereof the said James now is or hereafter may be seized or possessed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-5\">The court (Brewer, J.) refused to let the said marriage contract be read to. the jury, and was of opinion that it gave to the plaintiff's no right of action whatever for the recovery of the annual hires of said slaves from the defendants, as executors as aforesaid, and instructed the jury that they must find a verdict for the defendants under all the proof in the case.

The proof shows that the slaves in question belonged, before her marriage, to Charlotte A. Denton, the wife of the defendants\u2019 testator, and mother of Delia Denton, the ward of the plaintiffs, and were conveyed by the ante-nuptial deed or settlement, executed by James D. Denton and wife, on the 13th day of July 1838, (for which see <em>ante </em>404.) The only exception taken below, was to the refusal of the circuit court to allow the deed or marriage settlement to be offered in evidence by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">In the argument of the cause in this court., it was not denied that the effect of the deed was to vest the legal estate in the trustee named therein, for the use of James Denton, and Charlotte, his wife, during their joint lives, and upon the death of Charlotte, without having made any disposition or appointment, for the use of her only child, Delia Denton, the ward of the plaintiffs. And we think, by a proper construe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>tion of the deed, and under the proof in the cause, the whole equitable interest in the negroes mentioned devolved upon Delia Denton, on the death of her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">13ut the question presented by the bill of exceptions, for the decision of this court, is, whether the ward of the plaintiffs had, under the deed, such a title as will enable them to maintain a suit at law? On the part of the appellants it has been contended, that on the death of Charlotte, without having made a deed or will, the object of the trust was fully accomplished, and that the whole estate, legal and equitable, became vested in the <em>cestui que use. </em>On the other hand, it is argued that the evidence offered disclosed a mere equitable-title in Delia Denton, which could not authorize her guardians to sue at law; the legal estate having been conveyed to a trustee, and being still outstanding. If this latter view be correct, then there was no error in the action of the circuit court; for no principle is better settled than that \u201cby the common law, a <em>cestui que trust </em>has no standing in court <em>vet propria </em>persona; he can only assert his rights in a court of chancery. <em>Green vs. Johnson, </em>3 <em>G. </em>&amp; J., 389. At law the trustee, although clothed with the mere dry legal title, \u201cis regarded as the real owner, and his name must be used in any action or other proceeding affecting the title to the property.\u201d <em>Hill on Trustees, </em>316. Unless, therefore, under the marriage settlement, the trust terminated on the death of Mrs. Denton, and the legal estate became vested in her daughter, this action cannot be maintained. This depends upon the construction of the deed. Personalty is not within the statute of uses,, and the legal title to the property, in this case, is unaffected by the operation of that statute. In <em>Hill on Trustees, </em>248, it is said, that \u201cthe question as to the duration of the estate of the trustees, can rarely arise where the subject is personal estate; for in that case the whole legal interest is, in general, vested in the trustees by a gift, without any words of limitation, and will continue in them until divested by a legal transfer or assignment.\u201d See, also, <em>Hanson &amp; Wife, vs. Worthington, </em>12 <em>Md. Rep., </em>419. It is undoubtedly true, that \u201cwhen a trust has been created in personalty, and all th&amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>purposes of the-trust have ceased, or are at an end, the absolute estate is in the person entitled to the last use.\u201d <em>Rice vs. </em>Burnett, 1 <em>Speers Eq. Rep., 579. Harley vs. Platts, </em>6 <em>Rich. Law Rep., </em>315. But this must depend on the plain intent and meaning of the instrument creating the (rust. Looking at the provisions of the marriage settlement in this case, we find no sufficient ground for saying that it intended the trust to terminate, and the estate of the trustee to be divested on the death of Mrs. Denton; on the contrary, the obvious intent and purpose was, that the trust should continue for the benefit of her child or children; and the title of the trustee was meant to continue, with the obligation and duty to preserve the property for their benefit, at least until they should become <em>sui juris.</em></p>\n<decisiondate id=\"A7K\">(Decided Oct. 29th, 1861.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">If Lavielle, the trustee selected by the deed, were now living, and asserting his title to the property, of to their hire, in a court of law, it can hardly be questioned that his right would be supported; and the same principle would apply to a new trustee, if one had been appointed in his place. The deed offered in evidence showed only an equitable title in the plaintiffs, which could give them no standing in a court of law, and there was no error in its rejection as evidence..</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed,.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
