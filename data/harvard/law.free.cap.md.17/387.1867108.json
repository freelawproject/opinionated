The first question in the case arises upon the defendant\u2019s demurrer to the declaration. The plaintiff having <em>joined </em>in demurrer, and not having taken any exception to the action of the court in overruling his'ne <em>recipiatur </em>to this demurrer, because, of the previous plea and issue, it is too late now for him to make the objection. But besides this there was a demurrer by the plaintiff to tiie defendant\u2019s <em>second </em>amended plea, which was sustained by the court, and this demurrer mounts up to the first error in pleading. 10 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>27, <em>State vs. Nichols. </em>The sufficiency of the declaration is, therefore, clearly lip for review, and it is insisted that the variance between the writ and the declaration is fatal on demurrer. The suit is against Kent in his individual capacity, whilst, the declaration, on its face, discloses a <em>joint </em>contract of the defendant and Thos. H. Kent of Jos. <em>Coll, on Part., </em>419, 420, <em>(Ed. of </em>1834.) In the case of <em>Merrick vs. Bank of Metropolis, </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>74, 75, it was decided, that if the declaration discloses that the promise is joint, it is necessary to aver that the other joint promissor is dead, or to account for his not being joined in the action, or it is bad upon demurrer or writ of error. It was not necessary, therefore, to plead in abatement, in order to take advantage of this objection. See, also, on this point, 1 <em>Chitty's Pl., </em>46, 47. 13 <em>Md. Rep., </em>117, 122, <em>Balt. Cemetery Co., vs. Independent Church. Smith\u2019s Lead. Cases, </em>294.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-9\">2nd. The defendant\u2019s second plea was good, and the demurrer to it should not have been sustained. If the defendant was liable at all it was by reason of having, as acceptor, <em>promised, </em>by his acceptance, to pay the bill at maturity. This promise was necessarily implied from his acceptance, and therefore was properly traversed by this second plea. <em>Act &amp;f </em>1856, <em>ch. 112, sub-ch. 2, Art. </em>6, <em>sec. </em>80.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>3rd. The questions presented by the exceptions relate to the variance between the declaration and the bill of exchange offered in evidence, and, it is submitted, (his variance is fatal. The <em>narr. </em>states the draft was drawn by J. T. Lyles &amp; Co., when the record shows it was drawn by J. T. Lyles. The <em>narr. </em>states, that it was accepted by Daniel Kent and Thos, H. Kent of Jos.&amp; Co., whereas the draft offered in evidence was accepted by Thos. H. Kent of Jos. &amp; Co. The narr. states, that the draft was endorsed by Mackall to the plaintiff) whereas that offered in evidence was endorsed by Mackall to Hackett, and the endorsement of the latter was not proven. It should not, therefore, have been admitted in evidence. 1 <em>Greenlf. on Ev., secs. </em>56, 5S, 64, 66, and cases (here cited. 1 <em>Phillip's Ev., </em>506. 2 <em>Camp., </em>305, <em>Jones vs. Mars. </em>3 <em>Camp., </em>463, <em>Hodge vs. </em>Fillis.

After the defendant\u2019s plea, that he did not accept the bill of exchange as alleged, on which issue was joined, and which was never withdrawn, nor any leave asked from the court to do so, it was too late to plead in abatement, or to obtain the benefit of the non-joinder in any other manner. 4 <em>Gill, </em>166, <em>Chapman vs. Davis. </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>74, <em>Merrick vs. Bank of Metropolis. </em>But if the question raised by the demurrer to the declaration is before the court, we insist there was no error in the action of the court thereon. The supposed informality in the plaintiff\u2019s proceedings, was, that the writ and <em>narr. </em>were against the defendant alone, while the bill offered in evidence was accepted by the firm of which Thos. H. Kent of Jos. was a member, and, therefore, the action should have been against him also. But, it is submitted, it was not necessary to declare against the other member of the firm, and that the suit against the defendant, as a' member of it, will be sustained. 7 <em>Term Rep., </em>597, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>Churchill vs. Gardner. </em>19 <em>Ark., </em>701, <em>Hicks vs. Maness. </em>1 English, 24, <em>Hamilton vs. Buxton.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-5\">2nd.

The rulings in the exceptions were also correct. There was no such variance between the bill offered in evidence and that declared on, as to render the former inadmissible in evidence. <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>579 to 582, <em>(Ed. of </em>1839.)

The writ was issued against the defendant in his individual capacity. The declaration alleges, in substance, that, J. T. Lyles &amp;. Co. drew their bill of exchange, and directed the same \u201cto the said defendant <em>and one Thomas H. Kent of Joseph, </em>trading under the name of Thomas H. Kent of Jos. &amp;. Co., requiring them to pay to R. G. Mackall, or order,\u201d &amp;c., \u201cand the said defendant and the said Thomas H. Kent of Joseph,, trading as aforesaid, accepted the said bill,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">The defendant demurred to this declaration, upon the ground, substantially, that it sets forth as cause of the action, <em>&amp; joint </em>obligation of the defendant with one Thos. H. Kent of Jos., trading under the firm of of Thomas H. Kent of Jos. Co., and that the suit should have been against the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number><em>joint acceptors </em>in (heir partnership capacity, and not against the defendants in his <em>individual </em>capacity. The plaintiff entered a <em>ne recipiatur </em>to this demurrer, upon the ground, it is presumed, that the defendant had <em>previously pleaded </em>to the declaration, but the court overruled this motion, and the <em>plaintiff </em>then joined in the demurrer. Upon this state of the case, no exception to this action of the court having been taken, by the plaintiff, he cannot be heard to say, that the demurrer was not interposed at the proper time.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The first question then is, ought this demurrer to have been sustained, the court below having overruled it., and the judgment being against the defendant?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The declaration clearly states the case of a joint contract, and the general rule is, that, in such a case, all the joint contractors must be joined as defendants. \u201cIn an action against a partnership firm on a partnership contract not under seal, all those who were partners at the time of the contract, ought to be joined as defendants; for a contract when made with partners is originally a <em>joint </em>contract, though it may be separate as to its effects.\u201d <em>Coll, on </em>Partnership, 419, 420, <em>(Ed. of </em>1834.J But, it is said, that the omission to join as defendant a party jointly liable, can only be availed of by plea in abatement. Such is undoubtedly the general rule, but it is equally well settled, that if it expressly appear on the face of the declaration, that the party omitted is still living as well as that he jointly contracted, the defendant <em>may demur, </em>move in arrest of judgment, or sustain a writ of error. 1 <em>Ghitty,s Pleadings, </em>46.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">In this case, the declaration is silent as to whether the other joint contractor is dead or alive; it says nothing upon the subject. There is much conflict in the authorities whether in such a case a demurrer will lie. On the one hand, there is high authority for saying, that in order to authorise a demurrer the declaration must <em>expressly state </em>that the party omitted is still living. On the other hand, decisions of equal weight have held, that the non-averment' of the death of the defendant who is omitted, is <em>a sufficient admission that he is still alive; </em>\u2014 that having shown there was a joint-contractor at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>the time of the contract made, the presumption is that he is still alive, unless the plaintiff will rebut the presumption hitmself has raised by showing that he is dead. It is difficult to \u25a0determine to which side the preponderance of authority on this question inclines. The former Court of Appeals, in the case of <em>Merrick vs. The Bank of Metropolis, </em>8 <em>Gill, </em>74, has said, however: \u2014 -\u201cTf the <em>declaration </em>discloses that the promise is joint, it is <em>necessary to aver that the other is dead, </em>or to account for his not being joined in the action, or it is <em>bad upon demurrer </em>or writ of error.5\u2019 And in the case in <em>5 Greenleaf s Reps., </em>443, there referred to, it was held that the declaration was fatally bad for want of an averment that the \u25a0co-promisors were dead at the time of the commencement of the action, and the court adds: \u201cThere seem to be no more reason for obliging a defendant in a plea in abatement, after averring that there was a co-promisor, who is not sued, to go on and aver his life, than there is for bliging a plaintiff, who discloses in his declaration that, there was a co-promisor who is not sued, to go on and aver his death. The averment of life is essential to the sufficiency of the plea; and the averment of death to the sufficiency of the declaration.\u20195</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">To these authorities we must adhere, and, as this declaration discloses, that there was a joint contractor at the time this contract was made, and does not aver that he was dead, or a non-resident of the county, or account in any other way for his not being joined in the action, the demurrer thereto should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">We have carefully examined the Act of 1856, cli. 112, and can find nothing in its various provisions changing the law as applicable to this case. The defect in the declaration is a defect in substance, which could be availed of by general demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">After the demurrer had been overruled, the defendant filed four amended pleas, so called: 1st that he never was indebted as alleged; 2nd, that he did not promise as alleged; 3rd, that he did not accept the said bill of exchange as alleged; and 4th, that said bill Was not duly presented for acceptance as alleged. The plaintiff (V/nmreri to the 1st a\u00bbv.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>2nd of these pleas, because they traverse matters not alleged in the declaration, and joined issue upon the 3rd and 4th. The court overruled the demurrer as to the-first plea; but sustained it as to the second. This latter decision is also before-us for review on- this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">If the reversal or affirmance of the judgment depended upon our decision of the propriety of this ruling-, we should' not reverse the judgment, because no injury has been wrought the appellant thereby. He- could have availed himself, at the-trial, of every defence under the pleas upon which issue was joined, that he could under the present plea. But as matter of practice, and looking to the forms of pleading prescribed in,. and to the other provisions of the Act of 1856, chapter 112,. under which these proceedings were had, we think this second plea was properly interposed. The declaration neither states in terms, an indebtedness or a promise to pay, but states-facts from which both are implied by law, and both were-proper subjects of denial by pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The case was then-, tried upon issues joined upon the 1st,. 3rd and 4th pleas, and, two exceptions taken by the defendants to the rulings of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">In the posture in which the case stood at the trial, the-court\u2019s ruling in the first exception was clearly correct. The-court having overruled the demurrer to the declaration, the-latter, in deciding (his exception, is to be treated as a valid-declaration. After the proof set out in this exception, the-plaintiff offered to read in evidence- to the jury, the <em>\u201csaid bill', of </em>exchangethat is, as we are informed in the exception,, the bill <em>\u201cmentionedin </em>the declaration.\u201d The-exception gives us no information of any other bill than that declared on in the <em>narr. </em>and we cannot travel through other parts of the record5 to find any other. The bill mentioned in the declaration was clearly admissible in evidence, that declaration having \u25a0 been decided to be sufficient. Whether there be any such variance between the bill of exchange found elsewhere in, the-record, and that declared: on, as to render the former inadmissible as evidence under the declaration, we need not decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">We also think the ruling in the second exception was correct.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number><em>Si </em>prayer that, under the pleadings and evidence in the cause, sthe plaintiff is not entitled to recover, is too general. This bras been so frequently decided by this court, since the passage of 'the Act of 1825, chapter 117, that no reference to the authorities is necessary.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"Ayg\">(Decided October 29th, 1861.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b403-5\"><em>Judgement reversad and procedendo </em>awarded\u201e</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
