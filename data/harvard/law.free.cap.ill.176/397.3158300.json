City of Mt. Pulaski, 69 Ill. App. 474, affirmed.</p><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-18\" pgmap=\"397\">Appeal from the Appellate Court for the Third District;\u2014heard in that court on appeal from the Circuit Court of Logan county; the Hon. George W. Herdman, Judge, presiding.\" \"</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-19\" pgmap=\"397(30) 398(375) 399(68)\">On March 24, 1891, the appellant was granted, by ordinance, the right to erect and operate an incandescent electric light plant in the village of Mt. Pulaski for the term of twenty years. On the 18th of April of the same year he purchased a lot on which a flour mill formerly stood, which, when in operation, had been supplied with water from a well in Green street, near its intersection with Spring street, in the village. This well was dug by the operators of the flour mill with the consent of the village authorities, and was connected with the lot by means of pipes laid underground. Afterwards, on June 23 of the same year, by an ordinance duly passed and approved, appellant was allowed the use of the well for the period of twenty years, the same to be maintained at his own expense and to be so kept as to be safe to the traveling public. In October following, by another ordinance, he was granted the right to put in upon the streets of the villag'e the necessary appliances for an arc system of electric lighting, with a contract for street lights for five years. In the erection of the incandescent plant he expended, in round numbers, $9000, and for the arc system about $10,000 more. When the right to use the well was given him he found that the Peoria, Decatur and Evansville Railway Company was using it to supply its engines, and he entered into a contract with it to supply it with water, using the railway company\u2019s pump until the following spring. In the spring of 1892 he discovered the water supply to be insufficient, and dug a well immediately adjoining the old one, inserting what is known as a \u201cCook\u2019s point\u201d to connect the two. Later on he made contracts with various parties, among others the Illinois Central Railroad Company and a flour mill, to furnish them water, and continued his business without interruption until November 25, 1895, when he was served with a notice, signed by the street commissioner, ordering him to remove the \u201cCook\u2019s point\u201d and all other attachments placed in Green street by him, and the pump and attachments in this second well. The pump in it not being suitable to be placed in the old well, on December 13, 1895, he purchased a new one, with necessary pipe and apparatus, for the purpose of placing the same in the old well, the cost of which was about \u00a7500. In order to lift the pump out of the new well he erected a derrick, and was proceeding with the work of taking out the pump and appliances and putting the new pump in the old well, when the events transpired which gave rise to this suit.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-4\" pgmap=\"399\">On December 21, 1895, the city council, the village organization having been chang'ed to that of a city organization, repealed the ordinance granting the appellant the use of the old well, and thereafter, while he was at work making the changes above mentioned, he was served with a notice, signed by the city attorney, stating that the city objected to the deepening of the old well, and to the placing of any appliances therein which would enable him to draw water from a deeper level than the bottom of the well as it was originally constructed. He was also notified at the same time, verbally, by both the city marshal and the city attorney, to stop work, which he refused to do. While the work was going on the street commissioner and others tore down the derrick and filled up the pipe he was placing in the old well with brickbats and other materials, and also proceeded to fill up the well with dirt and rubbish. Thereupon he obtained an injunction restraining\" the city from interfering with and obstructing him in the work, and proceeded to clean out the old well and put down in it a new eight-inch pipe, driving the same about thirty feet below the bottom of the well. He then covered the well with a platform made of four-inch oak plank, and filled up the new well.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-5\" pgmap=\"399(68) 400(20)\">The evidence shows that prior to this trouble appellant maintained the well in a dangerous condition; that he permitted steam to escape into it in a manner calculated to frighten horses on the street, and kept it insecurely covered. The temporary injunction granted was, on the hearing, dissolved and his bill dismissed. An appeal was taken to the Appellate Court for the Third District, where the decree of the circuit court was affirmed, and the case is brought here by this further appeal.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b400-5\" pgmap=\"400\">A.

But that body has no power to alien or otherwise encumber such streets so long as they are public streets, but must hold them in trust for public uses only, and hence no easement or right therein not of a public character can be granted by a municipality or acquired by any individual or corporation for exclusive private use, to the exclusion of the public. (Field v. Barling, 149 Ill. 556; Hibbard &amp; Co. v. City of Chicago, 173 id. 91.) A permanent encroachment upon public streets for a private use is a purpresture, and is in law a nuisance. (Driggs v. Phillips, 103 N. Y. 77; Smith v. State, 23 N. J. L. 712; Attorney General v. Heishon, 18 N. J. Eq. 410; State v. Woodward, 24 Vt. 92; Chamberlain v. Enfield, 43 N. H. 356; Commonwealth v. King, 13 Metc. 115; Hibbard &amp; Co. v. City of Chicago, supra.) In the case last cited it was said (p. 98): \u201cWhere the city has authorized a temporary use which causes a temporary obstruction, one having been licensed to exercise such temporary use would not be liable for a penalty, under the ordinances, for obstructing the street, as it was permitted as a matter of grace or favor. That such permission was given may be implied from circumstances. (Gridley v. City of Bloomington, 68 Ill. 47.) But when the city demands the removal of such a structure, it, if permitted to remain thereafter, becomes a nuisance.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b403-4\" pgmap=\"403\">The claim of the appellant that the second ordinance, which granted him the privilege of using the well, is part of the whole contract and that without it he would uot have accepted the franchise or erected the plant, in no way affects the question of law. He claims that the right to use the well was part of the consideration upon which he acted, and was intended as an inducement to him to accept the franchise and build the works. He must have acted with full knowledge of the fact that the municipality had no right or power to confer on him a right to a private use of the street, giving him a right to a permanent encroachment thereon and allowing him to create a purpresture. There being no power in the city to make a discrimination in the use of the streets in favor of appellant, and permit him to have a permanent private use of the same or to part thereof, if it has done so the most that can be said is, it amounted to a mere license that would not render him amenable to punishment for a violation of an ordinance of the city in obstructing the street. Such permission to so use the street is not binding upon the city, and is not irrevocable. The municipality having no power to grant such permanent use, there can be no estoppel against it from requiring the street to be open in its entirety, because no estoppel can arise from an act of the municipal authorities done without authority of law. Seeger v. Mueller, 133 Ill. 86; Pettis v. Johnson, 56 Ind. 139; Stevens v. St. Mary\u2019s Training School, 144 Ill. 336; Day v. Grieb, 4 Cush. 433.</p> <p id=\"b403-5\" pgmap=\"403(38) 404(88)\">There was power in the city council to pass the ordinance repealing the former ordinance granting the right to appellant to use the street, for such former ordinance, being without authority of law, might well be rescinded. Appellant acquired no right under the former ordinance against the public, nor did he acquire any right against the municipality by estoppel, nor by any right conferred by the ordinance, because the right conferred was a mere private use, and that private use created a purpresture. This fact it was the duty of appellant to know, hence a right existed in the city council to repeal the ordinance theretofore enacted granting the right to appellant to have and use this well in the public streets of the city.</p> <p id=\"b404-5\" pgmap=\"404\">\u2022 It was not error in the circuit court of Logan county to dismiss appellant\u2019s bill, nor in the Appellate Court for th'fe Third District to affirm its decree. . The judgment of the Appellate Court for the Third District is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b404-6\" pgmap=\"404\">Judgment affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b404-7\" pgmap=\"404\">Mr. Justice Boggs took no part in the decision of this case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
