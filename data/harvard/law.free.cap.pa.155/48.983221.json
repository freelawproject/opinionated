The only testimony on part of defendant was proof by plaintiff\u2019s witness, Patterson, the cashier of the bank, of the letter of June 3,1886, and his reply thereto. The letter and reply are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-14\">\u201c Pittsburgh, 6-3-86.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-13\">\u201c Alex.

P.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-18\">Plaintiff offered evidence tending to show that the question asked in the letter of June 3 referred to a renewal of the notes which decedent had agreed to, and not to a payment of them by the Coal Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-19\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>\u201cWe instruct you that if there was a negotiation with Mr. Williams, who was also treasurer of the Diamond Coal Company, in which it was understood and agreed that there should be a part paid and a renewal of the balance, and that if he after-wards knew what had been done, namely, that there had 'been no security released and nothing done but a part payment made and the renewal of the notes with the same indorsers for another four months, and knew the fact that there had been no arrangement outside of the previous arrangement to renew the notes, then that [the letter and reply of June 3d] does not release him. It does not operate as a release of his guaranty, and your verdict should be for plaintiff for the amount of these notes. That is a question of fact, though, for the jury. The face of the paper throws the burden on the plaintiff of explaining it and showing what the actual situation is. It depends, then, on whether you believe the testimony of Mr. Patterson against the apparent face of this paper.\u201d [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-4\">Defendant\u2019s point appears by opinion of Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-5\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff.

The point was as follows: \u201c That under the undisputed evidence relating to the letter and reply of June 3, 1886, the verdict should be for defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">This specification of error, containing altogether six lines, is followed by three pages of the evidence and argument. All this would have been proper enough if embodied in the printed argument of the appellant, but it has no place in the specifications of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The defendant\u2019s point was properly refused. The court below fairly left to the jury to find the subject-matter referred to m the letter and reply of June 3,1886. The legal effect of a written instrument is always for the court, and the court so held in this case, but whether the letter referred to the arrangement spoken of in the guarantee or to the arrangement for renewals, was a proper question to submit to the jury. Parol evidence has always been held admissible to give identity to the subject-matter of a written instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-3\">The remaining specification refers to a portion of the charge of the court. A careful examination fails to disclose error.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
