Before Gunnison, P.

On the trial, plaintiff gave in evidence the following extracts from defendant\u2019s constitution and bylaws of 1882 : <em>\u201c </em>In case of death, to pay a stipulated sum to such person or persons as may be designated by each member, thus enabling him to guarantee his family against want.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b527-12\">It was also provided that the lodge \u201c guarantee to each member the payment at his death of $2,000 to such person or persons as he may while living direct; provided that said member shall fully comply with each and all requirements of the hereinafter specified conditions and with the general laws governing said corporation.\u201d \u201c I further agree to accept said beneficiary certificates subject to such laws as now exist or may hereafter be adopted.\u201d The form of certificate prescribed contained a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>blank for designation of \u201c relationship \u201d of beneficiary. There was also a provision authorizing change in beneficiaries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-4\">Plaintiffs also gave in evidence a constitution and by-laws, adopted March, 1888, containing same guarantee, with addition of words \u201c within the rules for that purpose \u201d between \u201c direct \u201d and \u201c provided.\u201d Also, \u201c In filling up applications, or applications for change of beneficiary certificates .... a single man with children must select the children.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-5\">The evidence also showed that the first certificate designated the wife, and that the present one was made in 1884 after her death. Mulderick died April 28,1888. Defendant association was incorporated under act of Feb. 25, 1871, P. L. 197, but surrendered its charter under that act in 1887. In May, 1888, defendants were notified to pay plaintiffs. In October, 1888, they paid Frank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-6\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit and subsequently refused to take it off, on the ground (1) that the constitution of 1882 authorized the naming of Frank as beneficiary; (2) the constitution of 1888 did not apply ; and (3) there was no contract between plaintiffs and defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b528-8\"><em>J.

When the plaintiffs rested they had shown a valid undertaking by the defendant to pay to the beneficiary named by Mulderick. The name of this beneficiary had been changed, but no reason appears for denying to the one last named the benefit of the contract. The question in the court below was not whether parental affection or obligation should have led the decedent to name his children. If that had been the question it would have been very easy of solution. Unfortunately for the plaintiffs the question is, What did he do in naming the beneficiary ? This is involved in no doubt, and upon the evidence we see no legal reason why the beneficiary was not entitled to receive the money now sued for.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
