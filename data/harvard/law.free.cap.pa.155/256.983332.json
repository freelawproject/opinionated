The portion of the article of agreement quoted in the Supreme Court was put in evidence, which this court decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>was competent evidence.

In the charge it was referred to, and the court held, I think properly, that the deed being for \u2018 all the stone coal,\u2019 it carried all. That part of the agreement was clearly merged in the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-4\">\u201c I think there is no uncertainty or repugnancy in the descriptive part of the deed. It expressly conveys all the coal in and under the farm, describing it by adjoining farms\u2014then describes by courses and distances the boundaries of the coal, and then repeats the expression, \u2018 being all the coal in and under \u2019 the whole farm\u2014evidently the parties thought they had included all the coal in the specific boundaries. But as the clearly manifest intention was to convey all the coal in. and under the entire farm, the courses and distances will yield, to cover the fraction of an acre lying outside these lines, to conform to the general description and evident intention of the parties. There is nothing in the habendum inconsistent with this view.]\u201d [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\"><em>Frrors assigned </em>were (1-3) above instructions, quoting them; (4, 5) in charging in substance as indicated in the portions of the opinion as above, quoting them; (6-9) in withdrawing from the jury the above evidence, quoting it as above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-6\"><em>Joseph </em>Forsythe, for appellants, cited:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdG\">Everhart v.
