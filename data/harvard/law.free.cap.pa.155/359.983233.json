In consideration of plaintiffs guaranteeing the debts of the company they were charged a lower rate than was charged to the public.

The rates were accordingly raised. Other consumers who were also guarantors of the company\u2019s debts paid the increased rates, but the plaintiffs refused to pay them, and filed a bill in equity to restrain the company from cutting off their supply of gas. <em>Held, </em>that the refusal of the court to grant a preliminary injunction would not be reversed on appeal.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b382-4\">Argued April 14, 1898.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ADC1\">Appeal, No. 77, Oct.
