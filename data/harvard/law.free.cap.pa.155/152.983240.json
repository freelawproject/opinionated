Objected to for the reason that there are interlineations and alterations in the description of the premises conveyed. Counsel for the plaintiff states that the interlineations and alterations do not refer to or concern the disputed line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-4\">By the Court: It appearing to the court by an inspection of the deed that the interlineation of \u201c and one \u201d affecting a certain short line would change the survey against the plaintiff who now offers the deed in evidence and seemingly would make the disputed line more favorable to the defendant than if the interlineation were rejected\u2014in other words, that the interlineation does not unfavorably affect the defendant\u2014therefore the objection is overruled.

An amendment was allowed at bar which brings the principal specification within our rules. An examination of the case shows that it is without merit. The main ground of complaint was that the learned judge below admitted in evidence the interlined deed from Samuel Opp and wife to William Zimmerman. The ob <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>jection to the deed was that no evidence had been offered to explain the interlineation. The learned judge below held, after an inspection of the deed, that the interlineation did not unfavorably affect the defendant. The interlineation appears to have been in the same handwriting as the body of the deed and made with the same ink and probably with the same pen. There was nothing to indicate fraud or attempted fraud in the interlineation, and as it was apparently prejudicial to the party offering the deed, we do not think its admission was error.</p>\n<p id=\"Aym\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
