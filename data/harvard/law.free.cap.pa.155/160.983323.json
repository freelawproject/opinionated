Defendant claimed that he had never given the order for the refrigerators, and that it had been wrongfully sent in his name by a salesman of plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">Plaintiff introduced evidence tending to show that the refrigerators were accepted by defendant in the manner stated in the opinion of the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">Defendant\u2019s points were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-9\">\u201c 1. If the jury should find that the defendant did not order the goods and did not afterward accept them with the intention of taking them to his possession as owner, or appropriating them to his own use, the verdict must be for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-10\">\u201c 2. Under all the evidence it is for the jury to determine whether the acceptance of the goods by the defendant was with the intention of becoming the owner of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-11\">\u201c <em>Answer: </em>We say to you, gentlemen of the jury, there is no question of intention involved here to be submitted to you. There is no disputed question of fact. The goods were shipped to Mr. Hayes in his name, and when he took control of them by ordering the railroad company to turn them over to his agent, Mr. Cooper, the carter, the law implied an intention on his part to accept, and so far as the plaintiffs here are concerned he became the owner, and we instruct you to that effect, and must so qualify their points.\u201d [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-12\">Plaintiff\u2019s points were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-13\">\u201c 1. If the defendant gave no order to the plaintiffs for the goods sued for, and made no contract with them for furnishing him with refrigerators, it was his duty, when the said goods came to him, to decline to receive them from the railroad com pany.\u201d Affirmed. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-14\">\u201c 2. If the sixty-four refrigerators were shipped to Robert L. Hayes by the plaintiffs, relying upon his order, and he re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>ceived the same from the railroad company at West Chester, thereby discharging the said railroad company from liability to the shippers, the plaintiffs, the defendant, Robert L. Hayes, is bound to pay for the same, whether he authorized the sending of the order or not.\u201d Affirmed.
