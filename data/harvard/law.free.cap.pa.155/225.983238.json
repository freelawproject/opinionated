It is not necessarily contributory negligence to go on premises where a sign of warning is displayed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b247-9\">Those who indulge in the luxury, or enjoy the convenience, of keeping, within the city limits, dogs which they know are ferocious and dangerous, must see that they are so secured that persons lawfully going upon their premises or along the highways may not be bitten, or they must expect to suffer the consequences of their neglect: Pee Curiam.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b247-10\">Argued March 29, 1893.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AfD\">Appeal, No. 285, Jan.

J., it appeared that plaintiff, a real estate broker, had charge of the land which defendant occupied as tenant at will. The property having been sold, plaintiff went to the farm in 1890 to notify defendant of the sale, and to secure the signs \u201c for sale \u201d which had been placed upon the fences. Defendant owned two dogs, a setter and a spitz, and had placed on a post in the lane leading to the house a sign, \u201c Beware of the dogs.\u201d Plaintiff went to the front of the house, and knocked at the front door. Receiving no reply, he was about to leave, when he heard people talking towards the back of the house. He stepped from the porch into the roadway leading along the side of the house to the barn, and after going a short distance was attacked by the dogs, and severely bitten. There was evidence that the dogs had previously attacked people without provocation, and that defendant had knowledge of these facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-4\">Defendant\u2019s request for binding instructions was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b248-5\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $150.

Their verdict, in favor of the plaintiff, therefore, conclusively established both of said facts. The testimony not only warranted but required the submission of the case to the jury. It would have been plain error to have withdrawn it from their consideration by affirming defendant\u2019s point.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">In view of the evidence, as to the nature and extent of plaintiff\u2019s injury, the damages awarded by the jury were quite moderate. Those who indulge in the luxury, or enjoy the convenience, of keeping, within the city limits, dogs which they know are ferocious and dangerous, must see that they are so secured that persons lawfully going upon their premises or along the highways may not be bitten, or they must expect to suffer the consequences of their neglect to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
