Delph, John M. Moyer, Isaac K. Kreibel, John H. Schwartz and Simeon W. Moyer. The evidence to take the case out of the statute was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-16\">Schwartz said he was willing to pay his share and it should be paid. It all hung on Kreibel. He said he wouldn\u2019t pay unless he was compelled by law to do so. He didn\u2019t say how much he would pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Moyer said it should have been paid long ago and he was willing to pay his share, but he said it was hard to pay lost money. He said he would have settled up this long ago, but it hung on others. He said he had been long willing to pay this money and it ought to have been paid long ago. He was willing to pay his share. He said he would like to have it fixed up, he was tired of it, but it depended on the rest, Delp and others he mentioned, and he mentioned Kreibel too.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\">Delp, Kreibel and the others, except these two defendants, paid their proportion, and the suit was discontinued as to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">The court directed the jury to render a verdict for plaintiff reserving the question of law \u201c whether there is any evidence to be submitted to the jury to warrant recovery against the defendants.\u201d The court subsequently entered judgment for defendants non obstante veredicto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\"><em>Errors assigned </em>wore (1) in reserving the question of law, quoting it as above; (2) in entering judgment for defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b177-8\"><em>Charles </em>Hunsicker, <em>Wm.

Upon the merits we are of opinion that the evidence was not sufficient to toll the statute of limitations, and the judgment was properly entered for the defendants non obstante veredicto. We need not discuss the evidence or refer to the numerous authorities upon this subject. The case itself involves nothing new and we have gone over the subject so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>fully in former decisions that nothing remains to be added. If ^the profession does not understand by this time what is a sufficient acknowledgment to toll the statute we cannot hope by multiplying words to make it any plainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
