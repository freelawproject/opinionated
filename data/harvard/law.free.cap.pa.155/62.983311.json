J., it appeared that defendants, who were collectors and conveyancers, filed for plaintiff certain mechanics\u2019 lien claims, placing upon them the name of an attorney, whose name had been placed upon other liens previously filed by them for plaintiffs. Subsequently a rule was entered upon plaintiffs to issue a scire facias, and personal service of the notice of this rule was made upon the attorney of record for plaintiffs. The attorney, however, neglected to issue the writs, and the liens were lost. The contractor was insolvent, and plaintiffs never recovered their claims. Defendants averred that they had been employed only to file the claims, and not to collect them. They also alleged that the attorney was employed by the direction of plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-13\">The court charged in part as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>\u201c It is alleged by the plaintiffs in this case that this was the fault of the defendants, and that they lost their liens by the carelessness of the defendants. Whether the defendants were responsible for the neglect of the attorney to act, that is, to issue the writs of scire facias in pursuance of the order of the court or not, depends upon the facts which you shall find in this case. It depends, in other words, upon whether you shall find that the defendants were employed to <em>collect </em>this claim, whether they undertook to look after it and collect it and attend to it in all stages embraced in the meaning of the word \u2018 collect,\u2019 or whether they were only employed to file the claim. It is insisted by the defendants that they were not employed to collect the claim, but only to file the claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-5\">[\u201cIf, on the other hand, they were employed to collect these claims, as is alleged and sworn to by the plaintiff, Mr. Siner, then they are responsible for the neglect of the attorney which occasioned the striking off of the claims, if the attorney was employed by them.. Whether the attorney was employed by them or was employed by the plaintiffs is a fact for you to determine. If you find that the defendants undertook to collect these claims and that they employed the attorney, if the attorney was acting under their instructions, then they are responsible, in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of this state, which has been cited, for the negligence of the attorney.] [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-6\">\u201cIf they were employed to collect these liens, then it will be necessary for you to decide the other point, viz., whether the attorney, whose negligence apparently occasioned the striking off of the liens, was employed by them or by the plaintiffs, or whether he was employed by direction of the plaintiffs. If the plaintiffs directed the defendants to employ him, then they are not responsible.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-7\">Defendant\u2019s point was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-8\">\u201c If the jury believe that the defendants employed a reputable and competent attorney to prosecute the lien claims then they are not responsible for the neglect of that attorney.\u201d Refused.

The defendants, having undertaken the collection of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, are responsible for the neglect of the attorney employed by them by which the claims were lost. The question of defendants\u2019 negligence was fairly submitted to the jury, and their verdict is conclusive upon the question of fact. \u00a1,</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
