The subscribing witness testified that on Feb. 28, 1873, Mrs. Turner was at the bank, and acknowledged her signature to the bond, and that the cashier handed the witness the bond, and requested him to mark the date of his witnessing it, which he did by writing the date under his signature. There was no evidence that Mrs. Turner knew that the date of the bond had been changed, or that any of the alterations had been made.

Defendant\u2019s objection to the bond was as follows: Defendant\u2019s counsel objects to the admission of the bond in evidence, because the date of the bond has been changed by erasure,_ which plainly appears upon the face of the bond, and this change not being noted in the attesta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>tion clause before execution, defendant\u2019s counsel not having seen this original bond before, having seen only the copy filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-5\">The Court: I am inclined to think that in regard to filing a copy, where there is a manifest alteration on the face of an instrument under seal, and that alteration is not described in any way and does not appear in the copy filed,\u2014the objection may be made at the trial and plaintiff called upon to explain such alteration, especially where there is no subscribing witness to explain the apparent alteration. That would be my view of the case at present. If that view results under the circumstances in a surprise, we will of course take that into consideration, because the question of pleading is somewhat modified by recent legislation. You can therefore either proceed to call the subscribing witness and explain this transaction, or plaintiff may be surprised at the course the case has taken and secure further time for trial.

Dietrick was elected cashier of this bank. On the 18th of September, 1871 \u2014some two months later, as appears by a minute properly entered in the book of the bank, the amount of the cashier\u2019s bond was fixed at $20,000. And here the history of the bond for a time stops. On the 16th of June, 1873, it seems, from an entry in the minute book of the directors at a meeting of the board of directors of that date, June 16, 1873, a bond of the cashier was submitted to the meeting, and the bond is described corresponding to the one now produced in court, and action was taken with reference to it as appears from an entry on page 103 of the minute book 1, to which I now call your attention: \u2018 A meeting of the directors of the Plymouth Savings Bank was held at their bank rooms on Monday, June 16, 1873, present, Peter Shupp, J. J. Shonk,-Davenport, J. B. Pierce and Frank Turner.\u2019 The minutes of the last meeting were approv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ed, etc. Then follows this entry: \u2018 The bond of cashier for $20,000,\u2019 originally followed by the words, \u2018 was then signed,\u2019 but the word \u2018 was \u2019 and the word \u2018 then \u2019 erased, so that it reads now, \u2018 the bond of cashier for $20,000, signed by Mary Dietrick and Mrs. S. G. Turner \u2019\u2014then comes an interlineation \u2018 with proper corrections \u2019 \u2014\u2018 was read by the vice president and taken in charge by him. There being nothing further, adjourned.\u2019 The minutes are signed W. <em>W. </em>Dietrick.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">\u201c It is alleged that this bond originally bore the date of 1871 and that the date in figures, \u201828,\u2019 and the word \u2018February\u2019 are written over erasures, the exact character of which cannot be ascertained upon inspection. The year 1871, however, has evidently been changed to 1878, as you see upon inspection of the bond, which will be sent with you to your room. If, gentlemen, you shall find from an inspection of the bond that these alterations were made, then the question arises, were they made with the knowledge and the assent of Mrs. Turner, the defendant ? If not made in that way, she would be relieved of her liability on this bond as a surety for her brother.] [2] Understand me, gentlemen. If you find from the face of the bond that its date has been altered from some day in 1871 to the 28th day of February, 1873, without the knowledge and consent of Mrs. Turner, as shown by the evidence in the case, then her liability on this bond ceases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-6\">\u201c [But we come now to another branch of this case which it is my duty to present to you, because it is a legal view of the case which naturally arises and must be disposed of. Suppose you find from the evidence that Mrs. Turner was aware of and assented to the change of date and knew that the original bond was, for some reason, to be altered as to its date, what would then be her position in this case ? Samuel G. Turner, the husband of the present defendant, as shown by the evidence, died in December, 1872; therefore, through the whole of the year 1871, Mrs. Turner was a married woman, and under all the legal disabilities imposed upon her as such under our law. Under our Pennsylvania law she, as a married woman, was incapacitated in 1871 from making a bond or becoming surety upon a bond like the one involved in this controversy, and, as to her, such a bond was not only voidable by reason of her being married, but was absolutely void. Furthermore, it is our duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>to say to you as matter of law that an instrument or contract absolutely void cannot be rendered valid and binding by subsequent ratification after the removal of the disability. In other words, gentlemen, appfying these legal principles to this case, if you shall find from an inspection of this bond and from the evidence in the case, that Mrs. Turner signed it on some day in the year 1871, and then acknowledged it to be her act and signature in 1873, as testified to by Mr. Lance, the subscribing witness, who says he did not see her sign her name, but heard her admit her signature, it would still be such an instrument as she could not ratify, being originally void under our law, a bond signed by a married woman as a surety, and even her knowledge and acquiescence as of the other date, February 28,1873, would not make it valid and binding as an obligation against her. If you find this to be the truth of this case in regard to this bond, your verdict should be in favor of the defendant.\u201d] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s point was among others as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\">\u201c 1. If the jury find that on the 28th of February, 1873, the bond in suit was witnessed by W. W. Lance, <em>at the -request and </em>in the presence of the defendant, Mrs. S. G. Turner, and William W. Dietrick, as the bond which they proposed to furnish the directors of the bank in response to the action of the bank fixing the cashier\u2019s bond at $20,000, then no matter whether Mrs. Turner, the defendant, actually signed the bond on the 28th of February, 1873, or on some prior day,\u2014it nevertheless became her bond, and fixed her liability as bondsman, if it were afterwards delivered to the directors and accepted by them as their cashier\u2019s bond.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-7\">The court crossed out its four italicized words and answered the point as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-8\">\u201cWe say to you that point may be affirmed with the single qualification which we referred to in our general charge, that it would be good unless originally void,\u2014in other words, unless void at the time it was originally signed, because of her being a married woman; and then her ratification would go for naught; because a void instrument cannot be ratified by subsequent assent.\u201d [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-9\">Defendant\u2019s points were among others as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-10\">\u201c 6|-. Under the evidence in the case Mrs. Turner was a mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>ried woman in 1871. If the jury therefore find that the date of the bond in question was changed from some time in 1871 to February 28, 1873, this change was material, because the bond would not be binding upon her, being a married woman at the time, and the legal presumption therefore is that the erasure was made after Mrs. Turner signed the bond and without her knowledge and consent. There being no evidence on the part of the plaintiff to overcome this presumption, the jury must therefore find for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>We affirm that point as to the first proposition contained in it and decline to affirm the subsequent or concluding part of it, but call your attention again to what we said early in our charge, that if the jury believe that the date of the bond in question was changed from some time in 1871 to February 28, 1873,\u2014that at that date in 1871 Mrs. Turner was a married woman, as shown by the evidence,\u2014then the bond was void as to her, and there can be no recovery in this case.\u201d [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.

Justice Thompson,</author>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The appellant as assignee of the Plymouth Savings Bank brought this action against appellee upon a bond alleged to have been given by her to it conditioned for the faithful performance of the duties of its cashier, W. W. Dietrick, her brother. In September, 1871, it appears by the minutes of the Savings Bank that the amount of the bond required to be given by its cashier for the faithful performance of his duties was fixed at $20,000. No further action seems to have been taken by its board of directors until June 16, 1873, when the following entry appears upon its minutes: \u201c The bond of cashier for $20,000,\u201d followed by \u201c was then signed by Mary Dietrick and Mrs. S. G. Turner.\u201d The words \u201c was \u201d and \u201c then \u201d were erased and the words \u201c with proper corrections \u201d interlined. So that it, as corrected, then read as follows, viz.: \u201c The bond of the cashier for $20,000 signed by Mary Dietrick and Mrs. S. G. Turner with proper corrections was read by the Vice President and taken in charge by him.\u201d This bond upon which suit has been brought upon examination shows alterations. The words \u201c 28th February \u201d are written over an erasure, and the figure \u201c 3 \u201d is written over \u201c 1 \u201d of the year 1871, and thus it is made to appear as if dated \u2018[February 28,1873.\u201d In 1871 the appellee was the wife of S. G. Turner, who died subsequently in 1872. When the bond was offered in evidence by appellant an objection was made to it and sustained, because it showed upon its face alterations, but subsequently, on proof by a subscribing witness, it was admitted. The first assignment of error relates to the action of the court in sustaining the objection in the first instance, but as it was subsequently admitted it would seem hardly necessary to consider this assignment of error: Worrall v. Pile, 132 Pa. 529. As this however is earnestly pressed by appellant it may be proper to say that as the alterations in question cast a suspicion upon the instrument, the burden of proof was upon the appellant to explain them. In Jordan v. Stewart, 23 Pa. 249, it is said: \u201c But when a contest occurs, and the instrument is offered in evidence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>question at once arises, whether the alteration is beneficial to the party offering it; if it be not, as in the instance of a bond or note altered to a less sum, the prima facie presumption is unchanged; if it be, as was the case here, we do not presume a forgery, but we hold the party, offering it in evidence and seeking advantage from it, bound to explain the alteration to the satisfaction of a jury. The initiative and the burden of proof are thrown upon him.\u201d In the case of Hartley v. Corboy, 150 Pa. 28, the words in a promissory note were originally \u201c four months,\u201d and \u201c ninety days \u201d was written over them. Mr. Justice Gkeen in considering the cases upon the subject said: \u201c In these circumstances the case comes clearly within the operation of all our decisions upon this class of cases, and it is at once manifest that, when the note was offered in evidence without any explanation of the visible and material alterations, it should have been promptly rejected,\u201d and following this he considers the cases upon this subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">But the appellant contended that in the attestation clause the erasures are noted because the witness wrote under his name February 28, 1878. This date of witnessing does not indicate in any manner a purpose to note erasures or alterations made before execution, and the copy filed not showing evidence of alterations and erasures thus misled the appellee and she filed no affidavit. The learned trial judge therefore under these circumstances was not guilty of error in requiring appellant to make proof of the execution of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">When this bond was actually signed does not appear by the proofs, but clearly must have been prior to the minute of the bank already referred to. The alteration of the words \u201c was then signed\u201d and the insertion of the words \u201c with proper corrections \u201d indicate that it was signed before that date. As there is no proof upon the subject and as the paper originally bears date in 1871, and as it is not probable that a paper with no signatures should be preserved from 1871 to 1873, there is a reasonable presumption that the paper was signed at the time of the original date of the instrument. But the learned trial judge left if to the jury to find whether the date of the bond had been altered without appellee\u2019s knowledge or consent. By their verdict they have found the date was 1871, and that it was altered without her knowledge or assent.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>During 1871 the appellee\u2019s husband was alive and this bond then executed by her as a surety was absolutely void. If thus absolutely void, a naked ratification by her after discoverture did not make it binding upon her. If therefore in 1873 when discovert she simply acknowledged her signature, it was not sufficient to make her liable upon it. In Brown v. Bennett, 75 Pa. 423, it was held that the receipt of an installment after discoverture was in fact a redelivery of the instrument, but it was there said that a naked ratification after discoverture would not avail, and that a mere admission of liability might not be sufficient. In Buchanan v. Hazzard, 95 Pa. 243, it was held that a married woman\u2019s deed is absolutely void and that she cannot be estopped by any subsequent act of ratification, and that nothing but a new deed subsequently acknowledged could avail. In Glidden v. Strupler, 52 Pa. 403, it is said: \u201c The contract to convey being absolutely void because of incapacity, its ratification is equally forbidden unless by deed in the mode prescribed by the statute. No multiplication of deeds (and they are the most solemn acts in pais by which title can be transferred) will serve to ratify the void conveyance, unless made according to the statutory direction. Much less can express ratification by parol or expressions of satisfaction infuse life into that which has no vitality. How, then, is it possible mere acts can be more efficacious that merely indicate the intention to transfer, which the writing has already expressed in terms explicit and emphatic? Acquiescence in, or acknowledgment of the invalid act, cannot be invested with greater virtue or vigor than the deed itself by which the act was done. The policy of the law which denies the capacity to do the act as clearly denies the capacity to confirm it except in the legal mode.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">It is however argued that Jourdan v. Jourdan, 9 S. &amp; R. 268, is an authority for ratification in this case. There the offer was made to prove that, after the death of the 'husband, she, the wife, had delivered the deed, and as she had actually delivered the deed after discoverture it was held to be error not to permit proof of the fact. It is clear that tire scope of the proof was to show an actual delivery of the deed as her deed when she had become discovert. In the present case, while appellee was in the bank and standing behind the coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ter she simply acknowledged her signature and nothing more, and therefore the case last referred to cannot apply, as earnestly contended by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">It is contended that on February 28, 1873, the bond was in fact re-executed and that a redelivery of it then took place. If so redelivered with alterations, and if she at the time had no knowledge of them she cannot be held liable. The learned trial judge instructed the jury : \u201c If you shall find from an inspection of the bond that these alterations were made, then the question arises, were they made with the knowledge and assent of Mrs. Turner, the defendant ? If not made in that way, she would be relieved of her liability on this bond as a surety for her brother.\u201d lie thus left this to them as a question of fact to be determined by them. As the interlineations and erasures were questions of fact for the jury, Heffelfinger v. Shutz, 16 S. &amp; R. 44, they have found by their verdict that they were made without her knowledge or assent, and, if they were so made, clearly she cannot be held to be liable upon this bond: Miller v. Gilleland, 19 Pa. 123. When the principal party modifies his contract, it is fatal to its validity as against the surety whose assent has not been obtained, even if it be for his benefit, or if it do him no harm: Bensinger v. Wren, 100 Pa. 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">It has been argued that the bond in question was executed with the alterations and erasures, and delivered as such to the bank, and therefore the appellee is liable, but the evidence does not warrant this conclusion. The only witness upon this subject is Mr. Lance, who testified: That he dropped in the bank on February 28, 1873 ; that appellee was in the bank behind the counter; that the cashier was also there ; that the appellee did not sign it then, but that she acknowledged her signature; that the cashier handed him the bond; that he was requested to make the date of his witnessing it. There is no evidence therefore to show that the appellee knew that the date of the bond had been changed, or that any of the alterations had been made. She thus acknowledged her signature only, and the witness put his name to the paper with the date. If that bond, executed in 1871 during coverture and therefore void, was intended by her to be executed, she being discovert, and redelivered to the bank, this evidence does not establish it. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>learned judge charged the jury: \u201cIf you find that it has not been altered, in the manner alleged, if it was really signed not in 1871, but on 28th of February, 1878, you will then determine her liability.\u201d As the question of re-execution and redelivery was thus submitted to the jury, their verdict negatives this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The evidence does not warrant the conclusion that although she signed the bond in 1871 she in fact executed it February 28th, 1873, with a knowledge of the alteration, nor that the obligors retained this bond from 1871 and delivered it to the bank in 1873, with its date rewritten February 28, 1873. The alternative contention that, even if this bond was actually delivered to the bank in 1871, it was redelivered in 1873, the date being changed with her consent and knowledge, is not sustained by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">It is scarcely necessary to discuss the admission claimed to have been made by counsel for appellee. Its effect would necessarily have been fatal to her defence. It is therefore not possible that with this effect it could have been intended to be made. It would be a harsh rule to hold that the rights of parties may be swept away by admissions of counsel unintentionally made. The learned judge was right therefore in treating the admission as unintentional, and the jury in regarding it in the same light.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
