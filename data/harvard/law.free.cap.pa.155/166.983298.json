There being evidence that there are different rules of measurement in this locality, the parties are relegated to the rules of law. <em>Answer: </em>If you should conclude that there are different rules, then it affects the question of custom; but it does not dispose of the question as to how much work was done. If you should conclude there are various rules as to measuring, then you will reach the conclusion that there is no custom about it; that the custom is not so uniform and certain as to warrant you in saying that it is a custom. And still it is for you to ascertain how much work he did by the measurements which have been submitted.\u201d [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-13\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff.
