We think the case is ruled by the cases of Lysle v. Williams, 15 S. &amp; R. 136, and Marys v. Anderson, 24 Pa. 272. There is no substantial difference between the expressions used here and in those cases. The words are used not merely by way of computation, but a present interest is to commence from the date. In such case the day of the date is included. It is worthy of note that the first year\u2019s rent was paid June 12,1890.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-9\">\u201c Plaintiff is entitled to judgment for the amount of her claim, but the judgment should be without costs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-10\"><em>Error assigned </em>was making absolute rule for judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-11\"><em>T.
