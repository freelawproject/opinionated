J., it appeared that plaintiff, a baker, owned a house and lot on the southwest corner of Terrace and Cotton streets in Manayunk. Cotton street is thirty feet wide and so steep that it is difficult and dangerous for vehicles to use it. In 1891 the city erected, for the convenience of pedestrians, platforms and steps along the street on the side opposite plaintiff\u2019s property. These platforms and foundations were about fourteen feet wide and extended the whole length of plaintiff\u2019s lot, and so obstructed the street, plaintiff testified, that it could not be used for wagons. The court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-7\"><em>Eredriek A. </em>Sobernheimer, for appellant, cited:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALW0\">Patent v.
