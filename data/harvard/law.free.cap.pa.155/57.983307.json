Defendant paid rent for nearly a hundred weeks, not consecutively, ceasing to pay in March, 1887. On April 1, 1887, Albrecht &amp; Co. made an assignment for the benefit of creditors to Peter Boyd. Under an order of court the assignee assigned defendant\u2019s lease to plaintiff, who had been appointed trustee of the piano club. Plaintiff brought this action, defendant waiving the preliminary demand for surrender.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-10\">The court admitted in evidence, under objection by defendant, the auditor\u2019s report in the assigned estate of Albrecht &amp; Co., C. P. No. 1, March T., 1887, No. 533, for the purpose of showing title in the appellee, and his right to recover. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-11\">The court also admitted in evidence, under objection by defendant, the assignment of Peter Boyd, dated Oct. 27, 1888, assigning the particular lease (between Albrecht &amp; Co., and William J. Davis) to plaintiff.

I see no reason whjr the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, if you believe the testimony which has been offered. I see no reason why you should not believe it, as it is reasonable, it is probable and it is entirely uncontradieted. However, that is a matter for you. If you believe the testimony presented by the plaintiff in this case, you will find a yerdiet for the value of the piano, which has been fixed by the witness at $200. If you believe that is the right sum, you will find a verdict for that amount.\u201d [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-6\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-7\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1, 2) rulings on evidence, (8) the charge of the court, quoting it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-8\"><em>Charles </em>Davis, for appellant, cited:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE-\">Overton v.

The third specification, which alleges error in a portion of the charge of the court, is not sustained. There was abundance of evidence to show a conversion of the piano by the defendant, and, under the lease or agreement between Albrecht &amp; Co. and the defendant, the plaintiff was entitled to recover in this form of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
