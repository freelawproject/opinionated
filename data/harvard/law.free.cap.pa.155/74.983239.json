On a rule to open the judgment both defendants testified that, on April 1,1891, plaintiff\u2019s agent, S. S Cavin, Esq., agreed to accept a surrender of the term under the lease, which expired on April 15, 1891, and to give a new lease for two or three months. Mr. Cavin denied this. Plaintiff claimed that defendants\u2019 testimony was contradicted by the fact that three months\u2019 rent was paid after the expiration of the original term, and also by the following letter1, signed by both defendants :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-5\">\u201cPhiladelphia, May 80, 1891.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-6\">\u201c Chairman Boaed of City Teusts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-7\">\u201c Dear Sir : The undersigned were lessors of 134 South Third street, rooms 4 and 5, and their lease will not expire for nearly a year. They would respectfully ask that your board would relieve them from the lease, as they were connected with a short term order whose supreme office was at this address, which order is now out of business. Personally they are not able to pay the rent, and have no business which they could use the office for. While the order was in business the rent was paid by it, and not by the lessors.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-8\">Rule to open judgment discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b97-9\"><em>Error assigned </em>was above order of court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b97-10\"><em>S.
