All of the oil was inspected in Mc-Kean county, and the McKean county inspector had deputised a person in Philadelphia to place his brand upon defendant\u2019s oil. None of the oil was inspected in Philadelphia. Plaintiff therefore claimed that he was deprived of the fees, provided by the act of May 15, 1874, P. L. 189. Held, that a preliminary injunction restraining defendant from selling oil not inspected by plaintiff, and from using the name of the McKean county inspector, was properly granted and would not be reversed by the Supreme Court.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b295-7\">Argued April 4, 1893.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOz\">Appeal, No. 319, Jan.

Any premature expression oi opinion as to the merits of the controversy might prove to be misleading in the further development of the case before the master, as well as on final hearing in the court below. The only question now presented for our consideration is whether the court manifestly erred in granting the preliminary injunction. As at present advised we are not satisfied that any such error was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed, with costs to be paid by appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
