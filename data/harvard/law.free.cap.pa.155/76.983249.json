From what you know, what would be a fair rental for a river bank lot having say 130 feet on the Port Warden\u2019s line and running say 300 feet in depth ? What rental would you in 1885 have been willing to give for this river bank lot 130 feet in front, running back 300 feet in depth, as it stood without a sewer upon it?\u201d Objected to.

[6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-7\">\u201c 3. If the jury find that the plaintiff was prevented from using this property as a wharf, without unnecessary difficulty and expenditure by reason of defendant allowing its sewer head to remain upon it, and its sewer to flow upon it, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the fair annual value of the property as if devoted to its most advantageous natural use.\u201d Refused.
