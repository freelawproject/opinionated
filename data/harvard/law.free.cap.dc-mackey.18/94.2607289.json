McCLELLAN <em>vs. </em>THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b108-6\">1. An assessment for street improvements is void when the description of the property is so unintelligible that the court cannot ascertain the premises charged with the assessment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b108-8\">2. Where the lots claimed to be assessed are lots 41 and 42 of square 69, and the description is \u201c of 41 and 42,\u201d it is unintelligible and void.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b108-10\">3. Where an assessment contains charges not authorized by law it is to that extent void.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b108-12\">4. So, where the amount intended to'be assessed is given in figures only, with no mark to indicate the value represented by the figures, the assessment is void.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b108-14\">5. Bensinger <em>vs. </em>The District, 6 Mackey, 288, and Walker <em>vs. </em>The District, 6 Mackey, 355, <em>affirmed.</em></headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-16\">At Law.</p>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"AkA\">No. 27,834.</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AOq\">Decided January 14, 1889.</decisiondate>\n<judges data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-17\">The Chief Justice and Justices James and Merrick sitting.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-18\">Proceedings in <em>certiorari </em>to quash a special assessment for street improvements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b108-19\">The Pacts are sufficiently stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-20\">Messrs. Birney &amp; Birney for petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-21\">Mr. A. G. Riddle for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b108-22\">Mr. Chief Justice Bingham</author>\n<p id=\"AdV\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-23\">This is a petition by the plaintiff to quash the assessments laid upon lots 41 and 42 in square 69, of which he claims to be the owner. The lots are bounded on the east by Twenty-first street, and front on Twenty-first street 22 feet and 6 inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-24\">In the assessment upon this lot the description is \u201c of 41 and 42.\u201d In Bensinger <em>vs. </em>The District of Columbia, 6 Mackey, 288, it was held that such a description was not so intelligible as to enable the court, or any one, to ascertain the premises upon which the charge was made, and consequently that an attempted assessment on premises by such a description was illegal and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>It' would appear also that the ordinance authorized curbing, paving, and guttering only, and that when making the assessment, grading and materials were added, and charges were added for cobblestones and gutter-stones.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">These, it appears, were payable at the time out of ward funds, and were not the subject of assessment against the property, and to the extent of the same the assessment would for that reason be invalid. So held in the case of Walker and Simmons <em>vs. </em>District of Columbia, 6 Mackey, 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u2022 Again, the amounts are given in figures only. No mark is connected with the figures, so that, any one can determin\u00e9 whether or not values are represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">This court held in Walker <em>vs. </em>District <em>(supra) </em>that where an assessment was made and no values were given in writing, or in figures, intelligently connected with a proper dollar-mark or other indication of value, that no addition would be made by the court, and that the assessment would be quashed. Bensinger <em>vs. </em>District, 6 Mackey, 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">For these reasons this assessment will be quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
