The complainant, in June, 1886, abandoned Washington, and went to her native place, Detroit, Mich., thereby acquiring a Michigan domicile. At her marriage complainant acquired the domicile of her husband, namely, Vermont. On leaving Saratoga Springs, in August, 1887, complainant was domiciled in Vermont, and she has never since been in Washington.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-7\">2. To entertain jurisdiction the court must be satisfied that at the date of the filing of the bill (1) Mrs. Bradstreet had a domicile in this District; or(2) in the event that Mr. Bradstreet\u2019s domicile was elsewhere his wife had acquired, for the purpose of obtaining a divorce, a domicile here. Neither of these propositions are proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-8\">3. The certificate of marriage, signed by both parties August 6, 1886, gives as Mr. Bradstreet\u2019s residence, \u201c Boyalton, Vt.\u201d Mrs. Bradstreet therein alleges her residence to be \u201c Detroit, Mich.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-9\">The defendant is only temporarily in Washington. A clerk of a legislative committee is less distinctly <em>\u201c </em>located \u201d in this District than are clerks of the Executive Departments.

County, within the meaning of the code providing that the plaintiff in an action of divorce must have been an actual resident in good faith of the county at the' time of filing. Plaintiff lived at Leavenworth (not in N. County) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>for five years as collector of internal revenue, going to N. County to vote, and keeping there a sleeping apartment and his law library. He married in Pennsylvania, brought his wife to Leavenworth, and kept house there. It does not appear that she ever went to N. County. <em>Held, </em>that he wras an actual resident of N. County. See, also, Hayes <em>vs. </em>Hayes, 74 Ill., 312, where it was held that as regards distribution of personal property a domicile in Illinois is not lost by the party residing in Iowa, owing to domestic troubles, and by his voting there (Iowa\u2019s laws authorizing one to vote on a residence of six months) or by his purchasing a house and lot there on speculation.

He has no business interest in this District, no money invested here in real estate or otherwise. He was not in the habit of staying here after his active work at the Capitol ceased. He came here from Vermont solely to act as clerk of a committee,'a temporary office that he might be obliged to vacate at a moment\u2019s notice. His home is in Vermont, and while traveling he registered his name and that of his wife as of \u201cRoyalton, Vermont.\u201d He has effects at his father\u2019s house in Royalton, and a room kept there as specially his own. He accompanies the Vermont Senator to that State on the adjournment of the Senate.

Jacobs on Domicile, Sec. 76; Ross <em>vs. </em>Ross, 103 Mass., 575; Bishop on Mar. &amp; Div., Sec. 124.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-6\">The chairman of the committee testifies that he thinks Mr. Bradstreet\u2019s stay \u201cis precisely like my stay here in my official capacity as a Senator, and that we are both citizens and residents of Vermont.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b248-7\">4. The plaintiff left Washington before her marriage to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>defendant, and returned to her domicile of origin, Michigan. <em>Re </em>Walker, 1 Lowell, 237. Thence she wrote to defendant : \u201c It seems now that I want to stay right here as long as I live. I never shall return.\u201d She was married here in August, 1886, as of Michigan. After deserting the defendant at Saratoga Springs, she has never visited Washington, but has sent here and had her furniture in part sold, the rest sent to her home in Michigan.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-4\">It is not necessary to deny the proposition that for the purposes of divorce a wife may obtain a domicile in this District while her husband has lived and continues to live elsewhere. The facts here show that plaintiff has not obtained such a domicile, nor has she ever taken steps thereto.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-5\">Mr. Bradstreet\u2019s domicile being in Vermont, this court has no jurisdiction of the bill, because the plaintiff had not resided within the District for two years next preceding the date of her application. Section 740 Devised Statutes provides that \u201c No divorce shall be granted for any cause which shall. have occurred out of the District, unless the party applying for the same shall have resided within the District for two years next preceding the application.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-6\">The bill alleges cruelties committed in Washington in December, 1886, and proceeds to show that the parties lived here as man and wife, until June, 1887, 'when they left Washington together for a summer trip to New Hampshire, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-7\">The cruelties alleged to have been committed six months before they left the District, her bill on its face shows were condoned. The cause, therefore, for which divorce is now asked is certain misconduct alleged to have taken place outside the District, viz., in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b249-8\">That a cause of divorce for cruelty once condoned may be revived by subsequent cruel treatment we admit, but we submit that it is not revived for any other purpose than as evidence that may be urged to satisfy the court in corroboration of a <em>present </em>cause, that the parties ought no longer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>live together. The condonation differs from that in cases of adultery, the effect of the injury being entirely dissimilar. The language of the statute is: \u201c No divorce shall be granted for <em>any </em>cause which shall have occurred out of the District, unless,\u201d <em>&amp;c. </em>If it be necessary to prove acts of cruelty committed out of the District in order to sustain this bill, then the wholesome restriction of the statute applies. The cruelty here charged must endanger life or health. It is not sufficient that there be a reasonable apprehension, to the satisfaction of the court, of bodily harm. This latter condition of affairs warrants a divorce from bed and board only. The real <em>cause </em>asserted in the bill is cruelty inflicted in New Hampshire.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-3\">The statute being designed for <em>bona fide </em>residents, and not for the benefit of outsiders, Mrs. Bradstreet cannot be regarded as having resided here for two years preceding the filing of her bill. Her resigning her office and going to her old home in Michigan, and writing thence that she should never return, brought to an end any domicile she may have previously had in Washington. This result accords with her own act in signing afterward her marriage certificate as a resident of Detroit, Michigan. The attempt of her daughter (whose testimony is involved in contradictions) to overcome the effects of this letter is useless. The letter, written just after she had left Washington, and had gone back to her domicile of origin, is not easily set aside by present protestations that her intentions were entirely different from what she at that time announced them to be.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-4\">A non-resident plaintiff (whether husband or wife) cannot invoke the jurisdiction of this court in divorce proceedings. So far as the opinion in Smith <em>vs. </em>Smith, 4 Mackey, 255, would appear to depart from the well-settled principles in this regard, it ought to be made the subject, upon proper occasion, of careful review.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b250-5\">Mr. Justice Bradley</author>\n<p id=\"AD1\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">This is a proceeding for divorce. The petition was filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>October 25, 1887. The petitioner, Sarah Bradstreet, alleges in her petition that she was married to the defendant, George P. Bradstreet, in the District of Columbia, the 6th day of August, 1886 ; that she is temporarily stopping in the city of Detroit, State of Michigan; that she had resided in the District -of Columbia for more than ten years prior to filing her petition, and that the defendant is also a resident of said District of Columbia. Her prayers for relief are based upon several alleged acts of cruelty on the part of the defendant, which are set forth in the petition, some of which are claimed to have occurred in the District of Columbia, and the last of which are alleged to have occurred outside of this District, some time in the summer of 1887.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The defendant was served with process, and on November 12, 1887, he filed his plea in bar, alleging that petitioner was not a resident of the District of Columbia at the time of filing her petition; that she had not resided therein for two years next preceding her application; that before her marriage with defendant she was a resident of, and domiciled in, the State of Michigan; that she deserted the defendant and went to the State of Michigan, where she resided at the date of filing her petition; and that defendant is not, and never has been, a resident of the District of Columbia,- but has always been, and still is, a resident of Royalton, Vt., which is his domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Issue being joined upon this plea, evidence was taken in behalf of both parties, and the cause having been set down for hearing, it has been certified to this court to be heard in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Prom the testimony it appears that at the time of her marriage to the defendant the petitioner was a widow; that she came to the District of Columbia with her first husband, H. H. Cushing, and their children, and commenced housekeeping with him here in the month of May, 1868; that she continued to reside here with him until his death; that in 1872, after his death, she obtained a position in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Post-Office Department, and continued as a clerk in said Department until June 28, 1886, when she resigned her position or was removed by the Postmaster-General, when she went to Michigan with her daughters; that during all this time she kept house and resided (with her children, two daughters and a son,) in this District; that when she went to Michigan in June, 1886, she left her house in this city open and in charge of servants; that she left Michigan and returned to Washington, and was married to the defendant, August 6, 1866; that she returned to Washington for the purpose of looking after her house, and to decide whether to accept another Government position; of which she then had the promise, or to marry the defendant; that after her marriage to defendant, he rented a house, No. 2017 Q, street N. W., in this city, where she lived with him until the summer of 1887, when she went away with him for a summer trip, during which, on account of grief at her daughter\u2019s death, and because of defendant\u2019s alleged bad treatment, in the month of August, she went to visit her brother in Detroit; that she intended to return to this District, but, upon the advice of her brother, she remained in Detroit pending the divorce proceedings, her petition for divorce being sworn to in that city, and forwarded from there to this jurisdiction to be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">It is beyond dispute that the petitioner was a <em>bona fide </em>resident of the District of Columbia from 1868 until she resigned her office in June, 1886. It is claimed, however, that Michigan was her domicile of origin, and that when she returned there in June, 1886, she wrote to the defendant a letter, which, in stating that their former relations were now severed and entirely at an end, also uses the expression \u201c I never shall return,\u201d and that inasmuch as the domicile of origin reverts easily, this declaration coupled with actual presence in that State, effected the change of domicile. But the evidence shows that she had the promise of another office in Washington ; that she had left her house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>here open and in charge of servants, and that she fully intended to return, and that statement considered in its connection, and with the circumstances surrounding it, appears rather to be a declaration that she would never return to her former relations with the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\">It is also claimed that the petitioner was not a resident of this District at the time of her application, inasmuch as she deserted the defendant at Saratoga, in August, 1887, and went to Michigan to permanently remain. This claim is not sustained by the evidence, which shows that she is temporarily visiting her brother in that State, and that she is abiding with him pending this proceeding and intends to return to this Distirct upon its termination.-</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Unless, therefore, the law requires something more than actual <em>bona fide </em>residence in this District of the party complaining, in order to maintain a suit for divorce, and unless the defendant, at the time of the marriage, was domiciled in Vermont, and was there domiciled at the time of this application, and such domicile drew to it that of the petitioner, so that she was no longer a. resident of this District in the sense of the law from the time of her marriage to defendant, the requirement that the party applying has \u201cresided within the District for two.years next preceding the application,\u201d is fully satisfied by the proof in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Was the defendant domiciled in Vermont? Vermont was his domicile of origin, but at the time of marriage he had not resided in that State for thirteen years. He had only visited his old home for a short stay in the summer. Had spent a part of his summers in travelling, and the remainder of the year he had resided in this District. This residence here was not for any definite, limited stay, but for ten years defendant had been clerk to the' Judiciary Committee of the Senate, intending and expecting to remain here as long as that employment lasted. During this time he had boarded with the petitioner; h\u2018ad furnished a room in her house, and had removed furniture from Vermont to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Washington, for that purpose.' He had no home in Vermont in the proper sense of the word. His father was domiciled in that State, and the defendant was accorded the privilege of stopping at his father\u2019s house when visiting Royalton in consideration of the payment of board. He had not voted or paid taxes in that State for several years, but whether he had preserved or lost his political rights is not considered material. He was married here. He rented and furnished a house where he resided with petitioner and her daughters, and the evidence discloses efforts on his part to purchase that house, and declarations that if he could purchase he wpuld spend the .summers here.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">\u201cIf a person has actually removed to another place with an intention of remaining there for an indefinite time, and as a place of fixed present domicile, it is deemed his place of domicile notwithstanding he may entertain a floating intention to return at some future period.\u201d Story Confl. Laws, Sec. 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u201cBut what amount of proof is necessary to change a domicile of origin into a <em>prima facie </em>domicile of choice ? It is residence elsewhere or where a person lives out of the domicile of origin. That repels the presumption of its continuance, and casts upon him who denies the domicile of choice the burden of disproving it. Where a person lives is taken <em>prima facie </em>to be his domicile until other facts establish the contrary.\u201d Ennis <em>vs. </em>Smith, 14 How., 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">\u25a0 In Ringgold <em>vs. </em>Bailey, 5 Md., 186, the court says upon this subject: \u201cThe party\u2019s purpose to remain need not be fixed and unalterable. If it becomes a place of fixed present domicile it will be sufficient to fix a residence, and although there may be a floating intention to return to his former place of abode at some future period, still these circumstances will not defeat the newly acquired residence or the rights and obligations which attach to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In Mooar <em>vs. </em>Harvey, 128 Mass., 219, it appeared that defendant enlisted in the army, and in February, 1864, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>was detailed as bookkeeper in the Surgeon-General\u2019s office in Washington. In 1869 he was appointed a clerk in the Treasury Department at Washington, which office he held at the time of suit; that since February, 1864, he had lived in Washington. <em>Held, </em>that although\u2019the defendant was in military service, he could change his domicile to any place he saw fit. \u201cThe jury would be justified in finding that since 1864 he had actually lived in Washington with short occasional absences. This is one essential element of domicile in Washington. The remaining element is the intent with which he lived there * * * he lived in Washington, and all the outward <em>indicia </em>which usually determines the domicile of a person appointed to that place as the place where he resided and had his home. The evidence tended to show that he had not paid taxes nor voted in Lawrence since 1862. This failure to perform the duties and avail himself of the privileges of a citizen is a significant fact pointing to a change of domicile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">The evidence shows that at the time of filing the petition in this proceeding,'the defendant had lived out of his domicile of origin for thirteen years, and that during that time he had resided in Washington. This was <em>prima facie </em>the domicile of choice, and imposed upon him the burden, which he also assumed by his plea, of proving that he had retained his Vermont domicile of origin. This burden has been assumed to be lifted by the inference sought to be drawn from the alleged temporary character of the defendant\u2019s employment, and his presence in the District of Columbia, under such employment, has been, likened to that of a United States Senator, who may be temporarily located here representing the interests of his State. It is apparent, however, that the employment, although, subject to termination at any time by the will of the Judiciary Committee, was not of a mere temporary nature, but was for an indefinite time; that the duties of such employment required the presence of the defendant in Washington during the greater portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>the year. Unlike a Senator he is pursuing here his own business, seeking his own interests, and representing himself <em>exclusively. </em>His acquisition of a new domicile here is not only not inconsistent with his employment, occupation, and interests, but is thoroughly consistent with them, and the legitimate conclusion from the whole evidence of his conduct and declarations is that this District was and is his domicile of choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">If, therefore, in Sec. 740, E. S. D. C., the word \u201c resided \u201d means \u201c domiciled,\u201d we find that the petitioner and defendant were here domiciled at the time of their marriage, and that this was their domicile at the time of making this application.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The result of this conclusion is, we overrule the plea to the jurisdiction and remand the case to the Special Term.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
