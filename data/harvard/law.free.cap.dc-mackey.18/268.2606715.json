Wheeler and James Hoban for complainant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-15\">The evidence shows that the lot enhanced in value after title acquired by Young and before the death of plaintiff\u2019s husband in 1887.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-16\">The court referred the case to the Auditor with instructions to ascertain the value of the lot in 1875, when Young acquired title. The complainant claims that the value is to be taken according to its value at the time of her husband\u2019s death, when it was more valuable, and hence this appeal from said order, which settled the only material point in the case so far as complainant\u2019s right may be concluded by an allowance of dower under said order of reference. See Bowie <em>vs. </em>Berry, 1 Md. Ch., 452; Hitch <em>vs. </em>Davis, 3 <em>Id., </em>266.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b282-17\">Mr. Westel Willoughby for defendants:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-18\">Authorities are conflicting as to the allowance of increased value arising from extrinsic causes.

She is entitled to no advantage from enhancement of value either by improvements made by the alienee or from general rise in the value, or from any cause whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-4\">In Dorchester <em>vs. </em>Coventry, 11 John., 510, the court say: \u201c The widow does not have the benefit of the improvements or of the increased value or appreciation of the land; the defendant must accordingly have judgment for one-third of the premises in value as they were at the alienation of the husband.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-5\">In Hall <em>vs. </em>James, 6 John. Ch., 258, Kent, J., the land had decreased in value. <em>Held, </em>that the same rule applies. It should be the same both as to the widow and the purchaser. See also Humphrey <em>vs. </em>Finney, 2 John., 584.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-6\">It would not be proper to decree a sale of the property. 17 Rich., 248; 15 Mass., 164; 2 N.

Dec., 603 ; 80 <em>Id., </em>707.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b283-7\">Decree for specific sum cannot be assigned without consent of all parties. 7 Cranch., 370.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b283-8\">Mr. Justice Montgomery</author>\n<p id=\"ABq\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">On the 19th day of December last, this cause was submitted to the court below on pleadings and proofs; two decrees were made, the first dismissing the bill as to the defendant McKenny, and the last adjudging that the \u201cdower interest of the complainant in the property in controversy should be determined according to the value of the property in the year 1875,\u201d and referring it to the Auditor \u201c to take further proof as to the value of the premises\u201d in 1875, from which last decree the complainant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The bill was filed on the 20th day of June last. It averred, among other things, that complainant in 'the year 1860 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>intermarried with one Basil Baden, who in July, 1887, died intestate, and who daring coverture was \u201cseized in fee simple\u201d of a part of lot 9 and all of lot 10, in square 173, in this city; that this property is worth $2,500; that Mr. Baden \u201cmade disposition thereof without complainant\u2019s consent,\u201d and that by <em>\u201cmesne </em>conveyances it passed to and is held and owned by defendant Young.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\">Complainant prays for \u201c dower in said real estate,\u201d and if such dower cannot be \u201c assigned in specie,\u201d then that such \u201creal estate may be sold,\u201d and \u201ca just equivalent in money may be decreed to her in lieu thereof.\u201d Mr. Young, in his answer, declined to admit the death of Mr. Baden, but did admit the ownership and purchase of the property by him as averred in the bill, except that he asserts that he <em>contracted </em>for it in 1878 or 1879, and was afterwards compelled to resort to a bill in equity for specific performance, which he did, obtaining his decree in the year 1880, at which time the property was worth, he alleges, about $300. His answer also avers that he had paid out sums in improvements and taxes on the property, such sum aggregating about $700, and he denies that it is now worth $2,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The marriage is proven, as alleged in the bill. It is also proven, and not disputed, that Mr. and Mrs., Baden lived together here as husband and wife from the time they were married until the month of March, 1878, when he left and went to some place unknown to the complainant, and that she has never since heard anything from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">It also appears from the evidence that Mr. Baden sold the property to one Essex Roberts upon contract in 1875, and that Mr. Roberts sold to defendant,. Young, also upon contract, in 1878. Some testimony as to value was also taken and filed prior to the submission of the cause below.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The decree appealed from is treated by all concerned as having established finally the basis upon which complainant\u2019s interest is to be determined, and no question is made, but an appeal lies from such a decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Neither is the legal propriety of the joinder of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>fendants questioned, and we, therefore, <em>assume </em>that such joinder was correct. Allen <em>vs. </em>Meloy, 8 Ohio, 463; 2 Scribner on Dower, 158-9; Marshal <em>vs. </em>Anderson, 1 B. &amp; Mon. (Ky.), 198; Barney <em>vs. </em>Frowner, 9 Ala., 901; Boynen <em>vs. </em>Lancaster, 2 P. &amp; H. (Va.), 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Mr. Young\u2019s counsel urges <em>first, </em>\u201cthat there is no competent evidence of Mr. Badfen\u2019s death, and <em>second, </em>that the complainant if entitled to dower at all in these lands is only \u201cdowable * * * as of the value thereof at the time of alienation\u201d by the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">It is true that Mr. Baden\u2019s death is not directly proven, but it is fairly shown, and seems to be undisputed that he left his home and family eleven years ago, and has never been heard of since.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The rule seems well settled that <em>\u201c </em>after the lapse of seven years without intelligence concerning a person, the presumption of life ceases.\u201d 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, 57; 1 Bishop on Marriage and Divorce, 452; Rice <em>vs. </em>Rice, 10 Ohio St., 996 ; Newman <em>vs. </em>Jenkins, 10 Pick., 515; Bailey <em>vs. </em>Bailey, 36 Mich., 182; Rosenthal <em>vs. </em>Mayhugh, 33 Ohio St., 155; Whiting <em>vs, </em>Nicoll, 46 Ill., 235. We must, therefore, for the purposes of this suit presume the death of Mr. Baden.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Now, should the interest of complainant be determined according to the value of the property at the time of aliention by the husband, or shall she be permitted to profit by its enhanced value, if any, which \u201c has arisen from extrinsic and general causes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">. ' When Mr. Baden became seized of these lands his wife\u2019s inchoate right of dower attached, and her title thereto became \u201c consummate\u201d at his death. 4 Kent\u2019s Com., 67 ; Price <em>vs. </em>Hobbs., 47 Md., 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">\u201c.The alienation of the husband conferred no title on the alienee as against the wife in respect of her dower.\u201d 1 Scribner on Dower, 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">The right of dower is a \u201c strictly legal right.\u201d 1 Story\u2019s Eq. Jurisp., 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">It is highly favored in equity. <em>Id., </em>629, 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>It \u201cwas one of the three principal favorites of the common law.\u201d 4 Kent\u2019s Com., 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">We are unable to see any good reason why the dower of this woman in these lands \u201c must be regulated by the value thereof at the time of alienation.\u201d On the contrary we are satisfied upon principle that while she cannot be allowed to share in \u201c the improved value * * * w'hich has arisen from the actual labor and money of the owner,\u201d she should not be denied her dower interest in such part of their improved value, if any, as \u201c has arisen from extrinsic and general causes,\u201d and this view is, we think, supported by the great weight of authority in this country. 2 Scribner on Dower, 618; 4 Kent\u2019s Com., 68 ; Bowie <em>vs. </em>Berry, 1 Md.

Ch., 258; Dorchester <em>vs. </em>Coventry, 11 John., 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The New York cases, however, rest upon a statute enacted in 1806,'which declares that \u201c dower of any lands sold by the husband shall be according to the value of the lands, exclusive of the improvements made since the sale. 2 Scribner on Dower, 614; Walker <em>vs. </em>Schuyler, 10 Wend., 483; Dorchester <em>vs. </em>Coventry, 11 John., 510; Allen <em>vs. </em>McCoy, 8 Ohio, 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>And in Dorchester <em>vs. </em>Coventry the court declares that it could not be \u201cpresumed that the legislature intended to make a distinction between the improvements and the increased value of the land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">In support of his position upon this question counsel for Mr. Young cites three of the cases above referred to, viz: Tod <em>vs. </em>Baylor, Hale <em>vs. </em>James, and Dorchester <em>vs. </em>Coventry.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In the <em>first </em>it appears that the husband aliened in 1801, and died twenty-three years later. Meanwhile the purchaser had expended $1,270 in permanent improvements. In 1827 the widow exhibited her bill, praying dower in the land so aliened. The chancellor decreed that \u201c do'wer be allotted according to the present value of the lands with all its improvements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed the decree, declaring that \u201cwhen the husband alienes during coverture the widow-shall not be entitled to dower according to the <em>improved value </em>of the land, but must take her dower according to the value at the time of alienation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In Hale <em>vs. </em>James, the \u2019husband of complainant mortgaged the land in dispute to the defendant in 1814, and some years afterwards conveyed to defendant his equity of redemption. He died in 1821, and a few months later his widow filed her bill asking for dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">When mortgaged, the lands, <em>\u201cexclusive </em>of subsequent improvements,\u201d were worth $9,600; when conveyed, $7,333, and at the husband\u2019s death, $6,166, it was held that the <em>date </em>of the <em>deed </em>was to be \u201cdeemed to be the period of alienation, at which the valuation was to be taken,\u201d and that such value should be \u201cestimated without regard to the subsequent improvements made by the purchaser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">In Dorchester <em>vs. </em>Coventry, the husband conveyed in 1804 and died in 1813 \u2014 when conveyed, the land was worth $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">On the trial of the cause brought by the widow to recover dower, it appeared that the value of the land was <em>then </em>$1,750 \u2022 \u201c exclusive of buildings erected since the alienation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>It was held that the widow was entitled to \u201chave judgment according to the value of the land at the time of the alienation.\u201d The court says that the statute (of 1806 above referred to) \u201c cannot admit of any other reasonable interpretation.\u201d And then follows the language above quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">In most, if not all, of the cases outside of New York, and in many, or most of the New York cases, the question passed upon was not whether the widow should or should not have the benefit of the increased value \u201c which had arisen from extrinsic or general causes,\u201d but it was whether or not the increased value which had arisen from .the actual labor and money of the ailenee should be shared by her in accordance with what seems to be the rule established in England. 2 Scribner on Dower, 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Very few, if any, authorities can be found in this country in conflict with the doctrine declared by Judge Story in Powell <em>vs. </em>Morrison, that the widow whose husband has, without her consent, aliened land of which he was seized, and in which she had an inchoate right of dower, was entitled to such interest \u201c as would be equal in value to one just third part\u201d of \u201cthe present value, * <em>* </em>* exclusive of the increased value occasioned by the building and improvements on the premises since the alienation thereof by the husband,\u201d- and such we regard as the settled law of the land, in the absence of statutory provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">We think that in this case the complainant is entitled to a decree directing that the value of her \u201c dower interest * * * in the property in controversy is to be determined according to the value of such property at the present time, less the amount, if anything, which has arisen from the actual labor and money of the owner.\u201d It should be ascertained what sum this property would now be fairly worth if the expenditures and improvements alleged to have been made by Mr. Young since he purchased, had not been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">The cause will be remanded to the court below for further action in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
