In this regard he relies upon <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684, 6 L. Ed 2d 1081 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">In dismissing this petition, the District Judge said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-5\">\u201cAgain we must repeat, as we did in the former petition filed in this Court, that nowhere does it appear that the petitioner has exhausted the appeal remedies available to him in the State Courts, in fact, nowhere in the record supplied to us by the petitioner does he allege that he ever appealed from his conviction in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Further, we agree with the decision of the Ohio Supreme Court in the habeas corpus proceeding heretofore pursued before it that the questions propounded by petitioner are not cognizable under habeas corpus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-6\">\u201cPetitioner presents no new ground not heretofore presented and determined in this Court and in the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and, therefore, comes within the provisions of Section 2244, Title 28 United States Code Annotated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">This has a very familiar ring, since petitioner in the current appeal was the petitioner in <em>Saulsbury </em>v. <em>Green, </em>318 F. 2d 320 (C. A. 6, 1963), which is the leading ease in this Circuit on the question of Ohio\u2019s posteonviction remedies. In that case we held that Saulsbury had not exhausted his State remedies because he had not been to the State Supreme Court on habeas corpus or filed a motion for leave to take a delayed appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">In the interval, it appears clear that he has done the former. See <em>Saulsbury </em>v. <em>Green, </em>175 Ohio St. 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">It likewise appears that the Supreme Court of Ohio has given him an evidentiary hearing on his Fourth Amendment claim and has entered findings of fact adverse to him. In the cited opinion the Supreme Court of Ohio has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-10\">\u201cPetitioner as his first ground for release argues that he was convicted upon evidence obtained by illegal search and seizure. From the evidence introduced at the hearing, it appears that federal officers, suspecting narcotics were being sold, gave money to an individual who went to petitioner\u2019s apartment and purchased marijuana cigarettes. The agents had fisted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>serial numbers of tbe money. When tbe informer came out of tbe building, he turned tbe cigarettes over to tbe agents and they in company with city detectives went to petitioner\u2019s apartment. They were admitted by him and searched tbe apartment and found no narcotics but did find part of tbe marked money in petitioner\u2019s clothes. Upon this evidence, petitioner was prosecuted under tbe state law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\">\u201cIt is only evidence that is obtained by an illegal search that is inadmissible under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In the present situation, the officers bad good cause to believe that a felony bad been committed. Tbe search was pursuant to a lawful arrest. It has long been held that a search pursuant to a lawful arrest is reasonable, and evidence obtained thereby is admissible. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>331 U. S. 145, 67 S. Ct. 1098, 91 L. Ed. 1399; and <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U. S. 307, 79 S. Ct. 329, 3 L. Ed. 2d 327.\u201d <em>Saulsbury </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>at 433-434.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">It thus appears that the only federal constitution issue presented to the District Judge has been presented to tbe Ohio Supreme Court and has been adjudicated against petitioner upon tbe merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">It would be an exercise in futility to require petitioner to go back to,this same court with a petition for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">However, as an alternative ground for dismissal of petitioner\u2019s application for writ of habeas corpus, the Ohio Supreme Court also held that <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>was not applicable retroactively. This view has now been adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>85 S. Ct. 1731 (Decided June 7, 1965); <em>United States ex rel. Angelet </em>v. <em>Fay, </em>333 F. 2d 12 (C. A. 2, 1964), aff\u2019d. 85 S. Ct. 1750 (1965), (Decided June 7, 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">Petitioner herein was convicted and sentenced in June of 1956. He did not appeal. <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>was decided June 19, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">The dismissal of the petition is affirmed. <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-11\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
