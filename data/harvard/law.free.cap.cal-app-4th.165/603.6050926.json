Osorio contends the admission of a victim\u2019s out-of-court statements describing her attacker violated his right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004) 541 U.S. 36 [158 L.Ed.2d 177, 124 S.Ct. 1354] <em>(Crawford). </em>He also contends the trial court erred in failing to stay a 10-year gang enhancement because the court stayed the sentence on the underlying offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">In the published portion of this opinion, we reject Osorio\u2019s <em>Crawford </em>challenge. The trial court properly admitted the victim\u2019s statements to a paramedic and a police officer at the scene because they were nontestimonial. The trial court properly admitted the victim\u2019s third description of the attacker as partial impeachment under Evidence Code section 1202 of her earlier descriptions. The trial court correctly instructed the jury to consider the third description as impeachment only, and there is nothing in the record indicating the jury failed to follow that instruction. Finally, in the unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude the trial court erred in failing to stay the gang enhancement attached to the robbery conviction. Accordingly, we stay the gang enhancement and affirm the judgment as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">Osorio belonged to the Los Males gang and in that circle was known by his gang moniker, \u201cCriminal.\u201d Sometime around midnight on the evening of October 6, 2000, Osorio entered the Anaheim apartment of Angela King, a 34-year-old civilian traffic officer for the Anaheim Police Department. When King returned home, Osorio shot her and fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-13\">After the shooting, Osorio rode his bicycle to the home of Andrew Guzzetta, a member or associate of the Los Malos gang. Guzzetta, Jose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Arroyo, a fellow Los Malos member, and his brother Cesar, Joshua Parsons, and others congregated at the home drinking beer and smoking marijuana. When Osorio arrived, he told the group he had just \u201cshot a pig.\u201d Osorio explained he had heard there were guns in the apartment and he intended to steal them, but was interrupted when a woman in uniform came home. When the woman attempted to stop Osorio from leaving, he said he \u201cfreaked out,\u201d shot her, and dragged her back into the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Osorio showed the group a wallet he had taken, which contained King\u2019s police photo identification. Agitated and nervous, Osorio concluded he needed to get rid of the wallet. He put the wallet in a dog dish, poured oil on it, and set it on fire. He then picked up the burned wallet and handed it to Parsons, who agreed to dispose of it for Osorio.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The wallet was then buried in a vacant lot behind Guzzetta\u2019s house. Osorio told the others he had to go back to the apartment to eliminate his fingerprints, and left on his bicycle carrying a container of flammable liquid and a gym towel.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Around 1:00 a.m., fire broke out in King\u2019s unit and another apartment in the same complex rented by 70-year-old Betty Easley. A neighbor ran into Easley\u2019s apartment and found Easley standing in the back doorway yelling, \u201cHelp me. Help me.\u201d Easley clutched her throat and explained a burglar had tried to kill her by strangling her. Easley, covered in blood, was in shock. Her throat had been slashed and she was bleeding from stab wounds in the front and back. Neighbors escorted Easley to a detached unit behind the burning building. When a paramedic arrived at the scene, Easley described her attacker as a \u201cwhite,\u201d bald male, approximately 40 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Sergeant Brian McElhaney of the Anaheim Police Department also spoke with Easley at the scene. McElhaney asked Easley to tell him what happened and to describe her attacker. Easley said she had arrived home, turned on the apartment lights, and a man suddenly stabbed her. Easley described her attacker as \u201cwhite,\u201d balding, in his 40\u2019s, wearing a brown shirt, and about the same size as the officer, who stood six feet and weighed 195 pounds. She explained she could not see him clearly because the room was dark. McElhaney asked Easley where the man had gone, and she responded that he fled out the back of the apartment. Paramedics transported Easley to the hospital. She had a slash wound to her neck, multiple stab wounds, a collapsed left lung, soot in her mouth and throat, inhalation injuries, low blood pressure from blood loss, and a blackened eye. Firefighters found King lying on the floor of her burning apartment, with a gunshot wound to her head and bums on both arms. King was transported to a nearby hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Sometime after Osorio left Guzzetta\u2019s house on his bicycle, Guzzetta, Jose, Cesar, and Parsons moved up the street to the home of Parsons\u2019s friend, Adam Hazlett. There, they drank beer, smoked marijuana, and talked about what had happened. About 25 minutes later, Osorio arrived on his bicycle. Osorio told the group, \u201cI just lit the place up.\u201d He explained that he rode back to King\u2019s apartment to get rid of evidence, but mistakenly walked into the wrong unit. When Osorio encountered an elderly woman inside the apartment, he stabbed her and slit her throat because he did not want any witnesses. Osorio\u2019s forearms were covered in blood, and he had blood stains on his clothes. He recounted how he had shot a woman wearing a police uniform, and explained he set fire to her apartment to eliminate his fingerprints and any other evidence. While talking to the group, Osorio removed a small .22- or .25-caliber pistol from his waistband and wiped blood from it with his shirt. He said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to get rid of this,\u201d and attempted to hand over the gun, but no one would take it.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">On October 8, 2000, King died from the gunshot wound. Investigators determined she had been shot at point-blank range. At the autopsy, the pathologist removed a .25-caliber bullet fragment from her brain. On October 10, 2000, Detective Karen Schroepfer interviewed Easley in her hospital room. Unable to speak, Easley wrote on a notepad. In describing her assailant, she noted he had tan skin. Easley remained hospitalized until she died from pneumonia on December 11, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">On October 7, 2000, Parsons retrieved King\u2019s buried wallet and contacted police the following day. Parsons told investigators a person known as \u201cCriminal,\u201d and matching Osorio\u2019s description, had given him the wallet. He also told police that Osorio had described how he had committed the crime. Parsons identified Osorio from a six-pack lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">On October 9, 2000, officers placed Osorio\u2019s house under surveillance. About 10:30 p.m., a male Hispanic emerged from the residence, walked to the front sidewalk, looked up and down the street several times, and then reentered the residence. He repeated his surveillance six to eight times over a period of five minutes. At 11:30 p.m., the man repeated this exercise, and exited the house 10 minutes later with Osorio. When plainclothes investigators drove by on more than one occasion, Osorio would either turn around or cover his face. Osorio sat behind a tree and then reentered the residence with his companion. Both men reemerged five or 10 minutes later, and Osorio began walking away. When police vehicles converged on the scene, Osorio ran into an alley and jumped over a fence. After a 45-minute to one-hour search assisted by a helicopter and canine unit, police located Osorio crouching between an air conditioning unit and a house. When police arrested Osorio, he exclaimed: \u201cYou guys should have killed me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>On October 11, 2000, Timothy Warren, an inmate at an Anaheim police facility, was cleaning cells when Osorio called him over. Osorio asked Warren if he had seen Osorio\u2019s picture on television and said, \u201cI am here for that thing in Anaheim.\u201d When Warren asked, \u201cWhat thing in Anaheim?\u201d Osorio responded, \u201cYes, I did that pig.\u201d Osorio asked Warren to bring him a copy of the newspaper and Warren agreed. Warren later identified Osorio from a six-pack lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The jury convicted Osorio of two counts of first degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a));<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> one count of first degree robbery (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 212.5, subd. (a)); two counts of first degree burglary (\u00a7 459); one count of arson of a structure causing great bodily injury (\u00a7451, subd. (a)); and one count of arson of an inhabited structure (\u00a7 451, subd. (b)). The jury found to be true the following special circumstances: murder in the commission of a burglary (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(G)); murder in the commission of a robbery (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(A)); murder in the commission of an arson (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(H)); and multiple murder (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(3)). The jury also found Osorio personally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (d)) and twice personally used a deadly weapon (\u00a7 12022, subd. (b)(1)). In a bifurcated trial on gang allegations, the jury found Osorio\u2019s burglary and robbery of King to have been committed for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in association with a street gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">At the penalty phase, the jury agreed defendant should receive a sentence of life without the possibility of parole. The court sentenced Osorio to two consecutive terms of life without the possibility of parole, plus a consecutive term of 44 years to life. Osorio now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">A. <em>Admission of the Victim\u2019s Pretrial Statements Did Not Violate Osorio\u2019s Rights Under the Confrontation Clause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">1. <em>Osorio Has Not Forfeited His </em>Crawford <em>Challenge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">Relying on <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. 36, Osorio contends the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation when it admitted Easley\u2019s descriptions of her attacker. The Attorney General counters that Osorio forfeited his right to challenge admission of the statements because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>Osorio was directly responsible for Easley\u2019s unavailability. The prosecution\u2019s failure to raise the issue at trial precludes invoking it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The Sixth Amendment allows admission of a witness\u2019s out-of-court testimonial statements against a criminal defendant if the witness is present at trial for cross-examination. If the witness is unavailable, the testimonial statements are admissible only if the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine. <em>(Giles v. California </em>(2008) 554 U.S. _ [171 L.Ed.2d 488, 128 S.Ct. 2678, 2682-2683] <em>(Giles).) </em>The United States Supreme Court has read the clause as referring to the right of confrontation at common law, \u201cadmitting only those exceptions established at the time of the founding.\u201d <em>(Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. at p. 54.) The court has recognized two historical exceptions to the common law right of confrontation: dying declarations and forfeiture by wrongdoing. <em>(Giles, </em>at pp. - [128 S.Ct. at pp. 2682-2683].) Forfeiture by wrongdoing is an equitable doctrine based on the principle that \u201cone who obtains the absence of a witness by wrongdoing forfeits the constitutional right to confrontation.\u201d <em>(Davis v. Washington </em>(2006) 547 U.S. 813, 833 [165 L.Ed.2d 224, 126 S.Ct. 2266] <em>(Davis).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">In <em>Giles, </em>the Supreme Court recently clarified that the forfeiture by wrongdoing exception applies only where the defendant acted with the intent or purpose of making the witness unavailable to testify at trial. Although the court did not expressly specify any particular procedure or level of proof required for determining whether the doctrine applies, it recognized that where the defendant is on trial for the witness\u2019s murder, the trial court must conduct an evidentiary hearing before admitting the witness\u2019s statement if the defendant objects to its admission. <em>(Giles, supra, </em>554 U.S. at p._, fn. 6 [128 S.Ct. at p. 2691, fn. 6].) At the hearing, the prosecution cannot rely solely on the unavailable witness\u2019s unconfronted testimony, but must present independent corroborative evidence supporting the forfeiture finding. The prosecution also must show the unavailable witness\u2019s prior statement falls within a recognized hearsay exception and the probative value of the proffered evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">Here, the prosecution failed to raise the forfeiture-by-wrongdoing doctrine below. Because the trial court never held an evidentiary hearing or made the required finding that Osorio killed Easley to prevent her from testifying at trial, we do not consider the matter further.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">2. <em>Easley\u2019s Descriptions of Her Attacker at the Scene Were Not Testimonial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">In <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment bars \u201cadmission of testimonial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>(Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. at pp. 53-54.) <em>Crawford </em>did not provide a comprehensive definition of \u201ctestimonial,\u201d but explained the term \u201capplies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">In <em>Davis, </em>the court established an analytical framework for determining when an unavailable witness\u2019s statements are testimonial. There, a 911 caller abruptly ended the call without speaking. The 911 operator returned the call. Upon answering, the victim explained: \u201c \u2018He\u2019s here jumpin\u2019 on me again.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at p. 817.) After naming the defendant and briefly describing the assault, the victim informed the operator the defendant had \u201c \u2018just r[un] out the door\u2019 \u201d and was leaving in a car with another person. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 818.) The victim started to speak again, but the operator told her to \u201c \u2018[s]top talking and answer my questions.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The victim complied and provided information about the defendant, including his birthday, and further described the circumstances of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The court in <em>Davis </em>contrasted its case with <em>Hammon v. State </em>(Ind. 2005) 829 N.E.2d 444, a companion case which had been consolidated with <em>Davis. </em>In <em>Hammon, </em>police responded to a domestic disturbance at the home of Hershel and Amy Hammon. <em>(Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at p. 819.) The officers found Amy alone on the front porch, appearing \u201c \u2018 \u201csomewhat frightened.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Nonetheless, Amy told them \u201c \u2018 \u201cnothing was the matter.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The officers encountered Herschel in the kitchen, who admitted an argument with Amy, but claimed it \u201c \u2018 \u201cnever became physical.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In a subsequent interview, Amy acknowledged Herschel had shoved her to the floor and attacked their daughter. <em>(Id </em>at p. 820.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The Supreme Court determined the statements in the 911 call in <em>Davis </em>were nontestimonial, but came to the opposite conclusion regarding the police interview in <em>Hammon. </em>The high court explained that in <em>Davis </em>the statements were nontestimonial because they (1) pertained to ongoing events; (2) involved an emergency situation; (3) were elicited by the investigating officers to resolve an ongoing emergency situation; and (4) were given in an informal setting. <em>(Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at p. 827.) In <em>Hammon, </em>the court explained the statements constituted testimonial evidence because they \u201cdeliberately recounted, in response to police questioning, how potentially criminal past events began and progressed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 830.) The court reasoned, \u201cSuch statements under official interrogation are an obvious substitute for live testimony, because they do precisely <em>what a witness does </em>on direct examination; they are inherently testimonial.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The court summarized the holding for both cases: \u201cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>(Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at p. 822.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In <em>People v. Cage </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 965, 984 [56 Cal.Rptr.3d 789, 155 P.3d 205] <em>(Cage), </em>the California Supreme Court analyzed <em>Davis, </em>and derived the following basic principles for determining whether a witness\u2019s out-of-court statement is testimonial: \u201cFirst, ... the confrontation clause is concerned solely with hearsay statements that are testimonial, in that they are out-of-court analogs, in purpose and form, of the testimony given by witnesses at trial. Second, though a statement need not be sworn under oath to be testimonial, it must have occurred under circumstances that imparted, to some degree, the formality and solemnity characteristic of testimony. [Fn. omitted.] Third, the statement must have been given and taken <em>primarily </em>for the <em>purpose </em>ascribed to testimony\u2014to establish or prove some past fact for possible use in a criminal trial. Fourth, the primary purpose for which a statement was given and taken is to be determined \u2018objectively,\u2019 considering all the circumstances that might reasonably bear on the intent of the participants in the conversation. [Fn. omitted.] Fifth, sufficient formality and solemnity are present when, in a nonemergency situation, one responds to questioning by law enforcement officials, where deliberate falsehoods might be criminal offenses. Sixth, statements elicited by law enforcement officials are not testimonial if the primary purpose in giving and receiving them is to deal with a contemporaneous emergency, rather than to produce evidence about past events for possible use at a criminal trial.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">At the hearing on Osorio\u2019s <em>Crawford </em>in limine motion, the paramedic, Christopher Stevens, testified that his fire engine unit responded to a simple burning structure call, and he assisted firefighting efforts when he first arrived on the scene. Receiving a report of an injured person in an apartment at the rear of the burning building, Stevens entered the apartment and saw an injured Easley sitting on a couch. Stevens did not know how Easley had been injured. Attempting to determine the nature of the emergency, Stevens asked Easley what had happened to her. She responded an intruder struck her in the face with an unknown object, and attempted to choke her. Easley described her attacker as a \u201cwhite,\u201d bald male, approximately 40 years old. Stevens did not recall if he asked Easley to provide the description of her attacker. During his physical examination of Easley, Stevens asked her basic information, such as her name, age, and where she felt pain. Stevens described Easley\u2019s emotional condition as upset, scared, weak, and distraught.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>Applying the principles articulated in <em>Cage, </em>Easley\u2019s statements to Stevens were nontestimonial. When Stevens contacted Easley, he was unaware a crime had been committed, and he asked her questions to help him medically treat her injuries. Nothing demonstrated Stevens elicited responses to obtain information for later use in a criminal trial, and her statements to him had none of the \u201cformality and solemnity characteristic of testimony.\u201d <em>(Cage, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 984.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Sergeant McElhaney testified he and other officers arrived at the scene to establish traffic control for the fire department. Shortly after McElhaney arrived, a firefighter informed him there was an \u201cinjured party\u201d in the rear apartment. The rear apartment was only 40 or 50 feet from the burning building, and McElhaney described the whole scene as \u201cchaotic.\u201d McElhaney encountered Easley sitting on a sofa in the living room. She appeared to be in shock, and had a cut or slashing injury to her neck. At the time, he knew only that Easley had been injured, but did not know an assault had occurred. After asking her what had happened, McElhaney asked Easley to describe her attacker and the direction in which he fled. Easley described her assailant as in his 40\u2019s, balding, and possibly wearing a brown shirt, and stated he had fled out the back door. McElhaney immediately broadcasted Easley\u2019s description over his radio. He asked no further questions and left the apartment. The entire exchange lasted less than two minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">As we have recognized in a similar situation: \u201c \u2018Preliminary questions asked at the scene of a crime shortly after it has occurred do not rise to the level of an \u201cinterrogation.\u201d Such an unstructured interaction between officer and witness bears no resemblance to a formal or informal police inquiry that is required for a police \u201cinterrogation\u201d as that term is used in <em>Crawford. </em>[Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brenn </em>(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 166, 178 [60 Cal.Rptr.3d 830].)  McElhaney\u2019s questioning of Easley, conducted while she was in a state of shock and bleeding from her wounds, bore none of the earmarks of a police interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The evidence also demonstrates that McElhaney posed his questions in the midst of an ongoing emergency. Consequently, McElhaney did not perform the type of in-depth interview designed to obtain evidence to secure a conviction at trial; he obtained just enough information from Easley to warn the other officers to be on the lookout for the attacker. McElhaney did not know the attacker\u2019s motives, whether he remained in the general area, or carried weapons. Thus, McElhaney did not know whether the attacker posed a threat to the firefighters or officers in the area, or whether he would return to kill Easley.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The Supreme Court in <em>Davis </em>recognized this very point, observing that an officer\u2019s questions directed toward the identity of the assailant in that case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>were necessary, \u201cso that the dispatched officers might know whether they would be encountering a violent felon.\u201d <em>(Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at p. 827.) We have little difficulty concluding Easley\u2019s statements to McElhaney at the scene were nontestimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">3. <em>Easley\u2019s Third Description of Her Attacker Was Properly Admitted Under Evidence Code Section 1202</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Easley described her assailant to paramedic Stevens as being a \u201cwhite,\u201d bald made, approximately 40 years old. The trial court admitted this description under the hearsay exception for spontaneous statements. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1240.) Later in the trial, the court permitted the prosecutor to introduce Easley\u2019s statement at the hospital that her attacker had tan skin. The trial court admitted Easley\u2019s hospital statement under Evidence Code section 1202 for the limited purpose of impeaching that portion of Easley\u2019s statement to Stevens describing her assailant as \u201cwhite.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Osorio presents four arguments to support his claim the trial court erred: (1) Because admission of Easley\u2019s previous statements violated his confrontation rights, admission of evidence impeaching those statements also violated the confrontation clause; (2) Evidence Code section 1202 prohibits a party from impeaching its own witness; (3) due process prohibits the prosecution from arguing that a hearsay statement is trustworthy and later impeaching that same statement; and (4) the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction to consider Easley\u2019s hospital statement only on the issue of her credibility was ineffective because when the prosecution impeached her prior statement that the attacker\u2019s skin was white, the jury could only consider this evidence for its truth by concluding the assailant had darker skin. We disagree with each of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Osorio\u2019s first argument fails because we have concluded the trial court\u2019s admission of Easley\u2019s descriptions at the scene did not violate the confrontation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Osorio\u2019s second argument fails because nothing in the language of Evidence Code section 1202 purports to prevent the proponent of a witness\u2019s statement from using a prior inconsistent statement to impeach a portion of that witness\u2019s statement. Specifically, Evidence Code section 1202 provides, in relevant part: \u201cEvidence of a statement or other conduct by a declarant that is inconsistent with a statement by such declarant received in evidence as hearsay evidence is not inadmissible for the purpose of attacking the credibility of the declarant though he is not given and has not had an opportunity to explain or to deny such inconsistent statement or other conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">We recognize <em>People v. Beyea </em>(1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 176 [113 Cal.Rptr. 254] <em>(Beyea) </em>held that Evidence Code section 1202 does not allow a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>prosecutor to introduce a hearsay statement and then use a prior inconsistent statement to impeach part of the hearsay statement. <em>Beyea </em>based its decision on a portion of the California Law Revision Commission comments (Comments), which read: \u201c \u2018If the hearsay declarant is unavailable as a witness, the party <em>against whom </em>the evidence is admitted should not be deprived of both his right to cross-examine and his right to impeach\u2019 . . . .\u201d <em>(Beyea, </em>at p. 193, original italics.) The court also relied on <em>Am-Cal Inv. Co. </em>v. <em>Sharlyn Estates, Inc. </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 526, 542 [63 Cal.Rptr. 518]), which determined from the Comments that: \u201c \u2018The purpose of allowing extrajudicial inconsistent statements is to be fair to the party <em>against whom the hearsay was received inasmuch as he was denied the opportunity of cross-examination; </em>thus, <em>such party should at least be allowed to impeach the declarant by admitting the declarant\u2019s own statements which are inconsistent with the declaration received in evidence. </em>[Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Beyea, </em>at p. 193.) Beyea\u2019s reliance on the Comments to limit the scope of Evidence Code section 1202 is misplaced, for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">First, <em>Beyea </em>exalted the Comments over the statutory language. \u201cOur first and most important responsibility in interpreting statutes is to consider the words employed; in the absence of ambiguity or conflict, the words employed by the Legislature control, and there is no need to search for indicia of legislative intent.\u201d <em>(People v. Jacobs </em>(2000) 78 Cal.App.4th 1444, 1450 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 783].) There is nothing in the text of Evidence Code section 1202 that gives rise to any ambiguity or lends support to Beyea\u2019s interpretation.  Indeed, as <em>Beyea </em>expressly recognized: \u201cRead literally, the language of Evidence Code section 1202 appears to permit the impeachment of a witness with a prior inconsistent statement by the party who called the witness.\u201d <em>(Beyea, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.3d at p. 193.) Because the statute is clear and unambiguous, <em>Beyea </em>had no need to resort to the Comments for further clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Moreover, nothing in the Comments suggests the Legislature intended to prevent the use of impeachment evidence by the proponent of the hearsay evidence. The Comments\u2019s concern about the party against whom a hearsay statement is offered is understandable given that at the time the Comments were drafted in 1965, a party could not impeach his or her own witness unless the party was surprised and damaged by the witness\u2019s testimony. <em>(People v. Le Beau </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 146, 148 [245 P.2d 302].) Of course, one could never claim surprise or damage arising from his or her own introduction of an out-of-court statement. Accordingly, the question whether a prior inconsistent statement was an appropriate method of impeaching an out-of-court declarant at that point in time was moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The general rule against impeaching one\u2019s own witness, however, was abrogated by the Legislature\u2019s passage of Evidence Code section 785 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>the same year it passed Evidence Code section 1202. Evidence Code section 785 provides: \u201cThe credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by any party, including the party calling him.\u201d Significantly, Evidence Code sections 785 and 1202 were not only passed in the same year; <em>they were passed as part of the same bill. </em>(See Stats. 1965, ch. 299, \u00a7 2, p. 1297, operative January 1, 1967.) \u201c \u2018Both Acts were passed upon the same day and relate to the same subject matter. They are, therefore, according to a well settled rule of interpretation, to be read together, as if parts of the same Act . . . .\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>McGuire </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 4 [145 Cal.Rptr. 514], citing <em>People v. Jackson </em>(1866) 30 Cal. 427, 430; see <em>Commission on Peace Officer Standards &amp; Training </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 278, 294 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 661, 165 P.3d 462] [words of statute to be construed in context].) Under these circumstances, we may safely infer that if the Legislature had intended to make Evidence Code sections 785 and 1202 mutually exclusive, it would have expressly done so.  Read together as a single statute, these two sections allow a prosecutor to use a prior inconsistent statement to partially impeach a hearsay statement the prosecutor had previously introduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">As to Osorio\u2019s third argument based on due process grounds, we see nothing unfair or inconsistent in the prosecutor\u2019s introduction of Easley\u2019s first and second descriptions, and use of her third description as partial impeachment. The prosecutor properly introduced Easley\u2019s descriptions of her attacker at the scene as excited utterances under Evidence Code section 1240.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018The foundation for this exception is that if the declarations are made under the immediate influence of the occurrence to which they relate, they are deemed sufficiently trustworthy to be presented to the jury. [Citation.] [f] The basis for this circumstantial probability of trustworthiness is \u201cthat in the stress of nervous excitement the reflective faculties may be stilled and the utterance may become the unreflecting and sincere expression of one\u2019s actual impressions and belief.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Poggi </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 306, 318 [246 Cal.Rptr. 886, 753 P.2d 1082] <em>(Poggi).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Thus, in seeking to introduce Easley\u2019s first two descriptions under the spontaneous statement exception, the prosecution sought to demonstrate that Easley spoke under the immediate influence of the attack and therefore provided an \u201c \u2018 \u201cunreflecting and sincere\u201d \u2019 \u201d account of what she perceived. <em>(Poggi, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 318.) In doing so, the prosecution did not vouch for the complete accuracy of her perceptions, but asserted her statements represented her sincere perceptions and belief. The prosecution did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>use Easley\u2019s third description to undercut Easley\u2019s honesty or sincerity. Rather, the prosecution used Easley\u2019s third description to suggest that Easley had difficulty seeing defendant\u2019s skin color because the room was dark. The prosecution accordingly invited the jury to disregard entirely Easley\u2019s conflicting statements regarding the attacker\u2019s skin color, and instead focus on her perceptions regarding his height and weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Finally, we reject Osorio\u2019s argument that impeachment of Easley\u2019s prior identification of her attacker as White necessarily would have caused the jury to consider for its truth that portion of Easley\u2019s hospital description that the attacker had tan skin. The trial court specifically admonished the jury to consider Easley\u2019s third description only to evaluate the credibility of her previous statements, and not for its truth. In his closing arguments, the prosecutor echoed that admonition, instructing: \u201cThe evidence of a tanned complexion cannot be used for the purpose that the person who attacked her actually had a tanned complexion. It can only be used so that it impeaches the prior description. All right? [f] I know it is a fine line, but you have to walk that fine line, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we presume the jury followed the court\u2019s instructions. <em>(People v. Waidla </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 690, 725 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 396, 996 P.2d 46].) Because nothing in the record suggests the jury did not follow the court\u2019s limiting instruction regarding Easley\u2019s third description of her attacker, we reject Osorio\u2019s suggestion the jury was unable to consider the evidence as impeachment only.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">B.-E.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>in</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The judgment is modified by staying the 10-year enhancement for robbery as to count 2. The superior court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment and forward it to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. In all other respects the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Rylaarsdam, Acting P. J., and O\u2019Leary, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 28, 2008, S166478.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\"> Guzzetta testified that Parsons, not Osorio, burned the wallet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-11\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise noted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\"> Evidence Code section 1240 provides, in relevant part: \u201cEvidence of a statement is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if the statement: []\u25a1 (a) Purports to narrate, describe, or explain an act, condition, or event perceived by the declarant; and ['ll] (b) Was made spontaneously while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by such perception.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\"> We note in passing that any error in admitting Easley\u2019s hospital statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Cage, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at pp. 991-992; <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824].) Five witnesses testified Osorio bragged about the murders and arson. Although Osorio claimed some of the witnesses lied to hide their own involvement in the crimes, this defense does not explain the testimony given by Warren, an inmate Osorio met while incarcerated at an Anaheim Police Facility. No evidence suggested Warren knew any of Osorio\u2019s associates or had spoken with them. Significantly, Warren specifically recalled Osorio referred to King as a \u201cpig,\u201d a reference some of the other witnesses testified Osorio used to describe his victim. Moreover, Osorio\u2019s actions in hiding his face and fleeing from police demonstrated a consciousness of guilt. In particular, his statement to the police that \u201cYou guys should have killed me,\u201d belies the defense assertion that Osorio fled because of a previous wrongful arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 603.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
