J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVW\">Defendant Thomas Avery Dallas phoned his girlfriend while she was out and told her that her nine-month-old son had been hurt. The next day, the baby was found to have two skull fractures. (Fortunately, he recovered fully, with no permanent injuries.) Defendant claimed that the girlfriend\u2019s older son had hit the baby in the head with a plastic toy airplane; there was considerable evidence, however, that this was not true.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">The trial court, citing Evidence Code section 1109, also admitted evidence that defendant had committed previous acts of domestic violence against a former girlfriend and previous acts of child abuse against that former girlfriend\u2019s child.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">A jury found defendant guilty on two counts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-11\">Count 1: Felony infliction of an injury on a child. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 273d, subd. (a).)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-12\">Count 2: Felony child abuse. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 273a, subd. (a).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-13\">In connection with each count, it found true an enhancement for personally inflicting great bodily injury on a child under the age of five. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.7, subd. (d).) Defendant was sentenced to a total of 12 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-14\">In the published portion of this opinion, we will hold that, because defendant lived with the baby, this was not only a prosecution for \u201cchild <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>abuse\u201d so that prior acts of child abuse were admissible under Evidence Code section 1109, subdivision (a)(3), but also a prosecution for \u201cdomestic violence\u201d so that prior acts of domestic violence were likewise admissible under Evidence Code section 1109, subdivision (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">We will further hold that, because prior acts of child abuse were admissible in connection with count 1, the jury was also entitled to consider them in connection with count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">In the nonpublished portion of this opinion, we find no other prejudicial error. Hence, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Axm\">A. <em>Evidence of the Charged Crimes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Defendant was living with his girlfriend Jessica (Jessie) P. and her three sons\u2014seven-year-old S.P., four-year-old K.P., and the nine-month-old baby\u2014at Jessie\u2019s home in Temecula.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">Around July 2005, the baby started to seem \u201cnervous\u201d around defendant. For example, if Jessie walked into the room when defendant was holding him, he would turn and grab for her. In the morning, when he woke up, if defendant picked him up, \u201c[h]e would scream as if he were being hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">On the night of August 5-6, 2005, Aimee Cunningham and her boyfriend Raymond Padilla visited defendant and Jessie. Defendant suggested going to the nearby Pechanga Casino. Around 11:30 p.m., however, because Cunningham and Padilla had been drinking, the couple went to sleep. Defendant then said that he could not go to the casino because he wanted to finish a video game and take a shower. Thus, around 1:00 a.m., Jessie went to the casino by herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">Sometime during the night, when Padilla was half-awake, he heard somebody crying; he then went back to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">Around 2:30 or 3:00 a.m., Jessie received \u201can emergency page.\u201d When she called home, defendant told her that the baby was hurt and that K.P. was also involved. He did not sound concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-14\">When Jessie got home, K.P. was asleep. Defendant was holding the baby. The baby was not crying. When defendant handed the baby to Jessie, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>immediately noticed swelling on one side of his head. Defendant explained that he heard the baby crying; he went to the baby\u2019s room, where he found K.P. hitting the baby in the head with a plastic toy airplane. Defendant specifically said the baby was in his crib. He also said that he felt K.P. was sleepwalking.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Jessie said they should take the baby to a hospital. Defendant said that was not necessary and would only \u201cget CPS on our ass.\u201d Jessie looked up head injuries in a baby-care book; it said to call a doctor if the baby showed \u201csleepiness, . . . bruising in and around the eyes and ears, [or] a soft spot on the head.\u201d The baby did not display any of these symptoms, so she did not insist on getting medical care for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The baby would not go back to sleep, so Jessie sat up with him. When she took him to his room, defendant followed her in. He seemed to scan the room; he then pointed to a child\u2019s \u201cactivity center table\u201d and said that K.P. had been standing on it. Jessie thought it was odd that he had not mentioned the table before. It was standing upright where it normally stood, about 10 feet away from the crib. The legs of the table always left C-shaped impressions in the carpet. Jessie looked for these impressions near the crib but could not see any. Also, the airplane was normally kept in S.P.\u2019s room, under his bed. In Jessie\u2019s opinion, it would have been impossible for K.P., while sleepwalking, to get the airplane out from under the bed, climb on the table, and hit the baby with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Jessie testified that, as far as she knew, K.P. did not sleepwalk. Also, she had never known him to be violent with his brothers or any other children. She admitted that, shortly after she separated from her husband, she found K.P. and another child tossing a kitten back and forth; the kitten had a bloody nose, but it survived. As a result, she placed K.P. in therapy. He seemed to respond well and had not shown any \u201cinappropriately aggressive behavior\u201d since then.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">The next morning, defendant told Padilla that one of the children had hit the baby with a toy. He pointed to the living room floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Around noon, Jessie noticed that the baby\u2019s head felt \u201csquishy\u201d and that there were bruises in his ears. She took him to a medical center. X-rays taken there revealed that he had a skull fracture. As a result, he was taken to a hospital, where he was examined by Dr. Marilyn Kaufhold. Dr. Kaufhold is a forensic pediatrician and an expert on child abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">A CT scan showed that the baby had bilateral skull fractures\u2014both parietal bones, on opposite sides of the head, were fractured. The fractures were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>\u201clong\u201d and \u201cwent down the side of the head.\u201d The one on the right was \u201ca little bit longer\u201d than the one on the left. The scalp over both fractures was swollen, particularly on the right side, which was why the baby\u2019s head felt \u201csquishy.\u201d The swelling meant that the fractures were \u201crelatively fresh,\u201d as such swelling would go down \u201cwithin several days to a couple [of] weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The baby also had a number of bruises. First, he had a bluish bruise in the left ear, just outside the ear canal. He had another bluish bruise behind the right ear.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He had a yellowish-brown bruise above the right eye and a similar bruise right between the eyes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He had several bruises on his back and side. He had a brownish bruise on his left arm. Finally, he had a brownish bruise on his right thigh. Dr. Kaufhold testified that, while \u201c[i]t\u2019s not possible to date bruises very accurately,\u201d the bluish bruises to the ears were probably more recent than the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">According to Dr. Kaufhold, a child of the baby\u2019s age can get a skull fracture several ways. The most common is in a fall; a fall of as little as a couple of feet, onto a hard surface, can produce a skull fracture. \u201c[A]bout one percent of children who fall striking their head will get a skull fracture.\u201d The next most common way is in an automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Bilateral skull fractures, however, \u201care much less common.\u201d They do not normally result from \u201ca simple fall.\u201d Rather, they are associated with either a \u201chigh velocity impact[], such as in an auto accident or a fall from a greater height,\u201d or \u201ca crush force, such as an automobile rollover [or] a head being caught in a vi[s]e of some kind . . . .\u201d They could also result from two separate impacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">Dr. Kaufhold had never heard of a four-year-old inflicting similar injuries on a baby. She found it \u201cvery improbable\u201d that K.P. hit the baby with the airplane while sleepwalking, partly because it is \u201cunusual\u201d for a person to sleepwalk once and only once and partly because, even if K.P was standing on the activity table, he was not tall enough to reach into the crib and strike the baby with any force.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">She admitted that the toy airplane was heavy enough to cause a skull fracture, if swung hard enough; in that event, however, she would have expected to see localized, depressed fractures, unlike the long, flat fractures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>the baby had. Also, it would be unlikely that this would cause bilateral fractures\u2014\u201cthat you could do it twice and the other time be on the . . . other side of the head . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">By the time of trial, the baby had recovered fully from his injuries, with no lasting impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">B. <em>Evidence of Prior Acts of Child Abuse and Domestic Violence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">1. <em>Scalding J.S.\u2019s Genitals.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Crystal S. was defendant\u2019s former girlfriend; she had lived with him and was the mother of one of his children. J.S. was Crystal\u2019s son by a different father. When Crystal was living with defendant, J.S. was four years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">J.S. testified that, on one occasion, when he was drawing a bath, defendant came into the bathroom, grabbed J.S.\u2019s penis, pulled it under the hot running water and held it there. It felt \u201clike it was bleeding.\u201d As a result, J.S.\u2019s genitals were bruised for about a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">Crystal testified that one day, when she was giving J.S. a bath, she discovered that \u201chis balls were completely purple.\u201d She asked him what happened, but he would not talk to her about it at all. She then asked defendant what happened; he said his son had been wrestling with J.S. and had accidentally kneed him in the groin. The bruising started getting better after a week or so.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">2. <em>Suffocating J.S. with a Trash Bag.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">J.S. testified that, on another occasion, when his mother was out, defendant put a large plastic trash bag over his head and shoulders. Defendant then pushed his head against the seat of the couch. He could not breathe. He felt \u201c[l]ike [he] was gonna die.\u201d Finally, defendant let him go.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">Crystal testified that one day, she wanted to visit her grandfather in the hospital and to take J.S. with her. Defendant \u201cthrew a big fit,\u201d so she left J.S. with him and went alone. While she was out, she got a \u201creally bad feeling in [her] gut\u201d and phoned home. Defendant was \u201creally upset.\u201d He said, \u201cI found [J.S.] in the back yard, and he was in a trash bag, and his lips were blue.\u201d He added that he had performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and J.S. was okay. Nevertheless, he insisted that she had to come home immediately.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">When Crystal got home, J.S. would not say anything except that he was okay. When she asked him what had happened, defendant talked over him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>Defendant told her that J.S. had been trying to take a toy out of the bag when the bag \u201cgot stuck on him.\u201d He said that, when J.S. revived, J.S. asked, \u201cWhy are you kissing me[?]\u201d Defendant \u201cwas focusing on that part, . . . trying to make it... a funny situation.\u201d When Crystal got angry, defendant said, \u201cHow can you doubt what I am saying to you, I saved your son\u2019s life, he\u2019d be dead if it wasn\u2019t for me . . ..\u201d She wanted to call an ambulance, but defendant said if she did, they would take J.S. away from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">3. <em>Holding J.S. Underwater.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">Another time, J.S. was crawling between defendant\u2019s legs in a one-foot-high \u201ckiddy pool\u201d when defendant pinned his head between his legs and held him underwater. He could not breathe. After about 10 seconds, defendant let him go.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">4. <em>Choking J.S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">Another time, defendant gave J.S. a \u201ctimeout.\u201d When defendant said the timeout was over, he picked J.S. up by the neck and choked him. J.S. could not breathe. After finally letting him go, defendant \u201csaid it was a hug.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">5. <em>Breaking J.S. \u2019s Arm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">Yet another time, J.S. testified, defendant was going to throw him onto a bed but threw him into the wall instead, breaking his arm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He had to wear a cast.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant said it was an accident, but J.S. did not believe him, because he never said he was sorry. Defendant told Crystal that a friend of his \u201cwas wrestling too rough with [J.S.] and accidentally hurt him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">6. <em>Squeezing J.S.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">Finally, J.S. testified, one time defendant was playing with him by throwing him onto a bed. On the second throw, however, defendant \u201csqueezed [his legs and his body] together really hard,\u201d causing J.S. to throw up.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">7. <em>Domestic Violence Against Crystal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-14\">At one point in their relationship, Crystal left defendant because \u201che was becoming more angry and more physical.\u201d After about a month, however, she went back to him. Things were better for about a month, but then defendant got \u201cviolent with [her] again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>There was one particular incident in which defendant became angry with Crystal; he was \u201cscreaming at [her] and throwing stuff.\u201d When she turned and walked away from him, he kicked her from behind, and she fell down. He held her down and yelled at her. When he left the room, she grabbed the phone and said she was calling the police. He came back in and \u201cthrew the phone out of [her] hand.\u201d He then got on top of her and pressed his forearm against her neck and her jaw with \u201call of his weight.\u201d She thought he was going to break her jaw. She was in \u201cthe worst pain [she had] ever felt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Meanwhile, a neighbor had called the police. When they arrived, defendant ran out the back door. Crystal told the police what had happened. However, when the district attorney sought to prosecute defendant, Crystal admittedly did not cooperate. About a month after that, she left defendant and went to a domestic violence shelter.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">When the incidents of child abuse happened, J.S. generally did not tell his mother about them, because he was afraid of defendant. After she left defendant, however, he did tell her about them.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">C. <em>Defense Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">Cunningham had told the police that K.R was a \u201ctroubled child,\u201d and she was afraid he would hurt her son. She had also told police that K.P. \u201cwas always poking at the baby,\u201d and she was afraid he might hurt him. At trial, she denied holding any of these opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Jessie was originally introduced to defendant by their mutual friend, Nicole McGregor. Nicole testified that, when K.P. was three or four, he was \u201crough with other children,\u201d hitting, pushing, and throwing mud at them. He hit Nicole\u2019s son in the stomach, knocking him down, even though the other boy was two years older than he was. He also hit Nicole\u2019s daughter \u201ca lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">According to Nicole, K.P. would \u201cgo into [the baby\u2019s] room a lot and rip things out of his hands and push him back.\u201d Nicole once told Jessie that K.P. had an anger problem and probably needed help.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Jessie became angry and defensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Nicole\u2019s daughter, McKenze McGregor, who was 13 at the time of trial, testified that once, she was playing with the baby in his room when K.P. ran in, knocked the baby down, and said, \u201cThose are my toys, leave them alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Another time, when the baby was sitting \u201cpropped up\u201d on a chair in the kitchen, K.P. ran in, said, \u201cThat\u2019s my chair,\u201d pushed the baby off the chair, and sat in it himself.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The baby\u2019s head hit the floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">McKenze confirmed that K.P. had once punched her brother, who was older than K.P. was, in the stomach. Another time, K.P. hit her sister, who was also older than he was. McKenze admitted, however, that she disliked Jessie \u201cfor what she\u2019s doing to [defendant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Jessie testified that she was no longer speaking to Nicole, because Nicole did not believe that defendant could have hurt the baby, and Nicole showed \u201cno concern for the [baby\u2019s] well-being . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">ISSUES RELATING TO EVIDENCE CODE SECTION 1109</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">Defendant raises several issues with respect to the trial court\u2019s admission of evidence under Evidence Code section 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">A. <em>Additional Factual and Procedural Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">In the prosecution\u2019s trial brief, it noted that it intended to offer evidence of defendant\u2019s past acts of child abuse committed against J.S. It argued that this evidence was admissible on several alternative theories, including under Evidence Code section 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-12\">The prosecution also noted that it intended to offer evidence of defendant\u2019s past acts of domestic violence committed against Crystal S. Its trial brief, however, did not specifically explain why this evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">Defense counsel objected to the evidence of child abuse as more prejudicial than probative under Evidence Code section 352. The trial court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">Defense counsel also objected to the evidence of domestic violence, arguing that it was improper character evidence, that it was not similar to the current offenses because it was evidence of domestic violence rather than child abuse, and that it was unduly prejudicial. The prosecution argued that this evidence, too, was admissible under Evidence Code section 1109. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>trial court ruled that evidence of multiple incidents involving domestic violence against Crystal would be cumulative; otherwise, however, it overruled the defense objections. Thus, it allowed the prosecution to introduce evidence of a single such incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the trial court instructed the jury with CALJIC No. 2.50.02 (Evidence of Other Domestic Violence)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and CALJIC No. 2.50.04 (Evidence of Other Child Abuse Offenses).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>B. <em>Statutory Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Evidence Code section 1109, subdivision (a)(1), as it stood on August 6, 2005, the date of the offenses, and as it stands now, provides: \u201c[I]n a criminal action in which the defendant is accused of an offense involving domestic violence, evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of other domestic violence is not made inadmissible by Section 1101 if the evidence is not inadmissible pursuant to Section 352.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Effective January 1, 2006, the Legislature added subdivision (a)(3) to Evidence Code section 1109, which provides: \u201c[I]n a criminal action in which the defendant is accused of an offense involving child abuse, evidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of child abuse is not made inadmissible by Section 1101 if the evidence is not inadmissible pursuant to Section 352.\u201d (Stats. 2005, ch. 464, \u00a7 1.) It also added subdivision (d)(2), which provides: \u201cAs used in this section: fid .. . HQ .. . \u2018[c]hild abuse\u2019 means an act proscribed by Section 273d of the Penal Code.\u201d (Stats. 2005, ch. 464, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">C. <em>Ex Post Facto Application</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">D. <em>Prior Acts of Domestic Violence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred by admitting evidence of prior acts of domestic violence under Evidence Code section 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>As already noted, Evidence Code section 1109, subdivision (a)(1) provides for the admission of acts of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d in a prosecution for \u201can offense involving domestic violence.\u201d Evidence Code section 1109, subdivision (a)(3) then provides for the admission of acts of \u201cchild abuse\u201d in a prosecution for \u201can offense involving child abuse.\u201d However, Evidence Code section 1109 does not explicitly provide for the admission of acts of domestic violence in a prosecution for an offense involving child abuse, nor vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Defendant argues that he was charged only with child abuse, not domestic violence, and therefore evidence of acts of domestic violence was not admissible under Evidence Code section 1109. The People respond that, because the purpose of Evidence Code section 1109 is to admit propensity evidence, and because \u201c[t]he propensity to commit violence, whether on a partner, or upon a child, is the same,\u201d evidence of acts of either type of abuse should be admissible in a prosecution for the other. They do not explain, however, how Evidence Code section 1109 can be read to bring about this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Evidence Code section 1109 provides: \u201c \u2018Domestic violence\u2019 has the meaning set forth in Section 13700 of the Penal Code. Subject to a hearing conducted pursuant to Section 352, which shall include consideration of any corroboration and remoteness in time, \u2018domestic violence\u2019 has the further meaning as set forth in Section 6211 of the Family Code, if the act occurred no more than five years before the charged offense.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1109, subd. (d)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Taking Penal Code section 13700 first, it defines domestic violence as \u201cabuse committed against an adult or a minor who is a spouse, former spouse, cohabitant, former cohabitant, or person with whom the suspect has had a child or is having or has had a dating or engagement relationship.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 13700, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">For purposes of Penal Code section 273.5, which defines the crime of inflicting corporal injury on a cohabitant, \u201ccohabitants\u201d have been defined as \u201cthose \u2018 \u201cliving together in a substantial relationship\u2014one manifested, minimally, by permanence and sexual or amorous intimacy.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number><em>(People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 11, 18 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 693], quoting <em>People v. Moore </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1333 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 256], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Holifield </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 993, 1000 [252 Cal.Rptr. 729].) We may assume, without deciding, that \u201ccohabitant\u201d has the same meaning in Penal Code section 13700. If so, then the baby was not defendant\u2019s \u201ccohabitant,\u201d and therefore defendant was not charged with an offense involving \u201cdomestic violence\u201d under this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Family Code section 6211, however, defines domestic violence more broadly as including abuse committed against either \u201c[a] cohabitant or former cohabitant, as defined in Section 6209\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6211, subd. (e)), or \u201c[a] child of a party\u201d (Fam. Code, \u00a7 6211, subd. (e)). Once again, we may assume, without deciding, that because the baby was not defendant\u2019s own child, he was not the child of a party. This time, however, we cannot just assume that \u201ccohabitant\u201d has the definition established in case law. Rather, Family Code section 6211 expressly incorporates the following definition in Family Code section 6209: \u201c \u2018Cohabitant\u2019 means a person who regularly resides in the household.\u201d (See also <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 721, 727 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 365] [\u201cthe Legislature has used the term differently in various contexts, sometimes to connote living together as husband and wife, and sometimes to connote simply living together\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Siravo </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 555, 561 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 350] [\u201c \u2018 \u201c[c]ohabitation means simply to live or dwell together in the same habitation; evidence of lack of sexual relations is irrelevant\u201d \u2019 \u201d].) The baby regularly resided in defendant\u2019s household. Accordingly, in this action, defendant was charged with an offense involving \u201cdomestic violence\u201d within the meaning of Family Code section 6211.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Defendant points out, however, that Evidence Code section 1109 incorporates the definition in Family Code section 6211 subject to two qualifications\u2014(1) \u201cif the act occurred no more than five years before the charged offense,\u201d (2) and \u201c[sjubject to a hearing conducted pursuant to Section 352 . . . .\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1109, subd. (d)(3).) These qualifications seem designed to apply to the type of <em>evidence </em>that is made admissible (\u201cevidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of other domestic violence\u201d), but not to the type of <em>prosecution </em>in which it is made admissible (\u201ca criminal action in which the defendant is accused of an offense involving domestic violence\u201d). <em>(Id., </em>subd. (a)(1).) Defendant concludes that the Legislature must have intended the definition to apply to the former, but not to the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>We disagree. First of all, it would be somewhat bizarre for \u201cdomestic violence\u201d to mean something different from <em>\u201cother </em>domestic violence,\u201d particularly when used in the same sentence. Moreover, precisely <em>because </em>the two qualifications are designed to apply to the type of evidence, they do not meaningfully limit the type of prosecution. By definition, the charged offense cannot have occurred \u201cmore than five years before the charged offense\u201d; accordingly, this criterion will always be satisfied. Similarly, the prosecution\u2019s discretion to charge a defendant with an offense involving domestic violence is not \u201c[s]ubject to . . . [Evidence Code] Section 352\u201d; accordingly, making the definition subject to Evidence Code section 352 has no effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">This conclusion finds support in the legislative history. Evidence Code section 1109, as originally enacted in 1996, merely provided: \u201cAs used in this section, \u2018domestic violence\u2019 has the meaning set forth in Section 13700 of the Penal Code.\u201d (Evid. Code, former \u00a7 1109, subd. (d); Stats. 1996, ch. 261, \u00a7 2, pp. 1795, 1796.) In 2004, Assemblymember Cohn introduced Assembly Bill No. 141. The Assembly initially passed a version of this bill that simply provided: \u201cAs used in this section, \u2018domestic violence\u2019 has the meaning set forth in <em>Section 6211 of the Family Code or </em>Section 13700 of the Penal Code.\u201d (Assem. Amend, to Assem. Bill No. 141 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 23, 2003.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">A committee analysis explained that the preexisting version of Evidence Code section 1109 used \u201cthe definition of domestic violence in Penal Code section 13700 ... . This definition includes only violence against a spouse, former spouse, cohabitant, former cohabitant, or person with whom the suspect has had a child or is having or has had a dating or engagement relationship. AB 141 would instead amend the exception to include domestic violence as defined in Family Code section 6211, which includes violence against any child of a party. The bill will facilitate the prosecution of domestic violence by allowing in propensity evidence <em>in the prosecution of cases of domestic violence against children, </em>and by allowing evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior commission of domestic violence against a child to be used in appropriate domestic violence prosecutions.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 141 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 23, 2003, pp. 1-2, italics added.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>In a Senate committee vote, however, the bill failed to pass. (Assem. Bill No. 141 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.)

Section 13700 of the Penal Code. <em>Subject to a hearing conducted pursuant to Section 352, which shall include consideration of any corroboration and remoteness in time, \u2018domestic violence\u2019 has the further meaning as set forth in Section 6211 of the Family Code.\u201d </em>(Sen. Amend, to Assem. Bill No. 141 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) May 13, 2004.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The Senate committee amended it further so as to provide; \u201cAs used in this section, \u2018domestic violence\u2019 has the meaning set forth in Section 13700 of the Penal Code. Subject to a hearing conducted pursuant to Section 352, which shall include consideration of any corroboration and remoteness in time, \u2018domestic violence\u2019 has the further meaning as set forth in Section 6211 of the Family Code <em>if the act occurred no more than five years before the charged offense.\u201d </em>(Sen. Amend, to Assem. Bill No. 141 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) June 9, 2004.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">A subsequent third reading analysis demonstrates that the only intent behind the amendments was \u201cto make the bill\u2019s proposed expansion of the definition of \u2018domestic violence\u2019 <em>for purposes of propensity evidence . . . </em>expressly subject to a section 352 hearing, which would be required to include corroboration and remoteness in time . . . .\u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 141 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 9, 2004, p. 2, italics added.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, there is no indication that the amendments were intended to narrow the proposed expansion of the class of cases in which such evidence would be admissible. To the contrary, the analysis stated that intent behind the bill as a whole was still to <em>change </em>\u201ccurrent law, [under which] propensity evidence is admissible during sexual assault, elder or dependant adult and domestic violence prosecutions, <em>but not as to child abuse.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 3, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>Similarly, a subsequent Assembly analysis stated that using the \u201cbroader definition\u201d of domestic violence in Family Code section 6211 \u201cwill have two effects. First, and most important, <em>prosecutors will be able to use propensity evidence in the prosecution of child abuse cases. . . . </em>Second, in any domestic violence case, the prosecutor will be able to bring in relevant evidence of prior violence against children.\u201d (Concurrence in Sen. Amends., Assem. Bill No. 141 (2003-2004 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 9, 2004, p. 4, italics added.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We therefore conclude that, under Evidence Code section 1109, subdivision (d)(3), the definition of domestic violence in Family Code section 6211 can apply not only to the type of evidence admissible under Evidence Code section 1109, subdivision (a)(1), but also to the type of prosecution in which such evidence is admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Defendant relies on subsequent legislative history regarding Assembly Bill No. 114 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.), which added subdivision (a)(3) to Evidence Code section 1109. As he points out, the author of this bill originally proposed to make acts of domestic violence cross-admissible in a prosecution for child abuse. (Assem. Bill No. 114 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.) as introduced Jan. 12, 2005.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Before the bill was passed, however, this provision was eliminated. (See Sen. Amend, to Assem. Bill No. 114 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.) June 27, 2005.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Defendant concludes that the Legislature intended that evidence of domestic violence <em>not </em>be cross-admissible in child abuse cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">It is by no means clear that this is why the Legislature eliminated the provision for cross-admissibility. An earlier analysis of the bill had asked: \u201cIs This Bill Necessary? Inasmuch as children are specified victims of domestic violence under the Family Code and since [Evidence] Code Section 1109 already provides that evidence of a defendant\u2019s commission of other domestic violence is not made inadmissible in a prosecution for domestic violence subject to an evidentiary determination by the court pursuant to Evidence Code Section 352, supra, is this bill necessary?\u201d (Assem. Com. on Public Safety, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 114 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.) as amended Mar. 8, 2005, pp. 5-6.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, the Legislature may have eliminated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>cross-admissibility provision precisely because it agreed with our conclusion\u2014that a prosecution for abuse of a child living in the defendant\u2019s household is \u201ca criminal action in which the defendant is accused of an offense involving domestic violence\u201d within the meaning of Evidence Code section 1109, subdivision (a)(1). (Cf. <em>Eastburn v. Regional Fire Protection Authority </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1175, 1184 [7 Cal.Rptr.3d 552, 80 P.3d 656] [\u201cthe failure of the Legislature to adopt [the] proposed amendments . . . could merely reflect a determination that such amendments were unnecessary because the law already so provided\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">In any event, \u201c \u2018[w]e can rarely determine from the failure of the Legislature to pass a particular bill what the intent of the Legislature is with respect to existing law.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendoza </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 896, 921-922 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 431, 4 P.3d 265], fn. omitted, quoting <em>Ingersoll v. Palmer </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1321, 1349 [241 Cal.Rptr. 42, 743 P.2d 1299].) \u201c[W]hen the Legislature amends a bill to add a provision, and then deletes that provision in a subsequent version of the bill, this failure to enact the provision is of little assistance in determining the intent of the Legislature.

In count 2, however, he was charged with violating Penal Code section 273a. Defendant therefore argues that the jury should not have been allowed to consider evidence of his prior acts of child abuse in connection with count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">This is an issue, first and foremost, of statutory interpretation. In Evidence Code section 1109, the Legislature specifically referred to \u201ca criminal action.\u201d (Italics added.) An \u201caction\u201d embraces all of the counts (and other allegations) charged. If the Legislature had wanted to make the evidence admissible only in connection with a particular count, it could have said so. In fact, it said just the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">There is an obvious practical problem with asking a jury to limit its consideration of certain evidence to just one of several counts in an action. Ordinarily, we presume that jurors can follow an instruction to do so; however, there are times when the evidence is so potent or inflammatory that this presumption is overcome. The Legislature could reasonably choose to obviate the issue by providing that, whenever the evidence is admissible in connection with one count, it is admissible in connection with all counts, subject only to Evidence Code section 352. If the evidence is logically <em>relevant </em>to only one count, the defendant would be entitled to an instruction to that effect, on request. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 355.) Here, however, the evidence was logically relevant to both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">We therefore conclude that the trial court properly allowed the jury to consider evidence of defendant\u2019s prior acts of child abuse in connection with count 2 as well as count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">HI</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Gaut, J., and Miller, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied October 22, 2008, SI66744.
