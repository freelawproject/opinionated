Meneses of multiple crimes related to his participation in a scheme to defraud insurance companies. Defendant was accused of buying stolen police accident reports, using information from those reports to contact accident victims, referring the victims to attorneys and chiropractors (for which defendant collected fees), and encouraging the victims to inflate their insurance claims by receiving unnecessary medical treatment. A jury convicted defendant of stealing public records (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6200); referring business for purposes of insurance fraud (and attempting the same) (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 549, 664); making false or fraudulent insurance claims (Pen. Code, \u00a7 550, subd. (b)(2)); receiving a referral fee in connection with an insurance claim (Ins. Code, \u00a7 750); and conspiring to steal public records and to commit insurance fraud (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1)). The court stayed sentence on the conspiracy counts (Pen. Code, \u00a7 654) and sentenced defendant to an aggregate prison term of five years. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1652\">*1652</page-number>FACTS<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1460-4\">Defendant\u2019s trial testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-5\">In his testimony at trial, defendant admitted that he operated what he called a \u201clawyer referral service,\u201d in which law firms and chiropractors paid him money to refer people for services. Initially, defendant used information from connections inside San Francisco General Hospital to locate injured people. Later, defendant obtained \u201cleads\u201d for his referrals from San Francisco Police Department traffic collision reports. Defendant testified that he obtained the front page of the police reports, which usually identifies the parties involved in the collision, lists insurance information, states any vehicle code violations, and specifies whether the party not at fault was injured. Defendant said he bought the police reports from Enrique Lim, for $500 a week. Lim got the reports from his domestic partner, Susana Esquivel, who was a clerk-typist at the police department. Esquivel knew it was illegal to remove reports from the department. Esquivel never met defendant, and defendant claimed he never knew how Lim got the reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-6\">On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked defendant if he thought it was appropriate that he receive a police accident report, with personal information, and defendant said, \u201cit\u2019s a public record. So what\u2019s the big difference of that? Anybody could get that.\u201d Defendant explained that he used to obtain accident reports from the police department when he worked in a lawyer\u2019s office, when he presented a request for the report with the accident victim\u2019s authorization. The prosecutor asked, \u201cyou can\u2019t get a police report without that kind of authorization, can you?\u201d Defendant responded evasively, and continued to evade the issue during subsequent examination. Eventually, defendant said he \u201ccould not remember\u201d if, in the late 1990\u2019s, an outside party could obtain an accident report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-7\">The prosecutor also asked defendant about his handling of the reports. When the police searched defendant\u2019s home, they found 128 police reports. About half of those reports were found in a stack of folders placed in a backyard barbeque kettle upon briquettes and lighter fluid. Defendant denied the prosecutor\u2019s accusation that he wanted to be able to torch evidence with a moment\u2019s notice and claimed he was going to use the old reports as waste paper to light the charcoal for a barbeque. When the prosecutor pointed out that the reports were on top of the briquettes, not under them, defendant\u2019s only reply was that he did not intend to use the barbeque that day, but was readying it for the weekend (the search was on Wednesday).</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1653\">*1653</page-number>Defendant testified that he used the police reports he bought from Lim to contact the innocent party in a vehicle accident and urge him or her to hire a lawyer, see a chiropractor, and file an insurance claim. The client needed to see a chiropractor to prove to the insurance company that he or she was hurt. The lawyer received one-third of the insurance settlement and the client received the rest, after deduction of the chiropractor charges. Defendant had a referral arrangement with \u201c[a] lot of lawyers.\u201d In the 1990\u2019s, he worked with 10 to 20 lawyers. Defendant was \u201cpaid well\u201d by lawyers for the referrals, and was sometimes paid an additional amount by the chiropractors. In the late 1990\u2019s, lawyers paid defendant $1,000 for each referred client, usually in cash. Chiropractors paid $300 for a referral. If a person defendant referred to a lawyer did not go to the chiropractor, document injuries, and obtain a settlement, defendant would not get credit for the referral (his next referral would be unpaid).</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">Defendant described himself as a salesman who assisted people in filing insurance claims. Defendant maintained that it was never his intention to commit fraud, or to encourage others to commit fraud. Defendant said he thought it was legal to refer clients to lawyers for money. Defendant testified that his belief was based on advice from an attorney, Wayne Joyner, to whom he referred clients, and on advice received from a telephone inquiry to the State Bar of California. Defendant testified that a few other lawyers he worked with also told him it was legal to refer clients to them, but defendant \u201ccould not remember\u201d which lawyers. Defendant testified that he also thought it was legal to refer patients to chiropractors for money. Defendant did not claim that anyone advised him on this matter, when cross-examined on the subject. Instead, defendant said, \u201cit\u2019s common sense. I give them business, I deserve to be paid too.\u201d Later, on redirect, defendant said that Attorney Joyner told him it was \u201cokay\u201d to refer cases \u201cto both lawyers and doctors,\u201d as long as defendant obtained a business license. Defendant said he obtained a license, and operated under the fictitious business name, Legal Network Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-6\">Attorney Joyner, the one lawyer defendant identified as advising him that referrals were legal, denied ever rendering that advice. Joyner said he discussed a business license for Legal Network Services only in the context of tax treatment of corporations versus individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-7\">On cross-examination, defendant admitted that he did not keep account books for the business he claimed was legitimate. Defendant\u2019s only explanation for not keeping records of the money he received for referrals was: \u201cI\u2019m lazy.\u201d Defendant also admitted that he was previously convicted of conspiring to pass forged immigration documents, a federal felony. The prosecutor also impeached defendant with his 1992 deposition testimony in a civil proceeding. Despite defendant\u2019s testimony in this case that he had been referring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1654\">*1654</page-number>cases to lawyers for money since 1990, and always believed it legal, at that deposition defendant disavowed the practice. When deposed in 1992, defendant said he did not know that there are people who sign up potential clients for law firms. At that time, defendant said he had \u201cnothing to do with\u201d law firms paying money for referrals. Defendant offered several explanations for his prior testimony, including that he was not feeling well, did not know what the examiner was talking about, and was only a witness so should not have been \u201casked about the rest of [his] life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-4\">Mara Mamet</p>\n<p id=\"AAx\">November 1997 accident</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">Defendant\u2019s \u201clawyer referral service\u201d was uncovered in late 1997, when he solicited accident victim Mara Mamet, who happened to be a lawyer with the California State Bar responsible for investigating lawyer misconduct. In November 1997, a drunk driver hit Mamet\u2019s vehicle as she sat at a red light. A police officer prepared an accident report that did not list Mamet\u2019s occupation. Defendant paid Lim for Mamet\u2019s accident report filed with the San Francisco Police Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-6\">A couple weeks after the accident, defendant left a message on Mamet\u2019s telephone answering machine. Defendant said that he had good news, could help her, and called himself her \u201cguardian angel.\u201d Mamet suspected that defendant was a \u201ccapper\u201d (one who solicits business for lawyers). Mamet knew it was illegal and unethical for a lawyer to pay someone to solicit business, and had prosecuted lawyers for the offense. Mamet called defendant back to investigate the matter. When they spoke, defendant said he knew she was a victim and that he could help her get money. Defendant asked to come to her apartment that night, and she arranged to meet him the next day at a caf\u00e9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-7\">The next morning, Mamet contacted law enforcement authorities. It was agreed that an investigator for the San Francisco District Attorney\u2019s Office would pose as Mamet in meeting with defendant. The investigator, Brenda Deluca, met defendant at the caf\u00e9. Defendant, immediately upon meeting her, said he could tell her neck was sore by the way she moved. But Deluca was uninjured, the accident report did not list any neck injury, and Deluca had not complained of a sore neck. Deluca was given business cards for a chiropractor and lawyer. Defendant told her to \u201cjust keep seeing the doctor,\u201d and to tell her insurance company that she has a lawyer and the insurer must talk to the lawyer. Defendant said: \u201cThey are basing the claims on the medical bills. More medical bills is more money for you.\u201d Defendant explained: \u201c[b]ecause the lawyer [is] not going to get anything if there\u2019s no medical bills. There\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1655\">*1655</page-number>no basis on the claim.\u201d Deluca asked: \u201cWhat if the chiropractor says, oh you\u2019re okay and, and tells me to go home?\u201d Defendant advised: \u201cjust keep complaining.\u201d Deluca asked if she should keep complaining \u201c[ejven if it doesn\u2019t hurt that much.\u201d Defendant replied: \u201cYeah. Just keep complaining, okay?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-5\">Deluca went to the referred chiropractor. She told the doctor that she had been in an accident and had a sore neck. The chiropractor examined her and she received treatment: massage and cold packs. She returned two more times with complaints of soreness and received the same treatment. On her fourth visit, Deluca said she felt fine and the doctor closed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-6\">Eric Fedeler</p>\n<p id=\"A4D\">December 1997 accident</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-7\">Eric Fedeler was involved in a traffic accident on December 11, 1997, and provided information for a police report. Defendant telephoned Fedeler the next day offering legal services. Fedeler met with defendant, and defendant told Fedeler to see a chiropractor and that he \u201cwould need big bills for a big settlement.\u201d Fedeler said he did not have any neck or back pain and defendant said, \u201clet the doctor take care of that.\u201d Fedeler asked defendant how he got his personal information, and defendant said he got information from ambulance companies, police, tow truck drivers, or hospitals. Fedeler pressed defendant on exactly how he got his information and defendant replied, \u201c \u2018[i]n America we can get these things,\u2019 \u201d and gestured that he paid for the information by rubbing his fingertips against the pad of his thumb. Fedeler believed defendant was running a scam to cheat insurance companies, and refused defendant\u2019s offered services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-8\">Isaac Rodriguez</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-9\">January and March 1998 accidents</p>\n<p id=\"b1463-10\">Isaac Rodriguez had two accidents riding as a bike messenger in 1998. In January 1998, he collided with a car entering an intersection and fell to the ground with bumps, bruises, scrapes, and a swollen knee. The police took an accident report, which defendant bought from Lim. Shortly after the accident, Rodriquez received a call from defendant saying he wanted to connect Rodriquez with a lawyer and doctor to get compensation for the accident. Defendant told Rodriguez that he should receive medical treatment, and that the amount of money he would get was related to how many times he went to therapy. Rodriquez asked, \u201cwhat if the doctor says there\u2019s nothing wrong with me,\u201d and defendant said, \u201cyou can\u2019t x-ray pain. You can\u2019t tell someone their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1656\">*1656</page-number>pain doesn\u2019t show up on a chart, therefore, it\u2019s not there.\u201d Rodriguez was suspicious and discussed the call with his boss. Rodriguez was then contacted by insurance investigators, and he agreed to cooperate with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-4\">Rodriguez set a meeting with defendant but, after Rodriguez cancelled a couple times, he was met by Leila Cordova who worked with defendant. Rodriguez signed an attorney retainer agreement and Cordova urged him to see a chiropractor. Cordova said the settlement is based on the medical bills. Rodriguez said he had only a scratch and did not feel any discomfort. Cordova said he would not feel pain now but would probably feel it in about a week. When parting, Cordova told Rodriguez that if he wanted a good settlement, he would have to tell the doctor that there is really something wrong. She said \u201cyou can\u2019t find that on an x-ray or whatever,\u201d and \u201c[t]hey have to take your word for that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-5\">Rodriquez was in a second accident, on March 29, 1999, when he was struck by a car door opened in his bicycle\u2019s path. Rodriguez suffered a broken collarbone and provided information to the police. Within a couple of days, defendant telephoned and arranged to meet with Rodriguez. The meeting was recorded. Defendant referred Rodriguez to a lawyer and chiropractor. Defendant advised Rodriguez that the \u201c[m]ore medical visits you make is more money that you will take.\u201d Defendant told Rodriguez to go for therapy three times a week. Defendant said: \u201cForget those broken bones for awhile. Okay? HQ . . . [f] Let\u2019s say whiplash.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-6\">John Arguello, also known as Juan Martinez</p>\n<p id=\"AXc\">February 1998 accident</p>\n<p id=\"b1464-7\">Insurance investigator John Arguello posed as \u201cJuan Martinez\u201d on a traffic collision report fabricated by the San Francisco Police Department. The police report stated, regarding Arguello and his two passengers involved in the accident, \u201c[cjomplaint of pain, seek own care.\u201d Two days after the fictional accident, defendant called and offered legal services. At a recorded meeting, defendant said that the basis of the case is medical, and that Arguello needed to see a doctor regularly. Defendant said, \u201cto have a good settlement, you need to go 25 to 30 times.\u201d Defendant assured Arguello that the treatment would be just a massage and ice pack. Arguello asked how much he, and the passengers in his car, could \u201cget out of this.\u201d Defendant said he did not know how much they would \u201cbuild up\u201d but estimated a recovery in the range of $75 to $200 per doctor visit. Arguello asked if there was a chance the doctor would say Arguello was fine after five visits, and defendant said, \u201cno\u201d and \u201cjust keep complaining.\u201d Defendant added later, \u201cremember that they are in the business also.\u201d \u201cThey want their patients to keep coming in so they can bill the insurance company as many as you can.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1657\">*1657</page-number>Defendant suggested that Arguello, who posed as self-employed, should also \u201c[m]ake a note that you have a loss of income\u201d and submit it to the lawyer. Defendant also referred Arguello to an automobile body shop. At another recorded meeting, Arguello said that he had unrelated damage to the same car from another accident that was hit-and-run and asked, \u201cis there something we can do about this?\u201d Defendant advised Arguello, when he took the car to the body shop for an insurance estimate; \u201cKeep your mouth shut and let them see the damage. Don\u2019t say anything.\u201d Defendant explained that getting coverage for unrelated damage is \u201ca fraud so you don\u2019t want to say anything that\u2019s not appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-5\">Arguello went to the chiropractor for about 10 treatments, and then the chiropractor said he was closing the case. In a recorded telephone call to defendant about the situation, defendant told Arguello to go back and complain of pain again. \u201c[J]ust tell them it still hurts,\u201d defendant said. When Arguello returned to the chiropractor, the chiropractor smiled and said, \u201c[t]he pain just came back, huh?,\u201d and laughed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-6\">The law firm to which defendant referred Arguello settled Arguello\u2019s insurance claims for vehicle damage and personal injuries, and forwarded checks to him. Arguello received a total of $4,056.83, which Arguello returned to the insurer at the conclusion of his investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-7\">Francisco Solorio</p>\n<p id=\"Aos\">April 1998 accident</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-8\">In April 1998, 17-year-old Francisco Solorio was in a traffic accident; a driver rear-ended Solorio\u2019s car as he was double-parked to drop off a friend. A police report was filed. Defendant telephoned Solorio about the accident and Solorio\u2019s mother, thinking defendant was associated with her insurance company, agreed that she and her son would meet him. Defendant referred Solorio to a lawyer and chiropractor. Defendant said that Solorio and his friends, who were passengers in the car, needed to go to the chiropractor he recommended, and would have to make 25 or 30 visits. Solorio\u2019s mother said, \u201c[w]hy so many? The kids are not, you know, that hurt.\u201d Defendant said, \u201c[tjhat\u2019s the procedure. You even don\u2019t have to go exactly and see the chiropractor. You just sign in and take off. You don\u2019t have to go to the appointment.\u201d Solorio\u2019s mother refused defendant\u2019s services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-9\">Mei Young</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-10\">September 1998 accident</p>\n<p id=\"b1465-11\">Mei Young was in a vehicle collision in September 1998, and reported the accident to the police. Defendant bought the police report from Lim and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1658\">*1658</page-number>within a couple days of the accident, defendant telephoned her and left a message to return his call. Young returned the call and defendant said he knew Young was in an accident and asked if she needed a lawyer and doctor. Young was suspicious and asked who he was and how he got her telephone number. Defendant said he worked for Bay Axea Legal Services, and got her number from the hospital. Young told him she did not go to the hospital and defendant then said he got her number from the Internet. Young did not believe him, and defendant grew impatient and hung up the telephone. Young called the police and reported the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-4\">Police Officer John Balma telephoned defendant to investigate. Balma told defendant that he had information that defendant was trying to solicit an insurance claim and defendant was reportedly getting victim information from hospital, ambulance, or towing records. Balma said he did not believe defendant could obtain information from such records. Defendant \u201cbecame arrogant\u201d and said, \u201cwell, this is where I get the information.\u201d Balma expressed disbelief and said, \u201cI can turn this over to the District Attorney\u2019s office.\u201d Defendant replied: \u201cyou can do whatever you want.\u201d At some point in the conversation, defendant became \u201cdefensive\u201d about how he obtained information and said something like, \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything wrong.\u201d Balma referred the matter to the district attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-5\">Vera Villarreal-Novero, also known as Vera Gonzalez</p>\n<p id=\"A7y\">September 1998 Accident</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-6\">Insurance investigator Vera Villarreal-Novero posed as \u201cVera Gonzalez\u201d on a traffic collision report fabricated by the San Francisco Police Department. Defendant bought the report from Lim. Defendant contacted VillarrealNovero about filing an auto insurance claim, and they agreed to meet at a restaurant. The meeting was recorded. In the meeting, defendant said his job was to make sure that Villarreal-Novero was compensated for her accident. Defendant said, \u201c[j]ust keep seeing the doctor. Okay? Every time that you go to see the doctor the insurance company will pay a hundred to two hundred dollars per visit.\u201d Villarreal-Novero asked: \u201c[n]ow is the doctor gonna realize that I don\u2019t feel bad? I mean I told you on the phone that I don\u2019t feel bad.\u201d Defendant said, \u201c[y]eah, I know.\u201d Villarreal-Novero asked: \u201cWill the doctor realize that or what am I supposed to tell the doctor?\u201d Defendant replied: \u201cNo, No. [J]ust tell him you injured your back okay? They can not, they\u2019re not going to say anything because this is a whiplash they\u2019re going to do just, just a massage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1466-7\">Villarreal-Novero said she was looking for work and needed money, so it would really help if she could get money on the insurance claim. Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1659\">*1659</page-number>suggested that he might find her a job in a lawyer\u2019s or doctor\u2019s office. Villarreal-Novero expressed interest but said she needed to make enough money to make ends meet. Defendant asked, \u201c[h]ow would you like a thousand dollars a week?,\u201d and suggested that she work with him getting clients for lawyers and volunteering at San Francisco General Hospital to make contacts. Defendant said his business makes $100,000 a year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-5\">Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-6\">The jury found defendant guilty of nine counts of conspiracy with the police clerk-typist Esquivel (and certain others). The counts were based on the theft of separate accident reports and defendant\u2019s contact with individual accident victims, Mamet (count 1), Fedeler (count 5), Rodriquez (Jan. 1998 accident, count 8), Arguello (count 11), Solorio (count 17), Young (count 20), Villarreal-Novero (count 22), Rodriguez (Mar. 1999 accident, count 25), and additional stolen reports (count 28). (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1).) On each conspiracy count, the jury found that the object of the conspiracy was to commit theft of public records. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6200.) Five of these counts included an additional target offense or offenses, including referral of business for purpose of insurance fraud (Pen. Code, \u00a7 549), and making false or fraudulent insurance claims (Pen. Code, \u00a7 550, subd. (b)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-7\">The jury also found defendant guilty of eight counts of the substantive offense of stealing public records, namely the traffic collision reports for accident victims Mamet, Fedeler, Rodriguez (two reports), Arguello, Solorio, Young, and Villarreal-Novero. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6200.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-8\">Defendant was likewise found guilty of four counts of referring business for purpose of insurance fraud (plus one count for attempt with Villarreal-Novero) and acquitted of a count for this offense concerning Mamet. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 549, 664.) The jury reached no decision on this offense concerning Solorio.</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-9\">Defendant was convicted of two counts of assisting in the making of false or fraudulent insurance claims (Arguello). (Pen. Code, \u00a7 550, subd. (b)(2).) He was acquitted of this offense concerning Mamet. Lastly, the jury found defendant guilty of one count of an unlawful referral in connection with an insurance claim (\u201ccapping\u201d). (Ins. Code, \u00a7 750.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-10\">Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b1467-11\">The prosecutor proposed an eight- or 10-year prison sentence. The court rejected the proposal and sentenced defendant to an aggregate prison term of five years. The court imposed three years for assisting in the making of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1660\">*1660</page-number>false or fraudulent insurance claim (count 14), plus two consecutive one-year terms for stealing public records (counts 2 and 6). The court stayed sentence on all conspiracy counts and the capping count (Pen. Code, \u00a7 654), and made all other counts concurrent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-5\">Defendant raises a number of claims on appeal: (1) the court, on its own initiative (sua sponte), should have instructed the jury on mistake of law and mistake of fact as defenses to all criminal charges because there was evidence that defendant \u201cdid not think he did anything wrong\u201d; (2) the court, sua sponte, should have instructed the jury to decide whether the separately charged conspiracies were truly separate conspiracies or only one overall conspiracy; (3) the prosecutor, in her closing argument to the jury, improperly referred to evidence outside the record by suggesting she had enough evidence to charge defendant with 80 criminal counts instead of the 28 charged in the indictment, and also wrongly implied her personal belief in defendant\u2019s guilt by saying it is her \u201cethical duty\u201d not to charge someone unless one is guilty; (4) the court should have sanitized defendant\u2019s prior conviction for the felony of conspiring to forge immigration documents, by eliminating all reference to conspiracy when the prosecutor impeached defendant\u2019s credibility as a felon; (5) insufficient evidence supports convictions based on stealing police accident reports because only photocopies of the reports were stolen; and (6) trial counsel was ineffective in failing to request essential jury instructions, failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, and failing to argue that it is legal to take photocopies of police reports. We discuss these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1468-6\">A. <em>The court had no duty to instruct on mistake of law or mistake of fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1468-7\">Defendant first claims that the court had a duty to instruct, sua sponte, on mistake of law and mistake of fact as defenses to all criminal charges because there was evidence that defendant \u201cdid not think he did anything wrong.\u201d The claim fails for two reasons. First, a mistake of law (mistakenly thinking one\u2019s conduct is legal) is rarely a defense to criminal prosecution, and has limited application here. Second, to the extent a mistake of fact defense applies, defendant fails to satisfy the standards for invoking instructional duties.  A trial court\u2019s duty to instruct sua sponte on particular defenses arises \u201c \u2018only if it appears that the defendant is relying on such a defense, or if there is substantial evidence supportive of such a defense and the defense is not inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s theory of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Barton </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 186, 195 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 569, 906 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1661\">*1661</page-number>531].) Defendant satisfies neither prong of this test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We begin with an overview of the principles of mistake of law and fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-5\">1. <em>General principles of mistake of law and mistake of fact</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1469-6\">\u201cFor criminal liability to attach to an action, the standard rule is that \u2018there must exist a union, or joint operation of act and intent, or criminal negligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Jennings </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 254, 267 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 645, 95 P.3d 906], citing Pen. Code, \u00a7 20.) Generally, the prosecution must prove some form of guilty mental state. <em>(In re Jennings, supra, </em>at p. 267.) A defendant may refute guilt by showing a mistake of fact disproving criminal intent. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 276-277.) A person is usually considered incapable of committing a crime if he or she \u201ccommitted the act or made the omission charged under an ignorance or mistake of fact, which disproves any criminal intent.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 26.) As examples, a reasonable yet mistaken belief that the victim consented to sex is a defense to forcible rape <em>(People v. Mayberry </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 143, 153-158 [125 Cal.Rptr. 745, 542 P.2d 1337]); a good faith and reasonable belief that the complaining witness was at least 18 years old is a defense to statutory rape <em>(People v. Hernandez </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 529, 530-536 [39 Cal.Rptr. 361, 393 P.2d 673]); and a defendant\u2019s bona fide and reasonable belief that he was divorced is a defense to bigamy <em>(People v. Vogel </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 798, 803 [299 P.2d 850]). As our Supreme Court observed: \u2018At common law an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances, which, if true, would make the act for which the person is indicted an innocent act, has always been held to be a good defense.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Jennings, supra, </em>at p. 279.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1469-8\">In determining whether a defendant\u2019s mistaken belief disproves criminal intent, the courts have drawn a distinction between mistakes of fact and mistakes of law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Snyder </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 590, 592-593 [186 Cal.Rptr. 485, 652 P.2d 42].) While a mistake of fact usually is a defense, a mistake of law usually is not. It is commonly said that ignorance of the law is no excuse. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cole </em>(2007) 156 Cal.App.4th 452, 483 [67 Cal.Rptr.3d 526].) \u201c[I]n the absence of specific language to the contrary, ignorance of a law is not a defense to a charge of its violation.\u201d <em>(Hale </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 388, 396 [149 Cal.Rptr. 375, 584 P.2d 512].) \u201cIf the act itself is punishable when knowingly done, it is immaterial that the defendant thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1662\">*1662</page-number>it was lawful.\u201d (1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Defenses, \u00a7 36, p. 367.) As an illustration: a defendant\u2019s ignorance of a girl\u2019s age may be a defense to statutory rape, but a defendant\u2019s ignorance of the law prohibiting sex with underage girls is no defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-4\">The distinction between mistakes of fact and mistakes of law is an \u201coften difficult distinction.\u201d <em>(People v. Young </em>(2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 229, 233 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 726].) The difficulty is acute where a defendant has a mistaken belief about legal status or rights. Where, for example, a defendant is charged with violating a foreign child custody order, is his mistaken belief that the custody order is unenforceable in California a mistake of fact or a mistake of law? The court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Flora </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 662, 669-670 [279 Cal.Rptr. 17], construed the claim as a mistake of law defense, which the court ultimately rejected because there was no evidence of a good faith mistake. Arguably, the claim could be understood as a mistake of fact defense\u2014defendant claimed he was mistaken about the fact of the legal status of the custody order, not the existence of a law requiring compliance with court orders. It has been suggested that \u201c[although concerned with knowledge of the law, a mistake about legal status or rights is a mistake of fact, not a mistake of law.\u201d (Judicial Council of Cal. Crim. Jury Instns. (2008) Bench Notes to CALCRIM No. 3407; contra, <em>People v. Snyder, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d 590, 593 [mistake regarding legal status as a felon is a mistake of law, not fact, in prosecution for possession of a firearm by a felon].) Even if the claimed mistake in <em>Flora </em>was rightly construed as a mistake of law, the mistake was a collateral mistake about the nonpenal legal status of the foreign child custody order. Such mistakes are distinguishable from the strict understanding of a mistake of law where the defendant is mistaken about the penal law he or she is charged with violating.</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-5\">There are a number of circumstances \u201cin which violation of a penal statute is premised on the violator\u2019s harboring a particular mental state with respect to the nonpenal legal status of a person, thing, or action. In such cases, the principle is \u2018firmly established that defendant is not guilty if the offense charged requires any special mental element, such as that the prohibited act be committed knowingly, fraudulently, corruptly, maliciously or wilfully, and this element of the crime was lacking because of some mistake of nonpenal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Hagen </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 652, 660-661, fn. 4 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 24, 967 P.2d 563], italics omitted.) \u201c[T]he mistake must be one of <em>nonpenal </em>law. [Citation.] Thus, a taxpayer may defend against a [felony tax fraud] charge on the basis, for example, that he mistakenly believed certain deductions were proper under the tax laws, but not on the basis that he was unaware it was a crime to lie on one\u2019s tax return.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1470-6\">A mistake of law, in its strict sense, means ignorance that the penal law (of which one stands accused) prohibits one\u2019s conduct\u2014and ignorance on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1663\">*1663</page-number>this point \u201cis almost never a defense.\u201d <em>(People v. Hagen, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 660-661, fn. 4.) There are rare instances where ignorance that a penal law prohibits one\u2019s conduct <em>does </em>provide a defense. Those instances include crimes punishing the failure to act (rather than an affirmative act) and certain conspiracies. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 744, 751-754 [107 Cal.Rptr.2d 355, 23 P.3d 590], the California Supreme Court held that a defendant who claimed he was unaware of a law requiring sex offenders to register their residencies with the police was entitled to present that defense to the jury. The law punishes a willful failure to register, which is a failure to act. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 751.) In cases involving a mere failure to act, the defendant must know of the duty to act to be culpable. <em>(Ibid.; </em>cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Barker </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 345, 358 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 260, 96 P.3d 507] [no defense where defendant knew of the duty to register but \u201cjust forgot\u201d to update his registration].) Ignorance that a penal law prohibits one\u2019s conduct may also provide a defense where one is charged with conspiracy to commit a crime that is not malum in se. <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Ehrlichman </em>(D.C.Cir. 1976) 178 U.S. App.D.C. 144 &amp; fn. 17 [546 F.2d 910, 918-919].) \u201cThe essence of the crime of conspiracy is the \u2018evil\u2019 or \u2018corrupt\u2019 agreement to do an unlawful act. It is the evil intent that makes a combination criminally indictable \u2018The association of persons with an honest intent is not conspiracy, and one of the tests on a conspiracy trial is, did the accused act in ignorance without criminal intent? In other words, did they honestly entertain a belief that they were not committing an unlawful act?\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Marsh </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 732, 743 [26 Cal.Rptr. 300, 376 P.2d 300].) In a prosecution for conspiracy to practice medicine without a license, the trial court erred in instructing the jury that criminal intent was present even if the defendants believed their conduct was lawful. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 742-744.) However, the Supreme Court found that the error was not prejudicial because the evidence showed the defendants knew it was unlawful to practice medicine without a license. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 744.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-5\">2. <em>Defendant\u2019s ignorance of the law is no excuse</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1471-6\">Defendant argues on appeal that his \u201centire defense was that he did not think he did anything wrong, that he was acting legally to help inexperienced genuinely injured insureds to assure proper medical treatment and to navigate the insurance settlement procedure,\u201d and that the trial court should have instructed the jury that defendant\u2019s good faith mistake about the legality of his conduct exonerated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1471-7\">Defendant\u2019s claim that he \u201cdid not think he did anything wrong\u201d does not provide a cognizable defense to many of the crimes of which he stands convicted. Defendant\u2019s conviction for capping (count 16) was based on a law firm\u2019s payment to defendant for referral of insureds presenting damage claims. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 750.) It is immaterial that defendant supposedly believed it legal to refer insureds to lawyers and doctors. Defendant\u2019s belief is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1664\">*1664</page-number>classic mistake of law that provides no defense: \u201cignorance of a law is not a defense to a charge of its violation.\u201d <em>(Hale v. Morgan, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 396.) The trial court properly instructed the jury that a mistake of law is not a defense to the capping charge. The charge of conspiracy with capping as one of the target offenses (count 11) presents a different situation, as the trial court correctly recognized in its instructions to the jury. As noted above, \u201c \u2018[t]he association of persons with an honest intent is not conspiracy, and one of the tests on a conspiracy trial is, did the accused act in ignorance without criminal intent? In other words, did they honestly entertain a belief that they were not committing an unlawful act?\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marsh, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d at p. 743.) In defendant\u2019s association with others, his asserted belief that they were not committing an unlawful act when referring insureds for fees was a defense to conspiracy, and the trial court properly instructed the jury on this point. The court advised the jury: \u201cif you find that the defendant, in good faith, believed that capping was legal based on the advice of counsel, such belief would be a defense to that portion of Count 11, conspiracy that alleges the target offense of capping.\u201d The jury duly weighed this instruction and, in convicting defendant of conspiracy on count 11, selected other target offenses as objects of the conspiracy but not capping.</p>\n<p id=\"b1472-4\">Defendant was also convicted of referring insureds to service providers with knowledge, or reckless disregard for whether, the insureds or service providers intended to present false insurance claims (counts 7, 10, 13, 24 [attempt], 27). (Pen. Code, \u00a7 549.) Defendant claims he \u201cdid not know it was illegal to refer with reckless disregard for whether . . . others would commit fraud.\u201d This is a classic mistake of law that is not cognizable as a defense. <em>(Hale v. Morgan, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 396.) Likewise, it is no defense to defendant\u2019s convictions for assisting others in preparing false insurance claims (counts 14 and 15) that he supposedly \u201cdid not know it violated the law to assist a claimant to prepare a statement that contained false or misleading information.\u201d (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 550, subd. (b)(2).) \u201c \u2018It is an emphatic postulate of both civil and penal law that ignorance of a law is no excuse for a violation thereof. Of course it is based on a fiction, because no man can know all the law, but it is a maxim which the law itself does not permit any one to gainsay. . . . The rule rests on public necessity; the welfare of society and the safety of the state depend upon its enforcement. ... [If permitted] the plea [of ignorance] would be universally made, and would lead to interminable question incapable of solution. Was the defendant in fact ignorant of the law? Was his ignorance of the law excusable? The denser the ignorance the greater would be the exemption from liability.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hale, supra, 22 </em>Cal.3d at p. 396.) It would be absurd for the law to reward ignorance of legal duties. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1665\">*1665</page-number>3. <em>The trial court had no duty to instruct on mistake of fact because the defense is contrary to defendant\u2019s position at trial and unsupported by the evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1473-5\">Defendant\u2019s remaining convictions concern charges that he aided the theft of police reports (counts 2, 6, 9, 12, 18, 21, 23, 26) and conspired in their theft (counts 1, 5, 8, 11, 17, 20, 22, 25, 28). (Gov. Code, \u00a7 6200; Pen. Code, \u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1).) Defendant claims he mistakenly believed that the reports were open to the public and thus legally purchased from Lim, the domestic partner of a police clerk. Generously construed, this claim could be considered a cognizable defense, either as a mistake of fact or a mistake of law concerning the collateral matter of the nonpenal legal status of police records. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hagen, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 660-661, fn. 4 [mistake of nonpenal law may be defense].) As previously observed concerning mistakes of fact, \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018[a]t common law an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances, which, if true, would make the act for which the person is indicted an innocent act, has always been held to be a good defense.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Jennings, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 279.) Arguably, defendant\u2019s claimed belief in the free access of police records presents circumstances that, if true, would make defendant\u2019s act of buying police records an innocent act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-6\">But the trial court had no sua sponte duty to instruct on this mistaken belief the defense conjured on appeal. As noted above, a trial court\u2019s duty to instruct sua sponte on particular defenses arises \u201c \u2018only if it appears that the defendant is relying on such a defense, or if there is substantial evidence supportive of such a defense and the defense is not inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s theory of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Barton, supra, </em>12 Cal.4th at p. 195.) Here, defendant did not rely on a mistake of fact defense at trial, and the defense is both inconsistent with his theory of the case presented to the jury and unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1473-7\">At trial, defendant claimed he did not know the source of the reports, not that he thought his source was legal. In closing argument to the jury, defense counsel argued: \u201c[Defendant] doesn\u2019t know where the reports are coming from. He only knows that Enrigue Lim can provide them. That\u2019s what he knows. [][] And he\u2019s not aiding and abetting anything. If he was paying Susana [Esquivel, the police clerk] and saying here is this for that, that\u2019s something different. But he\u2019s not aiding and abetting her to do anything.\u201d Defense counsel argued that defendant was \u201ctoo far removed from the action to be criminally liable.\u201d Significantly, counsel effectively conceded that police reports are not publicly available by acknowledging that it would be illegal to pay a police clerk for them. This concession is inconsistent with defendant\u2019s appellate position that he believed anyone could legally obtain police reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1666\">*1666</page-number>Defendant\u2019s mistake defense, newly crafted on appeal, is also unsupported by the evidence. The facts strongly suggest guilty knowledge. Defendant claims that his testimony alone was enough to invoke the trial court\u2019s duty to instruct on a mistake defense, and points to his testimony that police accident reports are public records that anybody can get. A close reading of his testimony, however, shows that his initial claim of public access to police records was retracted under cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-4\">Defendant asserted that an accident report is \u201ca public record\u201d that \u201c[a]nybody could get.\u201d But defendant immediately limited his assertion by explaining that he obtained accident reports from the police department when he worked in a lawyer\u2019s office, after he presented a request for the report with the accident victim\u2019s authorization. The prosecutor pressed the point home: \u201cyou can\u2019t get a police report without that kind of authorization, can you?\u201d Defendant responded evasively. He vaguely suggested that police policies and procedures had changed over time. The prosecutor focused her question on 1997 through 1999, the time relevant here, and defendant initially said anyone could get an accident report if one provided identifying information, such as the accident\u2019s date, location, and parties involved. The prosecutor challenged that testimony. She asked if it was defendant\u2019s testimony \u201cthat the requester need not make any showing of having a legitimate interest in that accident in order to get the report?\u201d and defendant capitulated. He said he \u201ccould not remember about \u201997 to \u201999,\u201d and was talking about earlier years. This testimony fails to support a claim that defendant mistakenly believed the reports he obtained from 1997 to 1999 were publicly available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-5\">Defendant argues that we are required to find sufficient evidence to support a mistake defense because the trial court expressed its opinion that defendant was mistaken about the legality of his conduct. Defendant places undue reliance on a peripheral comment by the trial court. The comment was made during a hearing on the prosecutor\u2019s motion to increase bail and to remand defendant into custody, made near the end of trial. The court found that defendant posed a substantial flight risk and granted the motion. In evaluating the flight risk, the court remarked that defendant \u201chas a remarkable lack of remorse. He doesn\u2019t understand that he has committed a wrong, and I know that is going to be a jury decision. [1] I\u2019ve sat here\u2014enthralled is too strong a word, amazed is too strong a word\u2014but I\u2019ve noticed the lack of remorse and the feeling of right. . . .\u201d The court also said, \u201che actually thinks he did okay. He thinks that he acted legally and the Court knows that the jury will decide that issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1474-6\">On appeal, defendant misinterprets the trial court\u2019s comment as expressing a personal opinion that the evidence established a mistake defense to all crimes. The court\u2019s comment cannot be read so broadly. First, the comments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1667\">*1667</page-number>were made in the context of a bail hearing and were not intended as an authoritative pronouncement on the state of the evidence. Second, the court was commenting on defendant\u2019s self-righteous state of mind during the trial, not his state of mind at the time of the charged offenses. It is not unusual for a criminal defendant to rationalize his misconduct once accused and brought before a jury. Third, the court did not proclaim that defendant\u2019s \u201cfeelings of right\u201d displayed at trial were supported by the evidence. Far from it. The court said: \u201cI noted the lack of remorse and the feelings of right, which I\u2019m not sure are justified by the evidence.\u201d Fourth, the court\u2019s reference to defendant\u2019s alleged belief in the lawfulness of his actions apparently referred to defendant\u2019s capping activities, not stealing police reports. As discussed above, ignorance that a penal law prohibits one\u2019s conduct may provide a defense where one is charged with conspiracy to commit a crime that is not malum in se. <em>(United States v. Ehrlichman, supra, </em>546 F.2d at pp. 918-919 &amp; fn. 17.) The court thus instructed the jury that a good faith belief that capping was legal was a defense to the conspiracy charged in count 11, which included the target offense of capping. The court\u2019s comments at the bail hearing are an apparent reference to defendant\u2019s defense to the capping conspiracy, as reflected in its statement that defendant \u201cthinks that he acted legally and the Court knows that the jury will decide that issue.\u201d The comments cannot be fairly extended to all criminal charges. Nothing in the evidence or the trial court\u2019s comments supports defendant\u2019s appellate claim that the trial court had a duty to instruct on a mistake of fact defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-5\">B. <em>The trial court did not have a duty to instruct the jury to determine if there were multiple conspiracies, as charged, or a single conspiracy because the evidence did not support finding a single conspiracy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1475-6\">The jury found defendant guilty of nine counts of criminal conspiracy. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1).) In special findings regarding the target offenses of the conspiracies, the jury found that defendant conspired to commit the following crimes: (1) theft of a public record (police accident report) for all nine counts (counts 1, 5, 8, 11, 17, 20, 22, 25, 28); (2) referring business for purpose of insurance fraud, or attempting the same, on five of the nine counts (counts 5, 8, 11, 22, 25); and making a false or fraudulent insurance claim on one count (count 11). Various coconspirators were alleged. The court stayed sentence on the conspiracy counts. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1475-7\">Defendant seeks reversal of all conspiracy convictions. Defendant says the evidence could support a finding that there was a single conspiracy rather than multiple conspiracies. On this state of the evidence, defendant argues, the trial court erred in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte to decide whether there was one all-encompassing conspiracy (a conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, with the theft of police reports and referrals to lawyers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1668\">*1668</page-number>doctors part of the scheme) instead of nine separate conspiracies. We conclude that the trial court does have a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury to determine if single or multiple conspiracies exist where the evidence supports alternative findings. However, the evidence here does not support a finding of a single conspiracy, so no instructional error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-4\">1. <em>The court has a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury to determine if single or multiple conspiracies exist if the evidence supports alternative findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1476-5\">California intermediate appellate courts are presently divided on whether the trial court has a duty to instruct the jury on single versus multiple conspiracies. <em>(People v. Jasso </em>(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1213, 1220 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 697] <em>(Jasso) </em>[duty to instruct]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Liu </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1119, 1133 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 578] <em>(Liu) </em>[no duty to instruct]; <em>People v.

In <em>McLead, </em>the defendants were convicted of three counts of conspiracy to murder three rival drug dealers. <em>(McLead, supra, </em>at pp. 909-913.) On appeal, the defendants contended that the court should have instructed the jury to determine whether there were single or multiple conspiracies. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 921.) The <em>McLead </em>court rejected the contention, relying upon a solicitation to murder case. <em>(Ibid., </em>citing <em>People v. Davis </em>(1989) 211 Cal.App.3d 317, 322-323 [259 Cal.Rptr. 348] <em>(Davis).) </em>The <em>Davis </em>case had rejected \u201cthe notion that the number of solicitations shown by the evidence is a question of fact for the trier of fact,\u201d and adopted the theory that there are necessarily as many solicitations as there are potential victims. <em>(Davis, supra, </em>at pp. 322-323.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1476-6\">In <em>Liu, </em>the defendant was convicted of two counts of conspiracy to commit murder. <em>(Liu, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1125-1127.) The intended victims were the defendant\u2019s gambling rival, and the rival\u2019s wife. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1125.) The defendant believed his gambling rival had cheated him, and he wanted to kidnap the victims to extort money from them, then kill them. <em>(Ibid.) </em>On appeal, the defendant maintained that the evidence supported a finding that the planned murders were part of a single all-inclusive conspiracy. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1132-1133.) The defendant contended that the court erred in failing to instruct the jury to determine whether there were single or multiple conspiracies to murder the rival and his wife. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1133.) Division Three of this district rejected the contention with the bare statement that the question was not one of fact, and thus the court did not err in failing to submit it to the jury for its determination. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court based its holding on <em>McLead, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.3d 906, and <em>Davis, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.3d 317. <em>(Liu, supra, </em>at p. 1133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1669\">*1669</page-number>In <em>Jasso, </em>the defendant was a prison inmate who was convicted of three counts of conspiracy to smuggle drugs into prison. <em>(Jasso, supra, </em>142 Cal.App.4th at p. 1215.) There was testimony at trial that the defendant, and another inmate, had an \u201c \u2018ongoing business\u2019 \u201d that used inmates\u2019 wives to bring drugs during prison visits. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1220.) The appellate court reversed the judgment upon concluding that the trial court erred in failing to instruct on single versus multiple conspiracies. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1223-1224.) The court held: \u201c \u2018[a] trial court is required to instruct the jury to determine whether a single or multiple conspiracies exist . . . when there is evidence to support alternative findings.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1220.) \u201cSpecifically, an instruction is warranted where the evidence could support a finding that there was one overall agreement among the various parties to perform various functions in order to carry out the objectives of the conspiracy.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court relied upon a United States Supreme Court case explaining that \u201c \u2018the precise nature and extent of the conspiracy must be determined by reference to the agreement which embraces and defines its objects. Whether the object of a single agreement is to commit one or many crimes, it is in either case that agreement which constitutes the conspiracy which the statute punishes. The one agreement cannot be taken to be several agreements and hence several conspiracies because it envisages the violation of several statutes rather than one.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>citing <em>Braverman </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1942) 317 U.S. 49, 53 [87 L.Ed. 23, 63 S.Ct. 99].) The <em>Jasso </em>court noted the contrary line of authority holding that there is no duty to instruct on single versus multiple conspiracies (a line running from <em>Liu </em>to <em>McLead </em>and back to <em>Davis). (Jasso, supra, </em>at p. 1220, fn. 5.) The <em>Jasso </em>court did not discuss those authorities because the People, in <em>Jasso, </em>did not argue against a duty to instruct and instead argued that the evidence did not support an instruction in that individual case. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1220, fn. 5, 1222.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-5\">Here, the People do argue against a duty to instruct on single versus multiple conspiracies. The argument is not illuminating. The People rely on the principle that a prosecutor has discretion to charge one or multiple conspiracies. The principle is unassailable, but off point. The prosecutor may bring multiple conspiracy charges, but the jury must determine if those charges are sustainable. The question is whether the jury, in weighing the prosecutor\u2019s allegations, must be instructed to determine whether single or multiple conspiracies exist when there is evidence to support alternative findings. We answer the question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b1477-6\">It is well settled that the essence of the crime of conspiracy is the agreement, and thus it is the number of the agreements (not the number of the victims or number of statutes violated) that determine the number of the conspiracies. As the United States Supreme Court stated long ago: \u201cThe gist of the crime of conspiracy ... is the agreement or confederation of the conspirators to commit one or more unlawful acts . . . .\u201d <em>(Braverman v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1670\">*1670</page-number><em>States, supra, </em>317 U.S. at p. 53.) \u201c \u2018The conspiracy is the crime, and that is one, however diverse its objects.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 54.) It is also widely stated that the question of whether the evidence shows a single conspiracy or multiple conspiracies is a question of fact for the jury to decide. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Morocco </em>(1987) 191 Cal.App.3d 1449, 1453 [237 Cal.Rptr. 113]; <em>U.S. v. Williams </em>(2d Cir. 2000) 205 F.3d 23, 32; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Hanzlicek </em>(10th Cir. 1999) 187 F.3d 1228, 1232; <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>LiCausi </em>(1st Cir. 1999) 167 F.3d 36, 45; <em>United States </em>v. <em>DiCesare </em>(9th Cir. 1985) 765 F.2d 890, 900; 15A C.J.S. (2002) Conspiracy, \u00a7 192, pp. 490-491.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-4\">California cases stating that the question of single versus multiple conspiracies is <em>not </em>a factual question for the jury have a lone source, a source wholly unconcerned with conspiracy and the crime\u2019s distinct nature of punishing an <em>agreement </em>to act unlawfully. As noted above, <em>Liu </em>relied upon <em>McLead </em>and <em>Davis </em>in summarily stating that the question of single versus multiple conspiracies was not a question of fact, and holding that the court did not err in failing to submit the question to the jury for its determination <em>(Liu, supra, </em>46 Cal.App.4th at p. 1133). <em>McLead </em>relied exclusively on <em>Davis, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.3d 317. <em>(McLead, supra, 225 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 921.) <em>Davis </em>is thus the ultimate source for this line of authority. <em>Davis </em>provides a weak foundation for the proposition that the question of single versus multiple conspiracies is not a question of fact because <em>Davis </em>is not a conspiracy case, but a case concerning solicitation of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-5\">The <em>Davis </em>case rejected \u201cthe notion that the number of solicitations shown by the evidence is a question of fact for the trier of fact,\u201d and adopted the theory that there are necessarily as many solicitations as there are potential victims. <em>(Davis, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.3d at pp. 322-323.) The <em>Davis </em>court reasoned: \u201cThe commission of several murders results in more harm than the commission of a single murder. Thus, solicitation to commit several murders is a more serious wrong than solicitation to commit a single murder, no matter to what extent the solicitation constitutes a package deal for the accomplishment of a single purpose. We believe the law to be that the prosecutor may charge and, upon proper findings of guilt, the trial court may convict on, as many counts of solicitation to murder as there are identifiable victims.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 323.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1478-6\">The problem with reflexively extending <em>Davis, supra, </em>211 Cal.App.3d 317, to all conspiracies is that the number of victims is not a firm basis or indicator for determining the number of conspiracies. It is the agreement, not the overt acts, that defines the crime. <em>(Braverman v. United States, supra, </em>317 U.S. at p. 53.) Of course, solicitation to murder is also not defined by the number of victims, but by the number of solicitations, or \u201c \u2018incitements.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Cook </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 1142, 1146 [199 Cal.Rptr. 269].) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1671\">*1671</page-number>Unlike conspiracy, however, a multiplicity of victims in solicitation to murder cases often reveals a multiplicity of objectives. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Where a solicitee is importuned to commit separate acts of murder, there are multiple solicitations. <em>(Ibid.) </em>But a coconspirator importuned to commit separate criminal acts is not necessarily engaged in multiple conspiracies; a single conspiracy may have as its object one or many crimes. <em>(Braverman, supra, </em>at p. 53.) We do not believe that <em>Davis, </em>which held that the number of solicitations to murder is not a question of fact for the jury, is properly extended to hold that the number of conspiracies is never a question of fact for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-5\">Accordingly, we follow <em>Jasso </em>in holding that a trial court is required to instruct the jury to determine whether a single conspiracy or multiple conspiracies exist when there is evidence to support alternative findings. <em>(Jasso, supra, </em>142 Cal.App.4th at p. 1220.) However, we conclude that the evidence here did not support alternative findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-6\">2. <em>The evidence does not support a finding that there was one overall conspiracy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1479-7\">Defendant maintains that the evidence at trial supported an alternative finding that a single conspiracy existed, rather than multiple conspiracies as alleged. Defendant argues that the evidence shows just one overall insurance fraud conspiracy with all coconspirators working as a group in various functions. The argument is unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-8\">The evidence is that defendant operated independently as a sole proprietor who obtained \u201cleads\u201d (separately stolen police reports), used those leads to contact injured insureds, referred insureds to a number of different lawyers and chiropractors, and then encouraged the insureds to file false insurance claims with various insurers. The only common element is each conspiracy was defendant himself, who formed separate confederations with various parties at different times for different transactions. The evidence does not support a finding of a single enterprise with a common purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1479-9\">The facts of this case are analogous to <em>Kotteakos v. United States </em>(1946) 328 U.S. 750, 752-753 [90 L.Ed. 1557, 66 S.Ct. 1239], where the defendant acted as a broker assisting several individuals in filing false loan applications. Finding no connection between the borrowers, the United States Supreme Court observed that the case presented several conspiracies patterned like a wheel with separate spokes meeting at a common center (the defendant) without a rim enclosing the spokes. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 754-755.) While the loan applications were all linked to the defendant and had a similar purpose, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1672\">*1672</page-number>not possible for the jury to conclude that the defendant and the borrowers \u201cwere in a common adventure.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 768-769.) The court warned against confusing \u201cthe common purpose of a single enterprise with the several, though similar, purposes of numerous separate adventures of like character.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 769.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-4\">\u201cWhere two or more persons agree to commit a number of criminal acts, the test of whether a single conspiracy has been formed is whether the acts \u2018were tied together as stages in the formation of a larger all-inclusive combination, all directed to achieving a single unlawful end or result.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Morocco, supra, </em>191 Cal.App.3d at p. 1453.) \u201cRelevant factors to consider in determining this issue include whether the crimes involved the same motives, were to occur in the same time and place and by the same means,\u201d and targeted a single or multiple victims. <em>(McLead, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.3d at p. 920.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-5\">The conspiracies here were distinct and disconnected, not part of a larger all-inclusive combination directed to a single unlawful end. The nine conspiracies involved different combinations of conspirators and different time periods, and targeted different insurers. While defendant and the police clerk Esquivel were common conspirators in the theft of a police report in each count, most of those counts included additional conspirators and additional target crimes. Only two counts involved defendant and Esquivel as the sole named conspirators whose objective was the theft of police reports (counts 20, 28). But even those crimes occurred at different times and involved different reports and different injured parties. Moreover, there was no evidence that the conspiracy between defendant and Esquivel for the theft of police reports rested upon a single, uninterrupted agreement. Esquivel testified that she did <em>not </em>continuously provide accident reports to Lim from 1997 to 1999 (and, through him, to defendant). Esquivel said; \u201cSometimes I would stop [providing reports], then I would continue and then I would stop.\u201d The evidence would not have supported a finding of a single conspiracy. The trial court therefore was not required to instruct the jury to determine whether single or multiple conspiracies existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1480-6\">C.-F<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1673\">*1673</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1481-6\">Ruvolo, P.
