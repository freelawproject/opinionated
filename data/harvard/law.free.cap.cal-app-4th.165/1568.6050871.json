(Delta), allegedly engaged in \u201ca practice of misuse [of] the discovery process\u201d following the service of a set of demands for the inspection and production of documents by plaintiff and cross-defendant Pelton-Shepherd Industries, Inc. (Pelton-Shepherd), the trial court imposed terminating sanctions on Delta, striking Delta\u2019s answer to the complaint and dismissing Delta\u2019s cross-complaint, after previously imposing monetary sanctions of $2,500 on Delta.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1571\">*1571</page-number>From the subsequent default judgment in favor of Pelton-Shepherd, Delta appeals, arguing the trial court erred in granting Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s underlying motion to compel responses to the inspection demands because the motion was not heard before the discovery motion cutoff date and Pelton-Shepherd never moved to reopen discovery. Delta also contends (among other things) that the trial court erred in denying Delta\u2019s underlying motion for relief from the waiver of objections that resulted from Delta\u2019s failure to timely respond to the inspection demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-6\">In the published portion of the opinion, we conclude the trial court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> botched its responsibilities under the Civil Discovery Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and prejudicially abused its discretion in granting Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s motion to compel after the discovery motion cutoff date when Pelton-Shepherd had not moved to reopen discovery under Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As we will explain, a trial court has discretion to hear a discovery motion after the discovery motion cutoff date, but the exercise of that discretion is governed by section 2024.050, which requires the court to consider various factors in determining whether to hear a discovery motion after the cutoff date. Because the trial court here did not require Pelton-Shepherd to file a motion to reopen discovery under section 2024.050 before, or simultaneously with, filing its motion to compel, there is no indication in the record that the court considered any of the relevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-7\">We also conclude, in the unpublished portion of the opinion, that the trial court prejudicially abused its discretion in denying Delta\u2019s motion for relief from the waiver of objections because Delta\u2019s failure to timely respond to the inspection demands was the result of its attorney\u2019s excusable neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1379-8\">Finally we conclude these errors prejudiced Delta because it is reasonably probable that without them there would have been no basis for the trial court to later impose either monetary or terminating sanctions on Delta for misuse of the discovery process. Accordingly, we will reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1572\">*1572</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-5\">\n<em>The Pleadings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-6\">In September 2003, Pelton-Shepherd filed a complaint for declaratory relief and monies owed against Delta. According to Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s complaint, Delta had served (pursuant to an oral agreement) as a distributor of Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s gel packs in Southern California between January 1997 and May 2003. According to Pelton-Shepherd, Delta had terminated the distribution agreement in May 2003 and Pelton-Shepherd had accepted the termination, but Delta was continuing to claim the right to commissions for gel packs sold by Pelton-Shepherd. Pelton-Shepherd sought a declaration that the distribution agreement had been terminated. Pelton-Shepherd also alleged that Delta owed Pelton-Shepherd in excess of $29,714.75 in connection with a joint venture for a packaging distribution business in Northern California that had been part of the same oral agreement. Pelton-Shepherd sought damages in the amount of $29,714.75.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-7\">In October 2003, Delta filed its answer and a cross-complaint for damages for breach of contract, interference with prospective business advantage, abuse of trade secrets, and conversion. As relevant here, in the first cause of action in its cross-complaint (for breach of a written contract) Delta alleged it had entered into a written contract with Pelton-Shepherd around March 2003 \u201cconcerning the sale and distribution of certain coolant gel paks to be used by the parties[\u2019] customers.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Delta alleged Pelton-Shepherd breached the contract around June 2003 by refusing to pay commissions owed and \u201cfuture commissions as they came due and payable, all to [Delta]\u2019s damage in the sum of $7,085.00 for current damages, and the sum of $235,000.00 for future damages, said aforementioned sum calculated for fifteen (15) years at the historical rate of $17,000.00 per year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-8\">Pelton-Shepherd filed its answer to the cross-complaint in November 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b1380-9\">Ultimately the case was set for trial on November 14, 2005. That meant discovery was to be completed by October 17,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the last day to have any discovery motion heard was October 31. (See \u00a7\u00a7 2016.060, 2024.020, subd. (a).) With respect to a demand for the inspection and production of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1573\">*1573</page-number>documents (\u00a7 2031.010 et seq.), discovery is considered completed on the day the response to the demand is due. (\u00a7 2024.010.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-7\">\n<em>The Discovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-8\">As will be apparent from the discussion that follows, the discovery in this case is a classic example of how not to conduct discovery (on the part of the lawyers) or to manage discovery (on the part of the court). If discovery was always managed in this manner, no civil case would ever get to trial. Unfortunately, it is necessary to recount all the convoluted proceedings in order to explain how the trial court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-9\">On September 15, 2005, Pelton-Shepherd served Delta, by mail, with a second set of demands for the inspection and production of documents,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> consisting of 19 demands numbered 3 through 21.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Demands Nos. 3 through 17 sought various documents relating to \u201cthe Quail Mountain Herbs account,\u201d which was the subject of the second cause of action (for breach of oral contract) in Delta\u2019s cross-complaint. Demands Nos. 18 through 21 sought documents relating to Delta\u2019s production and sale of gel ice products since January 2003. Specifically, demand No. 18 sought \u201c[a]ny and all documents pertaining to the gel ice production/manufacturing set up that [Delta] had undertaken since January 2003 to present, including but not limited to production lay out diagrams and photos, purchase orders, vendor material billings and canceled checks.\u201d Demand No. 19 sought \u201c[a]ny and all customer purchase orders received for Gel Ice Products by [Delta] or related entities from January 2003 to present.\u201d Demand No. 20 sought \u201c[a]ny and all invoices of goods sold for Gel Ice Products by [Delta] or related entities from January 2003 to present.\u201d Demand No. 21 sought \u201c[a]ny and all customer checks received for Gel Ice Products by [Delta] or related entities from January 2003 to present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-10\">Given the date and method of service, Delta\u2019s responses to the inspection demands were due on October 20 (30 days plus five for mail service)\u2014three days beyond the discovery cutoff date. (See \u00a7\u00a7 1013, 2016.050, 2024.010, 2031.260, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1574\">*1574</page-number>A settlement conference was scheduled for October 17, 2005, but Delta\u2019s attorney failed to attend. The matter was continued to October 31. Meanwhile, having received no response to its inspection demands, on October 21 Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney sent a letter to Delta\u2019s attorney asserting that Delta had waived its right to object to the demands and asking for Delta\u2019s responses, without objections, within 10 days.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">At the expiration of that 10-day period on October 31, Pelton-Shepherd filed an ex parte motion to strike Delta\u2019s answer and cross-complaint on the grounds that Delta had (1) failed to file a settlement conference statement; (2) failed to attend the settlement conference; and (3) failed to respond to Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s inspection demands. The motion was to be heard on November 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-5\">In its opposition to the motion (filed Nov. 1), Delta asserted that Pelton-Shepherd could not seek terminating sanctions based on Delta\u2019s failure to respond to the inspection demands because Pelton-Shepherd had not first obtained a court order compelling Delta to respond to those demands. Delta also asserted that Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s request for terminating discovery sanctions was time-barred because the deadline for the hearing of discovery motions had passed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1382-6\">At the hearing on November 2, the court and the parties agreed to hold a settlement conference on November 14\u2014the scheduled trial date\u2014and to determine at that time what to do about a new trial date because the court was scheduled to conduct another trial that would last until November 18. Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney asserted his need for the documents he had demanded from Delta so that he could prepare for trial, and Delta\u2019s attorney pointed out that no motion to compel had been filed. When Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney asked if Delta\u2019s attorney was going to \u201crequire [him] to file a separate motion for the production of documents,\u201d Delta\u2019s attorney responded, \u201cWell, you can do whatever you want, but it seems like you\u2019re time-barred. All discovery motions had to be heard 15 days before the trial date, which is November 14th. It\u2019s not my fault that you waited to bring an ex parte application.\u201d Delta\u2019s attorney later invited Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney to call him the following morning so they could \u201ctalk about this off the court record, and maybe . . . work it out as professional attorneys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1575\">*1575</page-number>On November 3, the two attorneys talked on the telephone about Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s inspection demands, and Delta\u2019s attorney told PeltonShepherd\u2019s attorney that he would get back to him by the end of the day as to whether Delta would produce the documents. When Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney did not receive the promised call, he wrote to Delta\u2019s attorney the next day asking Delta\u2019s attorney to \u201cadvise [him] as soon as possible as to when [he might] expect the documents.\u201d The following Monday, November 7, Delta\u2019s attorney wrote back, stating that he had \u201chear[d] back from Delta . . . which informed me that it will be able to assemble responsive documents by the end of this week. As soon as I receive them, I will immediately send you copies of the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-6\">On November 8, the court denied Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s motion to strike the answer and cross-complaint but sanctioned Delta $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-7\">Following the settlement conference on November 14, which was unsuccessful, trial was reset for March 27, 2006.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After the settlement conference, Delta\u2019s attorney told Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney that Delta was providing the responsive documents to him that day for his review, but that he needed to sift through, copy, and page-number them. Thereafter, however, Delta\u2019s attorney failed to forward any documents to Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney. Accordingly, on December 6, 2005, Pelton-Shepherd filed a motion to compel Delta to respond to the second set of demands for production of documents. The hearing on the motion was set for January 11, 2006. Consistent with the discovery statutes, Pelton-Shepherd did not yet seek an order to compel Delta to actually <em>produce </em>any documents for inspection and copying.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1383-8\">On December 7, Delta\u2019s attorney wrote to Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney regarding the motion to compel. He first reproached Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney about filing the motion without first attempting to \u201cresolve this matter extra-judicially.\u201d He explained that he had been \u201cunable to get to the document production\u201d \u201cdue to trial preparation and a trial which was to begin on November 28.\u201d He then asserted that the motion was time-barred due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number>the discovery motion cutoff. Then, \u2018\u2018 [n]otwithstanding the untimeliness of [the] motion,\u201d he \u201cagree[d] to overnight to [Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney] the documents by Tuesday, December 13, 2005,\u201d if Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney would take the motion to compel off calendar. If not, then Delta\u2019s attorney said he would seek an ex parte order clarifying \u201cthat the discovery and discovery motion cut-off dates were not extended by the continued trial date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney did not respond to the letter from Delta\u2019s attorney or to two subsequent telephone messages. Nonetheless, on December 13 Delta\u2019s attorney sent a fax to Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney stating that he was preparing to send the documents. He invited Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney to call him \u201cto discuss taking [the] motion off calendar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-5\">On December 14, Delta\u2019s attorney notified Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney by telephone that he would be filing the ex parte application for clarification of the discovery cutoff dates on December 16. He asked Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney to stipulate to reopening discovery, and Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney said he would speak to his client.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1384-6\">Meanwhile, on December 15 Delta\u2019s attorney served Delta\u2019s responses to the inspection demands along with 248 pages of responsive documents. Delta agreed to produce all documents responsive to the first 15 of the demands (those relating to Quail Mountain Herbs), but objected to producing any documents in response to the last four demands (demands Nos. 18 through 21), which related to Delta\u2019s production and sale of gel ice products from January 2003 to the present, on the grounds (among others) that the demands sought \u201cinformation which is not relevant or reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence\u201d and \u201cprivileged financial information and documents which involve trade secrets and confidential and proprietary information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-7\">The following day, in disposing of Delta\u2019s ex parte application to clarify the discovery cutoff dates, the court noted, \u201cDiscovery not to be reopened; however, counsel/court shall work out any pending issues\u201d at the hearing on the motion to compel in January.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1577\">*1577</page-number>In subsequently opposing the motion to compel, Delta argued the motion should be denied as untimely. In reply, Pelton-Shepherd argued that Delta had waived its right to object to the timeliness of the motion both because Delta had not timely responded to the inspection demands and because Delta\u2019s attorney had \u201ccontinually promise[d] to send the documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-6\">The trial court granted the motion to compel. Thereafter, on January 24, 2006, Delta filed a motion for relief from the waiver of its right to object to demands Nos. 18 through 21.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Delta\u2019s attorney claimed he had not served a timely response to the inspection demands because he had inadvertently failed to open the envelope containing the demands when he received it along with two other envelopes from Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney. He further claimed he did not discover the unopened envelope until Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney informed him in the letter of October 21, 2005, that the responses were overdue and any objections had been waived. Delta\u2019s attorney also asserted that the documents sought in demands Nos. 18 through 21 were \u201cwildly beyond the scope of proper discovery\u201d and contained \u201cprivileged and confidential information . . . during a period of time following any further relationship between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-7\">Delta\u2019s motion was set for hearing on February 24, 2006. Meanwhile, on February 15, 2006, the court entered a formal order granting Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s motion to compel Delta to respond to the inspection demands. That order required Delta to \u201cfully respond without objection\u201d within 30 days. Consistent with the fact that Pelton-Shepherd had not sought an order compelling the production of any documents, the February 15 order did not order Delta to produce any documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1385-8\">At the February 24 hearing on Delta\u2019s motion for relief from waiver of objections, the court first expressed the understanding that the case had previously been \u201con for a motion for production of documents,\u201d which the court believed it had granted, and the court asked why it should \u201cset aside the granting of th[at] motion.\u201d The court also expressed uncertainty as to whether there <em>was </em>any such motion as a motion for relief from waiver of objections. When Delta\u2019s attorney identified the statutory basis for the motion, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1578\">*1578</page-number>asked him, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you want to turn over the documents?\u201d Delta\u2019s attorney argued the documents sought in demands Nos. 18 through 21 \u201chave nothing whatsoever to do with this lawsuit,\u201d and Delta \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to suffer because of [his] problem,\u201d i.e., his failure to timely respond to the inspection demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-4\">When the court asked why he needed the documents, Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney read the allegation from the cross-complaint set forth above regarding Delta\u2019s claim for $235,000 in future damages for breach of contract based on unpaid commissions. He asserted that \u201cDelta has actually gone out and started its own gel pack business and is soliciting those same customers that they are complaining for damages against us.\u201d He told the court he wanted the documents because \u201cthey can\u2019t have it both ways. They can\u2019t claim damages against us for not being able to sell those products to those customers, while at the same time they are making the profit from [those] customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-5\">In response, Delta\u2019s attorney asserted that the breach of contract claim in the cross-complaint was \u201creally about . . . one issue only\u201d\u2014commissions Delta claimed Pelton-Shepherd owed relating to a client named Bio-Rad Laboratories that Pelton-Shepherd had taken over from Delta on the promise that Pelton-Shepherd would pay Delta commissions for sales Pelton-Shepherd made to Bio-Rad. Delta\u2019s attorney asserted that Delta \u201cis not trying to compete with Bio-Rad. It has nothing whatsoever to do with my cross-complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-6\">On March 21, 2006, the court issued its ruling denying Delta\u2019s motion for relief from waiver of objections \u201con the condition that [Pelton-Shepherd] abides by the existing protective order.\u201d It does not appear from the record that there <em>was </em>any \u201cexisting protective order\u201d; however, the meaning of this reference to a protective order was clarified when the court entered its formal order denying Delta\u2019s motion on April 4, 2006. In that order, the court ordered \u201cthat the documents be produced forthwith,\u201d subject to several conditions restricting Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s right to use those documents.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This appears to be the protective order the court was referencing in its initial ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-7\">Meanwhile, trial was reset to May 30, and Delta moved for reconsideration of the ruling denying its motion for relief from waiver of objections. The court denied that motion on May 2. On May 8, Delta served Pelton-Shepherd with its further responses to the document requests. Delta agreed without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1579\">*1579</page-number>objection to produce documents responsive to demands Nos. 18, 20, and 21. With regard to demand No. 19, however, Delta asserted it was \u201cunable to comply . . . because it is not nor has ever been in possession of such documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-6\">On May 22, Pelton-Shepherd filed a motion for terminating sanctions on the ground that Delta had \u201cfailed to obey the order dated February 15, 2006, compelling [Delta] to fully respond, without objection, to the Request for Production of Documents, Set Two within 30 days of the order.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The attached declaration and memorandum of points and authorities made clear, however, that Pelton-Shepherd was not complaining about Delta\u2019s <em>responses </em>to the inspection demands, as much as about the documents Delta had produced\u2014or had <em>not </em>produced\u2014in response to most of the inspection demands, including (but not limited to) demands Nos. 18 through 21. Pelton-Shepherd complained that Delta had sent \u201ca pile of 1306 unorganized, undecipherable, and unintelligible documents\u201d that were \u201cnot labeled to correspond with any of the requests.\u201d Pelton-Shepherd also complained that Delta had not produced any documents responsive to demand No. 19 and that Delta\u2019s production of documents responsive to demands Nos. 20 and 21 was \u201c[incomplete.\u201d Specifically, Pelton-Shepherd complained that Delta had produced more invoices for gel ice products Delta had sold since January 2003 (demand No. 20) than customer checks for those products (demand No. 21) and had not produced <em>any </em>related customer purchase orders (demand No. 19), even though \u201cmore than one-half of [the] invoices show a purchase order from [the] customer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-7\">In addition to seeking terminating sanctions, Pelton-Shepherd also sought $2,500 in monetary sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-8\">In opposing Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s motion, Delta argued (among other things) that the only demands implicated by the February 15 order were the final four demands, and it had timely complied with the order by responding without objection to those demands and producing over 1,306 pages of documents as they are kept in the ordinary course of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-9\">In a ruling issued on June 23 following a hearing on June 14, the court (Judge McNatt) concluded that (1) the February 15 order applied to <em>all </em>of the inspection demands, not just the final four; (2) Delta had \u201cnot adequately explained why [it could not] produce [documents responsive to request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1580\">*1580</page-number>No.] 19, or the efforts made to provide it [sz'c]\u201d; and (3) Delta had not met its obligations under the discovery statutes by \u201c[s]imply providing more than 1300 pages of uncorrelated documents . . . , even if those documents are in chronological order.\u201d The court denied Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s request for terminating sanctions but granted the requested monetary sanctions and ordered the cross-complaint stayed \u201cpending full compliance with Judge Saiers\u2019 Order, pursuant to C.C.P. Sections 2023(b)(1) and (4)(B).\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> More specifically, the court ordered Delta to \u201cfully and without objection provide all documents identified in Judge Saiers\u2019 Order, or to provide a statement of due diligence why they cannot do so, and to pay all sanctions now due and owing\u201d within 20 days.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">On July 13, 2006, Delta served Pelton-Shepherd with further responses to the inspection demands. As relevant here, in response to demand No. 19 (customer purchase orders for gel ice products sold since Jan. 2003) Delta asserted that it had \u201cmade a diligent search and reasonable inquiry of all its files and records in an effort to comply with this Request,\u201d but was \u201cunable to comply . . . because the particular documents requested have either never existed or are no longer in [Delta]\u2019s possession, custody or control.\u201d Delta went on to explain that \u201c[t]he majority of such purchase orders were verbal and, as such, no written purchase orders exist. Those purchase orders which were in writing are no longer in [Delta]\u2019s possession, custody or control as [Delta] routinely disposes of such documents upon payment of the corresponding invoice. However, the identical information contained in each purchase order is also contained in the customer checks and invoices, copies of which were previously produced as Bates-numbered documents 362-470 and 471-1668, respectively.

All customer checks are Bates-numbered 362-470.\u201d Delta further asserted its belief \u201cthat any alleged missing checks may be in the possession, custody or control of [Delta]\u2019s customers, all of which are referenced in [Delta]\u2019s invoices, which are Bates-numbered 471-1668.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">Delta\u2019s further responses to the inspection demands were verified by Spencer Pritikin, an officer of Delta.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-7\">On July 14, 2006, the day after serving its further responses to the inspection demands on Pelton-Shepherd, Delta filed a \u201cnotice\u201d with the trial court of its compliance with the June 23 order. This notice included a copy of the further responses, as well as a copy of a check for $2,500 made payable to the clerk of the court. It also included a declaration from Pritikin in which he reiterated that \u201cthe majority of purchase orders requested in Request No. 19 have never existed as such orders were verbal. The written purchase orders are no longer in Delta\u2019s possession as they were routinely disposed of upon payment of the corresponding invoice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-8\">Despite Delta\u2019s claimed compliance with the June 23 order, on August 30, 2006, Pelton-Shepherd filed a \u201crenewed\u201d motion for terminating sanctions on the ground that Delta had still \u201cfail[ed] to comply with the orders of this Court dated February 15, 2006 and June 23, 2006, compelling [Delta] to fully and without objection provide documents.\u201d Specifically, Pelton-Shepherd complained about Delta\u2019s compliance with demands Nos. 19, 20, and 21.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> With respect to demand No. 19 (customer purchase orders), Pelton-Shepherd asserted that \u201c[t]he claim that [Delta] disposes of [written] purchase orders after payment is disingenuous\u201d and \u201ccompletely unbelievable under all commonly accepted business practices.\u201d With respect to demands Nos. 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1582\">*1582</page-number>(invoices) and 21 (customer checks), Pelton-Shepherd complained that while Delta had produced 1,198 invoices, it had produced only 109 customer checks, and a comparison of the checks to the invoices revealed that only 40 of the invoices produced were referenced on the checks produced. Thus, Pelton-Shepherd asserted, Delta had \u201crefused to provide evidence of payment of 1,158 invoices.\u201d Additionally, the analysis of the 109 customer checks produced revealed that those checks referenced numerous invoice numbers for which no corresponding invoice had been found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-4\">In its opposition to the renewed motion for terminating sanctions, Delta pointed out with respect to Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s complaint about demand No. 19 that \u201c[n]o evidence of any kind is offered to call into question Delta\u2019s truthfulness [about its practice of routinely disposing of written purchase orders]; [Pelton-Shepherd] only presents its counsel\u2019s conclusion about what a business should do.\u201d With respect to Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s complaints about demands Nos. 20 and 21, Delta asserted that \u201cDelta would not have any original \u2018customer checks\u2019; the original checks are deposited by Delta in [its] bank. Any records Delta might have would be as a result of a custom or practice to keep copies of the checks it receives.\u201d Delta further asserted that it had \u201cproduced the checks that it has a copy of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\">The motion was heard on September 28, 2006. The court\u2019s tentative decision was to deny the motion, but at the hearing Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney convinced the court to withhold its ruling pending a deposition of Delta\u2019s custodian of records \u201con the issue of production of documents.\u201d The court rejected Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s request that the deposition take place in Stockton, but told Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney that if he could \u201cconvince [the court] that this statement[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>] was erroneous, [the court would] reimburse [him] for [his] expenses going to Los Angeles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-6\">Delta designated Spencer Pritikin as its custodian of records, and Pelton-Shepherd deposed Pritikin in Los Angeles on October 12, 2006. Following the deposition, Delta produced 102 additional invoices to Pelton-Shepherd that were referenced on the customer checks Delta had previously produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-7\">Ultimately, the hearing on the renewed motion for terminating sanctions was continued to November 22, 2006.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> On November 20, Pelton-Shepherd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1583\">*1583</page-number>filed an unsworn \u201csupplemental brief\u2019 in support of its motion. In that document, Pelton-Shepherd purported to detail what had happened at Pritikin\u2019s deposition.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Pelton-Shepherd complained that Pritikin \u201chad very little to do with the assembly of the documents or their production.\u201d Pelton-Shepherd also asserted that in an effort to determine if any unproduced documents were located in Delta\u2019s customer files, Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney asked for a small number of files to be pulled for review. Ultimately, it was agreed that Delta would review the files for two customers (Gee Tee Company and POM Wonderful) for whom Delta had previously produced customer checks without matching invoices. According to Pelton-Shepherd, that review produced \u201cinvoices from both files that should have been produced over one year ago.\u201d Based on this discovery, Pelton-Shepherd asserted \u201cit is not credible that [Delta] made a diligent search for the production in the first place.\u201d Pelton-Shepherd also complained that following the discovery of the invoices, Delta refused (among other things) to \u201callow counsel to examine the staff members who actually compiled the documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-6\">At the hearing on November 22, Delta asserted that Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s supplemental brief was untimely, having been served on Delta less than 24 hours before the hearing. Delta also asserted that it had now provided Pelton-Shepherd with \u201c105 total additional invoices\u201d not previously produced that had been referenced in the customer checks previously produced. Delta claimed that \u201cover 75 percent of those have nothing to do with gel packs.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Delta argued there was \u201cno basis ... to enter any terminating sanctions here\u201d and suggested that the court reserve the issue of sanctions for the trial judge. The court took the matter under submission but gave Delta permission to file a posthearing opposition to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-7\">In that opposition, Delta complained about Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney\u2019s \u201cunsworn statements and conclusions about what the deposition showed.\u201d Delta offered its own take on Pritikin\u2019s testimony, supported by references to excerpts from the deposition transcript that were appended to an accompanying declaration filed by Delta\u2019s attorney. Delta argued that Pelton-Shepherd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1584\">*1584</page-number>was essentially seeking \u201cterminating sanctions] [because Delta] missed approximately 25 invoices\u201d that \u201chave nothing to do with [Pelton-Shepherd]\u2019s complaint and are only arguably discoverable based on broad wording in [Delta]\u2019s cross-complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">On December 7, 2006, the court granted Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s motion for terminating sanctions without further explanation. The court entered a formal order on January 10, 2007. In that order, the court found that Delta had \u201cengaged in a practice of misuse of the discovery process, including, but not limited to: [][] (a) Failing to submit to an authorized method of discovery; [][] (b) Making an untruthful response to discovery; [][] (c) Opposing, unsuccessfully and without substantial justification, a motion to compel discovery; and [][] (d) Disobeying court orders to provide discovery.\u201d The court also found that \u201c[additional orders to compel discovery or providing for issue or evidentiary sanctions would be ineffectual or inadequate.\u201d Accordingly, the court struck Delta\u2019s answer and dismissed its cross-complaint with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">The trial court subsequently granted Pelton-Shepherd a default judgment in the amount of $32,913.76, which included $35,760.51 in damages and $3,100 in costs relating to the Pritikin deposition, offset by $5,946.75 that Pelton-Shepherd owed Delta. Delta filed a timely notice of appeal from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-8\">\n<em>Discovery After the Discovery Cutoff</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-9\">Delta contends the trial court erred in granting Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s motion to compel Delta to respond to the inspection demands because the demands and the motion were both untimely. Delta contends that because the later terminating sanctions were based on Delta\u2019s \u201calleged violation\u201d of the February 15, 2006, order compelling Delta to respond to the inspection demands, those sanctions were \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d and should be reversed on that basis. As we will explain, we agree with Delta and conclude the trial court prejudicially abused its discretion in granting the motion to compel without first determining whether discovery should be reopened.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-11\"><em>Timeliness of the Inspection </em>Demands<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1393-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1585\">*1585</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-6\">\n<em>Timeliness of the Motion to Compel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-7\">We now turn to Delta\u2019s argument that the motion to compel was untimely. As we have explained, the last day to have any discovery motion heard was October 31.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Pelton-Shepherd did not <em>file </em>its motion until December 6, and the hearing on the motion was not set, and did not occur, until January 11\u2014nearly two and one-half months late. Thus, Delta is correct that the motion to compel was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-8\">In response, Pelton-Shepherd asserts that Delta \u201cis subsequently estopped from relying on the October 31, 2005 discovery motion cutoff\u201d date because it was <em>Delta\u2019s </em>fault that the motion to compel was untimely. Essentially, Pelton-Shepherd suggests that but for Delta\u2019s conduct, including \u201cfalse assurances that the documents would be produced,\u201d Pelton-Shepherd would have been able to meet the discovery motion cutoff date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-9\">\u201c[U]nder [the] doctrine of equitable estoppel, one may not lull a party into inaction by words or deeds that lead to a false sense of security.\u201d <em>(Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh </em>(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1351 [32 Cal.Rptr.3d 717].) \u201c[F]or the doctrine of equitable estoppel to apply,\u201d however, \u201cthe party asserting estoppel must rely on the other party\u2019s conduct, to its detriment.\u201d <em>(Lusardi Construction Co. v. Aubry </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 976, 994 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 837, 824 P.2d 643].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-10\">Here, Pelton-Shepherd suggests the reason its motion to compel was untimely was because after its ex parte motion to strike Delta\u2019s answer and cross-complaint was denied on November 2, 2005, Pelton-Shepherd \u201cwaited until December 5, 2005 to file [its] Motion to Compel due to [Delta]\u2019s continued assurances that [it] would comply with the [inspection demands].\u201d In other words, Pelton-Shepherd suggests that Delta\u2019s assurances made Pelton-Shepherd miss the discovery motion cutoff date. The reason this argument does not support a finding of estoppel is simple. As we have noted already, October 31, 2005, was not, as Pelton-Shepherd asserts, \u201cthe statutory deadline to <em>file </em>discovery motions\u201d (italics added), it was the deadline to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1586\">*1586</page-number>such motions <em>heard. </em>Thus, when Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s ex parte motion to strike was heard on November 2, it was already too late for Pelton-Shepherd to have a motion to compel heard. What Delta said and did after November 2 may have led Pelton-Shepherd to delay filing its motion to compel until December 6, but those words and actions did not prevent, and could not have prevented, Pelton-Shepherd from meeting the discovery motion cutoff date, because that date had already passed. Accordingly, Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s estoppel argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-4\">The issue, then, is whether the trial court erred, or abused its discretion, in granting Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s motion to compel after the discovery motion cutoff date. The thrust of Delta\u2019s argument appears to be that the trial court was required, as a matter of law, to deny the motion to compel because it was not heard within the time allowed by law. Pelton-Shepherd, on the other hand, argues the trial court had discretion to hear the motion to compel after the discovery motion cutoff date, and we should review the court\u2019s decision to do so for abuse of discretion. As we will explain, we agree with Pelton-Shepherd, but we conclude the trial court abused its discretion in hearing, and granting, the belated motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1394-5\">Subdivision (a) of section 2024.020 specifies that \u201c[e]xcept as provided in this chapter, any party shall be entitled <em>as a matter of right </em>... to have motions concerning discovery heard on or before the 15th day, before the date initially set for the trial of the action.\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, if a party properly notices a discovery motion to be heard on or before the discovery motion cutoff date, that party has a <em>right </em>to have the motion heard. By negative implication, a party who notices a discovery motion to be heard <em>after </em>the discovery motion cutoff date does not have a right to have the motion heard. But the fact that a party does not have a <em>right </em>to have a discovery motion heard after the discovery motion cutoff date does not mean the court has no <em>power </em>to hear it, or that the court errs in hearing it. Indeed, subdivision (a) of section 2024.050 specifically allows a discovery motion to be heard after the discovery motion cutoff date by providing that \u201cthe court may grant leave ... to have a motion concerning discovery heard, closer to the initial trial date, or to reopen discovery after a new trial date has been set.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> But that statute also specifies that such leave may be granted \u201c[o]n motion of any party.\u201d (\u00a7 2024.050, subd. (a).)  Moreover, such a motion must be accompanied by a meet and confer declaration,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and in exercising its discretion to grant or deny the motion the court must consider various factors, including (but not limited to) \u201c[t]he necessity and the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1587\">*1587</page-number>for the discovery\u201d and \u201c[t]he diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking ... the hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons that ... the discovery motion was not heard earlier.\u201d (\u00a7 2024.050, subds. (a), (b)(1), (2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-6\">Here, by the time Pelton-Shepherd filed its motion to compel on December 6, 2005, the cutoff date for hearing such a motion was more than a month past, and a new trial date had been set for late March 2006. Nevertheless, Pelton-Shepherd did not seek leave from the court under section 2024.050 to reopen discovery so that its motion to compel could be heard consistent with the foregoing statutes.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Instead, Pelton-Shepherd simply ignored the close of discovery and sought an order compelling responses to its inspection demands as though there had been no discovery motion cutoff date.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1395-7\">Noting that a \u201ctrial court may grant leave ... to have a motion concerning discovery heard\u201d after the discovery motion cutoff date \u201con a motion of any party,\u201d Pelton-Shepherd suggests the trial court properly exercised \u201cits discretion to allow [the] Motion to Compel to [be heard] after the discovery deadline\u201d when, at the December 16, 2005, hearing on Delta\u2019s ex parte application to clarify the discovery cutoff dates, the court \u201cfailed to reopen discovery\u201d but \u201cgranted leave to counsel to \u2018work out any pending issues\u2019 at the January 11, 2006 hearing on [the] Motion to Compel.\u201d We are not persuaded. As we have noted, Pelton-Shepherd did not file a motion for leave to reopen discovery so that its motion to compel could be heard after the discovery motion cutoff date. It is disingenuous for Pelton-Shepherd to suggest the trial court properly exercised its discretion in granting a motion Pelton-Shepherd never made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-8\">Although Pelton-Shepherd had no <em>right </em>to have its motion to compel heard after the passage of the discovery motion cutoff date, we do not question that the trial court had discretion to hear the motion. But \u201c[t]he scope of discretion always resides in the particular law being applied, i.e., in the \u2018legal principles governing the subject of [the] action . . . .\u2019 Action that transgresses the confines of the applicable principles of law is outside the scope of discretion and we call such action an \u2018abuse\u2019 of discretion.\u201d <em>(City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Drew </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1287, 1297 [255 Cal.Rptr. 704].) Here, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1588\">*1588</page-number>court\u2019s discretion to hear Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s motion to compel was governed by section 2024.020, which provided that (1) the last day for Pelton-Shepherd to have its motion to compel heard as a matter of right was October 31, 2005, and that (2) the postponement of the trial date did not \u201coperate to reopen discovery proceedings\u201d \u201c[ejxcept as provided in Section 2024.050\u201d\u2014that is, except upon a successful <em>motion </em>for leave to reopen discovery. Moreover, under section 2024.050, subdivision (b), the trial court\u2019s discretion to grant such a motion was not unfettered, but could be exercised only upon \u201ctak[ing] into consideration any matter relevant to the leave requested, including, but not limited to . . . [f] . . . [t]he necessity and the reasons for the discovery\u201d and \u201c[t]he diligence or lack of diligence of the party seeking ... the hearing of a discovery motion, and the reasons that... the discovery motion was not heard earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">Here, because the trial court did not require Pelton-Shepherd to file a motion for leave to reopen discovery under section 2024.050, there is no indication in the record that the court considered any of the matters relevant to whether discovery should have been reopened for the hearing of Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s motion to compel, including (but not limited to) (1) the reasons Pelton-Shepherd believed it needed the documents it was seeking; and (2) Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s diligence or lack of diligence in seeking those documents and in seeking a hearing on its motion to compel. Had the trial court required the filing of a motion to reopen discovery under section 2024.050, so that the parties could have offered evidence and argument on these and other relevant factors, the court would have had an informed basis on which to exercise its discretion to hear (or not hear) Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">By simply hearing the motion to compel without first deciding whether discovery should be reopened for that purpose under all of the relevant circumstances, the trial court \u201ctransgresse[d] the confines of the applicable principles of law\u201d <em>(City of Sacramento v. Drew, supra, </em>207 Cal.App.3d at p. 1297) and thereby abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-6\">The next question is whether the trial court\u2019s abuse of discretion in hearing the belated motion to compel was prejudicial to Delta. (See \u00a7 475; Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13.) As we have noted, Delta contends the error was prejudicial because the later terminating sanctions were based on Delta\u2019s \u201calleged violation\u201d of the order the trial court entered on the motion to compel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1589\">*1589</page-number>In determining whether the trial court\u2019s abuse of discretion was prejudicial, the question for us is whether it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to Delta would have been reached in the absence of the error. (See <em>Cassim </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 780, 800-802 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 374, 94 P.3d 513].) Answering this question is not (as Delta would have it) simply a matter of noting that the terminating sanctions were based (at least in part) on the order the trial court entered on the motion to compel. This is so because if the trial court had denied Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s motion to compel on the ground that the discovery motion cutoff date had passed and Pelton-Shepherd had not moved to reopen discovery\u2014i.e., if no error had occurred\u2014Pelton-Shepherd still would have had the opportunity to move to reopen discovery. The hearing on the motion to compel was on January 11, 2006, and trial was not set to begin until March 27, 2006. Faced with the denial of its motion to compel not on the merits but on this procedural basis, Pelton-Shepherd could have filed a motion to reopen discovery so that its motion to compel could be heard. Actually, given that by this time Delta had already served its responses to the inspection demands (albeit belatedly), what Pelton-Shepherd could have more reasonably chosen to do was file a motion to reopen discovery along with a motion to compel further responses to demands Nos. 18 through 21 on the ground that Delta\u2019s objections to those demands were without merit because Delta had waived those objections by failing to serve its responses in a timely manner. (See \u00a7 2031.310, subd. (a)(3) [authorizing a motion to compel further response on the ground an objection is without merit].) Had Pelton-Shepherd done so, the trial court would have been required to determine, under all of the relevant factors, whether discovery should be reopened so that Pelton-Shepherd could pursue discovery of the documents relating to Delta\u2019s manufacture and sale of gel ice products from January 2003 forward. This would have required the court to consider (among other things) the reasons Pelton-Shepherd believed it needed those documents and Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s diligence or lack of diligence in seeking the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-6\">On the record before us, it is reasonably probable the trial court would have denied Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s motion to reopen discovery. Of particular significance is the fact that while the case had been at issue since November 2003, when Pelton-Shepherd filed its answer to Delta\u2019s cross-complaint, Pelton-Shepherd waited until September 2005, less than two months before the initial trial date, to serve its inspection demands seeking discovery of the documents relating to Delta\u2019s manufacture and sale of gel ice products. The record before us contains no explanation for this delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-7\">Another significant factor is the marginal relevance of these documents. As we have noted, at the hearing on Delta\u2019s motion for relief from waiver of objections the court inquired into Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s need for the documents. Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney asserted they were relevant to Delta\u2019s cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1590\">*1590</page-number>action for breach of written contract, in which Delta sought damages for commissions Pelton-Shepherd allegedly owed but refused to pay under a contract the parties had entered into in March 2003. Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s attorney asserted that Delta was \u201csoliciting those same customers that they are complaining for damages against us\u201d and that Delta could not \u201cclaim damages against us for not being able to sell those products to those customers, while at the same time they are making the profit from [those] customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-4\">Based on Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s argument to the trial court, it is difficult to fathom the relevance of the documents Pelton-Shepherd sought in demands Nos. 18 through 21. Delta was not, as Pelton-Shepherd argued to the trial court, seeking damages against Pelton-Shepherd in its cross-complaint \u201cfor not being able to sell\u201d gel ice products to certain customers; rather, Delta was seeking damages for commissions that Pelton-Shepherd allegedly owed under a contract between the parties for products that Pelton-Shepherd was selling. Pelton-Shepherd did not explain why Delta\u2019s right to commissions for products sold by Pelton-Shepherd\u2014assuming Delta had such a right in the first place\u2014would have been affected by the fact that Delta was selling its own products to the same customers. Thus, it does not reasonably appear that documents evidencing Delta\u2019s sale of such products would have had any bearing on the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-5\">Based on the foregoing, it is reasonably probable that upon proper consideration of a motion to reopen discovery, the trial court would have determined that discovery should not be reopened simply to allow Pelton-Shepherd to belatedly pursue documents that were of little, if any, relevance to the case. And if the trial court had not reopened discovery, then there would have been no basis to impose the $2,500 in monetary sanctions on Delta and no basis to later impose terminating sanctions on Delta for engaging in \u201ca practice of misuse [of] the discovery process.\u201d By this reasoning, the trial court\u2019s abuse of discretion in considering (and granting) Pelton-Shepherd\u2019s motion to compel without first deciding whether to reopen discovery under section 2024.050 was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1398-7\">\n<em>The Motion for Relief from the Waiver of Objections</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>*</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1591\">*1591</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1399-6\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court with instructions to (1) vacate its January 10, 2007, order striking Delta\u2019s answer and dismissing Delta\u2019s cross-complaint; and (2) vacate that portion of its June 23, 2006, order imposing $2,500 in monetary sanctions on Delta.
