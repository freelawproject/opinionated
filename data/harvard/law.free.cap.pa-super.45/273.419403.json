And shortly thereafter, to wit, on or about March 30, 1908, the said John O\u2019Donnell called at the plaintiff\u2019s place of business in Philadelphia, stated that he had notice of arrival of said goods, and requested the plaintiff to procure for the defendants a bill of lading signed by the agent of said railroad company, so that, by indorsing and delivering it to the defendants\u2019 customer for whom the said goods had been ordered, their said customer might be able to get the said goods at the railroad depot. In accordance with said request the plaintiff thereupon procured said bill of lading, and on April 2, 1908, delivered the same to the defendants at their store in Philadelphia; and shortly thereafter they, the defendants, turned over the said, bill of lading to their said customer, viz.: The Chelsea Hardware Company of Atlantic City, and directed them to get the said goods at the said railroad depot, and thereupon they, the said defendants, sent their said customer their bill for the price of said goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-6\">And the plaintiff avers that the defendants, by virtue-of the facts aforesaid, accepted the goods so delivered by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Immediately following the shipment of the said goods to the defendants, to wit, on March 25, 1908, the plaintiff sent them an invoice or bill for the larger part of said goods, and a few days later, to wit, on April 6, 1908, the invoice for the balance thereof; and the defendants then and there admitted to the plaintiff the receipt of said goods, delivered as aforesaid, and made no objection to the plaintiff\u2019s bill therefor.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">This is an appeal from judgment for defendants on demurrer. The action was assumpsit for the price of goods which, by the defendants\u2019 written orders, accepted by the plaintiff, were to be shipped to one John O\u2019Donnell, who was the defendants\u2019 salesman and agent at Atlantic City, New Jersey, via the Reading Railroad. The specific reasons assigned in support of the demurrer were, (1) that the statement did not allege a sufficient delivery of the goods, (2) that it was not properly verified.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The second reason is not noticed in the appellees\u2019 brief and is not good. The plaintiff being a foreign corporation duly registered and authorized to do business in Pennsylvania, and having its Pennsylvania store and salesroom in Philadelphia, verification of the statement by the affidavit of the manager of its Philadelphia store, through which the sale was made, who was entirely familiar with the transaction, was sufficient: Erie Boot &amp; Shoe Co. v. Eichenlaub, 127 Pa. 164.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The facts relative to delivery, as averred in the statement of claim, are substantially as follows: The goods were shipped via the Pennsylvania Railroad to O\u2019Donnell at Atlantic City, where they arrived on March 28, 1908, of which fact the defendants, through their agent O\u2019Donnell, the consignee, then and there had notice, On or about March 30, O\u2019Donnell called at the plaintiff\u2019s place of business in Philadelphia, stated that he had notice of the arrival of the goods, and requested the plaintiff to procure for the defendants a bill of lading signed by the agent of the railroad company, so that by indorsing and delivering it to the defendants\u2019 customer for whom the goods had been ordered the customer would be able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>get the goods at the railroad depot. In accordance with this request the plaintiff procured the bill of lading and, on April 2, 1908, delivered it to the defendants, who shortly thereafter turned it over to their customer, the Chelsea Hardware Company, of Atlantic City, directed them to get the goods at the railroad depot, and thereupon sent them the defendants\u2019 bill for the price of the goods. The statement further averred that on March 25, 1908, an invoice or bill for the larger part of the goods, and on April 6, 1908, an invoice for the balance, were sent by the plaintiff to the defendants, and that the latter \u201cthen and there admitted the receipt of the goods delivered as aforesaid and made no objection to the plaintiff\u2019s bill therefor.\u201d The effect of the latter averment is not discussed in the paper-books, but even if it be disregarded we think the other facts alleged were sufficient to establish an acceptance of the goods, notwithstanding they were not shipped by the railroad designated in the defendants\u2019 orders. It is not pretended that the delivery to a carrier other than that named in the orders was a performance by the plaintiff of its part of the contract, or that the defendants were under obligation to accept the goods when they arrived at the depot of the carrier in Atlantic City. The risk of transportation was upon the plaintiff, and the defendants, if they had chosen to stand on their legal rights, might have awaited actual physical delivery of the goods, either at the depot of the railroad designated in the orders, or, perhaps, \u25a0 at their place of business, before accepting them. However, they did not choose to stand upon the letter of the contract, but by unequivocal acts and declarations showed their intention to waive the irregularity arising out of transportation by another railroad than that designated in their orders and to accept symbolical delivery. Not only so, but their use, with the plaintiff\u2019s assent, of the bill of lading to complete a sale they had made to a third person and to transfer to that person the control and ownership of the goods, was entirely inconsistent with the supposition that either party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>to the suit thereafter regarded the ownership of the goods as being in the plaintiff. The actual receipt of the bill of lading or other document of title to goods may be equivalent to that of the goods themselves: Burdick on Sales, 75, citing Currie v. Anderson, 2 E. &amp; E. 592; and if the circumstances under which it was delivered, accepted and used show that such was the intention of the parties, it is the equivalent. The principle is thus stated in 1 Benjamin on Sales (6th Am. ed.), sec. 148: \u201cA dealing with goods so as to justify a jury in finding a constructive acceptance may take place as effectively with the bill of lading which represents the goods as with the goods themselves.\u201d .This statement of the principle is supported by reason and authority. Applying it here it sustains the averment of the statement of claim \u201cthat the defendants, by virtue of the facts aforesaid, accepted the goods so delivered by the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\">The judgment is reversed and judgment is entered in favor of the plaintiff for $430.20, with interest on said sum from May 6, 1908, and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
