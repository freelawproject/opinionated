The pole was leaning toward the public road, and was about four feet out of line. In accordance with the orders of the foreman, plaintiff climbed it, and, having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>wrapped the wire twice around, put a clamp upon it; but, before he had finished, the men below were ordered to pull the pole up, and, as they did so, the end of the wire, which was made into what was called a cat\u2019s claw or half hitch, gave way, the pole lurched back, and threw the plaintiff off into the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Auz\">It was admitted that linemen, engaged in work such as the plaintiff was then doing, are required to provide themselves with safety belts, and that the plaintiff had and used one on the day of the accident. This belt is fastened around the body, and the end, being passed around the pole, is hooked, and its purpose is to prevent the user from being thrown off the' pole. At the time the men pulled the pole, the plaintiff\u2019s safety belt was unstrapped, and the facts relating to his use of it on that day can be briefly extracted from his testimony. He stated that he had clamped the bolt and was finishing the end of the guy wire when he heard the word \"Pull.\u201d He was then asked:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-4\">\u201c Q. How long before you had finished your work had you unstrapped your safety belt? A. Just about the time I was unstrapping it, this order was given. Q. At the time the order was given, you were finishing the ends? A. Just about had finished and unhooked my safety belt. Q. You said, a minute ago, that, while you were finishing the ends, you heard the word 'Puli\u2019 given. A. Yes, sir. Q. So that you hadn\u2019t taken your hands off the wire, and were working with the ends, when you heard the word 'Puli\u2019 given, didn\u2019t you? A. That is what I said. Q. And, then, after you heard the word 'Puli\u2019 given, you unstrapped your safety belt, didn\u2019t you? A. They started to pull before-Q. Just answer my question. Didn\u2019t you do that, after you heard the word 'Puli\u2019 given, while you were working with the ends of the wire? Didn\u2019t you. A. Yes, sir. Q. So that you knew an order had been given to pull, and, after that was given, you unstrapped your safety belt? A. Just unstrapped and came down. Q. You unstrapped it after you had heard the word 'Puli\u2019 given? A. But I had no chance to get down. They pulled. Q. Won\u2019t you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>just answer my question? Isn\u2019t that the fact, that, while you were still working, finishing the ends, you heard the word 'Puli\u2019 given? A. Yes, sir. Q. Now, you hadn\u2019t unstrapped your safety belt while you were finishing the ends, had you? A. I had just unstrapped and ready to come down. Q. And you unstrapped it after you heard him say ' Pull \u2019? A. \u2018 Pull,\u2019 yes, sir, and he pulled me to the ground.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-3\">The court overruled defendant\u2019s motion n. o. v.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b420-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b420-5\"><em>William H.

The point was refused and the motion for judgment n. o. v. was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Did the plaintiff\u2019s case, as presented, show him guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>of contributory negligence in such a way as to compel the court to declare, as a matter of law, that he was guilty?</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\">In the discharge of his duties as an employee of the defendant company, the plaintiff .was necessarily compelled to ascend telephone poles after their erection and to work thereon in attaching guy ropes, as he was doing at the time of the accident, and for other purposes. In order to provide for his safety while doing this work, he was furnished with, and had in his possession and use at the time of the accident, spurs fastened to his legs which could be driven into the pole and afford support for his person while at work. In addition to this, he had what was called a safety belt which was also attached to the pole but did not bind him closely to it, but enabled him to swing clear of the pole, in order to have a sufficient distance between him and it to enable him to work in fastening the ends of the guy wires which he was engaged in attaching to the pole at the time of the accident. It seems to be assumed by the appellant that at or immediately before the accident the plaintiff had detached his safety belt from the pole and, when the attempt was made by the defendant\u2019s other employees to straighten the pole, which was several feet from the perpendicular, by the application of rope and tackle, some slip occurred by which the pole flew back and threw the plaintiff from the hold which he had with his spurs and he was injured by the fall to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The appellant seems to assume that, if the safety belt had been attached to the pole at the time of the \"pull,\u201d as it is called, the accident would not have happened. This is probably true as to the particular form which the accident assumed, namely, the fall to the ground, but it may be doubted, in view of the character of the belt and its object, whether an accident equally serious, or more so, might not have occurred by bringing the plaintiff into quick and injurious contact with the pole, and it by no means follows that, if the fall had been averted, the contact with the pole would not have been quite as severe, or more so, than the fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The question, therefore, it seems to us, .was for the jury, even upon this phase of the case, but we are not satisfied that it was not also for the jury as to whether or not the plaintiff was negligent in loosing the belt at or about the time that his work was finished. It was his duty to descend, when his work was done. He unloosed the belt, as he says, because he was about through with his work. He heard the order of the foreman \u201cPull!\u201d about the time that the belt was unloosed. Was it before, or at the time of, or after, the unloosing of the belt that the order was given? If afterwards, had he time to refasten his belt to the pole before the pull was made? This is not by any means clear from the testimony, and we do not see how the court could have said, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence in loosing his belt. It was for the jury, and there is no fault alleged with the charge of the court in the manner of leaving the question for their consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\">There is no assignment of any portion of the charge for error and the single question, as raised by both the assignments, was, Could the court, as matter of law, say to the jury, or say after the finding of the jury, that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence? We think the case was not such as enabled the court to say this, and it was, therefore, correct in refusing the defendant\u2019s point, and also in discharging the rule for judgment, notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
