He left his home on the outskirts of Frederick, Maryland, on the morning of Saturday, March 12, 1994, to run various errands in his BMW automobile. Lee made several stops, one of which was at a car wash at a gas station. Sometime later he noticed that his car\u2019s front license plate was missing. He correctly surmised that the plate had come off at the car wash, and he returned to the gas station to retrieve it. Lee found that the license plate was mangled so that he was unable to reattach it to his car. He placed the plate on the rear floor of the automobile behind the driver\u2019s seat, and resumed his errands.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">At about 3:00 p.m. on March 12th, while Lee was still running errands, he observed a police car, with overhead lights activated, following his car. When he pulled over, Frederick County Deputy Sheriff Gary Cline approached Lee\u2019s car and asked Lee to present his driver\u2019s license and automobile registration card. Lee did so, and asked Cline the reason for the stop. When Cline responded that the front license plate was not on Lee\u2019s automobile, Lee explained that the plate had fallen off at the car wash and showed Cline the mangled plate.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Deputy Sheriff Cline then asked Lee if he would consent to Cline searching the vehicle for illegal narcotics and weapons. Lee refused to consent to the search, and Cline retorted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"av-dedup-0\">\u201cI don\u2019t need your permission to search the car. I can get dogs in here and search it without your permission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Lee still refused to consent to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Next, Cline took Lee\u2019s driver\u2019s license and registration card, returned to his police car, and contacted by radio the Frederick County Emergency Communications Center. Cline provided the radio dispatcher with Lee\u2019s license plate number in order to check its status. According to the radio dispatch tape of the incident, this initial call from Cline to the dispatcher was at 3:11 p.m. About two minutes later, the dispatcher called Cline and informed Cline that the license plate was valid and would not expire until later in the year.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>About a minute after being told that the license plate was valid, Cline again called the dispatcher and requested that the dispatcher \u201clocate a canine [unit] and start him my way.\u201d The dispatcher replied that no canine units were available to send to that location. Two minutes later, however, at 3:16 p.m., the dispatcher contacted Cline and informed the deputy sheriff that a State Police canine unit was nearby and available. Cline requested that the canine unit be sent to his location, stating (emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">\u201cI\u2019ve got a <em>suspect </em>not being too cooperative. Already told me there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to give me consent to search. Go ahead and start this way please.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Cline also asked the dispatcher about Lee\u2019s driving record and arrest warrant status. At 3:17 p.m., the dispatcher informed Cline that Lee\u2019s driver's license was valid, that Lee had no points, that Lee was not wanted by the police, and that he had never been involved with the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The radio dispatch tape discloses that, at 3:22 p.m., a second deputy sheriff, Officer Henry, reported to the dispatcher \u201cthat he was on the scene as backup.\u201d Shortly thereafter, while Officers Cline and Henry were engaged in a conversation at the side of Cline\u2019s police car, Lee got out of his vehicle and stood by the front of his vehicle. According to Lee\u2019s deposition, he \u201chad been sitting there [in the vehicle] for a good while. [His] legs were getting ... tired.\u201d Lee continued: \u201cThen, after about 30 seconds, Officer Cline yelled, get back in your car,\u201d and Lee got back into the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">A Maryland State Police trooper arrived on the scene at 3:30 p.m., with a dog. The trooper asked Lee if he had any drugs in the car, and Lee replied that he did not. The State trooper then circled Lee\u2019s ear with the trooper\u2019s dog and indicated that there was no sign of drugs. The trooper then put the dog back in the State police vehicle and left. Following the departure of the State trooper, Cline gave Lee two warning tickets, which Lee signed. Cline returned Lee\u2019s driver\u2019s license and registration card, and Lee left the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The radio dispatch tape shows that Cline reported the stop \u201ccleared\u201d at 3:42 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Lee filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Frederick County against Deputy Sheriff Gary Cline, Frederick County Sheriff James W. Hagy, the Maryland State Police, Maryland State Police trooper Eric Fogle, and the County Commissioners of Frederick County. Lee alleged \u201cthat he was detained and searched because of a Frederick County Sheriffs Department practice which targets African-American males driving expensive cars. Such drivers allegedly fit the Department\u2019s drug courier \u2018profile.\u2019 \u201d The complaint went on to state that \u201c[a]t no time did defendants ... Cline or ... Fogle have probable cause, reasonable ... suspicion or any ground, to believe that a crime had been committed or that the Plaintiff was carrying drugs [of] any kind.\u201d Lee claimed that Cline and Fogle were guilty of an unreasonable search and seizure, that the police officers unlawfully detained and imprisoned him, and that the officers \u201cintentionally discriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of race and failed to afford him equal protection of the law.\u201d Lee asserted that the Frederick County Commissioners were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">\u201caware of the Frederick County Sheriffs Department policy of utilizing a race-based drug courier profile and a policy of stereo-typing African-American males in late model luxury automobiles as \u2018suspicious\u2019 and criminal and these Defendants provide manpower and other resources in support of the Frederick County Sheriffs race-based policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Lee further alleged that the violations of his rights were knowing and \u201cintentional, extreme, outrageous, and intolerable and offend[ed] generally accepted standards of decency, morality and fairness, and ... caused Plaintiff to suffer embarrassment, mental anguish and emotional distress.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Count I of Lee\u2019s original complaint charged a violation of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; he asserted that the stop violated his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>ments to the United States Constitution. In the next count, Lee alleged that the defendants\u2019 actions violated his rights under the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The remaining counts in the original complaint were non-constitutional common law claims of false imprisonment, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Lee filed in the Circuit Court two amended complaints, adding a count sounding in negligence and a count charging a \u201cViolation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d and 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.104(b)(2). He also asserted that the \u201cDefendants\u2019 acts were done with malice [and] deliberate indifference to and in knowing violation of Plaintiffs\u2019 legal and constitutional rights----\u201d In addition, Lee alleged that the Maryland State Police officer\u2019s canine was a \u201clarge ferocious looking canine [which] caused Plaintiff to believe that he was not free to leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Following a ruling by the Circuit Court that, for several reasons, there was no basis for the asserted causes of action against Maryland State Police trooper Fogle and the Maryland State Police, Lee\u2019s second amended complaint abandoned his claims against those two defendants. Finally, Lee sought compensatory and punitive damages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Next, the remaining defendants removed the case from the Circuit Court for Frederick County to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. Following discovery, various motions, other pleadings, and memoranda, the United States District Court dismissed the state law claims against Sheriff Hagy and the Frederick County Commissioners, granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the counts based upon federal law <em>{i.e., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964), and declined to hear the counts against Cline based upon the Maryland Declaration of Rights and Maryland common law. The case was returned to the Circuit Court for Frederick County.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">The defendant Cline then filed in the Circuit Court a motion for summary judgment which the court granted. The Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Court held that there had been no violation of Lee\u2019s state constitutional rights, that Cline had qualified immunity under the Maryland Tort Claims Act with regard to the non-constitutional tort claims, and that the plaintiff had presented no evidence of malice to overcome Cline\u2019s qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Lee appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed, although the intermediate appellate court\u2019s reasoning differed somewhat from that of the Circuit Court. <em>Lee v. Cline, </em>149 Md.App. 38, 814 A.2d 86 (2002). The Court of Special Appeals held that the Circuit Court erred in deciding that there was no triable issue with regard to the claimed violation of Lee\u2019s state constitutional rights. <em>Lee v. Cline, supra, </em>149 Md.App. at 50-63, 814 A.2d at 93-101. The intermediate appellate court summarized (149 Md.App. at 63, 814 A.2d at 101):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">\u201cWe hold that there were material disputes regarding whether Cline prolonged Lee\u2019s traffic stop while awaiting the arrival of the canine unit. In concluding that there was no evidence of a constitutional violation, the circuit court disregarded Lee\u2019s version of events and accepted Cline\u2019s, even though Cline could not remember anything about this particular traffic stop. That was error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Nevertheless, the Court of Special Appeals held that the qualified immunity granted to state personnel, including deputy sheriffs, by the Maryland Tort Claims Act, \u201cgrant[ed] qualified immunity to State personnel on all types of tort claims,\u201d including \u201cstate constitutional torts\u201d and intentional torts. 149 Md.App. at 65, 814 A.2d at 102. <em>See </em>Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-105 of the State Government Article, and Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol., 2004 Supp.), \u00a7 5-522(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>cial Appeals went on to hold that \u201c[w]e find no error in the circuit court\u2019s holding that Lee failed to proffer sufficient evidence of malice to overcome Cline\u2019s qualified immunity.\u201d 149 Md.App. at 89, 814 A.2d at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Lee filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari which presented the following three questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u201cI. Whether the Court of Special Appeals err[ed] in holding that [, under the Maryland Tort Claims Act,] Officer Cline had qualified immunity against state constitutional violations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">\u201cII. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that [, under the Maryland Tort claims Act,] Officer Cline had qualified immunity against state common law intentional torts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">\u201cHI. WTiether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that there was insufficient evidence of malice to overcome any qualified immunity possessed by Officer Cline.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">Cline did not file a cross-petition for a writ of certiorari challenging the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that Lee had presented sufficient evidence of a violation of his state constitutional rights to generate a triable issue. This Court granted Lee\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, <em>Lee v. Cline, </em>374 Md. 82, 821 A.2d 370 (2003). Our order granting the petition neither limited the issues nor added any issues. Accordingly, the only issues before us are the three questions presented by Lee\u2019s certiorari petition. Maryland Rule 8 \u2014 131(b)(1); <em>R.A. Ponte Architects, Ltd. v. Investors\u2019 Alert Inc., </em>382 Md. 689, 694 n. 3, 857 A.2d 1, 3-4 n. 3 (2004); <em>Edwards v. Corbin, </em>379 Md. 278, 287 n. 5, 841 A.2d 845, 850 n. 5 (2004), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">We shall consider Lee\u2019s first two questions together, namely whether the Maryland Tort Claims Act grants qualified immunity to state personnel for tortious acts or omissions, within the scope of the state employees\u2019 public duties, when those acts or omissions involve violations of state constitutional rights or constitute so-called \u201cintentional\u201d torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">With one major exception not involved in the present case, the immunity granted to state personnel by the Maryland Tort Claims Act is generally co-extensive with the coverage of the statute. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5-522(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. If this case had involved the language of the Maryland Tort Claims Act as it existed prior to July 1, 1985, Lee\u2019s argument would have considerable merit. His argument, however, finds no support in the present statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">The General Assembly originally enacted the Maryland Tort Claims Act by Ch. 298 of the Acts of 1981, waiving the State\u2019s governmental immunity with respect to six categories of claims. These six categories were limited to specific types of negligence actions such as the negligent operation or maintenance of a motor vehicle, negligence by a state health care employee, defective conditions in state structures or property, and negligent actions by state employees in state parks or recreation facilities. These six categories would not have encompassed intentional torts or tort actions based upon constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Nevertheless, by Ch. 538 of the Acts of 1985, effective July 1, 1985, the coverage of the Tort Claims Act was broadened to include tort actions generally, with certain specified exceptions and limitations. Section 12-104(a)(l) of the State Government Article now provides that \u201cthe immunity of the State and of its units is waived as to a tort action, in a court of the State.... \u201d Neither intentional torts (in the absence of malice), nor torts based upon constitutional violations, are excluded. In fact, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>1989 bill (House Bill 364), which would have excluded constitutional torts, did not pass. This history was summarized in <em>Ritchie v. Donnelly, </em>324 Md. 344, 374 n. 14, 597 A.2d 432, 447 n. 14 (1991), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">\u201cAs a result of 1985 amendments to the Maryland Tort Claims Act, the statute does not exclude specified categories of torts except claims arising \u2018from the combatant activities of the State Militia during a state of emergency/ \u00a7 5-399.2(a)(3) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Otherwise, \u2018tort actions generally1 are encompassed, <em>Simpson v. Moore, </em>323 Md. 215, 219, 592 A.2d 1090, 1092 (1991), as long as the state employee\u2019s actions were not malicious, grossly negligent, or outside the scope of employment, <em>Boyer v. State, supra, </em>323 Md. at 579, n. 14, 594 A.2d at 131, n. 14; <em>Sawyer v. Humphries, </em>322 Md. 247, 253, 587 A.2d 467, 470 (1991). House Bill 364 of the 1989 Session of the General Assembly would have provided that \u2018[ijmmunity is not waived\u2019 under the Maryland Tort Claims Act for \u2018any state ... constitutional claim.\u2019 In the course of the bill\u2019s legislative process, this provision was amended out. Ultimately House Bill 364 did not pass.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\"><em>See also, e.g., Shoemaker v. Smith, </em>353 Md. 143, 156-158, 725 A.2d 549, 556-557 (1999); <em>Condon v. State of Maryland, </em>332 Md. 481, 492-493, 632 A.2d 753, 758-759 (1993); <em>Sawyer v. Humphries, </em>322 Md. 247, 253-254, 587 A.2d 467-470 (1991); <em>Rucker v. Harford County, </em>316 Md. 275, 297-302, 558 A.2d 399, 409-412 (1989); <em>Clea v. Mayor and City of Baltimore, </em>312 Md. 662, 671, 541 A.2d 1303, 1307 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The current language of the Maryland Tort Claims Act plainly appears to cover intentional torts and constitutional torts as long as they were committed within the scope of state employment and without malice or gross negligence. There are no exceptions in the statute for intentional torts or torts based upon violations of the Maryland Constitution. This Court has been most reluctant to recognize exceptions in a statute when there is no basis for the exceptions in the statutory language. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Connor v. Baltimore County, </em>382 Md. 102, 113, 854 A.2d 1191, 1198 (2004) (\u201cWhen interpret<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>ing a statute, we assign the words their ordinary and natural meaning. * * * We will not ... \u2018judicially insert language to impose exceptions, limitations or restrictions not set forth by the legislature\u2019 \u201d); <em>Nesbit v. GEICO, </em>382 Md. 65, 75, 854 A.2d 879, 885 (2004); <em>Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 477, 842 A.2d 743, 746 (2004); <em>Salamon v. Progressive Classic Insurance Company, </em>379 Md. 301, 311-316, 841 A.2d 858, 865-868 (2004); <em>Piscatelli v. Board of Liquor License Commissioners, </em>378 Md. 623, 630-633, 837 A.2d 931, 936 (2003); <em>Blind Industries and Services of Maryland v.

Geiger, </em>371 Md. 125, 142, 807 A.2d 32, 42 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">While this Court has not, until today, directly decided whether intentional torts and constitutional torts are covered by the Maryland Tort Claims Act, thereby granting state personnel qualified immunity for such torts, our prior opinions do support such coverage. <em>See Larsen v. Chinwuba, </em>377 Md. 92, 99, 107-109, 832 A.2d 193, 196, 201-202 (2003) (A tort action against the Insurance Commissioner setting forth causes of action for defamation, invasion of privacy, abuse of process, and violation of rights guaranteed by the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and this Court held that the Commissioner was entitled to immunity under the Maryland Tort Claims Act, although the issue before the Court concerned scope of employment rather than the basic coverage of the statute); <em>Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 757 A.2d 118 (2000) (A tort action against state governmental officials based upon allegations of various common law intentional torts, violations of the federal constitution, and violations of the state constitution, and the issues included (1) the sufficiency of the evidence to show malice, thereby defeating Maryland Tort Claims Act immunity, (2) liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, and (3) the inapplicability of the public official immunity doctrine to state constitutional torts; the Court held, <em>inter alia, </em>that there was sufficient evidence of malice to defeat Maryland Tort Claims Act immunity, although no other issue was raised regarding the coverage of the Act); <em>DiPino v. Davis, </em>354 Md. 18, 49-56, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>729 A.2d 354, 370-374 (1999) (Holding that there was coverage under the Local Government Tort Claims Act for certain intentional and constitutional torts): <em>Ashton v.

There are sound reasons for the strict limitations upon the doctrine of public official immunity, and those reasons have little or no applicability to the statutory immunity granted by the Tort Claims Act. Consequently, judicial opinions dealing with the well-established limitations upon public official immunity furnish no authority for judicially creating similar limitations upon the broad statutory immunity granted by the Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The purpose of the Maryland public official immunity principle is to insure that a public <em>official </em>(and not just any government employee), in the performance of \u201can important <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>public duty,\u201d \u201c \u2018has the freedom and authority to make decisions and choices.\u2019 \u201d <em>James v. Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>288 Md. at 324, 326, 418 A.2d at 1178, 1179, in part quoting <em>Clark v. Ferling, </em>220 Md. 109, 113, 151 A.2d 137, 139 (1959). The principle is aimed at permitting a public official to \u201c \u2018act according to one\u2019s judgment in the absence of a hard and fast rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>James, </em>288 Md. at 326, 418 A.2d at 1179, quoting <em>Schneider v. Hawkins, </em>179 Md. 21, 25,16 A.2d 861, 864 (1940). Thus, the situation where public official immunity is applicable involves a tort claim based upon alleged mis-judgment or a negligent exercise of judgment by a public official. The doctrine is intended to be a defense against claims that a \u201cbetter choice\u201d could have been made by an official. This defense is inherently related to actions based on negligence. Most alleged \u201cintentional torts,\u201d on the other hand, do not involve legitimate public policy choices or actions \u201c \u2018in the absence of a hard and fast rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>James, </em>288 Md. at 326, 418 A.2d at 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The immunity under the Maryland Tort Claims Act, however, is not inherently related to negligence actions in contrast to intentional tort actions. The purpose of the Tort Claims Act\u2019s immunity is not simply to protect judgmental decisions by officials. Instead, the purpose of the Tort Claims Act\u2019s immunity is to insulate state employees generally from tort liability if their actions are within the scope of employment and without malice or gross negligence. This broader purpose fully applies to non-malicious intentional torts and constitutional torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">There is another reason, justifying the strict limitations upon public official immunity, which is inapplicable to statutory immunity under the Maryland Tort Claims Act. The principle of public official immunity is not, and has never been, tied to a waiver of sovereign or governmental immunity. Under circumstances where sovereign or governmental immunity is applicable, and where public official immunity is also applicable, the person injured by governmental tortious conduct \"will have no remedy. For this reason, any significant expansion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>public official immunity might well present serious constitutional problems under Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Nevertheless, with regard to torts encompassed by the Maryland Tort Claims Act, the statute generally waives sovereign or governmental immunity and substitutes the liability of the State for the liability of the state employee committing the tort. Accordingly, where the immunity of the Tort Claims Act is applicable, the injured party will ordinarily be able to recover against the State as long as he or she complies with the procedural requirements of the Tort Claims Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The above-discussed distinction between public official immunity and Tort Claims Act immunity is particularly significant with regard to constitutional torts. This Court\u2019s holdings, that public official immunity is inapplicable in actions against public officials for violations of plaintiffs\u2019 rights guaranteed by the state constitution, is based squarely upon Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. In <em>Clea v. City of Baltimore, supra, </em>312 Md. at 680-681, 541 A.2d at 1312, we reviewed the seminal Maryland case concerning this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-7\">\u201cThe matter of a public official\u2019s immunity from damages for a constitutional violation was apparently first ruled upon by the Court in <em>Weyler v. Gibson, supra, </em>110 Md. 636, 73 A. 261. In that case, an enlargement of the Maryland Penitentiary encroached upon the plaintiffs\u2019 land, and the plaintiffs brought an action for damages against, among others, the Warden of the Maryland Penitentiary. With regard to the Warden\u2019s argument that he was entitled to the immunity of the State (110 Md. at 653, 73 A. 261), this Court responded as follows <em>(id. </em>at 653-654, 73 A. 261):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>\u2018JUDGE DILLON, in his work on the <em>Laws and Jurisprudence of Eng. &amp; Am., </em>207, said: \u201cThat all of the original States in their first Constitutions and Charters provided for the security of private property, as well as life and liberty. This they did either by adopting, in terms, the famous thirty-ninth article of Magna Charta which secures the people from arbitrary imprisonment and arbitrary spoliation, or by claiming for themselves, compendiously, all of the liberties and rights set forth in the great Charter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">\u2018Our Declaration of Rights (Article 19) declares that every man for any injury done to him in his person or his property ought to have remedy by the course of the law of the land, and (Article 23) [now Article 24] that no man ought to be deprived of his property, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land, and section 40, Article 3 of the Constitution prohibits the passing of any law authorizing private property to be taken for public use, without just compensation as agreed between the parties, or awarded by a jury, being first paid or tendered to the party entitled to such compensation.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">\u201cAfter pointing out that the \u2018immunity of the State from suit ... [is] firmly fixed in our law,\u2019 this Court continued <em>(id. </em>at 654, 541 A.2d 1303):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">\u2018But it would be strange indeed, in the face of the solemn constitutional guarantees, which place private property among the fundamental and indestructible rights of the citizen, if this principle could be extended and applied so as to preclude him from prosecuting an action ... against a State Official unjustly and wrongfully withholding property. ...\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">\u201cThus, the Court in <em>Weyler </em>flatly refused to extend the State\u2019s governmental immunity to a public official violating the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights, including those under Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The Court in <em>Ashton v.

The test is one of reasonableness. We recently summarized the applicable principle as follows <em>(Dua v. Comcast Cable, supra, </em>370 Md. at 644, 805 A.2d at 1084-1085):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">\u201cThis Court\u2019s opinions have also made it clear that Article 19 provides a measure of constitutional protection even for causes of action which are not based on constitutional rights.... <em>See, e.g., Robinson v.

Maryland State Police, </em>331 Md. 285, 297, 628 A.2d 162, 168 (1993)....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Nevertheless, with regard to both constitutional and non-constitutional torts, we have</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">\u201cheld that \u2018the Legislature may ordinarily substitute a statutory remedy, including a statutory administrative and judicial review remedy, for a common law remedy without violating Article 19 of the Declaration of Rights,\u2019 <em>Robinson v. Bunch, supra, </em>367 Md. at 446-447, 788 A.2d at 645.\u201d <em>Piselli </em>371 Md. at 207, 808 A.2d at 519.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Earlier, in <em>Ritchie v. Donnelly, supra, </em>324 Md. at 374 n. 14, 597 A.2d at 446-447 n. 14, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">\u201cThe General Assembly, however, could provide that the State will be liable for damages resulting from state constitutional torts such as those alleged by the plaintiff in this case, and that the individual employee will be immune. In other words, the Legislature may substitute state liability for individual employee liability. The Legislature has done precisely this, under certain circumstances, in the Maryland Tort Claims Act, Code (1984, 1991 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 through 12-110 of the State Government Article; Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol., 1991 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 5-399.2 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>sheriff of a county is a state employee within the meaning of the statute, \u00a7 12-101(6) of the State Government Article; <em>Boyer v. State, </em>323 Md. 558, 572, 594 A.2d 121 (1991); <em>Rucker v. Harford County, </em>316 Md. 275, 281, 558 A.2d 399, 402 (1989).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Consequently, because of Article 19 of the Declaration of Rights, there is a substantial difference between public official immunity and the immunity granted by the Maryland Tort Claims Act. Article 19 precludes the application of public official immunity to constitutional torts. The same constitutional provision may operate to restrict an expansion of public official immunity with respect to non-constitutional torts if the restriction is held to be unreasonable. Article 19, however, does allow substitution of governmental liability in place of the liability of government-employed tortfeasors. Therefore, at least to the extent that the Maryland Tort Claims Act substitutes the liability of the State for the liability of the state employee committing a tort, the requirements of Article 19 are satisfied. This distinction between public official immunity and Tort Claims Act immunity fully justifies the difference in scope between the former and the latter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">For all of the above-discussed reasons, we hold that the immunity under the Maryland Tort Claims Act, if otherwise applicable, encompasses constitutional torts and intentional torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Although we agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding regarding the type of torts covered by the Tort Claims Act\u2019s immunity provisions, we disagree with the intermediate appellate court\u2019s holding that there was insufficient evidence of malice to generate a triable issue. Viewing the evidence and the inferences therefrom in a light most favorable to the plaintiff Lee, we believe that there was sufficient evidence of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">One of the earliest cases that examined the issue of malice in the contest of qualified immunity granted by the Maryland Tort Claims Act was <em>Sawyer v. Humphries, supra, </em>322 Md. 247, 587 A.2d 467. In that case, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendant, a state police officer, while off-duty, threw rocks at their car, and attacked one of the occupants. The trial court held that the officer was immune from suit under the Maryland Tort Claims Act, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. This Court reversed that judgment, <em>Sawyer v. Humphries, </em>322 Md. at 261, 587 A.2d at 474, pointing out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoJ\">\u201c[w]hen someone, without provocation or cause, throws rocks at two other persons, he is obviously demonstrating ill will towards those persons. Wrestling another to the ground, pulling his hair, and hitting him on the face, again without cause or provocation, is certainly malicious conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">A comprehensive discussion of malice, in the context of the Maryland Tort Claims Act, is found in <em>Shoemaker v. Smith, supra, </em>353 Md. 143, 725 A.2d 549. In <em>Shoemaker, </em>two St. Mary\u2019s County sheriffs deputies were sued by a family after the deputies had forcibly removed the family\u2019s two minor sons from their home during an investigation by the St. Maiy\u2019s County Department of Social Services of allegations of child abuse. Judge Wilner, writing for the Court, explained (353 Md. at 161, 163-164, 725 A.2d at 558-559, 560):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-8\">\u201c[T]he General Assembly ... clearly and expressly retained a subjective element for immunity purposes. * * * The Legislature had decided that, when State personnel act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>maliciously, they, and not the State, must bear the risk. The predominant and laudable public policy is to discourage State personnel from acting with malice in the performance of their public duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">* ' * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">\u201cThe Court of Special Appeals has long applied ... some standard of \u2018actual malice\u2019 in defining \u2018malice\u2019 for the purposes of ... immunity under ... State and local tort claims laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">\u201cThis, we believe is the appropriate test \u2014 the one the Legislature intended to be applied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">\u201cActual malice,\u201d in Maryland law, normally refers \u201cto conduct \u2018characterized by evil or wrongful motive, intent to injure, knowing and deliberate wrongdoing, ill-will or fraud____\u2019 \u201d <em>Shoemaker v. Smith, supra, </em>353 Md. at 163, 725 A.2d at 559, quoting <em>Montgomery Ward v. Wilson, </em>339 Md. 701, 728-729 n. 5, 664 A.2d 916, 929 n. 5 (1995). The motive can exist even when \u201cthe conduct is objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Shoemaker, </em>353 Md. at 164, 725 A.2d at 560. This definition of malice was applied by this Court in <em>Okwa v. Harper, supra, </em>360 Md. at 181-182, 757 A.2d at 129, where Judge Harrell, writing for the Court, said (emphasis supplied):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-11\">\u201cBased on Appellees\u201d version of the story, a fact finder, if given the opportunity, could conclude that Appellees acted without malice and did not commit the act of battery while arresting Mr. Okwa. The fact finder could find that any injuries suffered by Mr. Okwa were the product of his own resistive and combative efforts. Apparently this is the version of events that the trial judge opted to believe. The trial judge necessarily determined Appellees\u2019 accounts of the alteration to be more credible and based his ruling on them. This was an error. The summary judgment process is not properly an opportunity for the trial court to give credence to certain facts and refuse to credit others. <em>See Pittman v. Atlantic Realty Co., </em>359 Md. 513, 537, 754 A.2d 1030, 1042-1043 (2000) (citations omitted) (the trial judge is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>not permitted to weigh evidence in deciding a motion for summary judgment); <em>Sheets v. Brethren Mid. Ins. Co., </em>342 Md. at 638, 679 A.2d at 542 (\u201c[i]n granting a motion for summary judgment, the trial court does not resolve factual disputes, but instead is limited to ruling as a matter of law\u201d); <em>Dobbins v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n, </em>338 Md. 341, 345, 658 A.2d 675, 677 (1995) (\u201cthe trial court does not determine facts, but instead rules on the motion [for summary judgment] as a matter of law\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">\u201cIf a fact finder believed Mr. Okwa\u2019s rendition of the incident, however, it could infer reasonably that Appellees were motivated by an improper motive or that they had an affirmative intent to bring harm to Mr. Okwa. <em>See Shoemaker, </em>353 Md. at 164, 725 A.2d at 560. It would not be unreasonable for a fact finder to infer that Appellees were motivated by an extreme and overzealous desire to punish Mr. Okwa for failing to obey immediately their instructions to walk away from the ticket counter and exit the terminal. <em>The alleged fact, if believed, </em>that police officers beat a citizen about his head and neck while they twisted his thumbs, <em>could support an inference that Appellees were inspired with malicious intention. </em>Such behavior fits the type of conduct which would strip the actor\u2019s immunity otherwise provided under the MTCA.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Thus, intent and motive are critical to the question of malice. In the instant case, the question raised for the purposes of immunity under the Maryland Tort Claims Act is whether a jury could reasonably find that Cline\u2019s conduct, given all the circumstances, was \u201cmotivated by ill will\u201d or \u201cby an improper motive.\u201d <em>Shoemaker, </em>353 Md. at 164, 725 A.2d at 560. The case at bar is somewhat similar to the <em>Okwa </em>case with regard to the inferences which a jury might properly draw.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Lee\u2019s claim of malice is based on the following facts and inferences which are to be drawn in his favor. The traffic stop took far longer than warranted. Both parties\u2019 experts testified that the stop should have taken no more than fifteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>minutes. There is evidence in the record that Cline had completed similar stops in a shorter period of time, of between four and ten minutes. The record indicates that Cline had the information he needed to write the tickets within six minutes of the stop. Nonetheless, the stop took approximately forty minutes. During that time, Lee was clearly under arrest; Cline\u2019s order that Lee \u201cget back\u201d in the car reinforces this.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Cline requested the canine \u201csearch\u201d after Lee declined to consent to the search of his vehicle, when there was utterly no evidence in the record justifying such a \u201csearch\u201d of the vehicle. Lee was driving with a valid license; he had no points or restrictions on his license, and was not wanted by the police. Lee had a reasonable and valid explanation for driving without a license plate, which was the initial justification for the stop. Nonetheless, Cline referred to Lee as a \u201csuspect,\u201d without any reason to label him as such. Cline told the dispatcher that Lee was not \u201ccooperative.\u201d A jury might reasonably infer that the only factors which motivated Cline\u2019s calling Lee an uncooperative \u201csuspect\u201d were that Lee was an African-American male driving a luxury car who refused to consent to a search.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Lee argues, and we agree, that a \u201cjury could infer ... that Deputy Cline deliberately prolonged the stop because ... Lee refused to consent to a search of his car.\u201d (Petitioner\u2019s brief at 16). Cline\u2019s request to search Lee\u2019s automobile when there was no basis for such a search, Cline\u2019s retort that he could search the vehicle without Lee\u2019s permission, Cline\u2019s insistence on obtaining a canine unit, Cline\u2019s \u201cyelling\u201d at Lee to get back into the car, the length of the stop, and Cline\u2019s reference to Lee as an uncooperative suspect, taken together, could support an inference of ill-will on the part of Cline. A jury issue with regard to malice was generated.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

The common law public official immunity doctrine has to some extent been codified in Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol., 2004 Supp.), \u00a7\u00a7 5-507(b)(1) and 5-511(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.

There is one issue regarding the impact of Article 19 upon Maryland Tort Claims Act immunity which has not been raised in this case, which is not likely presented by the facts of the case, and upon which we intimate no opinion. The Tort Claims Act, in \u00a7 12-104(a)(2) of the State Government Article, caps the State\u2019s liability at $200,000, but the Act, in \u00a7 5-522(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, grants total immunity to state personnel for torts \u201cfor which the State or its units have waived immunity ... even if the damages exceed the [monetary] limits of that waiver.\u201d Whether Article 19 of the Declaration of Rights precludes the grant of immunity to state personnel, to the extent that damages exceed $200,000, is an issue which has not previously been decided by the Court. As indicated above, we express no opinion on the issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
