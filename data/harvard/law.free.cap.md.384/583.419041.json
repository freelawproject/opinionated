The Maryland Tax Court and the Circuit Court for Talbot County held that the Comptroller may not assess Maryland estate tax in such circumstances. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Since 1926, the federal government has shared estate tax revenue with states through an eighty percent credit for state death taxes, now codified as I.R.C. \u00a7 2011 (2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Page v. Comptroller, </em>270 Md. 725, 729, 313 A.2d 691, 693 (1974). The General Assembly enacted the Maryland estate tax in 1929, 1929 Md. Laws Chap. 275, to take advantage of this federal revenue sharing. <em>See Page, </em>270 Md. at 729, 313 A.2d at 693. As such, the Maryland estate tax, unlike the Maryland inheritance tax, is linked directly to the federal estate tax. In <em>Comptroller v. Jameson, </em>332 Md. 723, 633 A.2d 93 (1993), we provided an overview of the interplay between these three taxes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-8\">\u201cThe United States imposes a federal estate tax which is payable nine months after death. On the federal estate tax return, estates are permitted to claim a credit, up to a specified amount, for state death taxes actually paid to any of the fifty states. This credit is a method of revenue sharing in which the federal government is diverting some federal estate tax revenue to the states.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>\u201cThe Maryland inheritance tax is a tax imposed on the privilege of receiving property. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1988) \u00a7 7-202 of the Tax-General Article----The Maryland inheritance tax is not integrated with the federal estate tax; in other words, the calculation of the Maryland inheritance tax is not dependant upon the federal estate tax system in any way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-6\">\u201cOn the other hand, the Maryland estate tax is completely integrated with the federal estate tax. The structure of the Maryland estate tax is referred to as a \u2018pick-up\u2019 tax. This means that, if the federal credit for state death taxes allowable by the Internal Revenue Code exceeds the Maryland inheritance tax, an estate must pay Maryland estate tax to pick up the difference between the credit and the state inheritance tax. Stated more succinctly, the inheritance tax is deducted from the federal estate tax credit to determine the amount of Maryland estate tax. By providing for full use of the federal credit for state death taxes, the Maryland estate tax statute shifts taxes that would otherwise be paid to the federal government to the state treasury....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 725-26, 633 A.2d at 94 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">Appellant is Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland, an official charged with, <em>inter alia, </em>the duty to assess and collect Maryland estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">Appellee is executor of the estate of Donald P. Ross, Jr. (\u201cdecedent\u201d), a Delaware resident who died on June 30, 2000. The majority of decedent\u2019s estate was located outside Maryland, but he left a one-third, undivided interest in real property known as 6523 Shingle Row Road in Royal Oak, Talbot County. The date-of-death value of this interest was $1,750,000. Decedent also left a one-third interest in the tangible property located at that address. The date-of-death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>value of the tangible property for federal estate tax purposes was $29,058.67.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">Pursuant to decedent\u2019s will, his interest in the Maryland tangible property passed to his issue, per stirpes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The residue of decedent\u2019s estate, which included his interest in the Maryland real property, passed to a trust established on November 1,1999 (the \u201c1999 Trust\u201d). Under the terms of the 1999 Trust, the residue of the estate was distributed immediately into two new trusts: the \u201cMarital Trust\u201d and the \u201cResiduary Trust.\u201d The amount of property to be set aside in the Marital Trust was specified as follows in the 1999 Declaration of Trust:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-5\">\u201cTrustee shall set aside, as the \u2018Marital Trust,\u2019 property with the smallest aggregate value needed to reduce Trustor\u2019s federal estate tax to the lowest possible amount after taking into account all credits and deductions against such tax available to Trustor\u2019s estate, except to the extent that the use of any such credit (other than the unified credit) would increase state death taxes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Accordingly, sufficient assets were distributed from the 1999 Trust into the Marital Trust to reduce decedent\u2019s federal estate tax liability to zero. Among these assets was the Maryland real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Decedent\u2019s mother, Wilhelmina duPont Ross, predeceased her son by only five days. From her estate, decedent inherited assets valued at $5,030,307.86. Because Wilhelmina Ross predeceased decedent by less than two years, decedent\u2019s estate was entitled to a $2,263,471.57 credit for tax on prior transfers under I.R.C. \u00a7 2013 (2004).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This credit exceeded all federal estate taxes owed on the inherited assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">On behalf of decedent\u2019s estate, appellee filed a United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return (\u201cForm 706\u201d) on October 1, 2001. On Form 706, appellee made, <em>inter alia, </em>the following entries:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-7\">\u201c10.

Appellee filed a Protest, setting out a legal argument in support of his computation of zero Maryland estate tax liability. Appellant subsequently sent appellee an Assessment for the deficient tax plus interest,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and appellee appealed to the Maryland Tax Court (an administrative agency).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Tax Court held a hearing on November 14, 2002 and issued an oral decision reversing the Assessment, finding that no Maryland estate tax was due. The Tax Court issued an order to this effect on April 1, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Appellant sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Talbot County. Judge William S. Horne held a hearing on November 21, 2003 and issued an opinion affirming the Tax Court on December 8, 2003. Appellant next appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Before that court could consider the case, we granted certiorari on our own initiative to resolve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>an area of confusion in Maryland estate tax law. 381 Md. 677, 851 A.2d 596 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">On appeal, appellant raises one issue: whether the Maryland Comptroller may assess state estate tax against an estate that has no federal estate tax liability due to its utilization of the federal credit for tax on prior transfers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">This case raises only an issue of law, as the parties agreed to a stipulation of facts before the Tax Court. When this Court reviews an administrative agency\u2019s decision, we employ the same statutory standards as would the Circuit Court; the inquiry is whether the administrative agency erred, not whether the Circuit Court erred. <em>See Spencer v. State Board of Pharmacy, </em>380 Md. 515, 523-24, 846 A.2d 341, 346 (2004). Under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Md.Code (1984, 2004 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-222 of the State Government Article, we determine the correctness of the agency\u2019s legal conclusions and may substitute our judgment for that of the agency. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(i)-(iv); <em>see Charles County v. Vann, </em>382 Md. 286, 295, 855 A.2d 313, 319 (2004). Specifically, in reviewing questions of law answered by the Tax Court, we have said that \u201ca reviewing court is under no statutory constraints in reversing a Tax Court order which is premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>Comptroller v. Gannett, </em>356 Md. 699, 707, 741 A.2d 1130, 1135 (1999) quoting <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Md. 825, 834, 490 A.2d 1296, 1301 (1985). We have held, though, that agency legal interpretations of the statute it administers are entitled to some deference. <em>See Vann, </em>382 Md. at 295-96, 855 A.2d at 319.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Determining whether the Comptroller may assess estate tax in this case depends upon an interpretation of the Maryland statute defining the relationship between federal and state estate taxes: Md.Code (1988, 1997 Repl.VoL., 2001 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 7-304 of the Tax-General Article. The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature. <em>Collins v. State, </em>383 Md. 684, 688, 861 A.2d 727, 730 (2004). In ascertaining legislative intent, we first examine the plain language of the statute. <em>Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 476-77, 842 A.2d 743, 746 (2004). We do not examine the plain language in isolation. Rather, we consider the particular and broad objectives of the legislation and the overall purpose of the statutory scheme. <em>See Handy v. State, </em>357 Md. 685, 705, 745 A.2d 1107, 1117 (2000) (quoting <em>Rose v. Fox Pool, </em>335 Md. 351, 359, 643 A.2d 906, 910 (1994) and cases cited therein). If the plain language of the statute is unambiguous and is consistent with the statute\u2019s apparent purpose, we give effect to the statute as it is written. <em>See Melton, </em>379 Md. at 477, 842 A.2d at 746. When there is more than one reasonable interpretation of a statute, the statute is ambiguous. <em>Melton, </em>379 Md. at 477, 842 A.2d at 746. If the statutory language is ambiguous or unclear, we look to legislative history, prior case law, and statutory purpose. <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484, 487 (2004). The statute must be construed as a whole so that no word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. <em>Rose, </em>335 Md. at 359, 643 A.2d at 909-910.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">\n<em>Positions of the Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">The parties present divergent interpretations of \u00a7 7-304.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Section 7-304 provides:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-5\">\u201c(a) <em>\u2018Federal credit\u2019 defined. </em>\u2014 In this section, \u2018federal credit\u2019 means the maximum credit for death taxes paid to any state that is allowable under \u00a7 2011 of the Internal Revenue Code against the federal estate tax of a decedent as reduced by the proportion that the amount of the estate not included in the Maryland estate bears to the amount of the entire estate of the decedent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-6\">\u201c(b) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 (1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the Maryland estate tax is the amount, if any, by which the federal credit exceeds the total of death taxes other than the Maryland estate tax that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-7\">(i) are imposed by a state on property included in the Maryland estate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-8\">(ii) are allowable in computing the federal credit; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-9\">(iii) except as provided in \u00a7 13-906 of this article, have actually been paid out of the Maryland estate and received by the appropriate unit of this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-10\">(2) The Maryland estate tax may not exceed the amount whose timely payment in accordance with federal law would reduce the amount of the federal estate tax payable out of the Maryland estate had this subtitle not been enacted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>\u201c(c) <em>Failure to take full federal credit. </em>\u2014 The Maryland estate tax is not affected by a failure to take or preserve the federal credit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">According to appellant, \u00a7 7-304(c) mandates that an estate must pay state estate tax regardless of whether the estate claimed the federal credit for state death taxes. Appellant views \u00a7 7-304(c) as dictating that appellee\u2019s choice to take the federal credit for tax on prior transfers instead of the credit for state death taxes has no bearing on the Maryland estate tax. In other words, the Maryland estate tax is based on the <em>potential </em>state death taxes credit, rather than the actual state death taxes credit taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">First, appellant asserts that the plain meaning of \u00a7 7-304(c) is that the estate\u2019s choice to take another credit on the federal Form 706 is irrelevant for Maryland estate tax purposes. Second, appellant argues that \u201callowable\u201d in \u00a7 7-304(a) means potential, further indicating that \u00a7 7-304(e) should be interpreted as making irrelevant whether the estate actually took the federal credit. Finally, appellant cites as support a statement we made in <em>Jameson </em>about the meaning of \u00a7 7-304(c): \u201cThe plain meaning of this sentence is that Maryland estate tax is calculated based upon what the maximum federal credit available to the estate is; not on what the executor of the estate chooses to claim as a federal credit.\u201d 332 Md. at 738, 633 A.2d at 100.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant maintains that this sentence evinces our adoption of appellant\u2019s position that the executor\u2019s choice is irrelevant for determining whether to assess Maryland estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Appellant argues that \u00a7 7-304(b)(2) does not contradict its interpretation of the statute. Appellant sees \u00a7 7 \u2014 304(b)(2) as a counterpart to \u00a7 2011(e) of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 2011(e) states: \u201cThe credit provided by this section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>shall not exceed the amount of the tax imposed by section 2001, reduced by the amount of the unified credit provided by section 2010.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 2011(e) (2004). In other words, \u00a7 2011(e) mandates that the state death taxes credit may not exceed the federal estate tax. According to appellant, \u00a7 7-304(b)(2) plays the same role; when the calculation of the state death taxes credit is greater than the federal estate tax, the Comptroller cannot assess a state estate tax greater than the federal estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Appellee responds by interpreting \u00a7 7-304 to impose Maryland estate tax only when federal estate tax liability exists. Appellee interprets the statute as creating a distinction between: (1) the amount \u201callowable\u201d as the federal credit under the \u00a7 7-304(a)\u2019s definition, and (2) the maximum estate tax that the Comptroller may impose under \u00a7 7-304(b)(2). While the calculation of the Maryland estate tax is determined by employing \u00a7 7-304(b)(l)\u2019s arithmetic formula using the \u201callowable\u201d amount of the federal credit, \u00a7 7-304(b)(2) adds that the Comptroller may not impose the estate tax unless the state death taxes credit reduces the federal estate tax. In other words, \u00a7 7-304(b)(2) mandates appellee\u2019s position that the Comptroller may not assess a Maryland estate tax when the estate owed no federal estate tax even without taking the state death taxes credit. Appellee\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 7-304(c) is based on his interpretation of \u00a7 7-304(b)(2). He asserts that \u00a7 7-304(c)\u2019s instruction to disregard an estate\u2019s failure to take the credit only applies when federal estate tax liability exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">A. <em>Purpose of the Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">While the specific issue we address in this case is a matter of first impression in Maryland, we have reviewed \u00a7 7-304 and its predecessor on a number of occasions. <em>See, e.g., Comptroller v. Jameson, </em>332 Md. 723, 633 A.2d 93 (1993); <em>Page v. Comptroller, </em>270 Md. 725, 313 A.2d 691 (1974); <em>Comptroller v. Davidson, </em>234 Md. 269, 199 A.2d 360 (1964); <em>Cross v. Downes, </em>164 Md. 216, 164 A. 758 (1933). We will review in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>depth our decision in <em>Jameson, </em>as our analysis in that case of the purpose and structure of the Maryland estate tax is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">In <em>Jameson, </em>the estate failed to file its Maryland estate tax return by the filing deadline. The estate did file its federal estate tax return and claimed the state death taxes credit. Subsequently, the estate filed its two Maryland inheritance tax returns and paid the taxes due. Months later, and more than two years overdue, the estate filed its Maryland estate tax return. As the state inheritance taxes exceeded the state death taxes credit taken, the estate calculated that it owed no Maryland estate tax.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Comptroller, though, assessed the estate for interest on the unpaid estate tax covering the time until the inheritance tax was paid, as there was estate tax liability until the inheritance taxes reduced the liability to zero. 332 Md. at 726-28, 633 A.2d at 94-95. We held that the Comptroller could collect interest on the late payment of state estate tax, even though the subsequent payment of state inheritance taxes eliminated the original estate tax liability. <em>Id. </em>at 740, 633 A.2d at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">In reaching this holding, we analyzed the structure and purpose of what is now \u00a7 7-304. As quoted <em>supra, </em>we defined the Maryland estate tax as a \u201cpick-up\u201d tax with its purpose to \u201cshift! ] taxes that would otherwise be paid to the federal government to the state treasury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 726, 633 A.2d at 94. <em>See generally Estate of Fasken, </em>19 Cal.3d 412, 138 Cal.Rptr. 276, 563 P.2d 832 (1977) (en banc) (detailing in great depth the history of the federal state death taxes credit and state estate taxes designed to \u201cpick-up\u201d the credit). We noted that the Maryland statute provides for \u201cfull use\u201d of the federal credit. <em>Jameson, </em>332 Md. at 726, 633 A.2d at 94. Thus, the Maryland estate tax is not an additional tax. Rather, it takes full advantage of federal revenue sharing by capturing the maximum amount of estate tax revenue that the federal govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>ment authorizes. <em>See </em>Robert A. Rombro &amp; Bonnie A. Travie-so, <em>Maryland Death Taxes, in </em>1 <em>Maryland Taxes </em>\u00a7 5.52 (MICPEL 2001) (noting that \u201cThe Maryland estate tax is not an additional tax imposed on the taxpayer, since it only causes to be paid to the state, rather than the federal government, the difference between the inheritance tax paid to any state and the maximum credit allowable by the federal statute with respect to death taxes paid to any state\u201d); H. Vernon Eney, <em>Death and Taxes </em>\u2014 Maryland <em>Style, </em>17 Md. L.Rev. 101, 111 (1957) (noting that \u201cThe Maryland estate tax is, therefore, not an additional tax at all since it is carved out of the Federal estate tax\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Applying <em>Jameson </em>to the case <em>sub judice, </em>we conclude that appellant\u2019s position is inconsistent with the purpose of \u00a7 7-304. Maryland\u2019s estate tax is integrated completely with the federal estate tax; it is a \u201cpick-up\u201d tax calculated by subtracting the other state death taxes from the federal state death taxes credit. This integrated structure reflects the credit\u2019s purpose of diverting some federal estate tax revenue to the states and \u00a7 7-304\u2019s purpose of capturing that revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Appellant would assess Maryland estate tax even when an estate has no federal estate tax liability and, consequently, has not taken the federal credit for state death taxes. In other words, in situations in which an estate has no federal liability, appellant would transform Maryland\u2019s estate tax from a revenue sharing instrument that does not increase the estate\u2019s tax burden into a new tax. That position is inconsistent with the integrated relationship between the federal and state taxes. Simply put, Maryland cannot benefit from revenue sharing when there is no revenue to share. In the absence of statuto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>ry authorization, the Comptroller may not transform \u00a7 7-304 into a tax increase. To hold otherwise would ignore the Maryland estate tax\u2019s purpose of accepting the federal government\u2019s offer to share revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">B. <em>Statutory Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Appellant\u2019s reading of \u201callowable\u201d in \u00a7 7-804(a) as \u201cpotential\u201d is contrary to the plain language of the statute. There is no reason to believe that the word \u201callowable\u201d is meant to remove the federal state death taxes credit and the Maryland estate tax from the role of revenue sharing instruments. Appellant only can reach this strained result by viewing \u201callowable\u201d as an isolated word. The entire phrase reads: \u201c \u2018federal credit\u2019 means the maximum credit for death taxes paid to any state that is allowable under \u00a7 2011 of the Internal Revenue Code against the federal estate tax of a decedent.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The plain meaning of this phrase is that calculating the Maryland estate tax under \u00a7 7-304(b)(l)\u2019s formula requires using as much of the federal state death taxes credit as federal law permits. The purpose of the provision is to ensure that the State picks up the entire amount made available to it by the federal credit. When no federal estate tax is owed, because the estate has taken the tax on prior transfers credit or for any other reason, then there is no state death taxes credit \u201callowable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Our reading of \u00a7 7-304(a) is compelled by the phrase \u201cagainst the federal estate tax of a decedent.\u201d Appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>interpretation of \u00a7 7-304(a) ignores this phrase. This phrase indicates that the federal credit should not be viewed as an abstract figure; instead, it must be seen as a sum redistributed from the federal estate tax. <em>See Riethmann Trust v. Dir. of Revenue, 62 </em>S.W.3d 46, 48 (Mo.2001) (en banc) (holding that near identical language in the Missouri statute \u201csuggests that in order to be obligated to pay the state\u2019s tax, some federal tax must be assessed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">As with \u00a7 7-304(a), we can understand \u00a7 7-304(b)(2) by looking at its plain language. Section 7-304(b)(2) states, \u201cThe Maryland estate tax may not exceed the amount whose timely payment in accordance with federal law would reduce the amount of the federal estate tax payable out of the Maryland estate had this subtitle not been enacted.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The plain language of this subsection is that the Maryland estate tax may not be greater than the additional federal estate tax an estate would owe were there not a state death taxes credit. Thus, the subsection mandates a calculation of what the federal estate tax liability would be without the credit for state death taxes. That the federal estate tax liability without the credit for state death taxes is reduced by another credit is irrelevant under this subsection. In this case, in the absence of a state death taxes credit, the estate would have owed no federal estate tax. Accordingly, \u00a7 7-304(b)(2) precludes appellant from assessing appellee Maryland estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Unlike \u00a7\u00a7 7-S04(a) and (b)(2), \u00a7 7-304(c) is ambiguous. Appellant reads \u00a7 7-304(c) as stating that an estate\u2019s decision to take another federal credit instead of the credit for state death taxes does not affect the Maryland estate tax. Appellee reads the section as stating that when an estate has federal estate tax liability, its failure to take or preserve the federal credit does not affect the Maryland estate tax. Viewed without reference to the legislative history, both parties\u2019 interpretations are reasonable. We, thus, look to the legislative history of \u00a7 7-304(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">In this pursuit, we are aided again by <em>Jameson. </em>In <em>Jame-son, </em>we analyzed the meaning and purpose of \u00a7 7-304(c) in response to one of the Jameson estate\u2019s arguments. The Jameson estate argued that since it had not paid the Maryland inheritance taxes at the time it paid its federal estate tax, a tax preparer had to enter zero as the amount of federal state death taxes credit available. The estate continued that as there was no federal credit \u201callowable,\u201d it owed no Maryland estate tax and could not be ordered to pay interest. 332 Md. at 737-38, 633 A.2d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Our response to the estate\u2019s argument was based on our determination that \u00a7 7-304(c) was passed to prevent such attempts to avoid estate tax through the timing of filing the respective inheritance and estate tax forms. We disagreed with the estate\u2019s argument about the effect of the timing of payment, holding that the General Assembly directly rejected the argument through its enactment of what is now \u00a7 7-304(c). We stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-6\">\u201cAlthough the above creative reasoning may have at one time had some merit, a 1978 amendment to Article 62A, \u00a7 2 clearly rejected this approach. <em>See </em>Acts of 1978, ch. 109. In House Bill 220, which became chapter 109, the legislature closed this potential loophole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 738, 633 A.2d at 100. After quoting the language of \u00a7 7-304(c), we noted that the plain meaning of the provision is that the Maryland estate tax is calculated based on the maximum federal credit available to the estate, not based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>\u201cwhat the executor of the estate chooses to claim as a federal credit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">That our observation was limited to the timing of estates filing returns is clear from the following few sentences, in which we discussed the legislative history of 1978 Md. Laws, Chap. 109. For example, we quoted a House Ways and Means Committee finding that the provision would ensure that \u201c \u2018the State will never again reimburse an individual who fails to submit the claim for the federal tax credit on time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, <em>Jameson </em>provides no basis for interpreting \u00a7 7-304(c) to authorize Maryland estate tax when an estate has no federal estate tax liability without utilizing the state death taxes credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">A review of the available legislative history of the 1978 amendment makes clear that \u00a7 7-304(c) was adopted to address timing problems. There is no indication in the committee bill file for House Bill 220, which became Chapter 109, that the committee even considered the issue of when there is no federal estate tax liability without utilizing the state death taxes credit. Instead, the file makes clear that the bill aimed to prevent the <em>timing </em>of the estate\u2019s filings from having any impact on the state estate tax. In a letter to the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, an official from the Comptroller\u2019s office explained the rationale for the bill:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">\u201cAn incident occurred whereby I.R.S. disallowed a credit due to a technicality of timely filing under the Federal regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-7\">\u201cSince the credit was not allowed by I.R.S., the personal representative filed with the State of Maryland, for refund of the tax that was paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-8\">\u201cThe Maryland Tax Court upheld the refund of the taxes paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-9\">\u201cThe Attorney General\u2019s office recommended the changes suggested in House Bill 220. The amount of the Maryland Estate tax payable under this section is not altered, diminished, or affected in any way by the failure of the estate\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>representative to properly take and preserve the maximum state death tax credit allowable under Federal law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Letter from B.T. Stehley, Chief of the Miscellaneous Revenue Division, Comptroller of the Treasury, to the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee (Feb. 2, 1978).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, the bill\u2019s purpose was to address a specific case requiring the State to refund the state estate tax, because the estate\u2019s representative had made a filing error in the federal returns\u2014 <em>i.e. </em>had failed to \u201cpreserve the federal credit\u201d as stated in \u00a7 7-304(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">That \u00a7 7-304(c) prevents estates\u2019 timing failures from having an effect on the calculation of the Maryland estate tax is further supported by a review of the \u201cCommittee Findings\u201d section of the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s report summarizing House Bill 220. We quoted these Committee Findings in part in <em>Jameson. </em>332 Md. at 738, 633 A.2d at 100. The entire Committee Findings consisted of two sections: (1) a \u201cPresent Situation\u201d section which briefly summarized the integrated relationship between the federal and state estate taxes and quoted part of Stehley\u2019s letter, and (2) a \u201cWith Bills Passage\u201d section which stated in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-7\">\u201cFailure of an individual to file for the Federal tax credit will in no way alter, diminish or affect the amount of the Maryland Estate Tax due.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-8\">\u201cIn other words, the State will never again reimburse an individual who fails to submit the claim for the tax credit on time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">House Ways and Means Committee, House Bill 220 (1978). The first sentence paraphrases the wording of the amendment. The second sentence defines that wording as preventing an estate\u2019s untimely filings from costing the State revenue from the federal government. In sum, \u00a7 7-304(e) provides no support for appellant\u2019s position that an estate is liable for state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>estate tax even when the estate is not liable for federal estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">After interpreting each provision, we must ensure that our construction of \u00a7 7-304 as a whole does not render any of its parts superfluous or meaningless. Considering all the provisions together, \u00a7 7-304 is a coherent whole. Together, \u00a7 7-304(a), (b), and (c) provide that the Maryland estate tax picks up the entire amount that the federal credit on state death taxes redistributes to the State \u2014 no more, no less. Subsection (a) states that Maryland picks up the full amount of the federal credit; (b)(1) provides the formula for calculating the tax, subtracting other death taxes; (b)(2) limits the Maryland estate tax to the federal credit; and (c) ensures that an estate\u2019s failures cannot cost the State revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">After reviewing the purpose and the meaning of the statute, we reject appellant\u2019s position. Accordingly, we hold that when an estate has no federal estate tax liability, without utilizing the federal credit for state death taxes, the Comptroller may not assess the estate Maryland estate taxes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Our holding is consistent with the holdings of other states addressing this issue. The facts in each of these cases are near identical to the facts of this case. In each case, a decedent inherited assets from a relative or friend less than two years before the decedent died. The decedent\u2019s estate representative claimed a credit for tax on prior transfers on the federal estate tax return, resulting in zero federal estate tax liability. With no liability, the estate did not claim the federal credit for state death taxes. The Comptroller then assessed the estate state estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>In <em>Riethmann Trust v. Dir. of Revenue, </em>62 S.W.3d 46 (2001) (en banc), the Missouri Supreme Court applied a statute with similar wording to the Maryland statute<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and reached the same result as we do. Based on the state estate tax\u2019s purpose of picking up the federal credit, the court concluded that \u201cthe overall tax liability of the estate is not increased by Missouri law; the state only gets to take a piece of the federal tax pie.\u201d 62 S.W.3d at 47. The court then held that the term \u201callowable\u201d meant \u201cthe amount of credit permitted against the actual federal estate tax payable after all other credits are taken <em>...\u201d Id. </em>at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The court offered a series of rationales for its holding. First, the clear legislative purpose was to ensure \u201cthe state shared in the federal tax pie,\u201d not to create a new tax. <em>Id. </em>Second, as cited <em>supra, </em>by augmenting \u201callowable\u201d with \u201cagainst the federal estate tax,\u201d the legislature expressed its intent that federal tax must be assessed in order for their to be a state estate tax. <em>Id. </em>Third, under Missouri law, an ambiguous statute imposing a tax normally is construed in favor of the taxpayer and against the State. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">In <em>In re Estate of Lacks, </em>255 Mich.App. 555, 662 N.W.2d 54 (2003), the Michigan Court of Appeals also reached the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>conclusion based on a statute with similar language.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> After noting that Michigan\u2019s estate tax was a pick-up tax and that the federal credit for tax on prior transfers is unrelated to the credit for state death taxes, <em>Id. </em>at 56, 58, the court held that \u201crespondent\u2019s position that state estate tax should be computed before and independent of federal deductions or credits is clearly contrary to our state and federal estate tax scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">In <em>Dickinson v. Maurer, </em>229 So.2d 247 (1969), the Florida Supreme Court reviewed the State\u2019s constitutional provision authorizing Florida estate pick-up taxes<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the statute implementing the provision.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court held that these provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>sions were intended to avail Florida of the federal credit\u2019s revenue sharing \u201cwithout increasing by one jot or one title the total tax burden\u201d on Florida estates. <em>Id. </em>at 249 (citation omitted).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">Similarly, in <em>Estate of Turner v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, </em>106 Wash.2d 649, 724 P.2d 1013 (1986) (en banc), the Washington Supreme Court held that a voter initiative authorizing the Washington estate tax was intended as a pick-up tax, and, thus, the state estate tax applied only to estates required to pay federal estate tax.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1016. To hold otherwise, the court reasoned, would defeat the revenue sharing purpose of the pick-up tax and would increase the estate\u2019s tax obligations. <em>Id. See also New York Trust Co. v. Doubleday, </em>144 Conn. 134, 128 A.2d 192, 197 (1956) (holding that a widow who had no federal estate tax liability because of the federal marital deduction had no state estate tax liability, since \u201cour statute incorporates within itself the provisions of the federal estate tax statute, governing the computation of the federal estate tax, including all of the provisions of the latter statute for exemptions and deductions\u201d).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>But see Estate of Eberbach v.

In <em>Estate of Kelly v. Commissioner of Revenue, </em>1991 WL 278273, the Minnesota Tax Court held that an estate was liable for Minnesota estate tax even though the tax on prior transfers credit had eliminated all federal estate tax liability.

We are not persuaded that the relied upon language supports the Minnesota Tax Court\u2019s conclusion. In any case, the Maryland statute does not contain the language relied upon by the Minnesota Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR TALBOT COUNTY AFFIRMED.

We also find persuasive the Missouri Supreme Court's response to the State's argument that the state death taxes credit must be taken before the tax on prior transfers credit, because the state death taxes credit is listed above the tax on prior transfers credit on the federal estate tax form, Form 706. The court responded that the order on the form is irrelevant, as the federal government \"does not care\u201d which credit an estate takes, and the order on the federal form reveals nothing about the state legislature's intent. <em>Riethmann Trust v.
