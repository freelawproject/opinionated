Because we find that the communications between Elsa Newman [hereinafter \u201cNewman\u201d] and her former attorney, Stephen Friedman [hereinafter \u201cFriedman\u201d], at issue in the present case fall within the attorney-client privilege and are not subject to the crime-fraud exception, we reverse the decision by the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case to the Circuit Court for a new trial. As guidance for the trial court on remand, we also will address whether the curative instruction adequately dispelled the prejudice caused by eliciting improper testimony about the exercise of Newman\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"APG\">A. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">Newman and Arlen Slobodow [hereinafter \u201cSlobodow\u201d] married in 1990, and thereafter they had two sons together, Lars and Herbie. In 1999, Newman\u2019s marriage to Slobodow deteriorated and the couple began divorce and custody proceedings in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland during which Newman was represented by Friedman. During the course of Friedman\u2019s representation of Newman in the spring of 2001, Friedman asked Newman\u2019s close friend, Margery Landry [hereinafter \u201cLandry\u201d], to be present in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>meetings with Newman for a \u201ccool head in the room.\u201d Landry and Newman discussed various plans involving harming Newman\u2019s children and blaming Slobodow while in Friedman\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">On August 31, 2001, Newman met with Friedman in preparation for a custody hearing on September 4, 2001 before Circuit Court Judge James Ryan. At one point during her meeting with Friedman, Newman stated, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t have to kill both children. I only need to kill Lars because I can save Herbie, and then Arlen [Slobodow] will go to jail and get what he deserves because he is a criminal, and I can at least save Herbie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Friedman disclosed to Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge Louise Scrivener the statements made by Newman the previous Friday. After Judge Scrivener informed Judge James Ryan of Friedman\u2019s disclosure, Judge Ryan announced the substance of Friedman\u2019s disclosure during the custody hearing on September 4, 2001. Newman was granted supervised visitation and Friedman\u2019s appearance as her counsel of record was stricken. The trial on the merits was postponed until December 7, 2001, and then again to January 28, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Prior to the trial on the merits, on January 7, 2002, at approximately 3:30 a.m., Landry entered Slobodow\u2019s house through an unlocked basement window carrying pornographic materials and a Smith and Wesson 9MM handgun. In Slobo-dow\u2019s bedroom, she found him asleep in bed and fired two shots hitting Slobodow once in the right leg. Slobodow struggled with Landry, pulling off her mask, and Landry fled the bedroom. Slobodow went downstairs, was attacked once more by Landry, and during the altercation bit Landry\u2019s finger. Landry left the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">Later that morning, Montgomery County Police arrested Landry at her home. On January 9, 2002, the State of Maryland filed charges against Newman for conspiracy to commit first degree murder and conspiracy to commit assault in the first degree, and Newman was arrested the following day. Thereafter, Landry pled guilty to assault, burglary, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>reckless endangerment, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, and obliterating the serial number on a gun. On December 17, 2002, she was sentenced to fifty years imprisonment, with all but twenty years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">B. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">On April 4, 2002, Newman appeared in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland and entered a plea of not guilty. On June 28, 2002, the Circuit Court held a pretrial hearing in which it considered the State\u2019s oral Motion in Limine to compel Friedman to testify about the matters that he had disclosed to Judge Scrivener. The State called Friedman to the stand. Newman requested that the court clear the courtroom prior to Friedman\u2019s testimony to preserve the confidentiality of Friedman\u2019s testimony prior to the court\u2019s ruling on its status under the attorney-client privilege. After the judge rejected that request, Newman asserted that the attorney-client privilege precluded Friedman\u2019s testimony, for which she was granted a standing objection. At the close of Friedman\u2019s testimony concerning his relationship with Newman and the content of his disclosure to Judge Scrivener pursuant to Rule 1.6 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the court ruled that Friedman acted reasonably in disclosing \u00d1ewman\u2019s statements under Rule 1.6 and that his disclosure obviated Newman\u2019s attorney-client privilege regarding the disclosed statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>On August 2, 2002, the State called Friedman to the stand at Newman\u2019s trial. Under court order, Friedman testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">STATE: When \u2014 during that period of time from two to seven, aside from the break that you took, was there anyone else meeting \u2014 or in the room with you and Ms. Newman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC\">FRIEDMAN: I think I spared Ms. Rogers [his secretary] and let her do something else. She probably popped in and out, but mostly it was just me and Ms. Newman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">FRIEDMAN: She had stopped being in a rage, got very quiet, very thoughtful, and tilted her head a little, and her eyes rolled up, and spoke in a voice different from her normal voice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-7\">STATE: What did she say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">FRIEDMAN: She said, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t have to kill both children. I only need to kill Lars because I can save Herbie, and then Arlen will go to jail and get what he deserves because he is a criminal, and at least I can save Herbie.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">STATE: What was your response when she said this to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">FRIEDMAN: Well, this had been going on all day \u2014 actually it had been going on for two years. What I said to her is what I would say to her in the past, and that is, \u201cMs. Newman, this is like talking about a bomb in the airport.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAq\">\u201cThere are consequences when you say things like that. You cannot involve me in a murder case, and you need to convince me , that you are just frustrated, and angry, and scared to death,\u201d and Ms. Newman was just scared to death before trial. She would be so scared she couldn\u2019t prepare for trial. I think that is why she was firing me, she wouldn\u2019t come in to meet with me because she was so horrified of going to court, that is what I wanted to rationalize, and I said, \u201cYou need to convince me that you are just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>upset \u2014 not say it, you need to convince me, or otherwise, I am going to tell Judge Ryan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">STATE: About how many times do you think she told you that she was considering killing Arlen [Slobodow]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2B\">FRIEDMAN: She and Margery [Landry] literally sat in front of me in my office and conspired to do it, that is why I had to bar Margery from coming into my office<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">STATE: When did that happen, Mr. Friedman?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH\">FRIEDMAN: It happened twice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">STATE: And could you tell us about that conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-l\">FRIEDMAN: Elsa and Margery would sit in my office\u2014 and I invit[ed] Margery into the conversations because I wanted what I thought would be a cool head in the room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">FRIEDMAN: The first time it happened I was reading a report, and they literally sat there, and Elsa was terribly distraught because it was during a time where \u2014 and they do this is the District of Columbia \u2014 I mean it is almost ex parte \u2014 in the District of Columbia if somebody swears out an abuse allegation, they take your kids away from you, and they say, \u201cWell, you can have a hearing in three to six months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-10\">Well, in his case Elsa was in terrible agony because they gave the kids to the person that she was convinced was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>sexually abusing them, and if she was right, this was a monstrous screw up in the system, and they wouldn\u2019t give us a hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-5\">So she is very distraught over this, and as I said, I cut women in this \u2014 I represent abused women, and this is some of the worst kind of abuse, and I cut people a lot of slack because I expect them to be appropriately very emotionally distraught, and she would sit there \u2014 and she sat there in front of me, and I was reading a report about something, and she was talking to Margie about shooting him and framing Arlen, and I will have to have an excuse \u2014 you know if \u2014 you know, should I do it, or how should we do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">Should we hire someone, and she said, \u201cNo. No. Ru-thann<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> said always do it [yourself] because when you try and hire somebody, you get caught.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">(Footnotes added). Newman once again asserted that the attorney-client privilege precluded the admission of Friedman\u2019s testimony, which the court rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">During the trial, the State also called Detective Mercer, the officer who arrested Newman, to testify in its case in chief, and asked her, \u201cAnd what rights did you advise [Newman] of?\u201d Detective Mercer responded, \u201cThat she had the right to remain silent, she had the right to an attorney. At which time she advised that she would like to consult with an attorney. Actually, she had an attorney waiting in the station lobby for her.\u201d Newman objected and moved for a mistrial. The trial court denied her motion and instead gave the jury the following curative instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">You have heard testimony that Elsa Newman was accompanied by an attorney when she appeared at the police station on January 10, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">This is not evidence to be considered by you. Ms. Newman is presumed to be innocent of the charges against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>her. You have heard evidence that Ms. Newman\u2019s ex-husband, Arlen Slobodow, was shot on January 7, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">Ms. Newman\u2019s house was searched following the shooting. She was aware of all this on January 10, 2002. It is fully consistent with the presumption of innocence that anyone under these circumstances would appear and consult with an attorney at the police station to protect his or her interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">On August 6, 2002, the jury found Newman guilty of conspiracy to commit first degree murder, attempted first degree murder, assault in the first degree, burglary in the first degree, and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. Newman filed a motion for a new trial, which the court denied. On January 24, 2003, Newman received four concurrent sentences of twenty years, one concurrent sentence of fifteen years, and upon release is required to serve five years supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Newman filed a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. She presented eight issues for review in the Court of Special Appeals including the denial of Newman\u2019s motion to disqualify the Montgomery County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, the admission of Friedman\u2019s testimony, the denial of Newman\u2019s requested voir dire concerning bias, denial of Newman\u2019s motion for mistrial due to improper testimony concerning her <em>Miranda </em>rights, the admission of character evidence in the State\u2019s case in chief, the denial of Newman\u2019s requested jury instructions, the denial of Newman\u2019s motion for new trial, and the sufficiency of the evidence to convict Newman on any of the counts. <em>Newman v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 20, 30, 845 A.2d 71, 77 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, held that Friedman\u2019s testimony was admissible under the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege because Newman evidenced an intent to commit future crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 49, 845 A.2d at 88. Moreover, the court determined that based on Friedman\u2019s two-year relationship with Newman and his role as an officer of the court, the State presented sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>evidence to establish that the statements expressed Newman\u2019s intended future acts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The court also concluded that the prejudice caused by the improper testimony of Detective Mercer that Newman was advised of her rights under <em>Miranda </em>and that Newman\u2019s attorney was awaiting her at the station was cured. <em>Id. </em>at 57, 845 A.2d at 93. After examining the facts of this case, the court determined that the prejudice caused by the reference to Newman\u2019s exercise of her <em>Miranda </em>rights did not exceed the curative instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 59-60, 845 A.2d at 94. Therefore, it held that the prejudice suffered by Newman was cured by the trial court\u2019s instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 60, 845 A.2d at 94-95. The Court of Special Appeals concluded, after analyzing the remaining six issues presented, that none constituted reversible error and affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>See generally Newman v. State, </em>156 Md.App. 20, 845 A.2d 71 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">We granted Newman\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, <em>Newman v. State, </em>381 Md. 674, 851 A.2d 593 (2004), which presented the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">1. Did the trial court err in allowing Newman\u2019s domestic relations attorney to testify about confidential attorney-client communications?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">2. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in denying Newman\u2019s Motion for Mistrial upon the State eliciting testimony about Newman\u2019s exercise of her <em>Miranda </em>rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">3. Did the trial court abuse its discretion in allowing the State to introduce various forms of inadmissible character evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">4. Did the trial court err in denying Newman\u2019s Motion tor a New Trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">5. Did the trial court err in denying Newman\u2019s requested voir dire concerning the potential bias of members of the jury panel?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">We hold that the trial court erroneously admitted Friedman\u2019s testimony concerning communications with Newman that were subject to attorney-client privilege. Because we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>reverse the decisions of the Court of Special Appeals and Circuit Court and remand the case for a new trial on the basis of that error alone, we need not address the other issues raised in this appeal. As guidance for the trial court on remand, however, we will address the admission of testimony about Newman\u2019s exercise of her <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Newman argues that there was no justification for compelling Friedman to disclose statements that she claims are subject to attorney-client privilege. She asserts that the crime-fraud exception to the attorney client privilege, relied upon by the Court of Special Appeals, was never raised in the trial court because the trial judge only focused on the reasonableness of Friedman\u2019s prior disclosures under Rule 1.6. Newman asserts that allowing the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decision to stand would irreparably damage the relationship between attorney and client.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Newman relies on our decision in <em>Harrison v. State, </em>276 Md. 122, 151-52, 345 A.2d 830, 846-47 (1975), for the premise that a trial court initially must hear testimony outside of the jury to determine whether attorney-client privilege attaches to specific communications. She states that the use of <em>in camera </em>proceedings has been approved by the Supreme Court in <em>U.S. v. Zolin, </em>491 U.S. 554, 109 S.Ct. 2619, 105 L.Ed.2d 469 (1989), to determine the application of the attorney-client privilege or an exception to that privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Newman urges this Court to adopt the interpretation of the scope of the crime-fraud exception<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> set forth by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in <em>In re Public Defender Service, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>831 A.2d 890 (D.C.2003), that the exception applies only when the communications to the attorney are intended by the client to directly advance criminal or fraudulent activities with the attorney\u2019s assistance. Newman asserts that the fact that the communications concern a potential future crime is not sufficient to destroy the privilege. She claims that her statements in Friedman\u2019s presence were manifestations of the mental strain and anguish with which she struggled during the custody dispute with her ex-husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Newman also asserts that the trial court erred in denying her motion for mistrial after the State had elicited testimony from Detective Susan Mercer, the officer who arrested Newman and Landry, regarding Newman\u2019s exercise of her <em>Miranda </em>rights. Newman points to this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Dupree v. State, </em>352 Md. 314, 722 A.2d 52 (1998), which she interprets to mean that the mere mention that a defendant has been advised of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>is reversible error. Moreover, Newman contends that in <em>Hardaway v. State, </em>317 Md. 160, 562 A.2d 1234 (1989), this Court held that the curative instruction is given in error if it would cause the jury to consider a defendant\u2019s post <em>-Miranda </em>silence. She asserts that the Supreme Court has held in <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976), and <em>Brecht v. Gordon, </em>507 U.S. 619, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993), that the use of a defendant\u2019s silence after being <em>Mirandized </em>is fundamentally unfair. Newman also finds fault in the trial court\u2019s curative instruction because it failed to advise the jury to draw no inferences from Newman\u2019s failure to make a statement to the police or protest her innocence. She argues that her election to consult with an attorney necessarily implies that she invoked her right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Concerning Newman\u2019s assertion of attorney-client privilege and the denial of her request for an in camera hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>State counters that Newman failed to preserve her argument for an in camera hearing because she did not request one in the trial court. The State also argues that Newman\u2019s continuing objection was inadequate to preserve her claim that the examination of Friedman exceeded the scope of the trial court\u2019s pretrial ruling. Moreover, the State asserts that Newman waived her privilege with respect to statements made to Friedman when Landry was present during the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The State argues that the crime-fraud exception to the privilege applies to Newman\u2019s communications with Friedman. The State asserts that Newman used Friedman as a \u201csounding board\u201d for her plan to kill her sons and husband and that she attempted to involve Friedman in her plans. The State claims that to overcome the crime-fraud exception Friedman would have had to have prevented Newman\u2019s perpetration of the crime, which, according to the State, did not happen because Slobodow was shot. Because the attack took place, the State asserts that the communications must be considered to be in furtherance of that crime. Even if the admission of Friedman\u2019s testimony was error, the State asserts that it was harmless in the present case because excluding Friedman\u2019s testimony would not have affected the jury\u2019s verdict in the ease. Finally, the State claims that the failure to conduct an in camera hearing was not a procedural error because the trial court determined the admissibility of Friedman\u2019s testimony in a hearing outside the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The State also argues that the decision whether to grant the motion is left to the trial court\u2019s discretion and that Detective Mercer\u2019s statement was an isolated comment. The State also distinguishes <em>Dupree v. State, supra, </em>and <em>Zemo v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 303, 646 A.2d 1050 (1994), because the trial court in the present case immediately gave the jury a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">A. The Application of the Attorney Client Privilege The Scope of the Privilege</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The Supreme Court has recognized the attorney client privilege as \u201cthe oldest of the privileges for confidential com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>munications known to the common law.\u201d <em>Upjohn Co. v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S.Ct. 677, 682, 66 L.Ed.2d 584, 591 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The attorney-client privilege dates back in the common law to the reign of Elizabeth I (1558-1603) and probably originated in the compulsion of witnesses to testify. <em>Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 131, 345 A.2d at 836. Until 1776, it was not deemed to be a right of the client but rather was that of the attorney as a \u201cpoint of honor\u201d as an element of professional behavior. <em>Id. </em>In that year, \u201cthe House of Lords in the Duchess of Kingston\u2019s Trial (20 Howell, State Trials 355, 386 (1776)) ruled that her attorney, whom she had exempted from secrecy, was required to respond to questions about his conversations with her some three decades earlier, even though the attorney had demurred, raising the point of honor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This development effectively ended the use of the \u201cpoint of honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">During the latter half of the eighteenth century another theory evolved which recognized that the client held a privilege which prohibited the disclosure of client secrets by the attorney, rather than simply permitting the attorney to keep \u201cthe client\u2019s confidences as a professional prerogative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This theory rose to the forefront as the \u201cpoint of honor\u201d receded and soon was in use throughout the United States. <em>Id., </em>citing 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7\u00a7 2290-91 (McNaughton Rev.1961); C. McCormack, Evidence, \u00a7 78 (2d ed.1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">In 1862, in <em>Fulton v. MacCracken, </em>18 Md. 528 (1862), this Court stated that \u201c[n]o rule is better established than \u2018that communication which a client makes to his legal adviser for the purpose of professional advice or aid shall not be disclosed, unless by the consent of the client for whose protection the rule was established.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 542-43. We have stated that the privilege is an accommodation of the competing public interests of the need to promote candor in communications between attorneys and their clients and the general testimonial compulsion to divulge relevant evidence in the pursuit of truth and justice. <em>See Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 133, 345 A.2d at 837. It is so basic to the relationship of trust between an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>attorney and client that, although it is not given express constitutional protection, it is essential to a defendant\u2019s exercise of the constitutional guarantees of counsel and freedom from self-incrimination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The privilege is understood to be \u201ca rule of evidence that prevents the disclosure of a confidential communication made by a client to his attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.\u201d <em>See E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v.

Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 2292, at 554 (McNaughton rev. ed.1961) (footnote omitted). The common law privilege is codified in Section 9-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Maryland Code, which states, \u201cA person may not be compelled to testify in violation of the attorney-client privilege.\u201d Md.Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The privilege, although essential to an effective attorney-client relationship, is not absolute. <em>In re Criminal Investigation No. 1/242Q, </em>326 Md. 1, 11, 602 A.2d 1220, 1225 (1992). We have observed that \u201c[o]nly those attorney-client communications <em>pertaining to legal assistance </em>and <em>made with the intention of confidentiality </em>are within the ambit of the privilege.\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours, </em>351 Md. at 416, 718 A.2d at 1138. This Court in <em>Lanasa v. State, </em>109 Md. 602, 71 A. 1058 (1909), observed, \u201c[T]o make the communications privileged, they ... must relate to professional advice and to the subject-matter about which the advice is sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 617, 71 A. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>1064. <em>See also Morris v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 252, 255, 242 A.2d 559, 561 (1968), quoting <em>Colton v. United States, </em>306 F.2d 633, 637, <em>cert. denied </em>371 U.S. 951, 83 S.Ct. 505, 9 L.Ed.2d 499 (1963) (\u201c[T]he privilege extends essentially only to the substance of matters communicated to an attorney in professional confidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">For a communication to be considered privileged, it cannot be intended for disclosure to third parties. <em>See E.I. du Pont de Nemours, </em>351 Md. at 416, 718 A.2d at 1139. We have recognized, however, that disclosure to third parties, or the presence of third parties during a communication, does not automatically destroy the privilege. <em>See State v. Pratt, </em>284 Md. 516, 520, 398 A.2d 421, 425-26 (1979) (holding that communications made to a psychiatrist in preparation for an insanity defense are protected by attorney-client privilege); <em>Rubin v. State, </em>325 Md. 552, 568, 602 A.2d 677, 683-84 (1992) (declining to apply attorney-client privilege to communications to a private detective in attorney\u2019s employ where personal relationship with the detective motivated the communication).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Friedman\u2019s Disclosure Under Rule 1.6 and the Attorney-Client Privilege</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Whereas the attorney-client privilege addresses compelled disclosure of client secrets during judicial proceedings, client confidentiality under Rule 1.6 of the Professional Code relates to the attorney\u2019s general duty to maintain the confidentiality of all aspects of a client\u2019s representation. The attorney\u2019s duty to maintain the confidentiality of a client\u2019s communications is set forth in the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct [hereinafter \u201cMRPC\u201d] Rule 1.6(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\">A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client unless the client consents after consultation, except for disclosures that are impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation, and except as stated in paragraph (b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">MRPC 1.6(a). It is subject, however, to significant exceptions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANWQ\">(b) A lawyer may reveal such information to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>(1) to prevent the client from committing a criminal or fraudulent act that the lawyer believes is likely to result in death or substantial bodily harm or in substantial injury to the financial interests or property of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">(2) to rectify the consequences of a client\u2019s criminal or fraudulent act in the furtherance of which the lawyer\u2019s services were used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">MRPC 1.6(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">There is a subtle relationship between the confidentiality required under Rule 1.6 and the evidentiary rule of the attorney-client privilege. <em>See Parler &amp; Wobber v. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, P.C., </em>359 Md. 671, 689, 756 A.2d 526, 536 (2000). The principle of confidentiality is given effect in both bodies of law. The attorney-client privilege applies in judicial and other proceedings in which an attorney may be called as a witness or otherwise required to produce evidence adverse to his client. <em>See </em>MRPC 1.6, cmt.; David A. Green, <em>Lawyers as \u201cTattletalesA Challenge to the Broad Application of the Attorney-Client Privilege and Rule 1.6, Confidentiality of Information, </em>20 Ga. St. U.L.Rev. 617, 621-22 (2004) [hereinafter \u201cGreen\u201d]; Daniel R. Fischel, <em>Lawyers and Confidentiality, </em>65 U. Chi. L.Rev. 1, 1 n. 6 (1998). The rule of confidentiality embodied in Rule 1.6, however, applies in all other situations that do not involve the compulsion of law. MRPC 1.6, cmt.; <em>see also In re Estate of Wood, </em>818 A.2d 568, 573 (Pa.Super.2003); <em>In re Bryan, </em>275 Kan. 202, 61 P.3d 641, 656 (2003) Rule 1.6 also is not limited to \u201cmatters communicated in confidence by the client but also to all information relating to the representation,\u201d whether obtained from the client or through the attorney\u2019s independent investigation, MRPC 1.6, cmt., whereas the attorney-client privilege only protects communications between the client and the attorney. <em>See Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 135, 345 A.2d at 838 (requiring that the communication be made by the client for the attorney-client privilege to attach); <em>Green, supra, </em>at 622; <em>Peters v. County Comm\u2019n of Wood County, </em>205 W.Va. 481, 519 S.E.2d 179, 186 (1999). Therefore, Rule 1.6 prohibits the disclosure of any information pertaining to the representation of a client, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>does not operate to render information inadmissible at a judicial proceeding. <em>See Parler &amp; Wobber, </em>359 Md. at 689-90, 756 A.2d at 536. Only communications subject to the attorney-client privilege cannot be disclosed under judicial compulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In a case similar to the instant case, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts addressed the relationship between disclosure under a predecessor to Rule 1.6 and application of the attorney-client privilege in <em>Purcell v. District Attorney for the Suffolk District, </em>424 Mass. 109, 676 N.E.2d 436 (1997). In that case, a client of Jeffrey Purcell, an attorney employed by Greater Boston Legal Services, threatened to burn down an apartment building where recently the client had been employed. <em>Id. </em>at 437. Purcell determined that he \u201cshould advise appropriate authorities that [his client] might engage in conduct harmful to others,\u201d and informed the Boston police. <em>Id. </em>At the client\u2019s trial, the prosecution subpoenaed Purcell to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 438. Purcell then filed an action requesting that the Supreme Court determine whether attorney-client privilege prohibited his testifying. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">In determining that a disclosure under DR 4 \u2014 101(C)(3),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the disciplinary rule in effect prior to the adoption of Rule 1.6, did not make Purcell\u2019s testimony admissible, the court held that to permit such disclosures to then be used against the client at trial would cause lawyers to be \u201creluctant to come forward if they know that the information they disclose may lead to adverse consequences to their clients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 440. Moreover, the court noted that the use of such disclosures could chill the free discourse between the lawyer and the client, thereby limiting the lawyer\u2019s ability to thwart threats in the future. <em>Id. </em>Thus, the court held that disclosure to prevent future harm to others is not sufficient to overcome attorney-client privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 440-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>We agree with the Massachusetts Supreme Court that such disclosure is not sufficient to obviate the attorney-client privilege and admit the statements as evidence against the attorney\u2019s client, not only because of the chilling effect of the obverse, but also because it pits the attorney, as advocate and adviser, against the client, when the client is charged with a crime. To permit a Rule 1.6 disclosure to destroy the attorney-client privilege and empower the attorney to essentially waive his client\u2019s privilege without the client\u2019s consent is repugnant to the entire purpose of the attorney-client privilege in promoting candor between attorney and client. Moreover, it would violate our duty to \u201cmaintain the integrity of the legal profession.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gansler, </em>377 Md. 656, 701, 835 A.2d 548, 574 (2003). Therefore, we hold that Friedman\u2019s disclosure pursuant to Rule 1.6 of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct did not defeat Newman\u2019s assertion of the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Communications Made with Landry in the Presence of Friedman</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The parties do not dispute that two statements made by Newman in the presence of Landry, about which Friedman testified, occurred during the existence of Newman\u2019s attorney-client relationship with Friedman or that the statements were related to Newman\u2019s divorce and custody dispute. They also do not dispute that Newman retained Friedman to act in his capacity as an attorney on her behalf. Rather, they diverge about the effect of Landry\u2019s presence at sessions with Friedman during which she and Newman discussed \u201ckilling] Lars, Arlen [Slobodow] would be blamed, and then he would go to jail ... planting evidence [of pornography] in [Slobodow's] house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">As we have observed, generally the presence of a third party will destroy the attorney-client privilege. <em>See E.I. du Pont de Nemours, </em>351 Md. at 416, 718 A.2d at 1139. The mere presence of a third party, however, does not constitute a waiver of the privilege per se. Because the attorney-client privilege is held and waived by the client, our essential inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>is \u201c \u2018whether the <em>client </em>reasonably understood the conference to be confidential\u2019 <em>notwithstanding </em>the presence of third parties.\u201d <em>Rosati v. Kuzman, </em>660 A.2d 263, 266-67 (R.I.1995), quoting <em>Kevlik v. Goldstein, </em>724 F.2d 844, 849 (1st Cir.1984) (emphasis in original). <em>See also </em>McCormack, Evidence, \u00a7 91 at 189 (2d ed.1972) (explaining that a \u201cmere showing that the communication was from client to attorney does not suffice, but the circumstances indicating the intention of secrecy must appear\u201d); <em>Hearn v. Rhay, </em>68 F.R.D. 574, 579 (E.D.Wash.1975) (noting that \u201c[t]he attorney-client privilege is limited to communications between the attorney and the client which are expressly intended to be confidential\u201d); <em>State v. von Bulow, </em>475 A.2d 995, 1005 (R.I.1984) (stating that the communication is privileged if expressly intended to be confidential).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">We find the analysis of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island in <em>Rosati v. Kuzman, </em>660 A.2d 263 (R.I.1995), to be persuasive on this point. In that case, the court analyzed whether the presence of a defendant\u2019s parents during communications between the attorney and their son destroyed any attorney-client privilege. <em>Id. </em>at 266. Examining whether the son reasonably understood the communications to be confidential, the court observed that his parents \u201coccupied a vital role in his defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267. They facilitated the son\u2019s relationship with the attorney, accepted other offers of assistance on their son\u2019s behalf, and acted as his confidants through a \u201ctense legal proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court relied upon those facts to determine that the son unequivocally intended that the communications in question remain confidential. <em>Id. </em>The fact that the third parties were the defendant\u2019s parents played no part in the court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The record in the case at bar indicates Newman\u2019s clear understanding that the communications made in the presence of Landry would remain confidential. Landry, as one of Newman\u2019s oldest and closest friends, accompanied Newman to Friedman\u2019s office in an attempt to \u201ckeep things more ... focused, ... to ease\u201d the relationship between Friedman and Newman. Friedman testified that Newman was \u201cdistraught\u201d over the possibility of losing custody of her children to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>father. He further testified that he \u201cinvited Margery [Landry] into the conversations [with Newman] because [he] wanted what [he] thought would be a cool head in the room.\u201d Later, due to the content of the conversations in his presence between Landry and Newman, Friedman stated, \u201c[T]hat is why I had to bar Margery from coming into my office.\u201d Thus, Friedman exerted his control over Landry\u2019s presence through his ability to invite her and also exclude her from the meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">Newman\u2019s acquiescence in Friedman\u2019s suggestion that Landry facilitate his meetings with her by providing a \u201ccool head\u201d cannot reasonably be interpreted as amounting to a waiver of her privilege, as the State suggests. Although Landry accompanied Newman to Friedman\u2019s office, there is nothing in the record to show that Newman suggested that Landry participate in her meeting with Friedman, and Friedman\u2019s testimony indicates that the opposite is true. We have held that \u201c[o]nly the client has [the] power to waive the attorney-client privilege.\u201d <em>Parler &amp; Wobber, </em>359 Md. at 691, 756 A.2d at 537; <em>see City of College Park v. Cotter, </em>309 Md. 573, 591, 525 A.2d 1059, 1067 (1987). Where the third party is acting at the attorney\u2019s behest, as Landry did in the present case, the client\u2019s consent to the third party\u2019s continued presence does not constitute waiver of the privilege because the decision to include the third party was not made by the client, but rather by the attorney. Therefore, Newman reasonably understood the communications in question to be confidential, and subject to the attorney-client privilege, because of Friedman\u2019s control over Landry\u2019s presence during their meetings.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Also, like Rosati\u2019s parents in <em>Rosati v. Kuzman, supra, </em>Landry acted as a source of support for Newman during divorce and custody proceedings which, according to all parties involved, were extremely contentious. She accompanied Newman to court proceedings, communicated directly with Friedman at Newman\u2019s direction, and assisted Newman in pursuing investigations of Newman\u2019s sons\u2019 allegations of sexual abuse with the proper authorities. Thus, we can discern no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>significant distinction between the circumstances of <em>Rosati </em>and the present case. Consequently, we find that Landry\u2019s presence during Newman\u2019s meetings with Friedman does not destroy Newman\u2019s attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The Crime-Fraud Exception and Its Application</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The Court of Special Appeals found that Friedman\u2019s testimony about the content of his disclosure under MRPC Rule 1.6 was admissible under the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege. We disagree with the court\u2019s application of the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers defines the crime-fraud exception as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\">The attorney-client privilege does not apply to a communication occurring when a client:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">(a) consults a lawyer for the purpose, later accomplished, of obtaining assistance to engage in a crime or fraud or aiding a third person to do so, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-10\">(b) Regardless of a client\u2019s purpose at the time of consultation, uses the lawyer\u2019s advice or other services to engage in or assist a crime or fraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers, \u00a7 82 (2000, 2004 Cum.Supp.). We have never explicitly accepted the existence of a crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege under Maryland law. Nevertheless, we agree with the Supreme Court\u2019s assessment that it would be an abuse of the privilege to permit the attorney-client privilege to \u201cextend to communications \u2018made for the purpose of getting advice for the commission of a fraud\u2019 or a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Zolin, </em>491 U.S. 554, 563, 109 S.Ct. 2619, 2626, 105 L.Ed.2d 469, 485 (1989). Thus, we hold that the crime-fraud exception applies in Maryland to exempt communications seeking advice or aid in furtherance of a crime or fraud, from the protection of the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-12\">In the present case, the State suggests that we should opine that a statement of intention to commit a criminal or fraudulent act is equivalent to seeking advice or aid in furtherance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>committing that crime from an attorney, brings that utterance within the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege. We decline to so opine and join our colleagues on both the federal and state levels who have required more than a mere statement of the intent to commit a crime or fraud to trigger the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege. <em>See e.g., In re Richard Roe, </em>168 F.3d 69, 71-72 (1999) (stating that the use of an attorney\u2019s services must be in furtherance of a crime or fraud for the exception to apply); <em>United States v. Chen, </em>99 F.3d 1495, 1503 (9th Cir.1996) (same); <em>Haines v. Liggett Group Inc., </em>975 F.2d 81, 90 (3d Cir.1992) (same); <em>United States v. White, </em>887 F.2d 267, 271 (D.C.Cir.1989) <em>(\u201cIt </em>does not suffice that the communications may be related to a crime. To subject the attorney-client communications to disclosure, they must actually have been made with an intent to further an unlawful act.\u201d); <em>In re Murphy, </em>560 F.2d 326, 338 (8th Cir.1977) (same); <em>In re Grand Jury Investigation, </em>842 F.2d 1223, 1226 (11th Cir.1987) (same); <em>In re International Systems &amp; Controls Corporation Securities Litigation, </em>693 F.2d 1235, 1242 (5th Cir.1982) (same); <em>State v.

State, </em>962 S.W.2d 544, 553 (Tex. Crim.App.1997) (\u201c[W]e cannot conclude that the crime-fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>exception can be satisfied by the mere pendency of ongoing criminal activity or the mere threat of future activity. The attorney\u2019s services must be sought or used to further the activity in question.\u201d); <em>Kleinfeld, v. State, </em>568 So.2d 937, 939-40 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1990) (stating that Florida\u2019s crime-fraud exception required the client to seek the attorney\u2019s assistance in furthering the crime or fraud); <em>In the Matter of Nackson, </em>114 N.J. 527, 555 A.2d 1101, 1105 (1989) (observing that the crime-fraud exception only applied where the client consulted with the attorney to obtain aid in the commission of a crime, to enable the client to avoid criminal prosecution, or to avoid lawful service of process); <em>People v. Paasche, </em>207 Mich.App. 698, 525 N.W.2d 914, 917-18 (1994) (stating that to establish the crime-fraud exception it must be shown that the communication was in furtherance of a criminal or fraudulent enterprise), <em>In re Marriage of Decker, </em>153 Ill.2d 298, 180 Ill.Dec. 17, 606 N.E.2d 1094, 1101 (1992) (defining the crime-fraud exception as only applying to communications with attorney in furtherance of a crime or fraud). To permit the mere statement of intent to defeat the attorney-client privilege would result in the exception swallowing the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The Court of Special Appeals only addressed the application of the crime-fraud exception to the communications disclosed by Friedman under MRPC Rule 1.6. <em>Newman v. State, </em>156 Md.App. at 48-49, 845 A.2d at 88. There is nothing in the record indicating that Newman sought advice or assistance in furtherance of a crime when she stated her intention to kill her husband and children.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Friedman testified that he disclosed communications with Newman in an attempt to thwart her plans. Moreover, Friedman stated that Newman\u2019s threats were typical in hotly contested custody proceedings. The State relies upon Friedman\u2019s fear that he was in danger of becoming an \u201caccessory before the fact of murder if [he] didn\u2019t do something\u201d to show that Newman consulted with Friedman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u201cin furtherance\u201d of a future crime or fraud. Although it shows that Friedman viewed Newman\u2019s threats as serious, the testimony relied upon by the State does little more, and does not establish that Newman consulted with Friedman for the purpose of obtaining assistance in furtherance of a future crime or fraud. Therefore, the communication disclosed by Friedman pursuant to MRPC Rule 1.6 is not subject to the crime-fraud exception and is privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">Although the Court of Special Appeals did not address the application of the crime-fraud exception to the communications in Landry\u2019s presence, we will so do. The State relies upon Friedman\u2019s testimony that he felt that he was being \u201csucked into their plan\u201d by Newman and Landry, and that they \u201cwere bringing [him] into this relationship.\u201d Those statements do not evidence any intent to seek assistance in furtherance of a crime, but rather only show that Friedman was uncomfortable with the content of the communications. The State\u2019s position that Newman solicited Friedman to assist her in her alleged scheme, or requested advice to accomplish it, is not supported in the record. Both the communication disclosed by Friedman pursuant to MRPC Rule 1.6 and the conversations held in the presence of Landry are privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Harmless Error</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">We must then consider whether the error committed by the trial court was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Dupree, </em>352 Md. at 332-33, 722 A.2d at 61; <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 646, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). Newman\u2019s convictions cannot stand unless, \u201cupon [our] own independent review of the record, [this Court] is able to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Dupree, </em>352 Md. at 333, 722 A.2d at 61; <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678. We cannot so conclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Although the State\u2019s other evidence established a close relationship between Newman and Landry, only Friedman\u2019s testimony connected Newman to Landry\u2019s attack on Slobodow and established the possible conspiracy. In light of the circumstantial nature of the State\u2019s case, we cannot conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the erroneous admission of Friedman\u2019s testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, we hold that the admission of Friedman\u2019s testimony in violation of Newman\u2019s attorney-client privilege was reversible error and we reverse the decision of the Court of Special Appeals with instructions to remand the case to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for a new trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>B. Admission of Detective Mercer\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">We shall, for the trial court\u2019s guidance, analyze the issues raised by Detective Mercer\u2019s testimony about Newman\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Newman asserts that testimony by Detective Mercer that she was <em>Mirandized </em>and that her attorney was waiting for her at the police station is an indirect comment on her post-<em>Miranda </em>silence because commenting on the presence of her attorney necessarily implicates the fact that Newman remained silent. As such, Newman argues that the trial court\u2019s curative instruction was inadequate and that her Motion for Mistrial was improperly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The pertinent part of Detective Mercer\u2019s testimony is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-7\">STATE: Did you advise her of her rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-8\">DETECTIVE MERCER: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-9\">STATE: And what rights did you advise her of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAm\">DETECTIVE MERCER: That she had the right to remain silent, she had the right to an attorney. At which time she advised that she would like to consult with an attorney. Actually, she had an attorney waiting in the station lobby for her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">The United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights guarantee the innocent and guilty alike the right to remain silent. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. V (providing that \u201c[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself\u2019); Md. Const. Declaration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Rights, art. 22 (\u201cThat no man ought to be compelled to give evidence against himself in a criminal case\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> An inherent component of this guarantee is that one who invokes the privilege against self-incrimination shall remain free from adverse presumptions surrounding the exercise of such right. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1973, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-107 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (providing that \u201c[t]he failure of a defendant to testify in a criminal proceeding on this basis does not create any presumption against him\u201d); <em>see Crosby v. State, </em>366 Md. 518, 528, 784 A.2d 1102, 1107 (2001); <em>Younie v. State, </em>272 Md. 233, 244, 322 A.2d 211, 217 (1974) (stating that no penalty shall flow from the exercise of one\u2019s right to remain silent).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Cognizant of the fundamental importance of the privilege against self \u2014 incrimination\u2014an essential pillar of our adversarial system-the Supreme Court adopted certain procedural safeguards to ensure the protection of this right in the context of a custodial interrogation. Pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), an individual in police custody must be warned, prior to any interrogation, that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, and that he has the right to the presence of an attorney. <em>Id. </em>at 479, 86 S.Ct. at 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d at 726. The viability of <em>Miranda </em>was reenforced in <em>Dickerson v. United States, </em>530 U.S. 428, 120 S.Ct. 2326, 147 L.Ed.2d 405 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">It is well established that the prosecution\u2019s use of post-<em>Miranda </em>silence to obtain a conviction is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of due process. <em>Wainwright v. Greenfield, </em>474 U.S. 284, 292, 106 S.Ct. 634, 639, 88 L.Ed.2d 623, 630-31.(1986); <em>Doyle, </em>426 U.S. at 619, 96 S.Ct. at 2245, 49 L.Ed.2d at 98. A defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to remain silent includes his desire to remain silent until counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>has been consulted. <em>Wainwright, </em>474 U.S. at 295 n. 13, 106 S.Ct. at 640 n. 13, 88 L.Ed.2d at 632 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">This Court has maintained that the right to remain silent \u201chas always been liberally construed in order to give fullest effect to this immunity.\u201d <em>Crosby, </em>366 Md. at 527 n. 8, 784 A.2d at 1107 n. 8, quoting <em>Allen v. State, </em>183 Md. 603, 607, 39 A.2d 820, 821 (1944). Notably, we have previously interpreted Maryland\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination contained in Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights to be more comprehensive than that contained in the federal Bill of Rights. Judge Eldridge, writing for this Court in <em>Hardaway v. State, </em>317 Md. 160, 161, 562 A.2d 1234 (1989), held that absent special circumstances, instructing a jury, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that the defendant has the constitutional right not to testify and that no adverse inference should be drawn from his election to remain silent, violated state common law and was reversible error. In so holding, this Court departed from Supreme Court jurisprudence which provides that the giving of a cautionary instruction over a defendant\u2019s objection does not violate his privilege against self-incrimination. <em>See Lakeside v. Oregon, </em>435 U.S. 333, 340-41, 98 S.Ct. 1091, 1095, 55 L.Ed.2d 319, 326 (1978). The predicate for this deviation, which effectively extends a defendant\u2019s constitutional protections, was our State\u2019s common law and \u201cthe approach taken by this Court generally with respect to defendants\u2019 rights and entitlements in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Hardaway, </em>317 Md. at 168, 562 A.2d at 1238. We find that our conclusion in <em>Hardaway </em>is dispositive of the issue at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">In the present case, Newman objected to the admission of Detective Mercer\u2019s testimony about Newman\u2019s exercise of her Fifth Amendment right to counsel, and by implication, the exercise of her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The State also failed to proffer a legitimate reason for eliciting the prejudicial testimony. Moreover, Newman objected to the use of a curative instruction to counteract the prejudice that she had suffered. As we stated in <em>Hardaway, </em>\u201c \u2018It is unrealistic to assume that instructions on the right to silence always have a benign effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hardaway, </em>317 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>166 n. 3, 562 A.2d at 1236-37 n. 3, quoting <em>Lakeside v. Oregon, </em>435 U.S. at 347, 98 S.Ct. at 1098, 55 L.Ed.2d at 330 (Stevens, J., dissenting). In cases, such as the one at bar, where the testimony regarding a defendant\u2019s exercise of the right to remain silent <em>post-Miranda </em>is elicited inadvertently at best and intentionally at worst, the curative instruction is not sufficient to overcome the prejudicial inferences. Therefore, we find that a curative instruction, given over the objection of the defendant, fails to cure the prejudice caused by testimony about the <em>post-Miranda </em>exercise of the right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">We hold that an attorney\u2019s discretionary disclosure of client communications under MRPC 1.6 does not obviate the client\u2019s ability to later successfully assert the attorney-client privilege. We also adopt the crime-fraud exception and require that the communications be made to an attorney seeking his assistance or aid in furtherance of an ongoing or future crime or fraud. Because neither disclosure under MRPC 1.6 or the crime-fraud exception destroys Newman\u2019s privilege in the present case, Friedman\u2019s testimony about his communications with Newman was inadmissible. Therefore, we reverse the decision by the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

The appropriate procedure to determine whether the altorney-client privilege or one of its exceptions applies was not followed with respect to the admissibility of Friedman's testimony about Newman\u2019s communications in Landry's presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">First we note that the \u201cparty seeking the protection of ihe privilege bears the burden of establishing its existence.\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours, </em>351 Md. at 415, 718 A.2d at 1138; <em>In re Criminal Investigation 1/242Q, </em>326 Md. at 11, 602 A.2d at 1225.

Rule 5-104(c) (providing that a hearing on preliminary matters be heard outside the presence of ihe jury). In this preliminary inquiry, the trial court will decide as a matter of law whether the elements of the privilege are present and if so, whether the communication, absent an exception, is privileged. <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours, </em>351 Md. at 415, 718 A.2d at 1138. This threshold question must be determined without requiring the disclosure of the communication at issue. <em>Harrison, </em>276 Md. at 136, 345 A.2d at 838; Md. Rule 5-104(a) (requiring strict application of the rules of evidence governing privilege).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In interpreting Federal Rule of Evidence 104(a), upon which Maryland Rule 5-104(a) is based, the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Zolin </em>that an in camera review to determine whether the attorney-client privilege and/or the crime-fraud exception applied was permissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 104(a). 491 U.S. at 569, 109 S.Ct. at 2624, 105 L.Ed.2d at 482. It explained, however, that to be entitled to an in camera review, the party opposing the privilege must \u201cpresent evidence sufficient to support a reasonable belief that [such] review may yield evidence that establishes the exceptions applicability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574-75, 109 S.Ct. at 2632, 105 L.Ed.2d at 492. The party opposing the application of the privilege may use any evidence, independent of the content of the privileged communication to present its <em>prima facie </em>case that the crime-fraud exception applied. At this point in the preliminary inquiry, the party opposing the privilege would be required to proffer evidence demonstrating that the communication at issue was made with the object of seeking assistance in directly furthering an ongoing or future crime or fraud. <em>See Purcell, </em>676 N.E.2d at 440; <em>In re Marriage of Decker, </em>180 Ill.Dec. 17, 606 N.E.2d at 1101; <em>Paasche, </em>525 N.W.2d at 917-18; <em>Haines, </em>975 F.2d at 90; <em>In re Grand Jury Investiga</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>tion, </em>842 F.2d at 1226; <em>In re International Systems &amp; Controls Corporation Securities Litigation, </em>693 F.2d at 1242; <em>In re Murphy, </em>560 F.2d at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak1\">We agree with the Supreme Court that an in camera hearing is an appropriate mechanism for determining the admissibility of allegedly privileged evidence during trial. Although the trial court held a pretrial hearing concerning Friedman's testimony about the communications disclosed under MRPC Rule 1.6, it failed to hold any proceeding outside the presence of the jury to determine the admissibility of Friedman\u2019s testimony about the communications made in Landry's presence, which were first revealed at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b573-6\">.

The custody battle, fought in the courts of both the District of Columbia and Montgomery County, embodied claims by each party that the other had physically or sexually abused the children. On at least two occasions, Newman filed claims in the District accusing Slobodow of sexually abusing the children. One such complaint was investigated by the D.C. police and resolved as \u201cUnfounded.\u201d The other, involving allegations of child pornography, was investigated by the FBI; it too was closed without action. In early 2001, following an apparent finding by the District of Columbia court that <em>Newman </em>had abused or neglected the children, Slobodow was given custody of the children and Newman was limited to supervised visits. That arrangement was confirmed by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in September, 2001. Trial with respect to \u201cpermanent\u201d custody was scheduled for January 28, 2002 in Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Newman apparently decided not to wait, or to trust her luck to the judicial process. Instead, she arranged for her longtime girlfriend, Margery Landry, to break into Slobodow\u2019s home during the dead of night, kill him, and leave behind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>packets of pornographic material as evidence that he had been sexually abusing his two sons. The fact that the children were also in the home and might be hurt or killed as well did not seem to matter. Landry, indeed, attempted to carry out that plan and nearly succeeded in doing so. At some point in the early morning hours of January 7, 2002, while Newman was conveniently in New Jersey, Landry, dressed in black and wearing a ski mask and latex gloves, broke into Slobodow\u2019s home, assaulted Slobodow as he lay in bed, shot at him twice, wounding him once in the leg, beat him over the head with a telephone, and attempted to flee. When Slobodow attempted to reach another telephone to call for help, she assaulted him a second time and succeeded in escaping through a window, leaving behind a handgun with an obliterated serial number, an empty clip and two spent shell casings, a fanny pack containing a box of nine millimeter ammunition, a pornographic video tape, and pornographic magazines and books. Landry was arrested, charged with and pled guilty to assault, burglary, reckless endangerment, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, and obliterating the serial number on a handgun, and sentenced to prison for 53 years, with all but 20 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In the belief that Landry\u2019s conduct was part of a conspiracy to affect the outcome of the pending custody case, the State charged Newman with conspiracy, attempted first degree murder, assault, burglary, and unlawful use of a handgun. On more than ample evidence, she was convicted on all counts and sentenced to life in prison, with all but 20 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The Court proposes to reverse those convictions and award Newman a new trial because it concludes that (1) certain threatening admissions made by Newman in the presence of her domestic relations attorney were inadmissible, and (2) a relatively innocuous statement by a detective that was immediately dealt with by a fully adequate curative instruction was so prejudicial as to be beyond remedy other than by declaring a mistrial. Both of those conclusions, in my view, are wrong, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\n<em>The Attorney\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The State presented several categories of evidence against Newman. One concerned the events of January 7 at Slobo-dow\u2019s home; a second dealt with the close relationship between Newman and Landry. The category at issue here involved statements made by Newman to various people during the divorce and custody litigation, some of which were recounted at trial by Newman\u2019s divorce lawyer, Stephen Friedman. In examining the issues raised by Newman regarding that testimony, some greater context than appears in the Court\u2019s opinion is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Newman first employed Friedman in December, 1999, to represent her in her divorce case, which, as noted, came to include collateral abuse and neglect charges in both Maryland and the District of Columbia. In August, 2000, about three weeks before scheduled trial in the custody aspect of the divorce case, Newman fired Friedman. In January, 2001, she fired the lawyer she had retained to replace him and reemployed Mr. Friedman. During the first period of representation, Newman became friendly with Friedman\u2019s secretary, Sandra Ashley. In December, 2000 \u2014 after she had fired Friedman and before she rehired him \u2014 Newman called Ms. Ashley and arranged to have dinner with her. During that dinner, she informed Ms. Ashley that she \u201chad plans to murder her husband.\u201d Specifically, she said that her friend Landry \u201chad connections with the mob in Chicago,\u201d that Landry was trying to obtain a gun from Chicago that was untraceable, and that she planned to dress all in black. She said at the time that she intended to catch her husband on the street in Washington when the children were not with him and kill him. Ashley said that Newman seemed quite serious, even when warned about the consequences, and that Ashley took the threat seriously. After consulting with an attorney, however, Ms. Ashley decided not to report the matter to the authorities, but, in February, 2001, after Newman had rehired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Friedman, she advised Friedman of the conversation in an email.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Friedman received another e-mail in February regarding the same Mnd of threat, this one from his associate, Beth Rogers. Ms. Rogers had accompanied Newman to an FBI polygraph test, presumably in connection with her complaint that Slobodow was involved in child pornography. When Newman \u201cfailed\u201d the test, Rogers reported that she said several times that \u201cshe would kill herself and the kids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">At some point, possibly in April, 2001, Newman and Landry were in Friedman\u2019s office. Newman often brought Landry to meetings with Friedman. Newman was upset because the District of Columbia court had recently given custody of the children to Slobodow. As Friedman was busy reading a report of some kind, Newman and Landry were conversing with one another. They were not talking to Friedman, and he was not part of the conversation. Newman was talking to Landry about shooting Lars and framing Slobodow. They spoke about the need to do the deed personally and not to hire someone, to have an alibi, and to plant pornographic evidence in Slobodow\u2019s house so he would be blamed. Friedman said that he was trying not to listen to the conversation and asked them to stop. He said that he did not take the conversation seriously at that point. That kind of conversation later occurred on another occasion, whereupon Friedman barred Landry from participating in his meetings with Newman.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">On August 31, 2001, Friedman met with Newman for several hours to prepare for a hearing set before Judge Ryan on September 4. The hearing was to be on some of the financial aspects of the divorce. Although, according to him, Newman was \u201cin a rage\u201d during the early part of the meeting, at some point she got quiet and thoughtful, and announced \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t have to kill both children. I only need to kill Lars because I can save Herbie, and then Arlen will go to jail and get what he deserves because he is a criminal, and I can at least save Herbie.\u201d Friedman said that comments such as that had been made before, and he cautioned her that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>could not involve him in a murder and that he had an obligation to tell the court when she \u201c[said] stuff like that.\u201d Newman responded that he was not allowed to repeat any of it and she would sue him if he did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">Friedman said that he was now concerned that Newman or Landry would kill either Lars or Slobodow, and that, after consulting an ethics adviser and a psychologist, he concluded that he might be an accessory before the fact to murder. Not desiring to contact the authorities or Judge Ryan, he instead, on the morning of the hearing, came to court early and consulted Judge Weinstein, the county administrative judge, who referred him to Judge Scrivener, the judge who headed the Family Division. Invoking Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.6, Friedman recounted his concerns to her, including Newman\u2019s threat to kill Lars and blame Slobodow. He read to her the e-mail he had received from Ms. Rogers. Judge Scrivener said that she would deal with the matter, following which Friedman reported to Judge Ryan\u2019s courtroom, prepared to participate in the hearing. After discussing the matter with several of her colleagues, Judge Scrivener called Judge Ryan, in the middle of the hearing, and informed him of what Friedman had disclosed. Judge Ryan returned to court and, on the record, recounted what Judge Scrivener had told him, namely, that \u201cMs. Newman has told Mr. Friedman and others that if she does not obtain custody of the children that she would kill the children rather than expose them to the torture of Mr. Slobodow ... and that she had hired a hitman to kill him, that is, to kill Mr. Slobodow.\u201d Judge Ryan concluded that Mr. Friedman was obliged to make that disclosure and permitted him to withdraw his appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">In a preliminary proceeding before Judge Rupp, prior to the commencement of her criminal trial, Newman objected to Friedman\u2019s testifying, claiming that her disclosures to him were privileged. The prosecutor responded that, although Friedman was then in court, he had not spoken with the prosecutors regarding Newman\u2019s statements, that the State had no intention of calling him as a witness, and that it desired only to put into evidence the transcript of the proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>before Judge Ryan, which was a public record. Nonetheless, Friedman was called to testify at the preliminary proceeding with respect to the circumstances behind his disclosure to Judge Scrivener, so the court could rule on whether those disclosures, as revealed in the transcript of the proceeding before Judge Ryan, were protected by the privilege. After listening to that testimony, as recounted above, Judge Rupp, consistently with the rulings of Judges Ryan and Scrivener, concluded that Friedman had acted reasonably and that \u201che did what he needed to do under [R]ule 1.6.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The relevant part of the transcript of proceedings before Judge Ryan on September 4 was placed into evidence as a Joint Exhibit, by stipulation. The prosecutor was concerned, however, that the transcript revealed, in substance, only what Judge Ryan said that Judge Scrivener had told him about what Friedman had told her regarding statements made by Newman, which was effectively quadruple-level hearsay. She changed her view and indicated her desire to speak directly with Friedman and to call him as a witness. Friedman declined to speak with the prosecutor or to testify unless specifically ordered to do so. Judge Rupp, following his earlier ruling that the disclosure to Judge Scrivener was appropriate, entered an order to the effect that (1) Friedman was not precluded from disclosing to the prosecutor what he had disclosed to Judge Scrivener, and (2) Friedman, having been subpoenaed to testify, was required to do so. In accordance with that order, Friedman testified at trial and disclosed to the jury essentially what he had previously told Judge Scrivener.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The Court recognizes that there are two legal precepts that need to be considered. The one actually invoked by Friedman is Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.6. Section (a) of that Rule effectively precludes a lawyer from revealing information relating to representation of a client unless authorized by the client or by section (b) of the Rule. In relevant part, \u00a7 (b) authorizes a lawyer to reveal information to the extent that the lawyer reasonably believes necessary \u201c(1) to prevent the client from committing a criminal or fraudulent act that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>the lawyer believes is likely to result in death or substantial bodily harm.\u201d The other precept is the ancient common law attorney-client privilege that has been codified by reference in Maryland Code, \u00a7 9-108 of the Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Article (\u201cA person may not be compelled to testify in violation of the attorney-client privilege\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The Court recognizes that there is \u201ca subtle relationship between the confidentiality required under Rule 1.6 and the evidentiary rule of the attorney-client privilege\u201d in that \u201c[t]he principle of confidentiality is given effect in both bodies of law.\u201d The Court does not seem to take issue with the validity of Friedman\u2019s disclosures to Judge Scrivener under Rule 1.6 and thus, I assume, accepts Judge Scrivener\u2019s, Judge Ryan\u2019s, and Judge Rupp\u2019s determinations that Friedman acted properly under the Rule in making the disclosure to Judge Scrivener. The Court thereby presumably accepts that Friedman reasonably believed that the disclosure was necessary to prevent Newman, or Landry from committing a criminal act likely to result in death or substantial bodily harm to another. Indeed, events showed rather remarkably the reasonableness of that belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The Court then detaches the evidentiary privilege from the Rule and, relying principally on <em>Purcell v. District Attorney for the Suffolk District, </em>424 Mass. 109, 676 N.E.2d 436 (1997), concludes that, even if disclosure is appropriate under the Rule, the attorney may be prevented from making the same disclosure in court. Although I recognize that the Rule and the evidentiary privilege are not identical in scope <em>(see Parler &amp; Wobber v. Miles &amp; Stockbridge, </em>359 Md. 671, 688-93, 756 A.2d 526, 535-38 (2000)), but, with all due respect to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, I can discern no justification whatever for a holding that an attorney may, under Rule 1.6, properly disclose client communications, clearly intended to be confidential, to law enforcement or judicial authorities that almost certainly will result in a criminal investigation of the client and may well result in criminal charges being filed against the client, but that, if such charges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>are brought, the attorney may be precluded from making the self-same disclosures in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Borrowing in part from the Massachusetts case, the Court offers three reasons for such a distinction: (1) lawyers will be reluctant to make disclosures \u201cif they know that the information they disclose may lead to adverse consequences to their clients,\u201d (2) permitting such disclosures in court \u201ccould chill the free discourse between the lawyer and the client, thereby limiting the lawyer\u2019s ability to thwart threats in the future,\u201d and (3) to allow the attorney to testify in court would, in effect, permit the attorney to waive the privilege that belongs to the client. None of those reasons can survive any critical analysis; indeed, at least the first two really make little sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">I cannot conceive, and the Court offers no explanation, of why a lawyer who believes that a disclosure is necessary to prevent death or serious bodily harm to another will feel free to make a disclosure under Rule 1.6, knowing that, as a result, his client will almost certainly be the target of a criminal investigation, but will nonetheless be reluctant to make the disclosure because he/she may be called to testify in court. If there is any empirical evidence that lawyers have withheld disclosures that are permitted and otherwise would be made under Rule 1.6 because of a fear that their client may be harmed if they ultimately are called to testify, the Court has not cited it. I expect that the Court has not cited such evidence because it does not exist. Similarly, the Court has cited no evidence, because I expect it does not exist, that \u201cfree discourse between the lawyer and the client\u201d will somehow be chilled if the lawyer, who may properly \u201cspill the beans\u201d to law enforcement authorities under the Rule, is also free to testify in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The third reason offered is equally baseless. The evidentia-ry privilege always remains with the client, but the privilege is not absolute and has never been regarded as absolute. There are exceptions to it, and when those exceptions apply, the client\u2019s privilege is either lost or diminished.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The only issue in this regard is whether the \u201ccrime/fraud\u201d exception embodied- in Rule 1.6 should be recognized as well under the evidentiary privilege, and I can see no reason why it should not be. The exception for disclosures relating to threats of death or serious bodily injury is based on supervening public policy \u2014 the determination by the American Bar Association, which initially drafted and approved Rule 1.6, and by the State Supreme Courts, including this Court, that have also approved and actually promulgated the Rule that the general rule of confidentiality needs to bend in that circumstance. That public policy has equal force with respect to the testimonial privilege. Yes, it can be terribly disadvantageous to a client to have his/her lawyer disclose in court, or before some other tribunal, that the client threatened to kill or seriously injure a particular victim and that the threat was credible, but that is no more disadvantageous than permitting the lawyer to disclose that information to law enforcement authorities with a view toward commencing and pursuing a criminal investigation against the client. Drawing the distinction that the Court proposes to draw simply muddles the law, gives no clear guidance to lawyers in a most difficult area that cries out for consistency, and achieves no counterbalancing useful objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Apart from that, the Court fails to give appropriate consideration to just what was presented to the jury. Ms. Ashley\u2019s testimony was clearly not protected by any attorney-client privilege. Friedman\u2019s testimony regarding the conversation between Newman and Landry that occurred in April, 2001 also, in my view, was not protected by the testimonial privilege, and, indeed, the Court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary is inconsistent with its own definition of the privilege. Friedman was not testifying as to communications made by Newman to <em>him, </em>but as to a conversation between Newman and Landry that he simply overheard. The Court defines the testimonial privilege as a rule that \u201cprevents the disclosure of a confidential communication made by a client <em>to his attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Court either overlooks or ignores the fact that the communications made at that April, 2001 meeting were not of that kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">The Court\u2019s opinion, I am sorry to say, is flawed both legally and factually and espouses a view that makes little sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\n<em>Post-Miranda Silence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">On August 1, 2002, the fourth day of trial, the State called Detective Susan Mercer to testify. Detective Mercer responded to the Slobodow home following the report of a shooting and was the lead investigator in the case. She testified first about the arrest of Landry and the various injuries noted on Landry\u2019s hand and finger. She then was asked about her first contact with Newman, upon her arrest on January 10. This was the relevant colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-8\">Q And did you have any conversation with Ms. Newman? A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">Q Okay. Did you advise her of her rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-10\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">Q And what rights did you advise her of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-12\">A That she had the right to remain silent, she had the right to an attorney. At which time she advised that she would like to consult with an attorney. Actually, she had an attorney waiting in the station lobby for her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">Newman immediately moved for a mistrial based on the Detective\u2019s volunteered statement regarding Newman\u2019s decision to consult an attorney. The court recognized the error but concluded that a mistrial was not necessary and instead gave the following curative instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-14\">\u201cYou have heard testimony that Elsa Newman was accompanied by an attorney when she appeared at the police station on January 10, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-15\">This is not evidence to be considered by you. Ms. Newman is presumed to be innocent of the charges against her. You have heard evidence that Ms. Newman\u2019s x-husband, Arlen Slobodow was shot on January 7, 2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Ms. Newman\u2019s house was searched following the shooting. She was aware of this on January 10, 2002. It is fully consistent with the presumption of innocence that anyone under these circumstances would appear and consult with an attorney at the police station to protect his or her interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">We have always accorded trial judges wide discretion in ruling on motions for mistrial. They are in the best position to determine whether an error, especially an evidentiary error, is so dramatically prejudicial as to require a mistrial \u2014 to be beyond remedy by a curative instruction. Only in the rarest instances have we second-guessed a trial judge\u2019s determination in that regard. Citing cases that are wholly inapposite, the Court holds, as a matter of law, that the brief, unsolicited remark by Detective Mercer is of that character. To me, that is utter nonsense. Yes, it was error. That is not the point. The point, rather, is that this brief, unsolicited remark was immediately corrected by a clear and responsive curative instruction, that it occurred on the fourth day of trial, and that the overall evidence against Newman was more than abundant, if not, in fact, overwhelming. There is simply no rational basis for concluding that Detective Mercer\u2019s remark so thoroughly and uncorrectably tainted the trial that a mistrial was required as a matter of law. We have allowed far more grievous errors to be corrected by curative instructions. But for Judge Harrell\u2019s concurrence in this part of the dissent, which deprives the Court\u2019s opinion on this issue of any prece-dential value, its purported ruling would sow nothing but confusion; it could not be cabined to just remarks about post-<em>Miranda </em>silence. Every error that creeps into a trial would become the subject of a motion for mistrial, and trial judges would be acting at their peril if they did not grant the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Judge CATHELL and Judge RODOWSKY authorize me to state that they join in this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
