By the time we were able to hear the case, however, the moratorium had expired and was not renewed. The issue we took the cases to decide is therefore moot, and there is no indication that it is likely to recur in any kind of similar factual setting, as the basis for the moratorium has, itself, been dealt with by subsequent county legislation. We shall therefore dismiss these appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">\n<em>APPEALS DISMISSED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY CARROLL COUNTY.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
