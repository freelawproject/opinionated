Basically, we are considering whether it was reversible error for the trial court to explain to the jury a defense and its effect on the burden of proof as to a particular charge, where that defense was never proffered by the defendant, Lionel Brogden, petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-14\">On February 24, 2003, petitioner was tried by a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on the charges of burglary in the first degree, malicious destruction of property, and wearing, carrying or transporting a handgun. Petitioner presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>no defense at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief. That same day, petitioner was convicted of first degree burglary and carrying a handgun but was acquitted of malicious destruction. He was thereafter sentenced by the trial court to twenty years incarceration for the burglary, all suspended except ten years. A three-year sentence was imposed for the handgun conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Petitioner thereafter appealed the decision to the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland and, as relevant here, challenged, <em>inter alia, </em>the propriety of the trial court\u2019s supplemental jury instructions in respect to the handgun charge and the sentence in respect to that charge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On April 16, 2004, the intermediate appellate court, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. Petitioner thereafter filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari to this Court. On August 25, 2004, we granted the petition. <em>Brogden v. State, </em>382 Md. 687, 856 A.2d 723 (2004). Petitioner presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-6\">\u201c1. Is it improper to instruct the jury regarding a defense to a crime, when no evidence supporting that defense has been introduced and the accused objects to the instruction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-7\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that the trial court\u2019s instruction on the licensing exception to the handgun statute was correct, and in any event harmless, when that instruction placed the burden of proof on the defense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b891-8\">3. Should [petitioner\u2019s] sentences be construed to run concurrently as a matter of law where the sentence imposed for the second conviction was made consecutive to the sentence [petitioner] was then serving and [petitioner] was not serving any other sentence at the time of disposition?\u201d [Alterations added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>We hold that the trial judge\u2019s action of giving supplemental instructions, over petitioner\u2019s objection, to the jury during its deliberations, in which the trial judge discussed a possible defense theory as to a particular count that was entirely inapplicable to that count as presented, had never been proffered by the petitioner, and alluded to that defense as placing a burden of proof on petitioner, constitutes error on the part of the trial court. We further hold that this error, which only relates to petitioner\u2019s conviction on the charge of petitioner \u201cwearing, carrying or transporting\u201d a handgun and not his burglary conviction, was not harmless as to that handgun charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">On May 11, 2002, police responded to a 9-1-1 call reporting a burglary at 1603 West Lombard Street in Baltimore City. The call was made by Ms. Laticia Hawkins, who reported that upon arriving at her home around 7:30 or 8:00 p.m. she found that her apartment had been broken into and burglarized. According to Hawkins\u2019 testimony at trial, she had opened the outer door to her apartment when she heard a noise come from inside the apartment, which had been secured when she had left earlier in the evening. As Hawkins began to back out of the building, a male intruder opened the door to her apartment, pulled out a handgun and pointed it in her direction as he ran away. The intruder was clutching a bag while fleeing the scene and Hawkins later learned that several compact discs, a video camera and a VCR were missing from her apartment. She also noticed in her apartment a metal crowbar that did not belong to her and presumably was used to effect entry into her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">After a May 14, 2002 interview with Hawkins, Detective Thomas McDonald caused an arrest warrant to issue for petitioner based on information obtained during that interview.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioner was then arrested. At trial in the Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>Court for Baltimore City, Hawkins identified petitioner as the intruder she had encountered on May 11, 2002, and testified that she recognized him as a former neighbor who had once lived in the same apartment building. After the State\u2019s casein-chief, the defense rested without presenting any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">During jury deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial judge asking for clarification on two points: first, whether it was a crime to have a handgun, and secondly, whether the State had the burden of proving that petitioner did not have a license to carry a handgun. This appeal is mainly concerned with the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s response to the second point. It is imperative to note at the outset that petitioner, during the trial, never claimed to possess a permit for the carrying of a handgun. In fact, he presented no defense other than requiring the State to prove its case. Thus, absolutely no issue was raised during trial concerning the existence of a license for the handgun allegedly seen in petitioner\u2019s possession and no evidence was introduced pertaining to petitioner having, or not having, such a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The following dialogue took place between petitioner\u2019s attorney (\u201cMs. Meckler\u201d), the prosecutor (\u201cMr. Cox\u201d) and the trial judge relating to how the trial court should respond to the jury\u2019s questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-6\">THE COURT: The jury\u2019s question \u2014 I\u2019m going to read them exactly the way they\u2019re written on here. I don\u2019t see anything else. It doesn\u2019t say any beginning or ending. It doesn\u2019t say Judge or, you know \u2014 I\u2019m going to read you only what\u2019s on the sheet. \u201cIs having a gun a crime?\u201d That\u2019s the first one. Next one, \u201cDoes the State have the burden to prove that he did not have a license (to carry the gun)?\u201d All right. The first one; what\u2019s your response on that, Mr. Cox?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-7\">MR. COX [PROSECUTOR]: I would say, yes, under the\u2014 under the way the jury instruction was formulated. I might say \u2014 suggest that you should read them the jury instruction again. But to the second part, I would, certainly, say no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>THE COURT: I think \u2014 you know, what I think \u2014 I think they\u2019re digging a little deeper there, but it isn\u2019t a crime to own a gun; it\u2019s only a crime to wear, carry, and transport a gun without a license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-5\">MR. COX: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-6\">THE COURT: I think that\u2019s what I would have to tell the jury, that under some circumstances, it may be a crime to own a gun. But I would say this, my inclination is to say, if you have not been convicted previously of a felony or a crime of violence or of having had a gun illegally, that it is not a crime to own a gun. However, it is a crime to wear, carry, and transport a gun, in accordance with my instructions. That is my inclination on question one. What\u2019s your response to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-7\">MS. MECKLER [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I think if you give them that, they\u2019re going to come back with, \u201cWell, does he have any prior convictions?\u201d I think it\u2019s just going to open a can of worms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-8\">THE COURT: All right. So you don\u2019t want me to say that. Just say that, in our society, it is permissible to own a gun, but it is not permissible to wear, carry, and transport a gun in Maryland without a license; how\u2019s that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-9\">THE COURT: ... That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do in the first one. Now, let\u2019s go to the second one. \u201cDoes the State have the burden to prove that he did not have his license?\u201d What\u2019s your answer to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-10\">MR. COX: No, Your Honor ... I don\u2019t believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-11\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t think so either. What\u2019s your response to that Ms. Meckler? In fact, it\u2019s just the reverse. They\u2019ve got \u2014 the Defendant \u2014 in Maryland law, the Defendant has to show that he has a license in order to justify having a gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-12\">MR. COX: Your Honor, I don\u2019t even believe that \u2014 in the first part, I don\u2019t even think there should be any reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>to a license; just the State doesn\u2019t have to prove that he did not have one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-4\">MS. MECKLER: Your Honor, I would\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-5\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019m going to tell them that the State doesn\u2019t have to prove that. In fact, it\u2019s just the reverse; the Defendant has to prove it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-6\">MR. COX: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-7\">MS. MECKLER: Regarding question four, \u201cIs having a gun a crime,\u201d I\u2019m going to ask just the Maryland pattern jury instruction for wear, carry, and transport be read ... <em>as to does the State have the burden to prove he did not have a license. That\u2019s not before the jury. The jury is not being asked to consider that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-8\">THE COURT: Well, that definitely is before the jury. The jury is coming up with far-reaching philosophical approaches to the question of guns.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-9\">MS. MECKLER: So I would just say \u2014 I would just ask that, you know, the jury just be instructed that\u2019s not something that \u2014 it\u2019s not before the jury for you to determine that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-10\">THE COURT: Okay. Well, I disagree with you. I\u2019m going to answer that the way I told you. I don\u2019t think the jury should be not told anything ... and not have their questions answered. I believe that when a jury reaches out intelligently into a question, that they have a right to an answer, and I\u2019ve always felt that way. I\u2019ve always disagreed with this policy of trying to isolate juries from the realities of life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-11\">In fact, in the State of Maryland, it is absolutely permissible to own a gun, as you know, in your house or in other places where the law permits it.... However, it is not legal in Maryland to carry, wear, or transport a gun without a license.... A license means you can carry a gun under restricted circumstances, which the license says. And it\u2019s the burden of the Defense to produce a license, if, in fact, there is one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>MS. MECKLER: Your Honor, are you going to \u2014 you\u2019re not going to tell the jury that though, are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-5\">THE COURT: Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-6\">MS. MECKLER: Okay. <em>I\u2019m going to object. </em>I don\u2019t think that the jury \u2014 the Court instructed the jury that the State had the burden of proof. <em>By saying or talking about this license is irrelevant, and by now bringing wp burden of proof, you\u2019re now shifting the burden to the Defense. We never raised the issue of a license, </em>and I think by \u2014 as soon as you say the word \u201cburden of proof,\u201d you\u2019re going to automatically shift the burden to the Defense, and there\u2019s no reason to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-7\">THE COURT: Well, I think there is [a] burden on the Defense to produce a license, if there is one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-8\">MS. MECKLER: <em>Had we brought that up, had we opened the door, had we brought that up as a defense, I would agree. We did not. </em>The jury is overreaching. And now what the Court\u2019s going to be doing is now saying, well, now the State no longer has the burden; the burden is now on the Defense to create a defense that we never came up with. This is something the jury has come up with on their own, and I don\u2019t feel that we should now be put in a position\u2014 just because they have a question, that we should now be told that ... the burden\u2019s on us, because then they\u2019re going to feel that, well, I should have put on evidence regarding the license. I have no burden to put on any type of defense. THE COURT: Okay. We\u2019ll let the appellate courts deal with it ... I disagree with you. Let them decide it. Bring [the jury] in.\u201d [Alterations added.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">When the jurors were brought back into the courtroom following this conversation between the trial court judge and the opposing attorneys, the trial judge instructed them as follows with respect to the jury\u2019s second question regarding the effect a gun license has on the burden of proof:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: ... All right. Now the second part of that question says, \u2018Does the State have the burden to prove that [the defendant] did not have a license in Maryland?\u2019 A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>license, by the way, which is different from registration. A license means whatever it says. A license to wear and carry a handgun is permissible, if you have a license; and you may wear, or carry, or transport a handgun, if you have a license, in accordance with the terms on the license.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-5\">\u201cEach license may have different terms. It might say you can carry it when you go to the bank, or it might say you can carry it at night. It might have different things, but that\u2019s what the license says. <em>It\u2019s the burden of the Defendant to prove the existence of the license, if one exists, not the State. </em>Does the jury understand my instructions? All right. You may now go back to the jury room and continue your deliberations.\u201d [Alteration added.] [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">After receiving these supplemental jury instructions, the jury arrived at its verdict very soon thereafter<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and petitioner was convicted of first degree burglary and of wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Petitioner contends that the trial court erred when it gave supplemental instructions to the jury which considered the existence of a handgun license where the issue of whether petitioner had such a license was never set forth by petitioner as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">In <em>Chambers v. State, </em>387 Md. 44, 48, 650 A.2d 727, 729 (1994), this Court stated that \u201c[t]he main purpose of a jury instruction is to aid the jury in clearly understanding the case, to provide guidance for the jury\u2019s deliberations, and to help the jury arrive at a correct verdict.\u201d Maryland Rule 4-325 addresses jury instructions in criminal cases and states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-10\">\u201c(a) When given. The court shall give instructions to the jury at the conclusion of all the evidence and before closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>arguments and may supplement them at a later time <em>when appropriate. </em>In its discretion the court may also give opening and interim instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">(c) How given. The court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the <em>applicable </em>law and the extent to which the instructions are binding. The court may give its instructions orally or, with the consent of the parties, in writing instead of orally. The court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-6\">(d) Reference to evidence. In instructing the jury, the court may refer to or summarize the evidence in order to present clearly the issues to be decided. In that event, the court shall instruct the jury that it is the sole judge of the facts, the weight of the evidence, and the credibility of the witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-7\">(e) Objection. No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury. An appellate court, on its own initiative or on the suggestion of a party, may however take cognizance of any plain error in the instructions, material to the rights of the defendant, despite a failure to object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-8\">(f) Argument. Nothing in this Rule precludes any party from arguing that the law applicable to the case is different from the law described in the instructions of the court stated not to be binding.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">As Md. Rule 4-325(a) states, jury instructions may be \u201csupplemented\u201d by the trial court \u201cwhen appropriate.\u201d While this Court has stated that a question of \u201c[w]hether to give a jury supplemental instructions in a criminal cause is within the discretion of the trial judge,\u201d <em>Lovell v. State, </em>347 Md. 623, 657, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>702 A.2d 261, 278 (1997), it is only within the ambit of the trial judge\u2019s discretion in the first instance if the supplemental instruction actually relates to an issue presented at trial. Petitioner claims that the supplemental instructions given by the trial judge to the jury during its deliberations were inappropriate because those instructions involved the issue of whether petitioner possessed a license to carry a handgun, an issue (and defense) <em>never presented at trial by petitioner </em>or by the State. As this Court stated in <em>Carter v. State, </em>366 Md. 574, 583, 785 A.2d 348, 353 (2001), \u201c[w]ith respect to the law to be applied in the case, when requested, it is the duty of the trial judge to instruct on the essential elements of the crime charged, any defenses <em>supported by the evidence, </em>and the burden of proof and presumption of innocence\u201d (emphasis added). We have also stated that \u201ca trial judge has a duty, upon request in a criminal case, to instruct the jury <em>on the applicable law. ... </em>This Court has interpreted Rule 4-325(e) as \u2018requir[ing] the trial court to give a requested instruction under the following circumstances: (1) the requested instruction is a correct statement of the law; (2) the requested instruction <em>is applicable under the facts of the ease; </em>and (3) the content of the requested instruction was not fairly covered elsewhere in the jury instruction actually given.\u2019 \u201d <em>Patterson v. State, </em>356 Md. 677, 683-84, 741 A.2d 1119, 1122 (1999) (some emphasis added) (quoting <em>Ware v. State, </em>348 Md. 19, 58, 702 A.2d 699, 718 (1997)); <em>see also Mack v. State, </em>300 Md. 583, 592, 479 A.2d 1344, 1348 (1984) (stating that \u201ca trial judge must give a requested instruction that correctly states the applicable law ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">At petitioner\u2019s trial on the burglary and handgun charges, petitioner chose to rest without presenting any evidence in his defense. Therefore, <em>no issue was raised </em>during trial concerning the existence of a defense that petitioner had a license for the handgun allegedly seen in petitioner\u2019s possession. This necessarily indicated a strategic choice by petitioner not to attempt to set forth the affirmative defense that he possessed a license to carry a handgun. At the time of petitioner\u2019s alleged offenses, Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 2001 Supp.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>Art. 27, \u00a7 36B provided the applicable law on the \u201cwearing, carrying or transporting\u201d of a handgun.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-5\">\u201c\u00a7 36B. Wearing, carrying or transporting handgun; unlawful use in commission of crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-6\">(b) <em>Unlawful wearing, carrying, or transporting of handguns; penalties. </em>\u2014 Any person who shall wear, carry, or transport any handgun, whether concealed or open, upon or about his person ... shall be guilty of a misdemeanor; and it shall be a rebuttable presumption that the person is knowingly transporting the handgun....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-7\">(c) Exceptions.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-8\">(2) Nothing in this section shall prevent the wearing, carrying, or transporting of a handgun by any person to whom a permit to wear, carry or transport any such weapon has been issued under \u00a7 36E of this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">Section 36B (c)(2) of Article 27 existed (and still exists presently as \u00a7 4-203(b)(2) of the Criminal Law Article) as an affirmative defense to the \u201cwearing, carrying or transporting\u201d of a handgun prohibition. It is a defense that, if set forth at trial, admits that the defendant <em>did in fact </em>have a handgun in his possession but that he should not be found guilty of violating any law because he had a license to have the handgun in his immediate possession at the time. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 451 (8th ed.2004) (defining \u201caffirmative defense\u201d as \u201c[a] defendant\u2019s assertion of facts and arguments that, if true, will defeat the plaintiffs or prosecution\u2019s claim, even if all the allegations in the complaint are true\u201d). Because \u00a7 36B (c)(2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>existed as an exception to the statutory prohibition against the carrying of a handgun, it was not the responsibility of the State to prove that the exception did not apply, but it was exclusively within petitioner\u2019s discretion as to whether he would pursue such a defense. This principle was made clear by this Court in <em>Mackall v. State, </em>283 Md. 100, 387 A.2d 762 (1978), in which we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-5\">\u201c[Wjhen a penal act contains an exception so incorporated with the substance of the clause defining the offense as to constitute a material part of the description of the acts, omission or other ingredients which constitute the offense, the burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt, that the offense charged is not within the exception. In other words, when an exception is descriptive of the offense or so incorporated in the clause creating it as to make the exception a part of the offense, the State must negate the exception to prove its case. <em>But, when an exception is not descriptive of the offense or so incorporated in the clause creating it as to make the exception a part of the offense, the exception must be interposed by the accused as an affirmative defense.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-6\"><em>Mackall, </em>283 Md. at 110-11, 387 A.2d at 767-68 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">It is clear from the record before us that petitioner never attempted to set forth such an affirmative defense in any pleading or at trial. Nor did the State present any evidence of a license or lack thereof. Issues of a license are entirely absent from the trial prior to the point of the jury\u2019s question.'<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, the trial judge\u2019s supplemental instruction to the jury stating that, \u201cIt\u2019s the burden of the Defendant to prove the existence of the license, if one exists, not the State,\u201d was inappropriately rendered. At that point, the burden was solely on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner did indeed burglarize Hawkins\u2019 apartment and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>have a gun on his person during the commission of that crime. Because petitioner chose not to pursue a defense relating to him possessing a license for a handgun (or any defense), there was absolutely no reason for the trial judge, over objection, to instruct the jury as to the law of handgun licenses and its effect on the burden of proof (whatever that effect might be). <em>See Evans v. </em>State, 28 Md.App. 640, 667, 349 A.2d 300, 319 (1975), <em>aff'd, </em>278 Md. 197, 362 A.2d 629 (1976) (observing that \u201cMaryland has consistently held that [jury] instructions <em>need not and should not </em>be given on particular defenses unless and until there is evidence sufficient to generate a legitimate jury issue with respect to a particular defense\u201d) (alteration added) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">The supplemental jury instructions at issue here were simply not \u201cappropriate\u201d under Md. Rule 4-325 in that they did not state the \u201capplicable law\u201d as to the issues relating to the handgun charge then properly before the jury for deliberation. At the point the supplemental instruction was given, the entire burden of proving the commission of that particular crime rested with the State. Petitioner had presented no defense. The jury had already been correctly instructed. To then inform the jury that petitioner had the burden of establishing the existence of a license in order to prevail on a defense that petitioner had never raised, was to impose a burden on petitioner that he never had. Under these circumstances it could not have been harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">While it may be commonplace for a jury to pose questions during deliberations to a trial court for clarification and often these questions are reasonable, this does not mean that a trial court judge is obliged to provide answers via supplemental instructions to every question that a jury presents to the court, especially when those questions deal with aspects of the law that have absolutely nothing to do with the case <em>as ;presented to that jury </em>and create burdens of proof on a defendant, that the defendant, under the circumstances of the particular case, does not have. The jury should be limited in its deliberations to the issues and evidence as presented to it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>and should not be given answers to inquiries which reach outside of the case as presented at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Our holding is bolstered further by the Court of Appeals of New York\u2019s opinion in <em>People of the State of New York v. DeGina, </em>72 N.Y.2d 768, 537 N.Y.S.2d 8, 533 N.E.2d 1037 (1988). In <em>DeGina, </em>the defendant was on trial for the sale of illegal drugs to an undercover police officer. Because defense counsel had stated in his opening that the undercover agent had tried \u201cto ensnare an innocent man,\u201d the trial court granted, over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the State\u2019s request that the jury be instructed on the defense of entrapment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>defendant was thereafter convicted of several counts of criminal sales of controlled substances. On appeal to the Court of Appeals of New York, the court was presented with two questions, very similar in substance to the ones now before this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-5\">\u201c[F]irst, was it error for the trial court to instruct the jury on the affirmative defense of entrapment over defendant\u2019s consistent protestations that he was not advancing an entrapment defense, but was in fact putting forth a different defense, and second \u2014 if error \u2014 was the error harmless?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-6\"><em>DeGina, </em>72 N.Y.2d at 771, 537 N.Y.S.2d 8, 533 N.E.2d at 1038.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">In reversing defendant\u2019s convictions, the Court of Appeals of New York found that the defendant had never raised the defense of entrapment at trial but instead \u201c[h]is defense was to deny engaging in the \u2018proscribed conduct\u2019 at all.... \u201d Id. at 775, 537 N.Y.S.2d 8, 533 N.E.2d at 1040. The court went on to hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-8\">\u201cHaving concluded from a fair reading of the record that defendant did not raise the entrapment defense, we further agree with the Appellate Division that it was error to accede to the People\u2019s request for such an instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-9\">\u201cImposing the burden of proving entrapment on defendant, who had not raised it, constituted an abuse of the affirmative defense in derogation of defendant\u2019s right to have the State bear the entire burden of proof. Moreover, <em>a trial court is not authorized to instruct the jury on legal principles that are not applicable to the particular case </em>.... As we have recognized, jury instructions have singular significance in criminal trials, where a charge error may well result in the deprivation of a fair trial and require reversal.... Whether or not reversible error in every ease, the erroneous instruction prejudiced defendant in at least two respects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number><em>\u201cFirst, a defendant unquestionably has the right to chart his own defense </em>... and in this case the entrapment charge undermined the defense chosen by the defendant. In telling the jury that when counsel used the word \u2018ensnare\u2019 he was really raising the defense of entrapment, the court\u2019s instruction effectively impaired the success of the different inferences urged by defendant....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-5\"><em>\u201cSecond, the court imposed on defendant an affirmative burden of proof he had not undertaken by his defense theory. </em>The jury was charged that defendant had the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that [the undercover officer] actively enticed him into committing the crime, and that without such enticement defendant would not have been disposed to commit the crime. Understandably, in light of his quite different defense, defendant did not attempt to present evidence, through his own witnesses or through cross-examination, to demonstrate that [the undercover officer] actively encouraged or induced him to sell drugs ... as would have been required to prevail upon a claim of entrapment. Nor did defendant make any affirmative effort to meet his burden of showing a lack of disposition to commit the charged crimes, as it was his claim that they had never happened at all. <em>Thus, the court\u2019s charge imposed upon defendant an affirmative burden that the jury was bound to conclude he had failed to sustain </em>.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b905-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 776-77, 537 N.Y.S.2d 8, 533 N.E.2d at 1041-42 (citations omitted) (some emphasis added). Finding that the jury instructions were indeed in error, the court then moved onto the second part of its analysis, <em>i.e., </em>whether the error was harmless or not. In holding that the error was not harmless, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b905-7\">\u201cWhile it is true, as the People point out, that the trial court initially, and properly, charged the jury that they were not to reach the affirmative defense of entrapment unless and until they determined that the People had met their higher burden of proving the elements of the charged crimes, we do not therefore conclude that defendant could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>not have been prejudiced by the imposition of a burden that he was unprepared to meet. In that defendant advanced only a defense \u2014 as to which he had no affirmative burden of proof ... <em>\u2014the suggestion that he had assumed a burden of proof in connection with his defense itself had the potential to mislead the </em>jury.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 778, 537 N.Y.S.2d 8, 533 N.E.2d at 1042 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>petitioner, by entering a plea of not guilty and then resting at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, raised only the defense that he had not committed the offenses at all, not that he had some affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">The State attempts to distinguish <em>DeGina </em>from the case <em>sub judice </em>by stating that, unlike in <em>DeGina:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-7\">\u201cHere, the instruction on the permit exception to the handgun violation was requested not by the prosecutor, but by the jury itself. There is no suggestion in the present case that the prosecutor was attempting to gain an advantage by confusing the jury or introducing a defense that it knew [petitioner] could not provide. Under Maryland law ... the trial court has a duty to clarify the law where the jury indicates that it needs clarification.\u201d [Alteration added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">What the State fails to realize is that while the trial court may sometimes have a duty to clarify the law where the jury indicates it needs clarification, such clarification is only appropriate if it concerns <em>the law applicable to the case as already presented to the jury. See </em>Md. Rule 4-325(c). One supposes that a jury could question myriad aspects of the law during its deliberations, but there has never existed a duty for the trial court to reply to jury questions which have nothing to do with the case as it was presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">Because we hold that the trial court erred in its response to the jury\u2019s inquiry as to the effect of a license on the handgun charge, we too must necessarily examine whether the trial court\u2019s action should or should not be considered harmless error. For reasons similar to those espoused by the Court of Appeals of New York in <em>DeGina, </em>we hold that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>trial court\u2019s error regarding the supplemental jury instructions was not a harmless error but likely unfairly prejudicial to petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">As stated, petitioner did not put on any evidence at trial in his defense \u2014 he merely relied on a presumption of innocence, which he unquestionably is entitled to do. <em>See Coffin v. United States, </em>156 U.S. 432, 453, 15 S.Ct. 394, 403, 39 L.Ed. 481 (1895) (stating that \u201c[t]he principle that there is a presumption of innocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law\u201d); <em>see also Williams v. State, </em>322 Md. 35, 42, 585 A.2d 209, 212 (1991) (stating that \u201c[w]hen we have referred to the presumption of innocence, we have followed with a warning to the effect that \u2018in order to warrant a finding of guilt, it is incumbent upon the State affirmatively to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Malcolm v. State, </em>232 Md. 222, 225, 192 A.2d 281, 283 (1963)).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">At the point when the case was handed over to the jury for deliberations as to defendant\u2019s innocence or guilt of the handgun charge, the jury was required to consider solely whether the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that petitioner was carrying a handgun on his person as he fled from the apartment building. Notwithstanding the curiosity of the jury, made evident by its question to the trial court judge about whether the State had a burden to prove that petitioner did not have a license for the handgun, it constituted error for the trial court judge to then remark in his supplemental instructions to the jury that petitioner, and not the State, carried the burden of proving that he had a handgun license if one existed when petitioner <em>had never countered the charges against him with such a defense. </em>The instructions, however correct, imposed a burden petitioner, under the circumstances of the case, did not have.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">In <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976), we stated \u201c[w]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u2018harmless\u2019 and a reversal is mandated.\u201d We do not find that the error at issue in this case was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">As we recently stated in the case of <em>Fleming v. State, </em>373 Md. 426, 432-33, 818 A.2d 1117, 1121 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-6\"><em>\u201cThe defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed on any theory of the defense that is fairly supported by the evidence. </em>Whether a particular instruction must be given depends upon whether there is any evidence in the case that supports the instruction; if the requested instruction has not been generated by the evidence, the trial court is not required to give it. Whether the evidence is sufficient to generate the required instruction in the first instance is a question of law for the judge. <em>In evaluating whether competent evidence exists to generate the requested instruction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the accused. </em>\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-7\">\u201cOn appeal, instructions are reviewed in their entirety to determine if reversal is required. The jury instructions must be read together, and if, taken as a whole, they correctly state the law, are <em>not misleading, </em>and cover adequately <em>the issues raised by the evidence, </em>the defendant has not been prejudiced and reversal is inappropriate. Reversal is not required where the jury instructions, taken as a whole, sufficiently protect the defendant\u2019s rights and adequately covered the theory of the defense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-8\"><em>Fleming, </em>373 Md. at 432-33, 818 A.2d at 1121 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">In the case sub <em>judice, </em>by instructing the jury as to which party bore the burden of establishing whether petitioner possessed a handgun license/permit, the trial judge improperly instructed the jury and injected into the jury deliberations a defense theory that <em>was never raised at trial by the petitioner </em>and misleading as to which party bore the ultimate burden of proof as to the handgun charge. The trial judge\u2019s supplemen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>tal instructions insinuated to the jury that a possible defense theory to the handgun violation existed that was not pursued by petitioner. After the trial judge announced to the parties how he was going to respond to the jury\u2019s questions, defense counsel for petitioner understandably stated her concerns with the supplemental instructions when she stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b909-5\">\u201cHad we brought that up, had we opened the door, had we brought that up as a defense, I would agree. We did not. The jury is overreaching. And now what the Court\u2019s going to be doing is now saying, well, now the State no longer has the burden; <em>the burden is now on the Defense to create a defense that we never came up with.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Because no evidence had ever been entered into evidence regarding whether petitioner possessed a license to carry a handgun, any instruction to the jury relating to the burden of proving the existence of such license was improper and constituted error. At that point in the trial, where that defense had never been raised, it simply was not within the province of the trial court to instruct the jury in the particular area of the law from which the jury question arose, thereby allowing the jury to lose focus from the proper issues involved. This was not harmless error. The jury should have instead been instructed to confine its deliberations to the issues and evidence properly before it and the instructions already given and not to speculate on matters as to which no evidence had been introduced. This is especially so when the supplemental instruction given imposes a duty on a defendant to prove the existence of an affirmative defense never raised. We hold that the trial court committed reversible error in relation to the handgun charge.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>With our reversal of the handgun conviction the third question relating to a consecutive sentence on the handgun charge becomes moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AS TO THE HANDGUN CHARGE REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO VACATE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AS TO THE HANDGUN CHARGE; OTHER CONVICTIONS AFFIRMED.

Wilh respect to the supplementary instruction now in issue, the dispositive answer is that the appellant did not request it. There was, therefore, no possible way that the appellant could be denied an instruction to which he was entitled. Rule 4-325(c) addresses no other problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-8\">\u201cOur conclusion as to excessive and frequently unnecessary jury instruction was 1) that the phenomenon is sad, 2) that it is unfortunate, and 3) that it nonetheless happens all the time. It has never been suggested that it is reversible error. A rule requiring a necessary instruction does not forbid an unnecessary instruction. It is under-inclusion that runs the risk of error. Over-inclusion only runs the risk of boredom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b903-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 424-27, 822 A.2d at 447-48 (alteration added). We disagree with the intermediate appellate court's assessment of the breadth of Md. Rule 4-325(c). We believe that the intermediate appellate court paints with too broad a brush in its conception that a superfluous jury instruction can never amount to error. We recognize in the case <em>sub judice </em>that sometimes it can. This is especially so when the unnecessary instruction purports to place a burden of proof on a defendant to prove a defense that the defendant never raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b903-10\">. As the Court of Appeals of New York recognized, because the defense of entrapment exists in that state as \u201can <em>affirmative </em>defense, the burden to establish these elements by a preponderance of the evidence is placed on the defendant \u2014 unlike other defenses, as to which the defendant has no burden and which the People must disprove beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>doubt.\u201d <em>DeGina, </em>72 N.Y.2d at 775, 537 N.Y.S.2d 8, 533 N.E.2d at 1040.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b909-7\">. Our holding does not affect the validity of the jury finding petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime of burglary. The supplemental jury instructions at issue in the case at bar did not address any of the elements of the separate burglary charge or the applicable burden of proof as to that charge.

I think, however, that, in this instance, it was not inappropriate for the trial court to take cognizance of the questions raised by the jury and to make <em>some </em>response to them, for, if it declined to do so, one or more jurors may have reached a verdict on wholly inappropriate and speculative grounds. I think that the appropriate response, in light of the questions, should have been that (1) wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun without a permit is unlawful; (2) the defendant has not claimed that he had a permit; and (3) because the defendant has not claimed that he had a permit, it is not an issue in the case and the State was therefore not required to offer evidence that he did not have one. That would have answered the jury\u2019s question in a proper and neutral manner without getting into burdens of proof, misstating the law, or prejudicing either the defendant or the State. It would have returned the jury\u2019s focus to where it should have been on that count \u2014 whether the defendant, in fact, was carrying a handgun, not whether he was entitled to carry such a weapon.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b911-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>RAKER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYe\">dissenting, with whom HARRELL, J., joins:</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">I would affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on the grounds of harmless error. Although the court formulated an incorrect response to the jury note as to whether the State has the burden of proving that the defendant did not have a gun license in Maryland, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">The jury obviously had determined that the defendant was in actual possession of the handgun and was thus wearing, carrying or transporting the gun. Since he raised no defense that he was licensed or permitted to carry, wear or transport this gun, he in fact received <em>more </em>than he was entitled to receive. <em>See Parker v. State, </em>7 Md.App. 167, 181-82, 254 A.2d 381, 389 (1969) (finding that in considering the propriety of an instruction, \u201ceven if it be so construed, there was no error in the instruction requiring reversal, as the defendant received more than that to which he was entitled\u201d). It made no difference as to who had the burden on this issue, because there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that he lawfully could carry or transport this handgun. When a defendant has a defense before the jury, even though he did not raise it, and it is one that could exonerate him, he can hardly complain about the instruction. \u201c[A] defendant who has received more than he is entitled to is in no position to complain.\u201d <em>United States v. Seavey, </em>180 F.2d 837, 840 (3d Cir.1950); <em>United States v. Nutter, </em>22 M.J. 727, 729 (A.C.M.R.1986). <em>See also People v. Osband, </em>13 Cal.4th 622, 55 Cal.Rptr.2d 26, 919 P.2d 640, 681 (1996) (holding error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because defendant received more than he was entitled to when the jury was instructed on the \u201cspecific intent\u201d to commit the underlying felony of rape). There was no reasonable possibility that the jury could have misunderstood the burden of proof as to the other counts. Accordingly, the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts addressed a similar issue in <em>Commonwealth v. Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 632 N.E.2d 821 (1994). The defendant complained on appeal of an erroneous instruction as to self-defense. The court pointed out that \u201c[t]he defendants\u2019 arguments fail because neither was entitled to any instruction on self-defense. Thus, whatever the judge said about self-defense, and the use of excessive force in self-defense, was more favorable to the defendants than they deserved and could not have prejudiced their positions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 830. <em>See also Commonwealth v.
