DuVall, the respondent. The petition charged that the respondent violated Rules 1.4, Communication,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 1.15, Safekeeping Property,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1.16, Declining or Terminating Repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>sentation,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 8.1, Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, as adopted by Maryland Rule 16-812.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The respondent was also charged with violating Maryland Code (1989, 2000 Replacement Volume) \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">We referred the case, pursuant to Rules 16-752(a),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to the Honorable William B. Spellbring, of the Circuit Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Prince George\u2019s County, for hearing pursuant to Rule 16-757(c).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The respondent was not served personally, despite reasonable efforts to do so. Consequently, service of process was made, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-753, on Janet Moss, Administrator of the Client Protection Fund of the Bar of Maryland. Thereafter, an order of default was entered against the respondent and a hearing date set. Following the hearing, at which the respondent not appear or participate, the hearing court, \u201c[hjaving considered the unrefuted aver-ments of the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action, along with evidence presented by the Petitioner,\u201d found facts by the clear and convincing standard and drew conclusions of law, as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\n<em>Findings of Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u201cThe Respondent was admitted to the Maryland Bar on December 10, 1981. By an Opinion and Order of the Court of Appeals filed March 17, 2003, she was indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Maryland, effective thirty days after the filing of the opinion. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Duvall, </em>373 Md. 482, 819 A.2d 343 (2003). The Respondent has not petitioned for reinstatement since her indefinite suspension took effect on April 16, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u201cThe legal representation which is the subject of the disciplinary complaint now before the court began several years prior to the commencement of the Respondent\u2019s indefinite suspension. In August, 1996, Robert Ravenscroft retained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Respondent to provide legal advice and services pertaining to the placement of Mr. Ravenscroft\u2019s sister, Leah Ravenscroft, in the National Lutheran Home for the Aged in Rockville, Maryland. At the time of Mr. Ravenscroft\u2019s initial contact with the Respondent, the Respondent maintained an office for the practice of law in College Park, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u201cOn August 27, 1996, Mr. Ravenscroft gave the Respondent a personal check in the amount of $1,700.00, drawn on a checking account held in the name of Leah Ravenscroft. The memo notation on the check indicated that $200.00 was to be applied toward the \u201ccosts\u201d and $1,500.00 was for \u201cfees.\u201d The $1,500.00 portion designated for fees was an advance retainer to be earned by the Respondent at a billing rate of $125.00 per hour. The Respondent endorsed the $1,700.00 check \u201cfor deposit only.\u201d Although the back of the negotiated check does not reflect whether the deposit was made to an attorney trust account, there is no question that the Respondent received the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u201cInitially, the legal action suggested to Robert Ravenscroft by the Respondent was to petition for a \u201cconservatorship\u201d of Leah Ravenscroft\u2019s affairs. It was later decided that such action was not necessary, and that the Respondent instead prepared a Power of Attorney granting Robert Ravenscroft authority to handle Leah Ravenscroft\u2019s affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\u201cIn the course of providing representation, the Respondent sent Mr. Ravenscroft two billing statements. The first, dated September 13, 1996, identified legal services rendered through that date and contained an entry stating that $431.25 had been taken as a payment from the Respondent\u2019s escrow account for professional services rendered. The second billing statement, dated May 2, 1997, identified additional legal services through that date, including the preparation of a Last Will and Testament for Leah Ravenscroft, and contained an entry stating that $171.25 had been taken as a \u201cpayment from account\u201d for professional services rendered. The second billing statement reflected that as of May 2,1997, the Respondent was holding a balance of client funds in the amount of $1,097.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>\u201cIn March 1999, Leah Ravenscroft was accepted as a resident at the National Lutheran Home in Rockville. Robert Ravenscroft testified in this proceeding that the only additional professional service rendered by the Respondent after May 2, 1997 was to prepare a real Estate Power of Attorney in August 1999 related to the sale of real property owned by Leah Ravenscroft in the District of Columbia. The Respondent never billed Mr. Ravenscroft for the preparation of that document.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u201cBy a letter dated August 1, 2001, sent to the Respondent\u2019s office address in College Park, Mr. Ravenscroft requested in writing that the Respondent review her records and refund the balance of client funds due to Leah Ravenscroft. The Respondent did not respond in any manner to Mr. Raven-scroft\u2019s letter. At various times after August 2001, Mr. Ra-venscroft attempted to reach the Respondent by telephone but was unsuccessful. On January 3, 2003, he learned that the respondent\u2019s office phone number had been disconnected.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u201cIn a letter dated January 6, 2003, Mr. Ravenscroft wrote to the Attorney Grievance Commission to report the Respondent\u2019s actions and his inability to contact her. By a letter to the Respondent dated January 17, 2003, mailed to the Respondent\u2019s home address in Greenbelt, Maryland, as provided by the Client Protection Fund, Bar Counsel forwarded Mr. Ra-venscroft\u2019s complaint and requested that the Respondent respond in writing to that complaint within ten days. The Respondent did not respond as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\u201cOn February 5, 2003, Bar Counsel sent the Respondent a second letter asking her to respond to Mr. Ravenscroft\u2019s complaint by February 14, 2003. The original of that letter was sent to the Respondent\u2019s home address by certified mail. A copy was mailed by regular first class mail. The certified mail envelope was returned by the U.S. Postal Service with a sticker providing a Post Office Box number in College Park. The envelope sent by first class mail was not returned to the office of the Attorney Grievance Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u201cThe Respondent has not responded to Bar Counsel\u2019s lawful demands for information in response to Mr. Ravenscroft\u2019s complaint. Such requests were made before the commencement of the Respondent\u2019s indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u201cThe Respondent has not accounted for the balance of Leah Ravenscroft\u2019s advance retainer, nor has she refunded the unearned client funds belonging to Leah Ravenscroft.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\n<em>Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u201cBy failing to respond to Robert Ravenscroft\u2019s request for an accounting of the retainer paid on behalf of Leah Raven-scroft and not keeping him informed as to the status of such funds, the Respondent violated Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.4(a), dealing with communication. The Respondent\u2019s failure to hold the unearned balance of the Ravenscroft retainer separate from her own property after May 2, 1997 may reasonably be inferred from the evidence presented. Such conduct violated Rule 1.15(a) of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct. The Respondent also violated Rules 1.15(b) and 1.16(d) when she failed to promptly deliver the advance payment of fee that had not been earned to client, Robert Ravenscroft, upon the conclusion of any active representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u201cThe unearned portion of the Ravenscroft retainer held by the Respondent as of May 2, 1997 constituted \u201ctrust money\u201d as defined in the Maryland Code, Business Occupations and Professions Article, \u00a7 10-301(d). As trust money, the balance of $ 1, 097.50 should have been maintained in an attorney trust account until such funds were earned by the Respondent as legal fees, expended as costs associated with the representation or refunded to the client upon conclusion of the representation. This court concludes that at some point after May 2, 1997, the Respondent no longer maintained the unearned balance of $ 1, 097.50 in trust and further concludes that she used such funds, which belonged to Leah Ravenscroft, for an unauthorized purpose in violation of \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u201cFinally, the Respondent violated Rule 8.1(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct by knowingly failing to respond to lawful demands for information from a disciplinary authority when ignored Bar Counsel\u2019s letter requesting a response to Mr. Ravenscroft\u2019s complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">As indicated, the respondent did not participate in the proceedings. The petitioner did not file any exceptions to the findings and conclusions of the hearing court. It did, however, make a recommendation for sanction, that the respondent be disbarred from the practice of law. In support of the recommendation, the petitioner emphasizes that the respondent as found by the hearing court to have \u201ccommitted multiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct,\u201d including failing to account for the unearned portion of a retainer, failing, despite being requested to do so to refund that unearned portion to the client and using those funds, which constituted trust funds, for a purpose other than that for which it was entrusted to the respondent. The petitioner also directs our attention to the fact that the respondent has previously been disciplined and, significantly,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\">\u201cWhile the previous disciplinary proceeding was still pending before the Court in early 2008, Bar Counsel received the complaint that is the subject of the current proceeding. Prior to her suspension, the Respondent ignored Bar Counsel\u2019s efforts to obtain information in response to the complaint filed by Robert Ravenscroft. She also did not respond at any stage of the subsequent disciplinary process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">It found it important that, unlike the current proceedings, in which the respondent did not participate at all, in the prior proceeding, the respondent participated, offering some explanation for her misconduct, that, at the time, her judgment was impaired by the depression, from which she was suffering, and refunded the unearned fee to the complaining client. The petitioner concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">\u201cGiven her prior experience in the disciplinary system, the Respondent, if she had any interest in regaining her eligibility to practice law at some point in the future, should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>recognized the importance of responding to Bar Counsel and of answering the formal disciplinary charges related to Mr. Ravenscroft\u2019s complaint. <em>See Attorney Grievance Commission v. Powell, </em>369 Md. 462, 475, 800 A.2d 782, 790 (2002) (\u201cAfter a disciplinary action, this Court expects a renewed commitment to professional standards and ethical conduct.\u201d). Considering her prior discipline history, the Respondent\u2019s failure to respond to Mr. Ravenscroft\u2019s complaint and her apparent conversion of client funds (the unearned retainer balance) provide sufficient grounds to impose the ultimate sanction of disbarment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">The petitioner might also have pointed out that, in addition to some of the same violations found in this case, the earlier proceedings involved additional violations, at least one of which was more serious; the respondent in the earlier case was found to have violated Rules of Professional conduct 1.15(a) and (b), 1.16(d), 8.1(a) and (b), and 8.4(c) and Maryland Code (2000 Repl.Vol., 2002 Suppl.) Business Occupations and Professions Article, \u00a7 10-306. Pursuant to Rule 8.4(c), the respondent was accused of, and found by the hearing court to have, engaged \u201cin conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In the prior case, <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Duvall, </em>373 Md. 482, 819 A.2d 343 (2003), although concerned about what it characterized as the respondent\u2019s \u201cpattern of dishonesty,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 819 A.2d at 347, the petitioner recommended as the appropriate sanction that the respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 489, 819 A.2d at 347. The respondent did not appear, in that case, at the hearing in this Court. Nevertheless, notwithstanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>some concern that the recommended sanction was not sufficient to protect the public, the majority of the Court accepted the petitioner\u2019s recommendation. Having observed, citing <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 773 A.2d 463 (2001), that \u201c[ojrdinarily the type of conduct engaged in by Respondent and which resulted in the violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct found here would result in disbarment,\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Duvall, </em>373 Md. at 490, 819 A.2d at 348, the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-4\">\u201cWe impose an indefinite suspension in the present case <em>solely </em>because: (1) Bar Counsel, in his written Recommendation for Sanction filed in this matter on 2 October 2002 (before oral argument), proposed indefinite suspension as the appropriate sanction; ... (2) Respondent neither filed a contrary recommendation as to sanction nor appeared at oral argument before this Court; (3) Respondent may have been influenced by, or even agreed with, Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation as to sanction and, having nothing to add, elected not to respond or appear; ... and, (4) Respondent might have acted differently to protect her interests had she thought disbarment was \u201con the table,\u201d at least insofar as she may have been influenced by Bar Counsel\u2019s judgment as to what sanction was appropriate to pursue. We do not suggest that the Court lacks the authority to disbar Respondent in this matter nonetheless. Clearly Rule 16-759(c) and the nature of the Court\u2019s jurisdiction in attorney discipline matters, gives the Court the authority to order any lawful sanction it deems appropriate in a given case. The boundaries of the Court\u2019s discretion may not be redrawn, as a matter of law, by a respondent\u2019s choice not to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation or not to appear at oral argument, or even by expressly acquiescing in Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation of a lesser sanction than the Court may deem appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">\u201cOur principal concern is that, on this record, Respondent\u2019s \u201csevere mental illness\u201d ... may have affected her judgment as to the prudential course of conduct to be taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>in view of the assumed exposure to the sanction she might be facing, based on Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation. Indefinite suspension may be perceived by members of the Bar as granting slightly more purchase from which to seek readmission, assuming rehabilitation, than disbarment. The relative professional stigma attached to indefinite suspension versus disbarment also may figure in a decision whether to oppose or acquiesce. Such reasoning in the mind of an attorney who has admitted her misconduct and continues to fight her related mental illness may seem reasonable. Respondent might have resisted disbarment had Bar Counsel sought its imposition. While Respondent is not to be commended for her lack of forethought in failing to grasp that the Court might not accept Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation, or that it was not bound by that recommendation, we deem it a fairer outcome, under the circumstances of this case, to adopt Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 492, 819 A.2d at 349. (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In one of the omitted footnotes, the Court noted the respondent\u2019s pattern of appearing at the Inquiry Panel hearings as evidencing the plausibility of the scenario we postulated. <em>Id. </em>at 493 n. 12, 819 A.2d at 349 n. 12. The Court then cautioned that, \u201chenceforth, a failure to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s recommended disposition and/or to appear at oral argument will not be considered as any level of mitigation in the sound exercise of our discretion as to what sanction is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 494, 819 A.2d at 350.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">We accept the petitioner\u2019s recommendation and order the respondent\u2019s disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-715.C., FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST MARY I.
