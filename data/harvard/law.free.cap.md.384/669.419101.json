We conclude a sentence is illegal if based upon a verdict of guilt that is not orally announced<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in open court in order to permit the jury to be polled and hearkened to the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">On November 5, 2001, Kerwin Jones held up Mohammed Shaik at gunpoint as Shaik was walking to the First Union Bank at 1515 Reisterstown Road to make a deposit encased in a money bag from the gas station where he was employed. Shaik struggled with Jones, and within moments, Jones had shot Shaik-in the leg, had run from the scene, and entered a car driven by Samuel Murray. Through their investigation, the police determined that Jones was the individual who shot Shaik.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>On November 19, 2001, Jones was arrested; the police executed a search warrant on Jones\u2019s home and discovered a bulletproof vest, ammunition, and a box for a .380 semiautomatic handgun. Thereafter, Jones and Murray were charged in one indictment: Jones was charged with two counts of assault in the first degree,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> attempted robbery,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> attempted theft and theft,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> three counts of wearing, carrying or transporting a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>handgun,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and three counts of possession of a restricted firearm.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The charges against Murray were identical to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>against Jones, except that Murray was not charged with three counts of possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony or crime of violence or the theft count. On September 80, 2002, trial began, and on its third day, the State abandoned Counts one (assault \u2014 in the first degree), four (assault in the first degree), five (attempted theft), and eight (use of a handgun in the commission of a felony). The Court also entered judgments of acquittal for Counts six (wearing, carrying, or transporting a handgun) and twelve (theft); and entered judgments <em>nolle prosequi </em>at the request of the State for Counts ten (possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a violent crime classified as a felony) and eleven (possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a violent crime classified as a misdemeanor). On the same day, the jury received instructions from the judge, a verdict sheet, and began its deliberations on the remaining four counts against Jones: attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon (Count two), attempted robbery (Count three), possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a crime of violence (Count nine), and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence (Count seven), and three counts against Murray: attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon (Count two), attempted robbery (Count three), and the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence (Count seven).</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">After deliberating for approximately two hours, the jury returned a guilty verdict against Murray on all three counts and was polled and hearkened to the verdict. In the proceedings pertaining to Jones,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the following dialogue ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>THE CLERK: Madam forelady, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon a verdict in the case of <em>State v. Kerwin Jones, </em>case number 01-CR-4391.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-5\">JUROR: We have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-6\">THE CLERK: Who shall say for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-7\">JUROR: Our forelady.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-8\">THE CLERK: Madam forelady, if you would stand. As to the case 01-CR-4391, <em>State of Maryland v. Kerwin Jones, </em>how do you find as to attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, not guilty or guilty as charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-9\">MADAM FORELADY: Guilty as charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-10\">THE CLERK: As to Count two, attempted robbery, not guilty or guilty as charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-11\">MADAM FORELADY: Guilty as charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-12\">THE CLERK: As to possession of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, not guilty or guilty as charged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-13\">MADAM FORELADY: Guilty as charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-14\">MR. PARVIZIAN [counsel for Jones]: Would you poll the ladies and gentlemen of the jury please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-15\">THE CLERK: You can be seated. The Court has recorded in the aforesaid case, in case number 01-CR-4391, <em>State of Maryland v. Kerwin Jones </em>you have found a verdict of guilty of attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, you have found him guilty of attempted robbery, and you have found him guilty of the use of a deadly weapon in the commission of a crime of violence. Is that your verdict juror number 1?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">The clerk polled the jurors individually and each juror responded affirmatively. The clerk then hearkened the jury to the verdict stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACy\">Hearken to the verdict as the Court has recorded it, in case No. 01-CR-4319, <em>State of Maryland v. Kerwin Jones, </em>your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>forelady said that you find him guilty of attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon; find him guilty of attempted robbery, find him guilty of possession of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence and so say you all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-5\">JUROR[S]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">The trial court then excused the jury and postponed sentencing for Jones until November 6, 2002, without there having been any acknowledgment of the discrepancy between the verdict sheet upon which Jones was found guilty of the four Counts submitted and the hearkened verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">On November 6, 2002, Jones was sentenced to twenty years incarceration for the charge of attempted robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon (Count two), twenty years incarceration without the possibility of parole for the first five years for the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence (Count seven), and five years incarceration for the possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony or crime of violence (Count nine).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Each of the sentences was to be served concurrently. Jones did not object to the imposition of the sentence for the use of a firearm after a conviction, which had not been orally conveyed in the courtroom and to which the jury had not been polled or hearkened.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">On March 26, 2003, Jones noted his appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Before that court, Jones argued that \u201chis conviction for possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony or crime of violence should not stand because the jury foreman did not announce the guilty verdict in open court.\u201d In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Special Appeals noted, where it is unmistakable that the jury found the defendant guilty, \u201csubstance will prevail over form even if the guilty verdict is not announced and even if it is neglected again when the jury is polled.\u201d Ultimately, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>court declined to disturb the sentence imposed for the firearm possession charge and concluded that the issue was not properly preserved by Jones because he had failed to object at any time when the verdict was delivered or when he was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Jones filed a petition for writ of certiorari in this Court for consideration of the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-5\">When a jury returns a verdict sheet showing a guilty verdict, but fails to announce the verdict in open court, does the trial court violate Maryland Rule 4-327 by accepting the verdict, and does such a violation render the imposed subsequent sentence illegal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">On August 25, 2004, we granted Jones\u2019s petition and issued the writ of certiorari. <em>Jones v. State, </em>382 Md. 688, 856 A.2d 723 (2004). We hold that the trial court could not legally impose a sentence for a verdict that was not orally conveyed in open court and to which the jury was neither polled nor hearkened. Therefore, we reverse the decision of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">A court\u2019s revisory power over a defendant\u2019s sentence is provided in Maryland Rule 4-345, which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-9\">(a) Illegal sentence. The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">As we have oftentimes stated, a sentence may be corrected even on appeal. <em>See Evans v. State, </em>382 Md. 248, 278, 855 A.2d 291, 308 (2004); <em>Ridgeway v. State, </em>369 Md. 165, 171, 797 A.2d 1287, 1290 (2002); <em>State v. Kanaras, </em>357 Md. 170, 183-84, 742 A.2d 508, 516 (1999); <em>State v. Griffiths, </em>338 Md. 485, 496, 659 A.2d 876, 882 (1995); <em>Matthews v. State, </em>304 Md. 281, 288, 498 A.2d 655, 658 (1985), quoting <em>Walczak v. State, </em>302 Md. 422, 427, 488 A.2d 949, 951 (1985). In <em>Ridgeway, </em>we explained that \u201cwhen the trial court has allegedly imposed a sentence not permitted by law, the issue should ordinarily be reviewed on direct appeal even if no objection was made in the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>court. Such review and correction of an illegal sentence is especially appropriate in light of the fact that Rule 4-345(a) ... provides that \u2018[t]he court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ridgeway, </em>369 Md. at 171, 797 A.2d at 1290, quoting <em>Walczak, </em>302 Md. at 427, 488 A.2d at 951; <em>see also Evans, </em>382 Md. at 278, 855 A.2d at 308-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">Jones argues that because the verdict for the charge of possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony or crime of violence was not orally announced in open court, the trial court\u2019s imposition of sentence on that count was illegal. He asserts that Maryland Rule 4-327(a)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> requires that the verdict not merely be handed to the clerk but that it also be read aloud into the record. He maintains that announcement in open court is required because of its relationship to a party\u2019s right to poll the jury as a means of ensuring the unanimity of the verdict. Alternatively, Jones states, the announcing in open court permits polling of jurors to that verdict if requested to do so and hearkening of the jury to that verdict. He asserts that because the verdict was not announced in open court, he was deprived of his opportunity to poll the jury and the jury was never properly hearkened to Count nine of the indictment, possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony or crime of violence. As such, Jones notes that there was no assurance that the guilty verdict on the verdict sheet with respect to Count nine was in fact unanimous. Jones argues that the use of \u201cshall\u201d in Rule 4-327(a) makes the announcing of the verdict in open court mandatory for the verdict to be effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">Conversely, the State urges this Court to affirm the decision reached by the Court of Special Appeals. The State asserts that Jones did not properly preserve this issue for appeal because he did not bring the missing verdict for Count nine to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>the trial court\u2019s attention and did not object at the time the trial court imposed the sentence. Moreover, the State contends that Jones should have objected to the trial court\u2019s instruction that the jury was to return its verdict on the verdict sheet if he intended to argue that to \u201creturn\u201d a verdict requires it to be announced in open court rather than simply recorded on a form that appears in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">The State argues that the probable handing of the verdict sheet to the clerk should be considered \u201creturning\u201d the verdict in open court for the purposes of Rule 4-327(a). It maintains that Jones\u2019s claim regarding the failure to announce the verdict with respect to Count nine should only be considered an attack on the form of the verdict rather than its substance. The State asserts that the delivery of the verdict sheet to the clerk in open court in Jones\u2019s presence satisfied the requirements of Maryland Rule 4-327. Therefore, according to the State, there is no support for Jones\u2019s claim that the verdict at issue is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">A. Historic Procedures for Returning the Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">The protocol for the return of verdicts at trial in Maryland in the late Nineteenth Century was articulated in <em>Givens v. State, </em>76 Md. 485, 487, 25 A. 689, 689 (1893):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-8\">When the jury have come to a unanimous determination with respect to their verdict, they return to the box to deliver it. The clerk then calls them over, by their names, and asks them whether they agree on this verdict, to which they reply in the affirmative. He then demands who shall say for them, to which they answer, their foreman. This being done, he desires the prisoner to hold up his right hand and addresses them: \u2018Look upon the prisoner at the bar; how say you, is he guilty of the matter whereof he indicted or not guilty?\u2019 The foreman then answers guilty or not guilty, as the verdict may be. The officer then writes the word \u2018guilty' or \u2018not guilty\u2019 as the verdict is, on the record and again addresses the jury: \u2018Hearken to your verdict as the court hath recorded it. You say that_is guilty (or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>not guilty) of the matter whereof he stands indicted, and so say you all.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">This procedure for returning a verdict is nearly identical to those used in the Provincial Court established during the colonial period. <em>See Proceedings of The Provincial Court, 1666-1667, </em>at 64 (describing how the jurors returned to the courtroom, the clerk called their names, asked if they agreed on their verdict, and who was to speak for them). Moreover, it was standard practice throughout the rest of the United States as long ago as the early Nineteenth century. <em>See </em>James Parker, <em>The Conductor Generalis, </em>323-24 (1801) (providing procedures identical to those used in the Provincial Court); Samuel Freeman, <em>The Massachusetts Justice, </em>40 (1802) (same); Samuel Bayard, <em>An Abstract of those Laws of the United States Which Relate Chiefly to the Duties and Authority of the Judges of the Inferior State Courts, and the Justices of the Peace, Throughout the Union, </em>230 (1804) (same); 1 Joseph Chitty, <em>A Practical Treatise on the Criminal Law, </em>436-37 (1819) (stating that verdicts in criminal cases must be given publicly, not privately, in the accused\u2019s presence); 4 Joseph Chitty, <em>A Practical Treatise on The Criminal Law, </em>318, 421 (1819) (providing procedures identical to those used in the Provincial Court of Maryland).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Maryland Rule 4-327(a) and (e)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> embody the essence of this historical procedure for \u201creturning\u201d a verdict. This Rule is identical to former Maryland Rule 759,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which was derived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>from Rule 40 of the Uniform Rules of Criminal Procedure promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Former Md. Rule 759, ed. note. Former Rule 759(a) and (e) were recodified without any change on April 7, 1986 as Maryland Rule 4-327(a) and (e). Md. Rule 4-327(a), (e). Throughout the Rule\u2019s many incarnations there has been no comment on what procedures are necessary for a jury to \u201creturn\u201d a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Nevertheless, we do know that the \u201creturn\u201d of a verdict by a jury has been comprised of three distinct procedures, each fulfilling a specific purpose. After the jury returned to the jury box to deliver its verdict, the foreman, speaking for the jury,, orally answered the inquiry of the clerk and stated the verdict to the trial court. <em>Givens, </em>76 Md. at 487, 25 A. at 689. Although in the colonial period, polling occurred immediately upon the jury\u2019s return to the court regardless of a failure to request to do so, <em>id., </em>at some point after 1893, the request to poll the jury came to be made after the oral announcement of the verdict. <em>Smith v. State, </em>299 Md. 158, 166, 472 A.2d 988, 992 (1984). A poll of the jury is conducted to ensure the unanimity of the verdict prior to its entry on the record. <em>Id. </em>at 166, 472 A.2d at 991. \u201cThe underlying requirement of a final verdict is that it be unani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>mous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163, 472 A.2d at 990. The requirement of unanimity is, of course, a constitutional right set forth in Article 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which states that \u201cevery man hath a right ... to a speedy trial by an impartial jury, without whose unanimous consent he ought not to be found guilty,\u201d and implemented through Rule 4-327(a). This Court explained this constitutional right in <em>Ford v. State, </em>12 Md. 514 (1859):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-5\">\u2018The verdict is the <em>unanimous </em>decision made by the jury and reported to the court, on the matters lawfully submitted to them in the course of the trial.\u2019 <em>Unanimity </em>is indispensable to the sufficiency of the verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 549, quoting 10 <em>Bacon\u2019s Abridged Title Verdict, </em>306 (emphasis in original).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">A defendant has the absolute right to poll the jury, <em>Smith, </em>299 Md. at 165, 472 A.2d at 991. As this Court asserted over a century ago in <em>Williams v. State, </em>60 Md. 402, 403 (1883): \u201c[A defendant is] entitled, as a matter of right, to a poll of the jury, and he [may] not be convicted, except upon the concurrence of each juror.\u201d <em>See </em>L. Hochheimer, The Law of Crimes and Criminal Procedure (2d ed. 1904) \u00a7 179. In order to exercise the right to poll, the defendant must request to poll the jury. Md. Rule 4-327(e). The procedure for polling is set forth in Maryland Rule 4-327(e), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOL\">(e) Poll of jury. On request of a party or on the court\u2019s own initiative, the jury shall be polled after it has returned a verdict and before it is discharged. If the jurors do not unanimously concur in the verdict, the court may direct the jury to retire for further deliberation, or may discharge the jury if satisfied that a unanimous verdict cannot be reached.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajr\">\u201cThe assent of each juror [polled] must be free and unqualified.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>299 Md. at 167, 472 A.2d at 992, quoting <em>Hochheimer </em>\u00a7 179. When a poll is demanded, the verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>becomes final only upon its acceptance after the poll. <em>Smith, </em>299 Md. at 168, 472 A.2d at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">After polling, the third step occurs when the jury is hearkened to its verdict as \u201cthe traditional formality announcing the recording of the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It was once required that \u201ca demand to poll the jury had to precede the recordation of the verdict upon hearkening. Once a verdict was hearkened it was \u2018too late to poll the panel.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166, 472 A.2d at 992, quoting <em>Ford v. State, </em>12 Md. 514, 546 (1859). We since have determined that a demand to poll the jury may be made at any time in the proceeding prior to the discharge of the jury. <em>Id. </em>at 167, 472 A.2d at 992. Hearkening of the jury to the verdict, like polling the jury, is conducted to \u201csecure certainty and accuracy, and to enable the jury to correct a verdict, which they have mistaken, or which their foreman has improperly delivered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165, 472 A.2d at 991, citing <em>Givens, </em>76 Md. at 488, 25 A. at 689-90. It is in the absence of a demand for a poll that a hearkening is required for the proper recordation of a verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 166, 472 A.2d at 992. As previously stated, \u201cUnder our practice the hearkening of a verdict is the traditional formality announcing the recording of the verdict. A jury poll has the same effect.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Ross v. State, </em>24 Md.App. 246, 254, 330 A.2d 507, 512 (1975). Traditionally, hearkening removed the case from the jury\u2019s consideration; however, because the parties and the trial court retain the right to poll the jury until its discharge after hearkening, where polling the jury follows its hearkening, the poll of the jury performs the same function. <em>Smith, </em>299 Md. at 168, 472 A.2d at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">The State argues that the probable handing of the verdict sheet to the clerk constitutes a proper \u201creturn\u201d of the jury\u2019s verdict for Count nine. We, however, disagree. \u201cReturning\u201d the verdict in open court mandates an oral announcement of the verdict upon the conclusion of the jury\u2019s deliberations to enable the defendant to exercise the right to poll the jury as to the verdicts. Furthermore, orally announcing each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>count of the verdict prevents possible confusion during polling and hearkening where there are multiple counts considered by the jury, as in the present case. This conclusion is not only consistent with our own jurisprudence, but also has been recognized by those of our sister jurisdictions which have addressed the issue.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Therefore, we conclude that for a verdict to be considered final in a criminal case it must be announced orally to permit the defendant the opportunity to exercise the right to poll the jury to ensure the verdict\u2019s unanimity.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This was not done with respect to Count nine, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>the possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony or crime of violence, against Jones.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Therefore, because the jury was not polled and hearkened to that Count in absence of its oral announcement, the verdict of guilt cannot stand and any sentence apportioned thereto must be vacated. We hold that Jones\u2019s sentence of five years imprisonment for the possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a felony or crime of violence is an illegal sentence. The judgment of the Court of Special Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AS TO COUNT NINE.

The State relies on <em>Government of the Virgin Islands </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>558 F.2d 691 (1977), to support its argument that a written verdict is sufficient to be considered a final verdict. The issue, however, is not the form in which the verdict was returned but rather whether proper mechanisms were utilized to ensure the unanimity of the verdict. In <em>Government of the Virgin Islands v. Smith, </em>the jury returned a verdict slip signed by all of the jurors, which ensured the unanimity of the verdict. <em>Id. </em>at 694. In the case at bar, only the foreperson signed the verdict sheet; there were no means to determine whether all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>jurors agreed with the verdict marked for Count nine on die verdict sheet. Thus, the verdict sheet in the present case did not ensure a unanimous verdict and the verdict at issue could not properly be accepted, thereby rendering any sentence imposed for Count nine illegal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b944-7\">. Jones does not contend that the other verdicts are improper. We have previously held that where verdicts are returned as to some Counts but not others, those verdicts to which the jury is hearkened or polled are legally proper. <em>See Hoffert, </em>319 Md. at 386, 572 A.2d at 541.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
