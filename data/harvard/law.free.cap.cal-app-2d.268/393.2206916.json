The sole question presented by this appeal is whether, in obtaining defendant\u2019s confession, the two police officers who questioned him violated defendant\u2019s constitutional rights as defined by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974].</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Defense counsel objected to the introduction of the confession, the only direct evidence linking defendant to the burglaries. The relevant facts are these: Charles McGriff was in custody in the Kern County jail, charged with committing the burglaries of which defendant was later convicted. A sheriff\u2019s deputy, Donald Sipe, learned that McGriff had telephoned \u00e1 friend to have defendant get in touch with the sheriff\u2019s office to clear McGriff of the charges. About an hour afterward, Sipe and a fellow officer were leaving the parking lot adjacent to the sheriff\u2019s office when they recognized defendant, who had just arrived by automobile. The officers joined defendant in walking toward the main entrance to the sheriff\u2019s office, and asked him if he had come to talk to them. He answered, \"Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">The officers took defendant to an interrogation room and placed him under arrest. Deputy Sipe advised defendant of his constitutional rights by reading from a printed card containing what was described as the standard <em>Miranda </em>formula <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra). </em>He was asked whether he understood those rights and whether, having them in mind, he wished to talk to the officers. Defendant replied that he understood his rights as enumerated, and that he wanted a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah5\">Deputy Sipe then advised defendant that since he requested a lawyer, the officers could not talk to him at all, that \"it just cut us off from having any conversation with him.\u201d Officer Sipe correctly analyzed the situation, but he nevertheless told defendant that the officers were of the opinion \"that he had come \"to the Sheriff\u2019s Office to clear a Charles McGriff of the charges that was against him, and to admit some burglaries that were committed in the Oildale area. \u2019 \u2019 Officer Sipe testified that defendant then said he would talk to them. Sipe reread the <em>Miranda </em>rights from the card; defendant again said he understood them and that he would talk to them. After interrogation, estimated variously between one and two hours, the officers obtained a confession from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The defendant\u2019s version of what happened includes a considerably greater amount of questioning and activity on the part of the officers, than is revealed by the testimony of Sipe. Defendant said: \"Q. Now Detective Sipe has testified that he read the constitutional rights to you at that time, and they have been put in the record. At that time what did you say in response to his request whether or not you understood your rights and whether or not you wanted to make a statement? A. I told him I would like to have an attorney.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u201c Q. At that point what did he say ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">A. He told me that he couldn\u2019t tell me what he had on me or that he couldn\u2019t\u2014that he was under the\u2014or he said he thought I came down to clear MeGriff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">Q. What transpired after that ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">A. He got out a tape of what MeGriff had put on\u2014put\u2014a statement on tape. And he played the tape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-9\">\u201cQ. Did that tape implicate you in any way in these burglaries ? A. Tes, it did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">\u201cMe. Allen: I am sorry. I still can\u2019t hear you. A. Yes, it did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Kuhs) Did Detective Sipe at that point indicate to you that that statement could not be used against you in evidence ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">A. No, he didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-13\">\u201c Q. What transpired after that ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-14\">A. I told him that I would agree to talk about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-15\">\u201cQ. Was there any discussion as to other evidence that the police might have on you ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-16\">A. Yes. They told me they had enough to convict me. Or not\u2014I wouldn\u2019t say convict. It was more or less in his words, in those\u2014around the words. \u2018We have a lot more evidence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-17\">\u201cQ. Did they offer to tell you what the evidence was? A. No, they didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-18\">\u201cQ. Did they make any statement relative to that evidence? A. No, they didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-19\">\u201cQ. At this point, after hearing the MeGriff\u2019s tape, at this point were you read your constitutional rights again ? A. Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-20\">\u2018 \u2018 Q. And you agreed to make a statement. Is that correct ? A. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-21\">After defendant testified as related above, Officer Sipe was not recalled to rebut the testimony, nor was the other officer who was present during the interrogation called to corroborate either Sipe or defendant. It may be that a more extensive <em>voir dire </em>was neglected in that the prosecuting attorney and the trial court mistakenly relied upon the Court of Appeal opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fioritto </em>which, superficially at least, seemed to approve the admission of a statement by a defendant obtained under circumstances similar to those before us. However, at the time of trial the Supreme Court had granted a hearing in <em>Fioritto </em>and later, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fioritto, </em>68 Cal.2d 714 [68 Cal.Rptr. 817, 441 P.2d 625], held a statement obtained under such circumstances to be inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Viewing the evidence most favorably to respondent, continued questioning by the officers after defendant told them he wanted an attorney runs afoul of <em>Miranda </em>as explicated in <em>Fioritto. </em>While it is true, as the Attorney General points out, the interrogation by Deputy Sipe after defendant announced he wanted an attorney was not directly accusatory, nevertheless the officer\u2019s leading and suggestive statements constituted psychological persuasion of the kind proscribed by the court in <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The dissent to this opinion characterizes the officer\u2019s conduct as a tactical error, but it is just such tactics that are condemned in the language of <em>Miranda, </em>at page 1627: Once warnings have been given, the subsequent procedure is clear. If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\u201d In <em>Fioritto </em>the court gave this language strict and literal interpretation, characterizing it as \u2018\u2018the didactic language of the United States Supreme Court,\u201d and observed that such language \u2018\u2018shows no disposition to permit subsequent interrogation in the absence of counsel even if authorities believe there has been a change of circumstances.\u201d (P.719.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Since the officers continued to question defendant after he demanded an attorney, we are compelled, under the authority of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Fioritto, </em>to hold the confession of defendant inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Conley, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b420-9\">GARGANO, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcV\">I dissent. In my judgment the facts of this case are distinguishable from <em>People </em>v. <em>Fioritto, </em>68 Cal.2d 714 [68 Cal.Rptr. 817, 441 P.2d 625], relied upon by the majority to overturn the judgment. In <em>Fioritto </em>the conduct of the police officers was obviously calculated to trick the defendant into talking after he had elected to exercise his constitutional right to remain silent, and if countenanced could lead to innumerable attempts to circumvent the mandate of <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 486 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 10 A.L.R.3d 974] ; after the defendant declined to waive his rights the officers confronted him with his accomplices, an argument ensued, the accomplices were taken away, and the officers again asked the defendant if he would like to sign a waiver of his rights and confess, which he did. Thus, the \u00bfSupreme Court, in reversing Fioritto\u2019s conviction, pointed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>the \u2018 ratio decidendi\u201d of <em>Miranda </em>and stated: \u201cA principal objective of that decision was to establish safeguards that would liberate courts insofar as possible from the difficult and troublesome necessity of adjudicating in each case <em>whether coercive influences, psychological or physical, have been employed to secure admissions or confessions.\u201d (People </em>v. <em>Fioritto, </em>68 Cal.2d at p. 717.) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">In the instant ease Deputy Sipe did not attempt, by trickery or otherwise, to induce defendant to talk against his will. At the most the officer experienced a normal reaction to appellant\u2019s sudden decision to be represented by counsel. The police were informed that defendant was voluntarily coming to the sheriff\u2019s office to clear his roommate, MeGriff, who had been charged with committing certain burglaries in the Oil-dale area near Bakersfield, California. Moreover, when the police officers met defendant in the parking lot adjacent to the sheriff\u2019s office and asked if he came to talk to them, he answered \u201cYes.\u201d Later, after defendant was arrested and advised of his rights he said he wanted a lawyer. At this point he was correctly informed by Deputy Sipe that the officers could no longer talk to him. However, Sipe understandably added that the officers were of the opinion that defendant had come to the sheriff\u2019s office to clear MeGriff and to admit some burglaries that were committed in the Oildale area. Defendant responded to this observation by stating that he wanted to talk to the officers. He was again advised of his rights and, when he said he understood, bis statement was taken. According to Deputy Sipe this preliminary discussion took only two minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">It seems to me that the majority view has the effect of insulating, with what sometimes could be disastrous results, a defendant against the slightest tactical error by an interrogating officer no matter how innocent or innocuous the tactical error may be. Manifestly, this result impedes law enforcement without substantially serving the interests of justice. I believe that <em>People </em>v. <em>Fioritto, supra, </em>should not be construed to stand for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 14, 1969. Gargano, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted. Respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 13,1969.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
