The demurrer was sustained without leave to amend when plaintiff indicated to the court that he was unable to more strongly plead a cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>In the complaint plaintiff alleges that he worked, under a written agreement of employment, as an outside commission salesman for defendant First Maintenance Supply Co.; defendant Fleisehman was one of its officers. The complaint further alleges that defendant Fleisehman, while in thg course and scope of his employment and \"for the purpose of undermining plaintiff\u2019s morale and to cause him to terminate his employment, did the following acts: (1) He refused to permit a particular fellow employee to service plaintiff\u2019s accounts while plaintiff was recovering from injuries suffered in an automobile accident; (2) thereafter, when plaintiff had returned to part time work, he admonished another salesman not to give plaintiff any help; (3) subsequently, he informed other employees not to follow the customary procedure of taking phone orders from plaintiff, thereby requiring plaintiff to mail or personally bring in his orders; (4) and, finally, he failed to respond to plaintiff\u2019s.written demand that his conduct and attitude (and that of the other employees of defendant) toward plaintiff be changed. \u25a0 \u00a1</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">The complaint contains the additional general allegations that Fleisehman\u2019s acts against plaintiff were inflicted with malice and with the intent to injure him mentally and emotionally; and that, as a consequene\u00e9 \u2022 of defendant\u2019s acts, plaintiff \u201csuffered humiliation'and severe emotional distress, all of which makes him nervous. \u201d '</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The trial court correctly concluded that plaintiff \u2019s complaint fails to state a cause of action. \u201cIntentional infliction of emotional distress, without physical trauma, can be a ground of liability <em>(State Rubbish etc. Assn. </em>v. <em>Siliznoff, </em>38 Cal.2d 330 [240 P.2d 282]), but only when the defendant\u2019s conduct is \u2018outrageous\u2019 <em>(id. </em>p. 338) ; or \u2018has gone beyond all reasonable bounds of decency\u2019 (Rest., 1948 Supp., Torts, \u00a7 46, com. g).\u201d <em>(Perati </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em>213 Cal.App.2d. 472, 474 [28 Cal.Rptr. 898]; see also <em>Spackman </em>v. <em>Good, </em>245 Cal.App.2d 518, 528-529 [54 Cal.Rptr. 78].) The conduct alleged against defendants does not fall into the category of conduct which could be described as \u201coutrageous\u201d or that which \u201chas gone beyond all reasonable bounds of decency.\u201d As-the employer of plaintiff and his fellow salesman, defendant Fleisehman was entitled to direct their job activities and determine office procedure. ..... \"</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">Files, P.J., and Dunn, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
