Code) and murder (\u00a7187, Pen. Code). A jury found him guilty of assaulting Jerry Spry by force likely to produce great bodily injury, a felony, a lesser but necessarily included offense than tha,t charged in count I, and not guilty of the murder of Henry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>Williams. He appeals from the judgment and order denying motion for new trial. The appeal from the order is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Jerry Spry testified that around 7:30 p.m. on November 24, 1966 (Thanksgiving Day), he, Howard Lee and Larry Spells were walking down the street toward a liquor store at 42d and Ascot to get sodas; an automobile came up beside them and defendant got out of the car; he had never seen defendant before; defendant ran up to a porch of a house, returned and, with reference to the three of them, said, \u201cLook at those three punks;\u201d he told him he was not a punk, then continued walking toward the liquor store with the defendant behind him; Lorenzo Marshall was standing in front of the liquor store and he (Spry) started to converse with him when defendant grabbed him by the collar; defendant said nothing when he grabbed him but a scuffle ensued in which he (Spry) hit defendant and defendant stabbed him in the stomach; he was unaware he had been stabbed until Marshall said, \u2018 \u2018 Someone is bleeding \u2019 \u2019; after he was stabbed he hit defendant with both fists; defendant stumbled a bit, ran to the corner and crossed the street; he saw no knife in defendant\u2019s possession; he (Spry) went home with a rag at the place of bleeding; Lee and Spells walked him home; he first went to the Central Receiving Hospital and then was taken by ambulance to General Hospital where he stayed for four days; the doctors took seven or eight stitches in his stomach.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Lee and Spells did not see a knife in anyone\u2019s hand; George Yiltz saw defendant display a knife on occasions prior to and on November 25, 1966; and Jimmie Smith had seen a knife on defendant two or three times prior to November 25, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Lorenzo Marshall, called by the defense, testified that he saw Spry, Lee and Spells come out of the liquor store; Spry struck defendant first; and he saw no knife in defendant\u2019s hand. Defendant testified that he was confronted by Spry on 41st Place between Compton and Dorsey on November 24, 1966; Spry said of him, \u201cWhere is this punk going\u201d; he tried to push Spry away from him outside the liquor store when Spry hit him first; Spry asked him if he wanted to fight and he replied no; he did not stab Spry and did not have a knife in his hand; he sustained injuries to his nose and lip as the result of Spry\u2019s blows.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Appellant assails the testimony of the prosecution witness, Jerry Spry, as inherently improbable and urges error in the denial of his motion to strike Spry\u2019s testimony as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>incompetent. Spry had testified on direct and cross-examination, then during redirect, because of confusion in some areas, lack of clarity in his responses and some difficulty in expressing himself, the judge interrupted the proceedings by stating that in his opinion Spry \u201chas demonstrated that he is a hostile witness or he is incompetent ... I prefer to rule that he is hostile, and I am going to allow . . . impeachment of this witness by . . . the party who has called him.\u201d To this defense counsel objected and moved to strike Spry's entire testimony on the ground that \u201che is not competent to testify.\u201d The judge denied the motion and commented, \u201c. . . we' have wasted two days with this man with the most unlikely and improbable testimony I have ever heard from any witness who has stated that he had finished 12th grade in high school\u201d and \u201cI am ruling that [he] is either incompetent or hostile, and I am opening the door to the prosecution to treat him as a hostile witness . . .\u201d; after further colloquy, \u2018 I am saying that in my experience of over thirty years I have to rule that this witness\u2019 conduct is that of a hostile witness.\u201d The prosecutor then asked defense counsel, \u201cDo you want a psychiatrist appointed\u201d to which the latter replied, \u201cI have no objection\u201d suggesting Dr. A. R Tweed. There was some suspicion that Spry had been drinking and the court said: \u201cI would like to have him examined right now. I don\u2019t know but what he is under the effect right now. , . . Well, I want him taken right now while he is in the same \u25a0 condition that he is; so that there can be some determination as to whether it is narcotics or what it is.\u201d Thus, under section 730, Evidence Code, Dr. Tweed was appointed to examine Spry as to his \u201cmental condition\u201d; Spry was taken to the doctor\u2019s office for the examination and the proceedings were continued to the following Monday morning. While the report of Dr. Tweed is not before us and thereafter no mention was made by either counsel or the judge concerning Spry\u2019s lack of competence as a witness or of the doctor\u2019s findings (from the judge\u2019s comment at the time of the motion for new trial it appears that Spry is \u201ca mental defective\u201d) it is obvious from the extensive redirect and reeross-examination of Spry on the following Monday that Spry was competent to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">It is true that Spry was confused in several areas and that some conflict exists in his version of the events, but read in its entirety, Spry\u2019s testimony is basically clear and credible\u2014he \"simply said that defendant called him a name, followed him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>anil then hit him starting a fight during which he stabbed him in the stomach. .</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The rule is stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Huston, </em>21 Cal.2d 690 at page 693 [134 P.2d 758] : \u201cAlthough an appellate court will not uphold a judgment or verdict based upon evidence inherently improbable, testimony which merely discloses unusual circumstances does not come within that category. <em>(Kidroski </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>[1940] 39 Cal.App.2d 602, 605 [103 P.2d 1000].)  To warrant the rejection of the statements given by a witness who has been believed by a trial court, there must exist either a physical impossibility that they are true, or their falsity must be apparent without resorting to inferences or deductions. [Citations.] Conflicts and even testimony which is subject to justifiable suspicion do not justify the reversal of a judgment, for it is the exclusive province of the trial judge or jury to determine the credibility of a witness and the truth or falsity of the facts upon which a determination depends. <em>(Hicks </em>v. <em>Ocean Shore Railroad, Inc., </em>18 Cal.2d 773, 781 [117 P.2d 850].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>47 Cal.2d 311, 319-320 [303 P.2d 329] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>231 Cal.App.2d 928, 931 [42 Cal.Rptr. 373].)  Whatever conflicts or inconsistencies exist in Spry\u2019s testimony were for the jury to consider in determining Spry\u2019s credibility and the weight to be given his testimony, but they are not such as to render Spry\u2019s testimony inherently improbable. The statements given by Spry are neither false on their face nor therein does there exist a physical impossibility that they are true. The main issue of fact upon which the testimony of the parties conflicts is whether defendant stabbed Spry and who started the fight. If Spry was not telling the truth the only possible alternative hypothesis is that while he and defendant were scuffling (a fact undisputed) someone else stabbed Spry in the stomach; under the uncontroverted circumstances this appears to be highly unlikely. There is nothing physically impossible or inherently improbable in the theory based on Spry\u2019s testimony and adopted by the jury that defendant, a bully, called Spry, who is a \u201cmental defective,\u201d a name, taunted him. followed him to the liquor store and grabbed him by the collar starting a scuffle in which he stabbed Spry. Unlike the testimony of the prosecutrix in a kidnapping charge in <em>People </em>v. <em>Carvalho, </em>112 Cal.App.2d 482 [246 P.2d 950], cited by appellant, there is nothing \u201cfantastic\u201d or \u201cmore than unusual\u201d or that does \u201cviolence to reason\u201d about Spry\u2019s testimony. (P. 489.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>The motion to strike Spry\u2019s testimony on the ground that he was an incompetent witness was made prior to Spry\u2019s examination by Dr. Tweed; the same was denied, and properly so. It is noted that after the examination and during subsequent extended redirect and reeross-examination no one, including defense counsel, even suggested that Spry might be incompetent as a witness. While Spry may be \u201ca mental defective\u201d the burden is upon appellant to show that he was incompetent to testify; he has not sustained his burden nor does the record of the law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> support his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Appellant contends that the judge erroneously restricted his cross-examination of George Viltz. He says that Viltz gave highly damaging evidence tending to show him \u201cas a knife wielder\u201d who used a knife on Spry; the judge erroneously believed his attempt to impeach Viltz was on a \u201ccollateral issue\u201d upon which he could not be impeached; and Viltz \u2019 motive in testifying was crucial, the evidence being susceptible of showing Viltz to be the murderer.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Defendant was also charged with the murder of Henry Williams of which he was acquitted. The testimony of Viltz was directed to that charge; he said he saw defendant display a knife on occasions prior to and on November 25, 1966 (the day of Williams\u2019 murder). Based upon his interpretation of the evidence that Viltz did not observe the homicide and was not present at the altercation in which Williams was stabbed in the heart, the trial judge ruled that the question defense counsel wished to ask Viltz, whether he had made a statement that Williams was running around with his wife and that he was going to do something about it, related to a collateral issue. A trial judge must of necessity consider the evidence in ruling on questions of law thus there is no merit to the complaint that in making his ruling, he improperly assumed that the homicide took place at a particular time and place. The trial judge has a wide discretion in the control and ultimate scope of examination of the witnesses, especially where the purpose is to show bias, and although liberality and wide latitude is the usual standard, we see no abuse of discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>here. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>239 Cal.App.2d 14, 20 [48 Cal.Rptr. 469] ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bronson, </em>263 Cal.App.2d 831, 840 [70 Cal.Rptr. 162].) Moreover, there was no prejudice to defendant; he was acquitted of the murder to which Viltz\u2019 testimony was directed, and on the assault charge, the testimony that Viltz had seen him with a knife on occasions prior to November 25, 1966, was cumulative. Jimmie Smith testified that she saw a knife on defendant two or three times prior to November 25, 1966, and Spry testified that during the altercation on November 24 defendant stabbed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Appellant\u2019s last claim that there was misconduct on the part of the trial judge predicated on the unfounded claim \u201cof unjustifiable criticism of defendant\u2019s counsel,\u201d his expression of opinion that certain witnesses were not to be believed, his discussion with counsel concerning an appeal \u201cbeing taken,\u201d and his unnecessary interruption of the interrogation of the witnesses and assumption of the role of prosecutor in participating therein, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">The record shows that at the start of the trial defense counsel was late because of matters he had to attend to in another court; the criticism was leveled at a fellow judge for the manner in which he presided in his courtroom. However unfortunate the judge\u2019s criticism of his colleague, it reasonably could not be construed as directed to defense counsel. Appellant\u2019s further assertion that the judge criticized his counsel for not properly representing him is simply not true. On the redirect-examination of Spry the judge faulted counsel for failing to object when Spry \u201cdoesn\u2019t make clear what he is talking about\u201d because \u201cwe are not getting an adequate record.\u201d It was defense counsel who first brought up the subject of representation by saying in response, \u201cI feel that he [defendant] is getting an adequate defense\u201d; the judge replied that \u201che may be getting an adequate defense by your remaining silent, but I am not tolerating this kind of record. \u2019 \u2019 The controversy related strictly to the clarity of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The trial judge did not, through his questioning of certain witnesses, intimate that they were not to be believed. Actually he seemed to be dissatisfied with the manner in which all of the witnesses, prosecution and defense alike, testified. For this there was good cause\u2014there appears to have been a reluctance on the' part of some, apparently friends of defendant, to testify concerning who started the altercation and who stabbed Spry, and an unusual alacrity on the part of others to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>testify on defendant\u2019s behalf. The record shows some difficulty on the part of both counsel in getting their witnesses to speak up, obtaining responsive answers, and avoiding confusion in various areas; and the judge\u2019s criticism reflected nothing more. The only witness he seemed at any time to doubt was Spry, the prosecution witness, and this occurred prior to Spry\u2019s examination. Whatever the jury at the time might have inferred from the judge\u2019s statements, was dispelled by the subsequent instruction that the jurors are the sole and exclusive judges of the credibility of witnesses. Before Spry was examined by Dr. Tweed, his answers to some of the questions were not clear; the judge was concerned about the record and sought to have both counsel clarify Spry\u2019s testimony to the end that the \u201crecord for whatever purpose\u201d be clear. The mention of appeal resulted in the judge\u2019s impatience with Spry, \u201cMr. Spry do you understand that if there should be an appeal of this matter, someone will have to lopk at this record?\u201d It is unclear to us why under the circumstances the judge thought Spry would understand such a question, but the remainder of the colloquy between him and defense counsel makes it clear that his concern was for a proper record for the evaluation of the jury, appeal or \u201cfor whatever purpose.\u201d Certainly the comment does not imply that the jury should find defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Appellant does not claim that the judge\u2019s questions of the witnesses were improper per se or implied belief in his guilt but argues that his \u201cvoluntary assistance\u201d improperly gave weight to the People\u2019s case. The judge\u2019s interruptions occurred during examination of all witnesses; in every instance to which our attention has been directed, he sought to clarify their testimony or bring out additional facts. His questions of defendant\u2019s witnesses bearing on a defense could well have been used to defendant\u2019s advantage.  \u201cIn the exercise of his broad powers to control the proceedings, the trial judge has a right and duty to expedite the trial and, if necessary in the interests of fairness and efficiency, to participate therein. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>38 Cal.2d 556, 564 [241 P.2d 224].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wrigley, </em>69 Cal.2d 149, 164 [70 Cal.Rptr. 116, 443 P.2d 580].) The situation is unlike that set up in <em>People </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>179 Cal.App.2d 624, 633 [4 Cal.Rptr. 50], cited by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The jury simply disbelieved the prosecution\u2019s witnesses relative to the murder of Henry Williams and acquitted defendant thereof; it gave credence to Spry\u2019s testimony and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>convicted defendant of the assault. The entire record reflects a full and fair trial on all of the issues and excellent representation by the public defender who represented defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Wood, P. J., and Fourt, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 7, 1969, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 5,1969.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Seetion 700, Evidence Code: <em>\u201cGeneral rule as to competency </em>\u201cExcept as otherwise provided by statute, every person is qualified to bo a witness and no person is disqualified to testify to any matter.\u201d Section 701, Evidence Code: \"Disqualification of witness \u201cA person is disqualified to be a witness if he is: (a) Incapable of expressing himself concerning the matter so as to be understood, either directly or through interpretation by one who can understand him; or (b) Incapable of understanding the duty of a witness to tell the truth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
