Aberle appeals from a judgment against him on respondent\u2019s complaint for reimbursement for old age security payments made to appellant\u2019s mother.  Appellant does not assert that the decision below was contrary to California law; rather, he contends that the applicable statute is invalid in that it deprives married women of vested property rights and unconstitutionally discriminates between married men and married women in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment (equal protection of the laws). We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">Sections 12100 and 12101 of the Welfare and Institutions Code (formerly sections 2224 and 2181) provide for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>county\u2019s action to recoup welfare benefits and for calculation of the adult child\u2019s liability for benefits paid to his indigent parents. In those calculations all of the child\u2019s income is taken into account, with reductions for his dependents. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 12101.) Appellant objects to this procedure on the ground that a married woman has a vested interest (Civ. Code, \u00a7 161a) in one-half the earnings of her husband because those earnings are community property (Civ. Code, \u00a7 164). To determine the husband\u2019s liability on the basis of all of his earnings, appellant asserts, is to deprive the wife of her vested interest in one-half thereof and to discriminate unfairly against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">However, this treatment of the husband\u2019s liability to the county for the support of his indigent parents is in harmony with this state\u2019s community property laws. Community property, except for the earnings of the wife, is liable for all of the husband\u2019s debts; the enactment of section 161a creating the wife\u2019s vested interest did not affect this rule. <em>(Grolemund </em>v. <em>Cafferata </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 679 [111 P.2d 641]; <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Fuller </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 18 [57 Cal.Rptr. 23]; <em>General Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Schian </em>(1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 555 [56 Cal.Rptr. 769].) The husband\u2019s earnings, although community property, need not be used in support of the wife\u2019s indigent parents. <em>(Grace </em>v. <em>Carpenter </em>(1941) 42 Cal.App.2d 301 [108 P.2d 701].) This is consistent with the rule that the husband\u2019s earnings are not liable for the wife\u2019s premarriage debts. (Civ. Code, \u00a7170.) Appellant\u2019s contention that each spouse\u2019s liability should be predicated upon his ownership rights in community property (\u00a7 161a), rather than upon his management and control over his earnings (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 171c, 172, 172a), has been rejected in the cases cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">We see nothing unfair or discriminatory in the statutory allocation of responsibility for each spouse\u2019s indigent parents. As in the case of other debts and obligations, the provisions of section 161a are not to be used to exempt one-half of a husband\u2019s earnings from the reach of one to whom he owes a statutory duty of reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Devine, P. J., and Rattigan, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 19,1969.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
