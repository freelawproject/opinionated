Judgment based on a jury verdict- was entered for plaintiff against defendant in the sum of $800, Thereafter on March 3, 1967, plaintiff filed notice of intenten to move for new trial. On March 22, 1967, the following minute order was entered: \u201cMotion for new trial is granted, unless Defendant pays the \u25a0sum of $1750.00 to plaintiff, within 30 days. Each side is to bear own costs.\u201d Defendant appeals from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">In a brief argument without citation of points and authorities, appellant claims that since the order specifies no reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>for granting the motion for new trial it must be assumed that it was granted on the last four grounds set up in the notice<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that none of them is here sufficient to support the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Out of the seven grounds set up in section 657, Code of Civil Procedure,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> plaintiff\u2019s notice of intention to move for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>new trial specified but four. Through what she now claims to have been an 1 \u2018inadvertence,\u2019\u2019 she did not include \u201cinsufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict\u201d (\u00a7 657, subd. 6, Code Civ. Proc.) but did specify as her first ground \u201cinadequacy of damages awarded by the jury\u201d which was not then (March 1967) allowed as a statutory ground for new trial<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   Briefly stated, we are faced with a notice of intention to move for a new trial which does not expressly include in the grounds stated \u201cinsufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict, \u2019 \u2019 and an order granting the motion which fails to expressly specify the ground therefor but does contain an additur.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Dealing first with the order, the issue is whether it may be treated as one granting the motion upon the ground of insufficiency of the evidence.  \u201cAppellate review is not limited to the ground stated in the lower court\u2019s order [citations] with the exception of the ground of insufficiency of the evidence.  If the order does not specify that it is granted on this ground, it must be conclusively presumed on appeal that the order was not based thereon. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 657.)\u201d <em>(Yarrow </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>53 Cal.2d 427, 434 [2 Cal.Rptr. 137, 348 P.2d 687] ; <em>Aced </em>v. <em>Hobbs-Sesack Plumbing Co., </em>55 Cal.2d 573, 578 [12 Cal.Rptr. 257, 360 P.2d 897] ; <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Fong, </em>37 Cal.2d 356, 376 [232 P.2d 241]; <em>Bray </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>167 Cal.App.2d 680, 685 [335 P.2d 137] ; <em>Verzola </em>v. <em>Russi, </em>135 Cal.App.2d 330, 331 [287 P.2d 166].)  However, it was early settled that the order need not follow the express language of section 657, subdivision 6, Code of Civil Procedure, and \u201cwhenever the order granting a new trial uses such language as can reasonably be construed as meaning that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, then the mandate of that section has been satisfied.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number><em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Public Works </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>100 Cal.App.2d 101, 104 [223 P.2d 37]; see <em>Aced </em>v. <em>Hobbs-Sesack Plumbing Co., </em>55 Cal.2d 573, 578 [12 Cal.Rptr. 257, 360 P.2d 897].) While reversing the order in which the trial court merely \u201cgranted\u201d the motion, the court in <em>Bray </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>167 Cal.App.2d 680 [335 P.2d 137], said, \u201cno particular words or language is required if the nature of the order itself is such that it can reasonably be construed as including insufficiency of the evidence.\u201d (P. 685.) Thus, an order granted on all grounds stated in the notice has been affirmed, the theory being that the grounds including insufficiency of the evidence were incorporated by reference <em>(Lewis </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Edison Co., </em>116 Cal.App 44, 45-50 [2 P.2d 419]; <em>Beckley </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>84 Cal.App. 557, 559 [258 P. 428]; see <em>Aced </em>v. <em>Hobbs-Sesack Plumbing Co., </em>55 Cal.2d 573, 578 [12 Cal.Rptr. 257, 360 P.2d 897]) ; and where the sole ground for new trial was insufficiency of the evidence an order simply granting the motion was adequate to specify insufficiency of the evidence. <em>(Ice-Kist Packing Co. </em>v. <em>J. F. Sloan Co., </em>157 Cal.App.2d 695, 697-699 [321 P.2d 840]; <em>Van Ostrum </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>148 Cal.App.2d 1, 4 [306 P.2d 44].)  But apposite are those cases which hold that an order granting a new trial with respect to issues of excessiveness or inadequacy of damages alone constitutes a proper specification of the ground of insufficiency of evidence as to those issues <em>(Frantz </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>64 Cal.2d 622, 624-625 [51 Cal.Rptr. 282, 414 P.2d 410] ; <em>Sinz </em>v. <em>Owens, </em>33 Cal.2d 749, 751, 760-761 [205 P.2d 3, 8 A.L.R.2d 757] ; <em>Kralyevich </em>v. <em>Magrini, </em>172 Cal.App.2d 784, 787 [342 P.2d 903]; <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. of Public Works </em>v. <em>McCullough, </em>100 Cal.App.2d 101, 104-105 [223 P.2d 37]; <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Tyrone Power Enterprises, Inc., </em>49 Cal.App.2d 383, 389-390 [121 P.2d 829] ; <em>Secreto </em>v. <em>Carlander, </em>35 Cal.App.2d 361, 364-365 [95 P.2d 476] ; see <em>Aced </em>v. <em>Hobbs-Sesack Plumbing Co., </em>55 Cal.2d 573, 578 [12 Cal.Rptr. 257, 360 P.2d 897]), on the theory that such an order necessarily includes a specification that the evidence is not sufficient to support the judgment. In <em>Frantz </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>64 Cal.2d 622 [51 Cal.Rptr. 282, 414 P.2d 410], the court looked to the record and held that the order granting a new trial on the issue of damages may properly be treated as an order based on insufficiency of the evidence and said at pages 624-625: \u201cAlso, here as in <em>Kralyevich </em>(p. 790 of 172 Cal.App.2d), the only point urged by the moving party in points and authorities offered in support of the motion was the inadequacy of the damages. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Under such circumstances we are persuaded (1) that the record establishes that the new trial was granted because the court believed the award to be too low, and (2) that the order granting the new trial \u2018solely on the issue of damages alone\u2019 necessarily included a specification of insufficiency of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Thus, the moving papers, hereinafter more fully discussed, and the additur modifying the judgment contained in the order leave no doubt that the motion was in fact granted because the trial judge, after reviewing the evidence and exercising his independent judgment thereon <em>(Mullin </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation </em>Hospitals, 206 Cal.App.2d 23, 29 [23 Cal.Rptr. 410] ; <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Superior Air Parts, Inc., </em>124 Cal.App.2d 91, 94 [268 P.2d 115]) was not satisfied that plaintiff had been adequately compensated for the extent of damage suffered by her and granted the motion on the ground of inadequacy of damages which under the foregoing authorities necessarily includes a specification of insufficiency of the evidence.  The additur is now proper, and in <em>Jehl </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., </em>66 Cal.2d 821 [59 Cal.Rptr. 276, 427 P.2d 988], the Supreme Court held that upon a motion for new trial grounded on insufficiency of the evidence because the damages are inadequate, the court should first determine whether such damages are clearly inadequate and if so whether the ease would be a proper one for granting a motion for new trial limited to damages. If both conditions exist the court in ts discretion may issue an order granting the motion for new trial unless the defendant consents to an additur as determined by the court. (P. 830.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">\u201cThe general rule is that a trial court has no power to grant a motion for a new trial on a ground that is neither statutory nor specified in the notice of such motion, or, in effect, of its own motion. <em>(Cooper </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>12 Cal.App.2d 336 [55 P.2d 299].)\u201d <em>(McFarland </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>220 Cal.App.2d 585, 587 [33 Cal.Rptr. 754]; <em>Malkasian </em>v. <em>Irwin, </em>61 Cal.2d 738, 741 [40 Cal.Rptr. 78, 294 P.2d 822]; <em>Fomco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Joe Maggio, Inc., </em>55 Cal.2d 162, 166 [10 Cal.Rptr. 462, 358 P.2d 918]; <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>189 Cal. 732, 736 [210 P. 36].) Under the law in existence in March 1967, \u201cinadequacy of damages awarded by the jury,\u201d specified in plaintiff\u2019s notice of intention to move for a new trial was not a ground for a new trial allowed by section 657, Code of Civil Procedure, and could be reached only on \u201cinsufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict\u201d <em>(Bray </em>v. <em>Rosen, </em>167 Cal.App.2d 680, 685 [335 P.2d 137]) which was not here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>expressly alleged in the notice. While \u201cinadequacy of damages awarded by the jury\u201d specified in the notice implies that the evidence was insufficient on this ground, the moving papers put all on notice that in fact the main ground of the motion was that the evidence was insufficient to support the award of damages. \u201cIn the instant case, one of the grounds for new trial set forth in the notice of intention to move for new trial was that the damages awarded were inadequate, which denomination would indicate that the evidence was insufficient on this ground. In addition thereto, plaintiff submitted therewith a document entitled \u2018Memorandum in Support of Motion for New Trial,\u2019 which plaintiff claims with considerable merit, constituted but one pleading, which, when construed together, evidenced plaintiff\u2019s intention to move for a new trial on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">\u201cA notice of intention to move for new trial requires that the grounds for the motion be set forth to apprise the court and opposing counsel of the basis of the motion. In this particular case, rather than using the shotgun procedure of listing all possible grounds upon which a new trial may be made, counsel determined in his memorandum, and by that memorandum spelled out the ground of insufficiency of the evidence and limited the presentation of three specific grounds. . . . These three specific grounds were stated and argued to the trial court and were the same grounds to which defendant\u2019s points and authorities in opposition to a motion for new trial relate. Therein defendant set forth certain evidence which he claimed sufficiently supported the verdict in the lesser amount.  The purpose of all noticing procedures in the Code of Civil Procedure appears to be to ensure that the procedure utilized actually affords reasonable notice to the opposing party. Thus defendant cannot now contend that, at the hearing of the motion for a new trial, he was unaware that plaintiff intended to argue this question.  Although Code of Civil Procedure, section 659, was amended in 1959, it might appear that <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Helene Curtis Industries, Inc., 117 </em>Cal.App.2d 66 [254 P.2d 931], might set forth the law applicable to this particular section as it now reads. The court there said: \u2018. . . the principle is sound that when the adverse party has been given due notice that such a motion will be made and is fully apprised of the grounds to be urged the jurisdiction of the court is complete.\u2019 We conclude that the trial court had jurisdiction to grant a new trial on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence.\u201d <em>(McFarland </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>220 Cal.App.2d 585, 589-590 [33 Cal.Rptr. 754].)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Under the foregoing and in light of plaintiff\u2019s moving papers we cannot hold nor does appellant claim that it was misled. The motion was made on the declaration of Samuel Maidman and points and authorities attached thereto. At the outset the declaration asserted that the verdict in the sum of $800 is totally inadequate based on uncontradieted evidence which supports a larger award.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And of controlling significance, plaintiff argued in her points and authorities attached to the declaration that if the trial judge believes the amount of the verdict to be grossly inadequate \u201cthen the verdict is not supported by the evidence and a new trial should be granted <em>upon the ground of insufficiency of the evidence.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Italics added.) Thus, we are persuaded that while \u201cinsufficiency of the evidence to justify the verdict\u201d is not expressly stated in the notice, the specification of \u201cinadequacy of damages awarded by the jury\u201d and the moving papers make it clear beyond doubt that insufficiency of the evidence was in fact a ground urged by plaintiff, known to defendant and considered and determined by the trial judge in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The granting or denial of a new trial is a matter resting largely in the discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed except on a manifest and unmistakable abuse. <em>(McFarland </em>v. <em>Voorheis-Trindle Co., </em>52 Cal.2d 698, 707 [343 P.2d 923]; <em>Ballard </em>v. <em>Pacific Greyhound Lines, </em>28 Cal.2d 357, 359 [170 P.2d 465] <em>; Mullin </em>v. <em>Kaiser Foundation Hospitals, </em>206 Cal.App.2d 23, 29 [23 Cal.Rptr. 410].)  Error is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>not presumed and the burden is on appellant to affirmatively show its presence in the record. <em>(Yarrow </em>v. <em>State of Califor</em>nia, 53 Cal.2d 427, 434 [2 Cal.Rptr. 137, 348 P.2d 687] ; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Keckler, </em>228 Cal.App.2d 199, 205 [39 Cal.Rptr. 267] ; <em>Benwell </em>v. <em>Dean, </em>227 Cal.App.2d 226, 231 [38 Cal.Rptr. 542].)  Appellant has not sustained its burden of establishing error; and, in the absence of a trial transcript (the cause is before us on the judgment roll alone) there is manifest no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion in granting the motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Wood, P. J., and Fourt, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The notice of intention to move for new trial specified the following grounds upon which the motion would be made: \u201c1.
