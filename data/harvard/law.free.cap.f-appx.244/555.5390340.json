(\u201cCurt Bean Transport\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their claim against defendants-appellees Ray Williams and Deep South Freight (\u201cDeep South\u201d). This case turns on the definition of \u201cresident\u201d for purposes of Mississippi\u2019s borrowing statute, Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-65, and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-15\">In April, 2003, the parties to this lawsuit were involved in a vehicular accident. The accident occurred in Louisiana, but none of the parties haled from that state. Nearly three years after the accident, Vahle, a resident of Missouri, and Curt Bean Transport, an Arkansas corporation, filed this action against Williams, a Mississippi resident, and Deep South, an Alabama company, in the Southern District of Mississippi. The defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that under Mississippi\u2019s borrowing statute, Louisiana\u2019s one-year prescription period barred the action. The district court agreed and dismissed the case. We review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss de novo, applying the same standard as the district court. <em>See Frank v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>314 F.3d 195, 197 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-16\">Mississippi\u2019s borrowing statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-17\">[w]hen a cause of action has accrued outside of this state, and by the laws of the place outside this state where such case of action accrued, an action thereon cannot be maintained by reason of lapse of time, then no action thereon shall be maintained in this state; provided, that where such a cause of action has accrued in favor of a resident of this state, this state\u2019s law on the period of limitations shall apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-18\">Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 15-1-65. The appellants concede that under Louisiana law, their claims would be barred by the one-year prescription period. <em>See </em>La. Rev. Code Art. 3492. Moreover, they concede that Vahle is a Missouri resident, and Curt Bean Transport an Arkansas corporation. Their lone contention, therefore, is that because they have conducted significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>business in Mississippi, they should be considered residents of Mississippi for purpos\u00e9 of the borrowing statute, and that Mississippi\u2019s more generous three-year statute of limitations should govern their claims. As explained below, this is not accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The appellants rely heavily on <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Paw Paw\u2019s Camper City, Inc., </em>in which we held that a non-resident corporation \u201cqualified to do business\u201d in Mississippi is a resident for purposes of the borrowing statute and enjoys \u201cthe same ... rights and privileges as a domestic corporation.\u201d 346 F.3d 153, 156 (5th Cir.2003) (citing <em>C.H. Leavell &amp; Co. v. Doster, </em>211 So.2d 813 (Miss.1968)). Nowhere in <em>St. Paul Fire </em>did we hold that <em>any </em>plaintiff that simply <em>does business </em>in Mississippi qualifies as a \u201cresident\u201d for purposes of the borrowing statute. Curt Bean Transport possesses neither a license nor a valid certificate of authority to do business in Mississippi, and is therefore not \u201cqualified to do business\u201d in the state. It has avoided the burdens that accompany being a resident, and cannot now reap the benefits. Furthermore, Vahle is a person, not a corporation, and falls outside even the broadest reading of <em>St. Paul Fire, </em>which only interpreted the borrowing statute as it related to a corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The plaintiffs also raise a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to the borrowing statute for the first time on appeal. We do not review claims raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Discount Centers, Inc., </em>200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir .2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">As the district court held, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims are not governed by Mississippi\u2019s three-year statute of limitations, but rather Louisiana\u2019s one-year prescription period. Their claims are accordingly time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b578-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
