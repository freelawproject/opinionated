No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-23\">Fernandez pled guilty to two counts of possession with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The district court attributed one kilogram of cocaine base and two kilograms of cocaine hydrochlroide to him and set his base offense level at 36, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3). The district court sentenced Fernandez to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment; and the court later denied his motion to reduce that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-24\">On appeal, Fernandez argues that the district court erred in concluding that Amendment 591 to the Sentencing Guidelines \u2014 which requires that a defendant\u2019s applicable Guideline section be determined by the offense of conviction \u2014 did not provide a basis to reduce his sentence. He asserts that his offense of conviction only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>includes conduct charged in his indictment or listed in his plea agreement; and neither his indictment nor his plea agreement specified a drug quantity attributable to him. Therefore, although Fernandez acknowledges that the district court sentenced him pursuant to the appropriate Guideline, he contends that \u2014 because he did not admit to a specific drug quantity\u2014 the district court selected the wrong base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 and erred in not sentencing him under the provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 that carries a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years. Fernandez argues that Amendment 591 is retroactively applicable; and as a result, his sentence should be reduced so that it does not exceed the statutory maximum of 20 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2003). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment if the defendant was \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission....\u201d Therefore, \u201cthe court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 ] 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Amendment 591 is listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement provided at U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a), it can be applied retroactively. <em>See United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1219 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1050, 126 S.Ct. 1643, 164 L.Ed.2d 351 (2006); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">In <em>Moreno, </em>the defendant argued that Amendment 591 prohibited the court \u201cfrom selecting the base offense level ... where the judge (not the jury) found the requisite drug quantity used in determining the appropriate base offense level under the applicable offense [Guideline.\u201d <em>Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1219. We rejected this argument, explaining that \u201cAmendment 591 directs the district court to apply the [Gjuideline dictated by the statute of conviction, but does not constrain the use of judicially found facts to select a base offense level within the relevant [Guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1219-20. In this case, Fernandez concedes that the district court properly relied on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, which is the Guideline applicable to offenses under section 841(a), in determining his sentence. Because Amendment 591 only applies to the district court\u2019s choice of the appropriate Guideline \u2014 and not to the base offense level within that Guideline \u2014 the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Fernandez\u2019s section 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-5\"> We note that Fernandez's reliance on <em>United States v. Cordoba-Murgas, </em>422 F.3d 65 (2d Cir.2005), is misplaced. In that recent decision, the Second Circuit vacated the defendant\u2019s sentence on direct appeal, concluding that \"when a defendant has been indicted for a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) involving an unspecified quantity of drugs, the defendant cannot be sentenced above the statutory maximum for an indeterminate quantity of drugs, as' set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).\" <em>Cordoba-Murgas, </em>422 F.3d at 66. Fernandez\u2019s case is distinguishable. He was sentenced in 1992, under the mandatory Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>lines system that existed at that time; and we affirmed his sentence on direct appeal. Fernandez's arguments that his sentence should be reduced because of <em>Cordoba-Murgas </em>and the Supreme Court's decisions in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), are without merit. <em>See Moreno, </em>421 F.3d at 1220 (explaining that <em>\u201cBooker </em>is a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable [G]uideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission. Therefore, <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to [section] 3582(c)(2) motions\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
