We granted a certificate of appealability on this issue: \u201cWhether the district court erred in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on [Riley\u2019s] claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to inform him of a plea agreement offered by the government.\u201d Reversible error has been shown; we vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-15\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. <em>See Breedlove v. Moore, </em>279 F.3d 952, 959 (11th Cir.2002). If a prisoner \u201calleges facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief, then the district court should order an evidentiary hearing and rule on the merits of his claim.\u201d <em>Holmes v. United States, </em>876 F.2d 1545, 1552 (11th Cir. 1989) (internal quotation omitted). But \u201ca district court is not required to hold an evidentiary hearing where the petitioner\u2019s allegations are affirmatively contradicted by the record, or the claims are patently frivolous.... \u201d <em>Aron v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 708, 715 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-16\">A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel presents a mixed question of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. Smith v. Singletary, </em>170 F.3d 1051, 1053 (11th Cir. 1999). \u201cTo prevail on an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, a habeas corpus petitioner must show that: (1) his lawyer\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would have pleaded guilty and would not have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-17\">Riley was charged with conspiracy to distribute more than 50 grams of a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>stance containing cocaine base. Riley\u2019s first trial for this offense ended with a hung jury. After Riley was convicted of the conspiracy offense at a second trial, Riley\u2019s trial lawyer, Victor Africano, withdrew from Riley\u2019s case. Thomas Miller assumed representation of Riley; and Riley was sentenced to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. According to Riley, Miller told Riley that the government had made an offer to Africano \u2014 before Riley\u2019s second trial \u2014 that Riley could plead guilty and serve a sentence of \u201c8 to 15 years\u201d in prison. Riley asserts that he was not informed of this plea offer and that, if he was timely informed of the government\u2019s plea offer, he would have accepted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">As part of its response to Riley\u2019s section 2255 motion, the government submitted an affidavit by Miller stating that \u201cAt no time during undersigned counsel\u2019s representation of defendant was a \u2018plea offer\u2019 tendered by the government which would/ could have resulted in a reduced sentence.\u201d In deciding that an evidentiary hearing was not required in this case, the district court noted, among other things, that Miller\u2019s affidavit explained that no plea was offered during Miller\u2019s representation of Riley. The government argues that Miller\u2019s affidavit refutes Riley\u2019s claim that Miller had advised him of a government plea offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">But Miller\u2019s affidavit only addresses events during Miller\u2019s representation of Riley and does not respond to Riley\u2019s allegation that a plea offer was made while Riley was represented by Africano. Therefore, Miller\u2019s affidavit does not affirmatively contradict Riley\u2019s assertion that Miller told him of a plea offer made by the government before Miller succeeded Africano in representing Riley. For this reason, the district court erred in concluding that an evidentiary hearing was not appropriate here.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">We vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Riley\u2019s section 2255 motion and remand this case for the district court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Riley\u2019s claim that his trial lawyer was ineffective for not informing him of a plea offer made by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">VACATED AND REMANDED. \u25a0</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1024-5\"> We note that, although the government's response to Riley's section 2255 motion denied making a plea offer to Riley and the government has explained that its standard operating procedure does not include making plea offers of specific sentences, the government has not submitted a sworn affidavit stating that a plea offer was never made in Riley\u2019s case. Therefore, the record contains no sworn affidavits from the government or from Africano, who is deceased. Riley has submitted an affidavit supporting his version of events; and Miller's affidavit is unresponsive to Riley's allegation that Miller was aware of a plea offer made during Africano's representation of Riley. In the light of all of these circumstances, an evidentiary hearing is not inappropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
