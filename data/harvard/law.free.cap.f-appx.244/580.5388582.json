He asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress incriminating statements made to law enforcement agents. Carbajal maintains that the agents coerced his guilty plea by allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>him to meet with his pregnant wife before taking him to jail and by telling his wife that she should convince Carbajal to cooperate with their investigation. The totality of the circumstances shows that Carbajal\u2019s statements were made without governmental coercion. <em>See United States v. Cardenas, </em>410 F.3d 287, 292-93 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Bell, </em>367 F.3d 452, 461 (5th Cir.2004). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b602-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
