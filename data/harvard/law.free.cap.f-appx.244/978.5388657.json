For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-15\">In August 2006, Lariscy was convicted of making a threat against the President of the United States, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871(a), and sentenced to 15 months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. Special Condition Number 2 of Lariscy\u2019s supervised release prohibited him from consuming alcoholic beverages. Standard Condition Number 2 required that Lariscy report to the probation officer and submit a truthful and complete written report within the first five days of each month.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-16\">On the evening of December 21, 2006, U.S. Probation Officer David Lamb made an unannounced visit to Lariscy\u2019s home and observed Lariscy sitting with an open can of beer while entertaining a female friend. Lariscy admitted to Officer Lamb that he had been drinking and stated that he was \u201ctoo old to change.\u201d Based on this encounter, on January 10, 2007, Officer Lamb filed a petition to revoke Lariscy\u2019s supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-17\">On January 11, 2007, Officer Lamb phoned Lariscy and told him to report to the probation office for a urinalysis scheduled later that day. Lariscy asked Officer Lamb to postpone the urinalysis until the next day, but Lamb refused. Lariscy became upset and stated that \u201che didn\u2019t know he was living in Nazi, Georgia.\u201d Lariscy failed to report to the probation office for his urine test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-18\">On January 12, 2007, Officer Tony Taylor went to Lariscy\u2019s home to execute the arrest warrant arising from the January 10th revocation petition. Lariscy greeted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>Taylor in a \u201cvery hostile\u201d manner and reiterated his references to living in \u201cNazi, Georgia.\u201d Officer Taylor saw Lariscy with a beer, smelled the aroma of alcohol on Lariscy\u2019s person, and surmised that he was intoxicated. After Lariscy calmed down, Officer Taylor arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">On January 25, 2007, Officer Lamb filed an addendum to the revocation petition, reporting Lariscy\u2019s refusal to submit to a urinalysis on January 11th and his consumption of alcohol January 12th.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">At the revocation hearing, the district court heard the testimony of Officers Lamb and Taylor regarding the events of December 21, 2006 and January 12, 2007. On cross-examination, Officer Lamb testified that he had visited Lariscy\u2019s home twice before his December 2006 visit and had not observed any other infractions. Officer Taylor testified that he did not use an intoximeter on Lariscy the day he arrested him, and that although he had been to Lariscy\u2019s home before, none of those previous encounters had caused him to believe that Lariscy was violating the conditions of his supervised release. The court also considered written statements of three employees of a county detention center made several hours after Lariscy\u2019s arrest. All three of the detention center employees stated that Lariscy did not appear to be intoxicated at the time they observed him, which was five to six hours after his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">Before imposing sentence, the district court noted that it had been \u201cvery lenient\u201d in imposing Lariscy\u2019s initial sentence. The court stated that Lariscy \u201chas a propensity to drink or to consume alcohol, and then he is capable in the Court\u2019s view of great mischief when he does that.\u201d In discussing Lariscy\u2019s potential for violence, the district court noted that Lariscy had previously threatened an attorney who was administering an estate, that federal agents had unsuccessfully attempted to dissuade Lariscy from threatening the President, and that in another criminal case, a defendant had stolen a \u201csmall arsenal\u201d from Lariscy. The court went on to state that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-8\">I thought Mr. Lariscy would heed the Court\u2019s sentence on that previous occasion last. The Court, in my view, gave him a very lenient sentence. The probation officer points that out. But yet, Mr. Lariscy has the potential to be violent, or at least to give people cause regarding his threats.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-9\">After he was released by the prison authorities, within three months, we have him consuming alcohol. It seems that all previous occasions when he was in trouble it was due to the consumption of alcohol. The previous sentence imposed was 12 to 18 months below the applicable guideline imprisonment range.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-10\">So the Court will not extend much more sympathy to thinking this is an old man with a loud mouth and a violent temperament. If I thought he was harmless, totally harmless, I would fashion a sentence in accordance with that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">After stating that it had \u201cconsidered the Sentencing Commission\u2019s Chapter 7 advice,\u201d the district court sentenced Lariscy to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment. Lariscy appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-13\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). Our \u201c[r]eview for reasonableness is deferential,\u201d and \u201cthe party who challenges the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a) ].\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We review the district court\u2019s decision to exceed the advisory sentencing range in Chapter 7 of the Sentencing Guidelines for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>443 F.3d 795, 798 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Upon finding by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant has violated a condition of his supervised release, a district court may, after considering the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a), revoke the term of supervised release \u201cand require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e); <em>Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d at 1107. When revoking a term of supervised release pursuant to \u00a7 3583(e), pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, providing just punishment for the offense, affording adequate deterrence, the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, the Sentencing Guidelines range, and the relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Chapter 7 of the Guidelines governs violations of supervised release and contains policy statements providing recommended ranges of imprisonment applicable upon revocation. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, p.s.; <em>Silva, </em>443 F.3d at 799. This court has consistently held that the policy statements of Chapter 7 are merely advisory and not binding. <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). Thus, although \u201cthe district court is required to consider the policy statements, it is not bound by them.\u201d <em>Silva, </em>443 F.3d at 799. \u201cWhen exceeding the recommended range, the court must normally indicate that it considered the Chapter 7 policy statements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[I]t is enough that there is some indication that the district court was aware of and considered them.\u201d <em>Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">A. Consideration of the 18 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">\u00a7 3553(a) Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-11\">Lariscy argues that the 24-month sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable because the court failed to adequately consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-12\">Although the court did not explicitly reference \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing sentence, the court\u2019s discussion of Lariscy\u2019s history, his underlying offense of conviction, and his potential for violence demonstrates that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in imposing the sentence. For example, the court noted that Lariscy: (1) \u201chas a propensity to drink or to consume alcohol,\u201d which makes him capable \u201cof great mischief,\u201d (2) has the potential to be violent, (3) violated the conditions of his supervised release a mere three months after his release from prison, and (4) had received a \u201cvery lenient\u201d initial sentence. These statements establish that the court considered Lariscy\u2019s history and characteristics, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), the need to protect the public from further crimes of Lariscy, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C), and the need to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B). Moreover, the court\u2019s statements that federal agents had unsuccessfully attempted to dissuade Lariscy from threatening the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>President reflects the court\u2019s consideration of the nature and circumstances of Lariscy\u2019s underlying offense, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3558(a)(1). And the court stated explicitly that it \u201cconsidered the Sentencing Commission\u2019s Chapter 7 advice,\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(5). As such, the record establishes that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, and Lariscy\u2019s reasonableness challenge fails in this regard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">B. Whether the Sentence Is Greater than Necessary</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Lariscy also argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the goals of the Sentencing Reform Act. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">In imposing a sentence that exceeded the Chapter 7 advisory range,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court stated that it had \u201cconsidered the Sentencing Commission\u2019s Chapter 7 advice.\u201d <em>See Silva, </em>443 F.3d at 799; <em>Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d at 1320. And, as discussed above, the court discussed Lariscy\u2019s previous \u201cvery lenient sentence,\u201d his \u201cpotential to be violent,\u201d the \u201cgreat mischief\u2019 that ensues from his \u201cpropensity to drink or consume alcohol,\u201d and the passage of a mere three months before he violated the terms of his supervised release. On this record, we cannot say that Lariscy\u2019s 24-month sentence was unreasonable or that the district court\u2019s imposition of this sentence was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">IY. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">. The Government asserts that because Lariscy failed to object at sentencing either that his sentence was unreasonable or that the district court did not consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we should review Lariscy\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of his sentence for plain error. But we need not decide this issue, because even under a reasonableness standard, Lariscy\u2019s appeal fails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">. Lariscy's underlying offense of conviction carries a mandatory maximum sentence of five years\u2019 imprisonment and is considered a Class D felony. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a)(2); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 871(a). For a Class D felony, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) authorizes a term of supervised release of not more than two years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Under the Chapter 7 policy statements, Lariscy's advisory Guidelines range of incarceration upon revocation was three to nine months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
