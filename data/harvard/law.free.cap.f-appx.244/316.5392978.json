Gonzalez argues on appeal that his conviction under \u00a7 841(a)(1) was duplicitous with his convictions under \u00a7 1791(a), that his convictions under \u00a7 1791(a)(1) and (2) were duplicitous with each other, and that his charge under \u00a7 841(a)(1) should have been treated as a lesser included offense of his charge under \u00a7 1791(a)(1). For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-16\">A federal indictment charged Gonzalez with the above-referenced offenses, as well as conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. Gonzalez filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to dismiss his charges under \u00a7 1791(a)(1) and (2) as resulting in multiple punishments for the same offense, in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Gonzalez likewise filed a <em>pro se </em>motion to dismiss his charges under \u00a7 841(a)(1) and \u00a7 1791(a)(1) and (2), as charging the same offense charged in the conspiracy count. The government responded to these motions, arguing that none of the counts in the indictment were duplicitous, as each required proof of a fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>not required by the others, pursuant to the test described in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). The district court agreed and denied Gonzalez\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">After a trial, a jury convicted Gonzalez of the above-referenced offenses. The jury could not reach a verdict, however, on the conspiracy charge, and the district court dismissed this charge on the government\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Gonzalez then filed another motion challenging his convictions under \u00a7 1791(a)(1) and (2) as duplicitous, arguing that these convictions punished him twice under the same statute for the same conduct. The district court denied Gonzalez\u2019s motion, reasoning that it had previously denied identical arguments and that Gonzalez had presented no new facts that merited revisiting the issue. Gonzalez appealed the district court\u2019s denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">After he was sentenced to 36 months\u2019 imprisonment for each of his charges, with the sentence for his violation of \u00a7 1791(a)(1) to be served consecutively to the sentences for his other violations, Gonzalez also appealed his convictions. Upon Gonzalez\u2019s motion, the district court consolidated Gonzalez\u2019s two appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The statutes in question in the instant appeal are \u00a7 841(a)(1) and \u00a7 1791(a)(1) and (2). To support a conviction under \u00a7 841(a)(1), the evidence must show that the defendant knowingly and intentionally possessed with the intent to distribute and dispensed a controlled substance. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). To support a conviction under \u00a7 1791(a)(1), the evidence must show that the defendant \u2014 either an inmate or non-inmate \u2014 knowingly and intentionally dispensed a prohibited object to a federal inmate and thereby violated a statute and/or prison rule. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a)(1); <em>see also United States v. Ponder, </em>963 F.2d 1506, 1512 (11th Cir. 1992). To support a conviction under \u00a7 1791(a)(2), the evidence must show that the defendant knowingly and intentionally possessed a prohibited object while he was incarcerated in a federal prison. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a)(2) and (d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">The definition of \u201cprohibited object\u201d includes controlled substances, such as heroin, as well as firearms and currency. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(d)(1). Also according to \u00a7 1791, if a defendant violates \u00a7 1791(a) and the violation involves a controlled substance, such as heroin, his sentence for that violation must be served consecutively to \u201cany other sentence imposed by any court for an offense involving such a controlled substance.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(c). The legislative history for \u00a7 1791 does not explain the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the provision. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">\n<em>I. Duplicity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">Regarding Gonzalez\u2019s appellate arguments that his convictions were duplicitous, the Double Jeopardy Clause generally protects defendants \u201cfrom being subjected to the hazards of trial and possible conviction more than once for an alleged offense.\u201d <em>Missouri v. Hunter, </em>459 U.S. 359, 365, 103 S.Ct. 673, 678, 74 L.Ed.2d 535 (1983). The Supreme Court has explained, however, that in the context of a single trial the clause also protects defendants from being subjected to cumulative punishments for a single offense when the legislature did not intend as much. <em>Id. </em>Thus, it is unconstitutional to indict a defendant on two charges stemming from one offense absent an indication that Congress intended this charging scheme, as a conviction on both charges would lead to cumulative sentences. <em>See id. </em>When an indictment unlawfully charges a single offense in multiple counts in this manner, it is duplicitous. <em>See United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>v. Sirang, </em>70 F.3d 588, 595 (11th Cir. 1995). We review allegations of duplicity <em>de novo. United States v. Hassoun, </em>476 F.3d 1181, 1185 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">Our review begins with an inquiry into whether Congress intended to authorize cumulative punishment when it enacted the criminal statutes in question. <em>See id. </em>To ascertain Congress\u2019s intention, we look to the legislative history of the statutory provisions. <em>Id. </em>We also look to the language of the statute. <em>Garfield v. NDC Health Corp., </em>466 F.3d 1255, 1266 (11th Cir.2006). Indeed, we have held that \u201cwhen a statute speaks with clarity to an issue judicial inquiry into the statute\u2019s meaning, in all but the most extraordinary circumstance, is finished.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">In the absence of clear evidence of legislative intent regarding cumulative punishment, however, our review depends on the test espoused in <em>Bloclcburger </em>that \u201cwhere the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions,\u201d cumulative punishment is acceptable if \u201ceach provision requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.\u201d <em>Hassoun, </em>476 F.3d at 1185 (citing <em>Block-burger, </em>284 U.S. at 304, 52 S.Ct. at 182). In applying this test, we limit our examination to the elements of the offenses and do not consider \u201cthe facts alleged in the indictment to support the counts nor the \u2018practical significance\u2019 of the theories alleged for each count.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1186. If the <em>Blockburger </em>test is satisfied, there is a rebuttable presumption of congressional intent to authorize cumulative punishment, such that an indictment is not unlawfully duplicitous. <em>Id. </em>at 1186-87 (holding that the presumption could be rebutted by evidence that Congress intended otherwise).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">\n<em>a. Section 8^1 (a)(1) v. Section 1791(a)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Specifically regarding Gonzalez\u2019s appellate argument that his conviction under \u00a7 841(a)(1) \u2014 for distributing and possessing with intent to distribute heroin \u2014 is duplicitous with his convictions under \u00a7 1791(a) \u2014 for providing heroin to an inmate and possessing heroin as an inmate, we conclude that these convictions were not unlawfully duplicitous, per the language of \u00a7 1791. <em>See Garfield, </em>466 F.3d at 1266. Pursuant to the language of the statute, a defendant has not violated \u00a7 1791(a)(l)\u2019s prohibition of dispensing a controlled substance to an inmate unless his conduct violates another criminal statute or prison rule. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a)(1). Thus, this provision contemplates that a defendant\u2019s single act will violate multiple statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">Moreover, also pursuant to the language of \u00a7 1791, when the defendant violates \u00a7 1791(a), either by providing or possessing a controlled substance, his sentence for that violation must be served consecutively to any other sentence involving a controlled substance. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(c). Thus, this provision also contemplates that a defendant will be convicted and sentenced separately for violations of multiple statutes. Accordingly, because the language of \u00a7 1791 contemplates a situation, such as the instant situation, in which a defendant simultaneously violated \u00a7 841 and \u00a7 1791(a) and received consecutive sentences for these violations, it appears that Congress intended to allow cumulative punishments under \u00a7 841 and \u00a7 1791. <em>See Hassoun, </em>476 F.3d at 1185; <em>Garfield, </em>466 F.3d at 1266. We hold, therefore, that the district court did not err in convicting Gonzalez under both \u00a7 841(a)(1) and \u00a7 1791(a). <em>See Hassoun, </em>476 F.3d at 1185.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">\n<em>b. Section 1791(a)(1) v. Section 1791(a)(2)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">Specifically regarding Gonzalez\u2019s appellate argument that his conviction under \u00a7 1791(a)(1) \u2014 for providing heroin to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>an inmate \u2014 was duplicitous with his conviction under \u00a7 1791(a)(2) \u2014 for possessing heroin as an inmate, we conclude that these convictions were not unlawfully cumulative, per the <em>Blockburger </em>test, which is applicable since there is no evidence of Congress\u2019s intent in enacting \u00a7 1791. <em>See Hassoun, </em>476 F.3d at 1185; <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Per this test, \u00a7 1791(a)(1) and (a)(2) each require proof of a fact not required by the other. <em>See id. </em>at 1185. A violation of \u00a7 1791(a)(1) requires proof that the transferee of the prohibited object was a federal inmate, which is not required for a violation of \u00a7 1791(a)(2). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a)(1) and (2). A violation of \u00a7 1791(a)(2) requires proof that the defendant was a federal inmate when his conduct occurred, which is not required by \u00a7 1791(a)(1). <em>See id.; Ponder, </em>963 F.2d at 1512. Accordingly, because each of the convictions requires proof of an additional fact, it appears that cumulative punishments for \u00a7 1791(a)(1) and (2) do not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>See Hassoun, </em>476 F.3d at 1185. We hold, therefore, that the district court did not err in denying Gonzalez\u2019s motion challenging these counts of his indictment and in convicting Gonzalez under both subsections of \u00a7 1791(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\n<em>II. Lesser-included Offense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Regarding Gonzalez\u2019s appellate argument that his charge under \u00a7 841(a)(1) should have been treated as a lesser-included offense of his charge under \u00a7 1791(a)(1), a lesser included offense is an offense such that \u201cit is impossible to commit the greater without having first committed the lesser.\u201d <em>Theriault v. United States, </em>434 F.2d 212, 214 (5th Cir.1970). Stated differently, if all of the elements of an offense constitute a subset of the elements of another offense, the former offense should be treated as a lesser included of the latter offense. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">However, we will not correct an error that the defendant failed to raise in the district court unless (1) the district court did, in fact, err, (2) the error was plain, (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>United States v. Kennard, </em>472 F.3d 851, 858 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 3004, \u2014 L.Ed.2d \u2014 (2007) (considering a defendant\u2019s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that the district court gave an erroneous jury instruction).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-13\">We will review Gonzalez\u2019s lesser-included offense argument only for plain error because the record demonstrates that he raises it for the first time on appeal. <em>See Kennard, </em>472 F.3d at 858.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>charging scheme was not erroneous. It would be possible to violate \u00a7 1791(a)(1) without having first violated \u00a7 841(a)(1), in that a defendant could have dispensed a prohibited object to a federal inmate without having also dispensed a controlled substance since the definition of prohibited object includes objects other than controlled substances. <em>See Theriault, </em>434 F.2d at 214; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(d)(1). Also, it is feasible that a defendant could have dispensed heroin without having first possessed with intent to distribute heroin, in that a defendant could simply arrange that heroin be given to an inmate. <em>See Theriault, </em>434 F.2d at 214; 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Moreover, and perhaps most importantly, because the language of \u00a7 1791(a)(1) contemplates that a defendant could simultaneously violate both \u00a7 841(a)(1) and \u00a7 1791(a)(1) and be sentenced separately for these violations, as discussed above, it appears that Congress did not intend for a violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1) to be a lesser included of a violation of \u00a7 1791(a)(1). We hold, therefore, that the district court did not plainly err in charging Gonzalez\u2019s alleged violations of \u00a7 841(a)(1) and \u00a7 1791(a)(1) as principals. <em>See Kennard, </em>472 F.3d at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Ill. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">Because Gonzalez\u2019s convictions were not duplicitous and because the district court\u2019s charging scheme was not erroneous, we affirm the district courts\u2019 denial of Gonzalez\u2019s motion and affirm Gonzalez\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\">. On appeal, Gonzalez argues that the <em>Block-burger </em>test is inapplicable when, as here, a defendant is charged twice under the same statute. Contrary to Gonzalez's contention, however, we have not held that the test is inapplicable to these situations. Rather, in <em>Hassoun, </em>we held only that our usual purely elemental inquiry should be supplemented with a fact-based analysis when a defendant is charged with two counts of violating one statutory provision. 476 F.3d at 1185-87. Moreover, <em>Hassoun, </em>unlike here, concerned two charges stemming from the same conspiracy language and using the same facts. <em>Id. </em>Thus, because we only held we should look at the facts to determine if the <em>Blockburger </em>test is satisfied and because even this limited holding is not binding since the instant appeal is distinguishable from <em>Hassoun </em>because it concerns charges stemming from two substantive provisions and using different facts, the traditional <em>Blockburger </em>test is appropriate here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b342-15\">. On appeal, Gonzalez argues that he raised his lesser-included offense claim at his sentencing hearing before the district court. Our review reveals, however, that Gonzalez only raised a markedly different argument at that hearing, namely that the jury should have been instructed that they could convict Gon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>zalez of the lesser-included offense of simple possession, rather than possession with intent to distribute under \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
