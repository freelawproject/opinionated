Padilla was sentenced to 46 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-24\">Padilla contends that the district court erred by increasing his base offense level by 16 levels, based on its finding that his 1998 Texas conviction of delivery of cocaine was a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). He maintains that the Texas delivery statute encompasses the conduct of \u201coffering to sell,\u201d which exceeds the breadth of the guidelines definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense,\u201d and that the 1998 state-court papers that were submitted at his sentencing proceeding were inadequate to \u201cnarrow the offense of conviction to one that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>encompassed within\u201d the guidelines definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">In considering whether a prior conviction qualifies as a drug-trafficking offense, the court may look to the statutory definition and elements of the offense, the charging documents, a written plea agreement, the guilty-plea transcript, factual findings by the trial judge to which the defendant assented, and jury instructions. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (addressing enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act); <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 273 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005); <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714-15 (5th Cir.2007). In <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>which involved a California statute, this court held that offers to sell a controlled substance are not drug-trafficking offenses under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 274-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Although the charging document for Padilla\u2019s 1998 conviction accused him of \u201cpossessfing] with intent to deliver\u201d more than four grams but less than 200 grams of cocaine and did not include the language \u201coffer[ing] to sell,\u201d another document reflected that Padilla pleaded guilty only to \u201cDelivery Cocaine <em>1-i </em>grams,\u201d with no further explanation. In <em>Gonzales, </em>this court addressed a prior conviction under Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.112, in which the indictment stated that Gonzales \u201c \u2018did unlawfully, knowingly and intentionally deliver, to-wit: actually transfer, constructively transfer, <em>and offer to sell </em>a controlled substance.\u2019 \u201d 484 F.3d at 715 (emphasis added). Because the \u201cindictment and jury instructions permitted the jury to convict Gonzales for behavior that does not constitute a drug-trafficking offense,\u201d we held that the district court committed plain error \u201cwhen it concluded that Gonzales\u2019s prior conviction was a for a drug-trafficking offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 716. Padilla\u2019s 1998 charging document did not include the problematic \u201coffering to sell\u201d language; however, the actual plea document in his case left open the distinct possibility that Padilla was convicted for behavior that did not constitute a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, we must vacate and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Padilla also challenges the constitutionality of the treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. Padilla\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed' by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although he contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>remains binding. <em>See Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 276. Padilla properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b572-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
