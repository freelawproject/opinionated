He was sentenced to 168 months of imprisonment. In 2005, VanBuren filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>a post-judgment motion alleging, inter alia, that counsel had been ineffective in failing to file a timely notice of appeal as requested. The court granted relief on this ground under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), vacated VanBuren\u2019s sentence, and imposed the same sentence in the judgment order, thereby allowing VanBuren an opportunity to file a timely notice of appeal. On appeal, VanBuren argues that his sentence violates <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that his counsel was ineffective, and that the district court abused its discretion in limiting defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of one of the Government\u2019s witnesses. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">On appeal, VanBuren maintains that his <em>post-Booker </em>sentence is unreasonable. Specifically, he claims that the district court, in granting post-conviction relief, violated <em>Booker </em>by imposing the same sentence without conducting a hearing, treating the sentencing guidelines as advisory, and considering the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007), as required under <em>Booker. </em>VanBuren also posits a different but related argument claiming that his <em>pre-Booker </em>sentence is unreasonable because the court treated the guidelines as mandatory and failed to adequately consider the factors under \u00a7 3553(a). Although VanBuren predominantly challenges his sentence on reasonableness grounds, he briefly asserts a Sixth Amendment argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">After <em>Booker, </em>a district court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in imposing a sentence post-<em>Booker, </em>courts still must calculate the applicable Guidelines range after making the appropriate findings of fact and consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the Guidelines and \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). This court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">As a threshold matter, VanBuren improperly treats the district court\u2019s reentry of judgment as substantive proceedings subject to challenge under <em>Booker. </em>Clearly, the district court vacated VanBuren\u2019s sentence and reimposed the same sentence in order to reinstate his direct appeal rights. Because VanBuren was effectively sentenced <em>pre-Booker, </em>the reasonableness standard of review is inapplicable. <em>See United States v. Hadden, </em>475 F.3d 652, 667-69 (4th Cir.2007) (holding that a court is free to merely \u201ccorrect\u201d a prisoner\u2019s sentence without the need for a formal resentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">In reviewing VanBuren\u2019s 1998 sentencing proceedings on constitutional and statutory grounds under <em>Booker, </em>because he made no objection to his sentence calculation in the district court, the claims are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 547-48. Under the plain error standard, VanBuren must show: (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected his substantial rights. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Even when these conditions are satisfied, this court may exercise its discretion to notice the error only if the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">Here, the indictment specifically charged VanBuren with possession with intent to distribute in excess of fifty grams <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>of cocaine base. His offense level was determined solely by the guideline dictating an offense level of thirty-two if the defendant was responsible for at least fifty grams but less than 150 grams of cocaine base, see <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(4) (1997). No enhancements were made to VanBuren\u2019s sentence. Because the court made no findings that increased VanBuren\u2019s sentence beyond what it would be based only on facts found by the jury, no Sixth Amendment violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Nor can VanBuren demonstrate any prejudice from the mandatory application of the Guidelines. In <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208 (4th Cir.2005), this court determined that, \u201ceven in the absence of a Sixth Amendment violation, the imposition of a sentence under the former mandatory guidelines regime rather than under the advisory regime outlined in <em>Booker </em>is error\u201d that is plain. <em>Id. </em>at 216-17. The court also concluded that, to satisfy the third prong of the plain error test, an appellant must demonstrate actual prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 217-24. White could not satisfy this requirement, however, because he could not establish that the application of the Guidelines as mandatory had an effect on \u201c \u2018the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 223 (quoting Williams v. <em>United States, </em>503 U.S. 193, 203, 112 S.Ct. 1112, 117 L.Ed.2d 341 (1992)). In this case, the record does not reveal any nonspeculative basis to indicate that the district court would have imposed a lesser sentence by treating the Guidelines as advisory. VanBuren therefore cannot demonstrate that the district court\u2019s error in sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">VanBuren also alleges on appeal that counsel was ineffective in (1) failing to pursue a guilty plea which would have resulted in a three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility; (2) failing to present evidence controverting the Government\u2019s allegations; (3) failing to contest the results of the laboratory report; and (4) compelling VanBuren to become a witness against himself. This court \u201cmay address [claims of ineffective assistance of counsel] on direct appeal only if the lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears from the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1203, 126 S.Ct. 1407, 164 L.Ed.2d 107 (2006). Because we find that ineffective assistance of counsel does not conclusively appear on the record, we do not address these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Last, VanBuren argues that the district court erred in limiting cross-examination of the Government\u2019s chain-of-custody witness concerning the witness\u2019s placement on administrative leave. This court reviews evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>482 F.3d 658, 662-63 (4th Cir.2007). We have reviewed the record and find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Accordingly, we affirm VanBuren\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
