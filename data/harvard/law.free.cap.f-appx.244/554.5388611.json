Johnson asserted in his complaint that he was prevented from exhausting the Administrative Remedy Program steps by prison officials\u2019 failure to pick up his Step 2 grievance in a timely fashion. In dismissing the complaint for failure to exhaust, the district court relied on Johnson\u2019s assertion that his administrative appeal was denied as untimely without considering Johnson\u2019s stated reasons for such denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The Supreme Court recently held \u201cthat failure to exhaust is an affirmative defense under the [Prison Litigation Reform Act], and that inmates are not required to specifically plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 910, 921, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b577-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
