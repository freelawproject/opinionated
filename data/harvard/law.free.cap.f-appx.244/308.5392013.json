He asserts two arguments on appeal, which we address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">Estupinan-Estupinan first contends the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over him because neither he nor his crime had a proven connection to the United States, and it offends \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice\u201d to allow an exercise of jurisdiction over him under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">\u201cA defendant who enters a plea of guilty waives all nonjurisdictional challenges to the constitutionality of the conviction, and only an attack on the voluntary and knowing nature of the plea can be sustained.\u201d <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>962 F.2d 996, 997 (11th Cir.1992). However, to the extent that Estupinan-Estupinan\u2019s challenge is to the district court\u2019s jurisdiction over him, we review his argument <em>de novo. See United States v. Perez, </em>956 F.2d 1098, 1101 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-16\">We have considered and rejected the argument that, because no \u201cnexus\u201d was proven between a defendant \u2014 a Colombian national who was apprehended on a \u201cgo fast\u201d boat in the Pacific Ocean and indicted under the MDLEA \u2014 and the United States, the district court lacked jurisdiction over the defendant. <em>See United States v. Rendon, </em>354 F.3d 1320, 1325 (11th Cir.2003). \u201c[UJnder the protective principle of international law, [Congress] may assert extraterritorial jurisdiction over vessels in the high seas that are engaged in conduct that has a potentially adverse effect and is generally recognized as a crime by nations that have reasonably developed legal systems.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). Furthermore, we emphasized that we, along with other Circuits, have rejected the argument that a \u201cnexus\u201d to the United States is a prerequisite to the exercise of jurisdiction under the MDLEA. <em>Id. </em>Because we have rejected the argument that a district court lacks jurisdiction over a foreign national indicted under the MDLEA for transportation of drugs in international waters, Estupinan-Estupinan\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-17\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-18\">Next, Estupinan-Estupinan contends the MDLEA is unconstitutional because it is an <em>ultra vires </em>exercise of Congress\u2019 power under Article I, \u00a7 8, cl. 10 of the Constitution, which gives Congress the power to \u201cdefine and punish Piracies and Felonies on the high seas.\u201d We have held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>the MDLEA does not exceed Congress\u2019 law-making authority, noting that the \u201cPiracies and Felonies\u201d Clause of the Constitution empowers Congress to \u201cdefine and punish Piracies and Felonies on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations,\u201d and the MDLEA was designed to \u201cpunish drug trafficking on the high seas, because drug trafficking aboard vessels (1) is a serious international problem and is universally condemned, and (2) presents a specific threat to the security and societal well-being of the United States.\u201d <em>United States v. Estupinan, </em>453 F.3d 1336, 1338 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1486, 167 L.Ed.2d 232 (2007) (quotations omitted). Because we have previously held the MDLEA does not exceed Congress\u2019 lawmaking authority, this argument also fails. Thus, we affirm Estupinan-Estupinan\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
