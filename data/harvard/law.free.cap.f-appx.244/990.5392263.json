After review, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-11\">Clavijo is a native and citizen of Colombia. In August 1998, Clavijo\u2019s three sisters were murdered in Colombia after they refused to make extortionate payments to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d). Clavijo began assisting Colombian authorities with the investigation into his sisters\u2019 murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-12\">Two days after the murders, Clavijo\u2019s brother received a telephone call from an individual who identified himself as a member of the FARC. The caller threatened to kill Clavijo if he continued to assist with the murder investigation. Clavijo continued to assist the police and continued to receive telephone death threats from the FARC.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-14\">During the investigation, police detained four individuals who were \u201curban guerrillas\u201d of the FARC. The urban guerrillas took orders from the FARC\u2019s \u201cjungle guerrillas.\u201d The four detainees were tried and, according to Clavijo, two were convicted and two were set free. One of the convicted detainees was Maria Concepcion Ladino Gutierrez, who was the leader of the urban guerrillas. After Gutierrez was convicted, Clavijo began to receive frequent threatening telephone calls in which unidentified callers stated that they would catch Clavijo. Clavijo learned during the investigation that the leader of the \u201cjungle guerrillas,\u201d Efrain Diaz-Sanchez, had been involved with his sisters\u2019 murders and wanted Clavijo killed because of his involvement in the murder investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-15\">In May 2000, a friend told Clavijo that he had overheard a group of men saying that they knew where Clavijo was and that money had been paid to have Clavijo killed. After hearing this information, Clavijo feared for his life and decided to leave Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-16\">Clavijo was admitted to the United States on June 12, 2000, as a nonimmigrant visitor with authorization to remain until December 11, 2000. On March 25, 2002, Clavijo filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief, alleging that he was persecuted by the FARC based on his political opinion. In response to the asylum application, the Department of Homeland Security served Clavijo with a notice to appear, charging him with removability under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>overstaying his visa. Clavijo conceded removability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">At his asylum hearing, Clavijo withdrew his application for asylum and proceeded with his application for withholding of removal and CAT relief. The parties stipulated to the facts in Clavijo\u2019s application. Clavijo also testified during the hearing consistent with his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">The government submitted the 2004 United States Department of State Country Report for Colombia. The 2004 Country Report noted that the FARC had committed hundreds of intentional killings and also had kidnapped civilians to help finance subversion and to put political pressure on the government. The 2004 Country Report also explained that the FARC persecutes and assassinates political leaders and government officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-6\">The IJ denied the application for withholding of removal and for CAT relief. The IJ found Clavijo credible, but concluded that Clavijo was statutorily ineligible for withholding of removal for two reasons. First, noting that Clavijo had not been arrested, detained or harmed directly, the IJ concluded that Clavijo had failed to demonstrate that he had suffered past persecution. Second, the IJ found that the FARC\u2019s death threats were motivated by Clavijo\u2019s involvement in the investigation into his sisters\u2019 murders, rather than by a protected ground. The IJ also concluded that Clavijo had failed to show that he had a well-founded fear of future persecution based on a protected ground. Finally, the IJ concluded that Clavijo was not entitled to CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-9\">Clavijo appealed to the BIA, which adopted, without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision. Clavijo filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-11\">On appeal, Clavijo argues that the IJ erred in concluding that Clavijo failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An alien seeking withholding of removal must show that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). In other words, the alien has the burden of proof to show that he \u201cmore-likely-than-not\u201d would be persecuted on account of one of the five protected grounds if returned to the country in question. <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). To establish eligibility, the alien must show either that he suffered past persecution or that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1), (2); <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-12\">Here, the IJ\u2019s finding that Clavijo did not suffer past persecution is .supported by substantial evidence. The tele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"993\">*993</page-number>phone death threats Clavijo received from the FARC do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 401 F.3d 1226, 1231 </em>(11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Furthermore, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that the FARC\u2019s death threats were motivated by Clavijo\u2019s involvement in the investigation into his sisters\u2019 murders, and not by Clavijo\u2019s actual or imputed political opinion. Likewise, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that any future persecution Clavijo fears also would be on account of Clavijo\u2019s involvement in the murder investigation and not on account of his actual or imputed political opinion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 </em>U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (explaining that an alien\u2019s refusal to cooperate with Colombian guerrillas because of the alien\u2019s political opinion is not sufficient; the alien must also show that the guerrillas\u2019s persecution occurs <em>\u201cbecause </em>of that political opinion, rather than because of his refusal to [cooperate] with them.\u201d); <em>Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>392 F.3d 434, 438 (11th Cir.2004) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Clavijo presented no evidence that the FARC\u2019s interest in him was due to his political opinion. Indeed, Clavijo essentially concedes as much in his counseled appeal brief, arguing that the FARC will loll him if he is returned to Colombia and asking, \u201cwhat is more important, the compliance with one of the five protected grounds or a human life?\u201d Clavijo did not present evidence that he belonged to a particular political party or that the threatening callers mentioned his political opinion or accused him of being involved in politics. The undisputed evidence shows that Clavijo was targeted by the FARC because he refused to comply with the FARC\u2019s demands to stop assisting the Colombian police with their murder investigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In other words, the death threats resulted from Clavijo\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the FARC\u2019s efforts to obstruct the murder investigation, not because of any political opinion held by Clavijo.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s finding that Clavijo was not statutorily eligible for withholding of removal is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">. Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ's decision without opinion under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), the IJ\u2019s decision becomes the final agency determination subject to review. See <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). We review a factual determination that an alien is statutorily ineligible for withholding of removal under the substantial evidence test. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001). Under the substantial evidence test, \"we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. The fact that evidence in the record may support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings does not warrant reversal. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir. 2004) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">. Notably, the FARC did not kill Clavijo's sisters because of their political opinions, but because they failed to continue making extortionate payments to the FARC. <em>See Rivera v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 815, 822-23 (11th Cir.2007) (concluding that persecution resulting from an alien\u2019s refusal to make extortionate payments to the FARC is not persecution \"on account of\u201d political opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1015-8\">. For the first time on appeal, Clavijo argues that he need not show that he would be singled out by the FARC if he returned to \u25a0 Colombia because there is a pattern and practice of persecution against those who collaborate in criminal investigations against the FARC. We lack jurisdiction to review this claim because Clavijo failed to exhaust it before the BIA. <em>See Fernandez-Bernal v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>257 F.3d 1304, 1317 n. 13 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">. On appeal, Clavijo did not raise any argument challenging the denial of CAT relief and, therefore, has abandoned that issue. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1228 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
