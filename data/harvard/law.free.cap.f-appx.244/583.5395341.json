In dismissing Smith\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted, the district court accepted the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge (\u201cMJ\u201d) in which the MJ determined that Smith had not alleged a physical injury as required under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e). We review the district court\u2019s decision <em>de novo. See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005); <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Smith argues that his symptoms constituted physical injuries and that Leonard\u2019s failure to remove allegedly toxic mold from the jail is gross negligence. Smith\u2019s alleged symptoms \u2014 headaches, sinus problems, trouble breathing, blurred vision, irritated eyes, and fatigue \u2014 may be sufficient to state a claim of physical injury under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e). <em>See Alexander v. Tippah Comity, </em>351 F.3d 626, 630-31 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Gomez v. Chandler, </em>163 F.3d 921, 924-25 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir. 1997). To the extent Smith\u2019s gross negligence claim is liberally construed to allege an Eighth Amendment claim of cruel and unusual punishment, he has alleged facts sufficient to preclude a determination that his mold claim is frivolous or fails to state a claim. <em>See Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 373; <em>Shipp v. McMahon, </em>234 F.3d 907, 911 (5th Cir.2000), <em>overruled on other grounds by McClendon v. City of Columbia, </em>305 F.3d 314 (5th Cir.2002) (en banc); <em>Palmer v. Johnson, </em>193 F.3d 346, 352 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we vacate the judgment as to the mold claim and remand for further proceedings on that claim. <em>See Geiger, </em>404 F.3d at 373; <em>Black, </em>134 F.3d at 733-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Smith does not make any arguments on appeal concerning lead paint, asbestos, or unsanitary food slots. Because he has abandoned those claims, we affirm their dismissal. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 612-13 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">The judgment is AFFIRMED in part and VACATED in part, and this case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b605-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
