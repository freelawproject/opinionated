The district court granted Jordan a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Federal habeas relief may not be granted upon any claim that was \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court\u201d unless the adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1) <em>&amp; </em>(2); <em>see Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">While Jordan argues that his counsel was ineffective for not filing a motion to suppress, this argument is subsumed within his argument that his counsel failed to properly investigate his case. The district court denied this claim on the ground that Jordan had not shown that his counsel\u2019s failure to file a motion to suppress prejudiced him, and Jordan has not challenged this determination. Accordingly, Jordan has waived any independent claim that his counsel was ineffective for not filing a motion to suppress. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987) (appellant\u2019s failure to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed that judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">Jordan argues that his counsel was ineffective for not objecting to an allegedly improper and prejudicial comment made by the trial judge. The record, however, shows that the challenged comment by the trial judge was simply a statement that certain evidence was impeachment evidence made during a ruling on an objection, not a statement that Jordan had been impeached as a witness. Accordingly, the statement was not an improper comment on Jordan\u2019s testimony under Louisiana law. <em>See State v. Vernon, </em>197 La. 867, 2 So.2d 629, 632 (1941). As any objection to the statement would have been futile, Jordan has not shown that his counsel was ineffective for not objecting or that the state court\u2019s denial of this claim was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See Clark v. Collins, </em>19 F.3d 959, 966 (5th Cir.1994); \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">Jordan argues that his counsel was ineffective for not objecting to hearsay testimony. Given the overwhelming evidence against him, Jordan has not shown that there was a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had his counsel objected to the hearsay evidence. <em>See Green v. Johnson, </em>160 F.3d 1029, 1040 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, Jordan has not shown that his counsel was ineffective for not objecting to hearsay testimony or that the state court\u2019s denial of this claim was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See id,.; </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-14\">Jordan asserts that his counsel was ineffective for not informing him of his correct sentence exposure if he went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>trial and not advising him to plead guilty. Relatedly, he argues that his counsel was ineffective for not investigating the case properly and learning that the evidence against him was overwhelming. At the state habeas corpus hearing, however, the prosecutor testified that he informed Jordan of his correct sentence exposure during plea negotiations, and Jordan\u2019s counsel stated that he thought he had properly informed Jordan. Given this testimony, Jordan has not shown that the state court\u2019s denial of this claim was based upon an unreasonable interpretation of the facts. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(2). As we are reluctant to consider the failure of an attorney to advise his client to plead guilty deficient performance, Jordan has not shown that the state court\u2019s denial of this claim was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See United States v. Faubion, </em>19 F.3d 226, 230 (5th Cir.1994); \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
