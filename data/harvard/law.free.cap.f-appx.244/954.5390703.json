They were convicted by a jury. Caballero was sentenced to serve 63 months in prison. Monzon-Gomez, whose base offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines was increased by two levels for obstructing justice (testifying falsely) at trial, was sentenced to serve 78 months in prison, the low end of the applicable Guidelines range of 78 to 97 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-16\">Before trial, Caballero and Monzon-Gomez moved to suppress the marijuana they were charged with possessing. They challenged as an unlawful seizure the traffic stop that gave rise to them arrest, arguing, first, that it was not supported by any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing and, second, that, even if the stop was lawful at its inception, them detention nevertheless became unlawful when the stop was extended for an unreasonable length of time without justification. The district court rejected both arguments and denied their motions to suppress. They appeal that denial, renewing the same arguments they made below. Additionally, Monzon-Gomez appeals his 78-month sentence, arguing that the district court, over his objection, incorrectly applied the two-level sentencing enhancement for obstruction of justice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b977-17\">After a careful review of the briefs and the record, we conclude, first, that the seized marijuana was not subject to exclusion under the Fourth Amendment and, second, that the district court properly applied the two-level sentencing enhancement. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of Caballero and Monzon-Gomez\u2019s motions to suppress and affirm Monzon-Gomez\u2019s 78-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-18\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b977-19\">In reviewing the disposition of a motion to suppress, we \u201creview[ ] the district court\u2019s findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard and the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>application of law to those facts <em>de novo.\u201d United States v.

He began to pursue the car when its driver \u201ctook off on me.\u201d Washington followed the car into an old mining community known as Mulga Mines, which is located outside of Birmingham about nine miles from Interstate. 20 (1-20). Testimony at the suppression hearing established that the \u201ctight windy roads\u201d through Mulga Mines are dangerous and cannot be safely negotiated by speeding drivers. Mulga Mines is accessible by only one road, making it somewhat isolated.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">Having lost sight of the car he was pursuing, Washington tried to locate it by driving down a dirt road, but decided not to do so for fear of getting stuck in the mud. The road was muddy because it had been raining on and off all day long. As he continued his pursuit, sometime between 10:00 a.m. and 11:15 a.m., Washington \u201csaw a big-rig truck backed into another muddy dirt road, which was probably 150 feet back from\u201d the paved road. According to Washington, the tractor-trailer \u201cwas real deep in there\u201d and was obscured by heavy foliage. The road where Washington observed the truck, described at the suppression hearing as a driveway, was largely \u201cunkempt\u201d because the single house to which it led had been abandoned for at least six years. Washington did not \u201csee any activity ... around the truck\u201d and found it \u201cbizarre that someone would back a truck up in that mud and leave it there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">Verbon Latta, another deputy sheriff in the Jefferson County Sheriffs Department, was also on patrol on February 18th. Latta had been patrolling Mulga Mines on a daily basis since 2000, so he knew the area \u201cvery well.\u201d According to Latta, Mulga Mines is \u201cknown as a drug area,\u201d a place where drugs are \u201croutinely sold\u201d and where law enforcement officers \u201croutinely recover stolen items, stolen vehicles.\u201d With regard to the driveway where Washington spotted the tractor-trailer, Latta said that there had been \u201cdozens\u201d of drug arrests in that vicinity for \u201ccrack cocaine, marijuana, and pills.\u201d According to Latta, stolen vehicles are routinely taken to the end of the driveway, stripped for parts, and abandoned. In the six years' since Latta had begun patrolling Mulga Mines, authorities had recovered \u201cover 50\u201d stolen vehicles from that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-10\">Around 12:00 p.m., Latta was dispatched to the driveway in response to a telephone call from a concerned citizen, who had called the sheriffs office to report a \u201csuspicious\u201d \u201c18-wheeler in a driveway.\u201d The caller had asked that someone come \u201ccheck it out.\u201d After he received the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>patch, Latta heard deputy Washington say over the radio that, based on his earlier observation, the truck had been parked in the driveway for more than an hour. And Latta heard fellow deputy sheriff Burton say that the truck had not been there \u201cin the last several days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">As Latta was nearing the driveway, he observed a tractor-trailer traveling toward his patrol car on the paved road \u201cat a pretty good clip.\u201d He estimated its speed at 35 to 40 miles per hour. The speed limit was 25 miles per hour. Latta was concerned about the tractor-trailer\u2019s speed because of the sharp, curvy roads in Mulga Mines. As the tractor-trailer passed by him, Latta observed two men in the cab and noticed that all the tires were covered in mud. Latta turned around and briefly followed the tractor-trailer as he radioed in its description and tag number. Latta then turned on his flashing lights and pulled the truck over at the intersection of Slope Drive and Mulga Loop Road. Latta testified at the suppression hearing that he pulled the tractor-trailer over for speeding. The driver, Monzon-Gomez, exited the cab and immediately approached Latta, seeming to indicate that he was lost. According to Latta, Monzon-Gomez, in broken English, said, \u201cInterstate 20, make a left, make a right, make a left.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Latta warned Monzon-Gomez that \u201che was over the speed limit,\u201d but did not issue him a citation. In an effort to help him find his destination, Latta asked MonzonGomez where he was going. Monzon-Gomez responded, \u201cDole,\u201d which Latta took to mean the corporate produce supplier. Latta asked for Monzon-Gomez\u2019s paperwork to see if it listed an address. Monzon-Gomez handed over some papers, but Latta could not find anything about Dole and did not see any address for a scheduled delivery in Alabama. During this exchange, Latta found it curious that Monzon-Gomez could have become so lost, so far away from 1-20, in an isolated community that happened to have a reputation as a \u201cknown drug area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Deputy Washington joined Latta at the scene less than five minutes after the tractor-trailer was pulled over, while Latta was still examining Monzon-Gomez\u2019s travel papers. When Washington arrived, Latta told him that he had noticed something odd about the back door of the trailer. The trailer was a refrigerated trailer, and Latta knew from firsthand experience that properly equipped refrigerated trailers are supposed to have a seal on the right-hand back door as a safety feature to ensure that the food inside \u201chas not been tampered with in any way\u201d during transport. Such seals, according to Latta, are supposed to be checked at every delivery point. The trailer Monzon-Gomez was hauling had no such seal; instead, the door to the trailer was outfitted with a combination lock. Latta found the presence of a combination lock on a refrigerated trailer suspicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">The deputies asked Monzon-Gomez where he and his friend were coming from, and Monzon-Gomez responded that they were returning to Miami from Texas. Monzon-Gomez told Washington that they had been parked in the driveway for only \u201ca few minutes\u201d and that they had gone there only to turn the trailer around. Washington found these statements suspicious for two reasons: first, because he had seen the very same tractor-trailer parked in the driveway earlier that morning and, second, because, before arriving at the driveway, one would have first driven past a large church parking lot much more suitable for turning around a tractor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>trailer. Monzon-Gomez told Washington that they had exited 1-20 to get something to eat. To Washington, that explanation did not account for why they were in Mulga Mines because the closest place to get something to eat was at the exit \u201cwhere he got off\u2019 1-20, which was nearly nine miles away.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Washington next spoke to Caballero, who said that he and Monzon-Gomez were returning from California, not Texas. Caballero confirmed the story given by Monzon-Gomez that they became lost while looking for somewhere to eat and had driven down the driveway merely to turn the trailer around. When asked what he was carrying in the trailer, Monzon-Gomez immediately walked to the back of the trailer and opened the doors, revealing \u201cboxes of lettuce stacked from the floor to the ceiling.\u201d Washington noticed \u201ca bunch of little blackberries and leaves\u201d in the back of the trailer, berries and leaves of the same variety he had observed growing along the side of the driveway where the tractor-trailer had been parked. Washington and Latta also observed muddy footprints leading into the back of the trailer and noticed that the boxes at the top of the pile were dented and crumpled. At first, MonzonGomez told Washington that he had not been in the back of the trailer at all. But when Washington showed him the muddy footprints, Monzon-Gomez corrected himself, saying that he had entered the trailer because his load of lettuce had shifted and he needed to \u201cstraighten it up.\u201d Deputy Burton, who had since arrived on the scene, noticed muddy footprints on top of the stack of boxes. All these observations led Washington and Latta to disbelieve Caballero and Monzon-Gomez\u2019s story about why they were in the Mulga Mines community.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Based on Caballero\u2019s and Monzon-Gomez\u2019s inconsistent statements and their presence in a known drug area, Washington called his sergeant and requested that a K-9 Unit be brought to the scene. Sergeant Lewis arrived moments later. Before calling in the K-9 Unit to sweep the tractor-trailer, Lewis decided that he and Washington should return to the driveway to have a look around. Deputies Burton and Latta remained behind with Caballero and Monzon-Gomez.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Back at the driveway, Washington immediately spotted a number of lettuce boxes in an adjacent ditch. He also saw some abandoned wooden pallets and some white twine similar to the twine he had seen holding boxes together in the back of the trailer minutes before. The lettuce boxes, which were dry although it had been raining steadily all day, were open at the top and contained yellow, plastic-wrapped bricks of marijuana, which Washington was able to identify based on his law enforcement experience. Washington radioed deputy Burton and told him to arrest Caballero and Monzon-Gomez.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">A short time later, Philip Hill, who handles drug-detection dogs for the Jefferson County Sheriffs Department, arrived at the driveway. Hill\u2019s German Shepherd, Teddy, quickly confirmed the presence of narcotics in the discarded lettuce boxes. Hill then took Teddy to the tractor-trailer, where Teddy immediately alerted on the cab. Marijuana was found in two separate locations inside the cab. In all, 966 pounds of marijuana were found in the ditch beside the driveway, and 72 pounds were found in the cab of the truck. The entire episode \u2014 from the time Latta pulled the tractor-trailer over until the time that the marijuana was found and the arrests were made \u2014 lasted only 30 minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b980-11\">Caballero and Monzon-Gomez first argue that the traffic stop was unlawful at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>its inception because it was not supported by any individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. We disagree. \u201cUnder the Fourth Amendment, a decision to stop an automobile is reasonable where the police have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation occurred, ... and an officer\u2019s motive in making the traffic stop does not invalidate what is otherwise objectively justifiable behavior under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>172 F.3d 775, 778 (11th Cir.1999) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The traffic stop initiated by Latta was reasonable because Latta had probable cause to believe that the tractor-trailer was speeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">It goes without saying that speeding is a traffic violation that may properly justify a traffic stop. Indeed, Monzon-Gomez and Caballero do not dispute this point, <em>see </em>Monzon-Gomez\u2019s Br. at 7 (\u201cpolice officers can constitutionally pull over a vehicle when they have probable cause to believe the car is speeding\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> nor do they argue that Monzon-Gomez was not speeding. Instead, their only argument is that \u201cDeputy Latta lacked probable cause to stop the Appellant for speeding in that the device used to measure the speed of vehicles is <em>not observation, </em>but <em>some type of radar device.\u201d Id. </em>at 7-8 (emphasis added). We disagree. The Fourth Amendment plainly does not prohibit a law enforcement officer from pulling over a motorist for suspected speeding whenever the officer is acting solely on the basis of his visual observation. Stated differently, the Fourth Amendment does not require the use of radar detection to establish probable cause to believe a motorist is speeding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Caballero and Monzon-Gomez have cited no legal authority to support their contrary position and we have found none.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">The district court expressly found in its order denying Caballero and Monzon-Gomez\u2019s motions to suppress that \u201c[njothing in the record disputes the fact that Latta observed the defendants\u2019 speeding vehicle.\u201d This factual finding has not been shown to be clear error, and we accordingly conclude that the traffic stop of the tractor-trailer was lawful under the Fourth Amendment because it was supported by probable cause to believe a traffic law had been violated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b981-12\">Caballero and Monzon-Gomez next argue that, even if lawful at its inception, the traffic stop became unlawful when Washington and Latta, without reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, prolonged its duration beyond the time \u201cnecessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d Monzon-Gomez\u2019s Br. at 9. We conclude, however, that the traffic stop was lawful at all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>times because the deputies on the scene had sufficient reason to believe that Caballero and Monzon-Gomez had engaged in criminal activity, and the 30 minutes it took to confirm the deputies\u2019 suspicion was not unreasonably long.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">\u201c[T]he <em>duration </em>of [a] traffic stop must be limited to the time necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Purcell, </em>236 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2001) (alterations added; emphasis in original). Generally, the durational limit on a traffic stop means that the stop \u201cmay not last any longer than necessary to process the traffic violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). But \u201can officer may prolong a traffic stop\u201d for a reasonable amount of time beyond that which is necessary to process the traffic violation \u201cif he has articulable suspicion of other illegal activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Boyce, </em>351 F.3d 1102, 1106 (11th Cir.2003). And in those circumstances, the lengthened detention may last as long as is reasonably necessary for the officer to \u201cpursue[] a means of investigation likely to\u201d confirm or dispel his suspicions about the criminal activity. <em>United States v. Street, </em>472 F.3d 1298, 1306 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Caballero and Monzon-Gomez argue that they \u201cshould have been permitted to leave\u201d the scene as soon as Latta made the decision not to \u201cissue a citation\u201d for speeding (the reason for the stop) and after Latta did not find \u201canything amiss with Monzon\u2019s driver\u2019s licence [or] paper work.\u201d Caballero\u2019s Br. at 6. Instead, the deputies \u201casked further questions,\u201d which Caballero and Monzon-Gomez say impermissibly lengthened their detention, thus making the stop unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment. We disagree. Because deputies Latta, Washington, and Burton had reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify a brief investigation aimed at determining whether Caballero and Monzon-Gomez had engaged in illegal activity, and because that investigation was not unreasonably long, we conclude that their continued detention was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">As an initial matter, we note that Caballero and Monzon-Gomez were stopped in a \u201cknown ... drug area.\u201d Standing alone, this fact is of course not sufficient to create the reasonable suspicion necessary to justify their continued detention. <em>See Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 124, 120 S.Ct. 673, 676, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000). \u201cBut officers are not required to ignore the relevant characteristics of a location in determining whether the circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is why \u201cthe fact that the stop occurred in a \u2018high crime area\u2019\u201d is \u201camong the relevant contextual considerations\u201d in determining the legality of an investigatory detention. <em>Id. </em>The fact of their presence in a known drug area does not stand alone in this case. Other \u201ccontextual considerations\u201d made the deputies suspicious that criminal activity was afoot.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-11\">When independently asked where they were coming from, Caballero said California, and Monzon-Gomez said Texas. Monzon-Gomez told Latta that he was looking for the Dole produce company, but the ' papers he handed Latta did not show any address for that company and did not list any delivery destination in the State of Alabama. Caballero and Monzon-Gomez told the deputies that they had exited 1-20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>looking for a place to eat and had, in the process, become lost in Mulga Mines. This part of the story did not add up to the deputies, however, because there was a restaurant at the very 1-20 exit where Caballero and Monzon-Gomez left the interstate, yet for reasons never explained they wound up driving approximately nine miles to an isolated community whose narrow, curvy roads were especially inhospitable to tractor-trailers.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">Monzon-Gomez told Washington that they had stopped in the driveway for only \u201ca few minutes\u201d while turning the trailer around. Washington knew, however, that the tractor-trailer had been parked \u201cprobably 150 feet\u201d down the driveway for nearly an hour, because he had seen it there between 10:00 a.m. and 11:15 a.m. and Latta had seen it leaving the driveway shortly after 12:00 p.m. Washington also found suspicious Caballero\u2019s statement that they were using the driveway to turn the trailer around, because, to get to the driveway, they would have had to drive right past a large church parking lot much more suitable to the task.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Latta found it suspicious that there was a combination lock on the door of a refrigerated trailer \u2014 the type of trailer which, as Latta knew from firsthand experience, should have had a seal on the right-hand door to ensure that the produce inside the trailer had not been tampered with. When the deputies asked him what he was hauling, Monzon-Gomez voluntarily opened the back door of the trailer, revealing muddy footprints, a pile of damaged lettuce boxes, and \u201ca bunch of little blackberries and leaves\u201d like the ones Washington had seen growing beside the muddy driveway. Given the presence of muddy footprints and the presence of leaves matching those found by the driveway, it was odd when Monzon-Gomez said that no one had been in the back of the trailer. When Washington showed him the footprints, Monzon-Gomez quickly changed his story, saying that he had climbed in the back of the trailer to \u201cstraighten ... up\u201d his load.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">In light of the fact that their numerous inconsistent statements rendered their story implausible, that their trailer was not properly equipped to be transporting refrigerated produce, and that they had spent nearly an hour (if not longer) in an abandoned driveway in a \u201cknown ... drug area,\u201d we readily conclude that the deputies on the scene had ample reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to briefly detain Caballero and Monzon-Gomez while Washington and Lewis went to the driveway to confirm or dispel their suspicions. Thus the duration of their detention was not unlawfully prolonged under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">Under the Sentencing Guidelines, Monzon-Gomez had a criminal history category of I. His base offense level was 26. After concluding that he obstructed justice by giving perjured testimony at trial, the district court increased Monzon-Gomez\u2019s base offense level by two points, bringing his adjusted offense level to 28. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The Guidelines sentencing range applicable to Monzon-Gomez, following the obstruction-of-justice increase prescribed by \u00a7 3C1.1, was 78 to 97 months. The district court sentenced him to serve 78 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-11\">Section 3C1.1 instructs a district court to \u201cincrease [a defendant\u2019s] offense level by 2 levels\u201d if \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded ... the administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>tion of justice with respect to the ... prosecution ... of the instant offense of conviction\u201d and if \u201cthe obstructive conduct related to [] the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction.\u201d A defendant obstructs or impedes the administration of justice within the meaning of this provision if he \u201ccommit[s] ... perjury\u201d at his trial. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, cmt. n. 4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">For purposes of \u00a7 3C1.1, perjury is defined as \u201cfalse testimony concerning a material matter with the willful intent to provide false testimony, rather than as a result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\u201d <em>United, States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993). Matters considered \u201cmaterial\u201d include \u201cstatements], or information that, if believed, would tend to influence or affect the issue under determination.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">If a defendant objects to the proposed application of \u00a7 3C1.1, \u201ca district court must review the evidence and make independent findings necessary to establish a willful impediment to or obstruction of justice, or an attempt to do the same.\u201d <em>Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. at 95, 113 S.Ct. at 1117. Observing its obligation under <em>Dunnigan, </em>the district court in this case \u201creview[ed] the evidence\u201d and \u201cma[d]e independent findings\u201d with respect to two separate statements<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> made by Monzon-Gomez at trial, concluding that \u201cthose two statements are material, were made under oath, and were necessarily false based upon the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">Monzon-Gomez does not dispute that the statements identified by the district court were made under oath at trial, that they were material, or that they constituted perjury within the definition set forth in Dunnigan,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead, he argues only that \u201c[t]he district court failed to articulate a separate and independent ground to support an enhancement\u201d because the court imposed the enhancement based \u201con the fact that the jury\u2019s verdict was irreconcilable with the Appellant\u2019s testimony.\u201d Monzon-Gomez\u2019s Br. at 14. We disagree. In remarking on the incompatibility of Monzon-Gomez\u2019s trial testimony and the jury\u2019s verdict, the district court was making a simple credibility determination \u2014 that Monzon-Gomez testified untruthfully \u2014 that we are bound to respect. <em>See Gregg, </em>179 F.3d at 1316. This adverse credibility determination was sufficient \u201cto establish ... [an] obstruction of justice.\u201d <em>Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. at 95, 113 S.Ct. at 1117. The district court\u2019s determination that Monzon-Gomez intentionally perjured himself at trial is amply supported by the record, and we therefore affirm its application of the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">For the reasons stated above, we affirm the denial of Caballero and Monzon-Gomez\u2019s motions to suppress and affirm Monzon-Gomez\u2019s 78-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-13\">.

Monzon-Gomez\u2019s assertion that \"some type of radar device\u201d is necessary to justify a traffic stop for speeding is misplaced. It may well be true that visual observation alone, unaccompanied by evidence of speeding generated by a properly tested \"speed measuring device,\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 32-5A-177, would be insufficient as an evidentiary matter to successfully prosecute a speeding violation in court under Alabama law. <em>Id. </em>But evidentiary burdens are not implicated where Fourth Amendment probable cause is concerned. With regard to traffic stops under the Fourth Amendment, the question is simply whether a law enforcement officer has sufficient cause to believe that a traffic law has been violated, not whether such a violation can be successfully prosecuted in court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b981-14\">. The fact that Latta did not issue a speeding citation, a point emphasized by both Caballero and Monzon-Gomez, is irrelevant to the probable-cause inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b982-6\">. Caballero and Monzon-Gomez challenge only the \"duration\" of their detention and not its \u201cscope.\u201d <em>See Purcell, </em>236 F.3d at 1277 (differentiating between challenges to the duration of a traffic stop and challenges to the scope of such a stop).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b984-6\">. At the sentencing hearing, the district court identified the statements as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b984-7\">The first [statement] is that he [MonzonGomez] was traveling through Birmingham, not because of a drug drop, but because it was a more efficient route known based on construction and other road conditions and highway conditions. And the second was his claim under oath that he had nothing to do with the drugs that were dropped.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b984-14\">. Monzon-Gomez does not argue that his testimony at trial was the result of \"confusion, mistake, or faulty memory.\" <em>Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. at 94, 113 S.Ct. at 1116.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
