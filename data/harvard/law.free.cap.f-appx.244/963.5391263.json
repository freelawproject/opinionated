Weatherspoon appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Baptist Hospital (\u201cthe Hospital\u201d) in this employment discrimination action brought pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a). After review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b985-28\">Weatherspoon, who is black, worked for the Hospital as a medical technologist. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>March 2005, Weatherspoon was terminated after his supervisor smelled alcohol on his breath and a test revealed that Weatherspoon had a blood-alcohol level over the .08 limit set by the Hospital\u2019s drug and alcohol policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">In a circumstantial evidence case such as Weatherspoon\u2019s, the plaintiff has the initial burden on summary judgment to present evidence that: \u201c(1) [he] is a member of a protected class; (2) [he] was subjected to an adverse employment action; (3) [his] employer treated similarly situated employees outside of [his] protected class more favorably than [he] was treated; and (4) [he] was qualified to do the job.\u201d <em>Burke-Fowler v. Orange County, </em>447 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2006). The district court granted summary judgment after concluding that Weatherspoon failed to establish the third prong of his prima facie case, that is, he failed to present evidence that the Hospital had treated similarly situated employees who were not black more favorably.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">Our <em>de novo </em>review of the record confirms the district court\u2019s conclusion. Weatherspoon presented no evidence of other employees who violated the drug and alcohol policy and were not fired. Furthermore, the Hospital presented evidence that it had fired other hospital employees for violating the drug and alcohol policy, including one white employee who, like Weatherspoon, was fired following a positive blood alcohol test conducted at the hospital. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">Weatherspoon also claims that the Hospital violated unspecified federal laws and the Florida Drug-Free Workplace Act in its handling of his blood test results. We decline to address these issues, which were not raised in the district court. <em>Narey v. Dean, </em>32 F.3d 1521, 1526 (11th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b985-18\">. We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Brooks v. County Comm\u2019n of Jefferson County, Ala., </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1162 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b986-7\">. The district court alternatively concluded that Weatherspoon failed to show that the Hospital\u2019s legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating him \u2014 Weatherspoon's violation of the drug and alcohol policy \u2014 was pretext. Because we conclude that Weather-spoon failed to establish his prima facie case, we need not address this alternative ground for granting summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
