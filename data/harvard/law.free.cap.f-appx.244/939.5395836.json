On appeal Starosta contends that the district court erred in dismissing her claim, arguing that the court incorrectly determined that the use of the abbreviation \u201cP.A.\u201d in the name \u201cLaw Office of David Borack, P.A.,\u201d was not a false, deceptive, or misleading representation under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e. According to Starosta, the abbreviation gives the false impression that Borack\u2019s law office is registered as a professional corporation in Florida. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-14\">In 1998 Starosta received an unsolicited Wachovia Visa credit card in the mail. She used the credit card, but did not pay her bill. In 2003 NCOP, a debt purchasing company, acquired the rights to Starosta\u2019s delinquent account. Acting through its business affiliate, NCO Financial Systems, Inc., NCOP attempted to collect the balance on Starosta\u2019s delinquent account and advised Starosta that her debt was being considered for referral to a debt collector. In July 2004, NCOP brought an arbitration claim against Starosta and obtained a $3,016 award. Starosta did not pay the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-15\">In January 2005 NCOP hired the Law Office of David Borack, P.A., to file a claim against Starosta to enforce the arbitration award. Soon thereafter Starosta reached a settlement with NCOP, agreeing to pay $1,351.56 to satisfy her debt. Starosta did not pay that amount either. As a result NCOP instructed Borack\u2019s law office to file an enforcement action in Florida state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-16\">On August 26, 2005, Starosta initiated this lawsuit, alleging violations of the FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692-92p, and the Florida Consumer Collection Practices Act, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 559.55 <em>et seq</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>\n</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The defendants filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, alleging that Starosta had failed to state a claim. On August 18, 2006, the court granted the motion without prejudice, which allowed Starosta to file an amended complaint. She did so, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>defendants again moved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. The court granted that motion, but this time it dismissed Starosta\u2019s complaint with prejudice. She then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to grant a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), \u201caccepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Manuel v. Convergys Corp., </em>430 F.3d 1132, 1139 (11th Cir.2005). Section 1692e of 15 U.S.C. provides that \u201c[a] debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation in connection with the collection of any debt.\u201d That section is divided into sixteen subsections, which provide a non-exhaustive list of prohibited debt collection practices. Starosta\u2019s main contention is that the Borack\u2019s law office violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(10), (14). Section 1692e(10) prohibits \u201c[t]he use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer.\u201d Likewise, \u00a7 1692e(14) prohibits \u201c[t]he use of any business, company, or organization name other than the true name of the debt collector\u2019s business, company, or organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">Starosta\u2019s appeal centers on the letters \u201cP.A.\u201d in the name of defendant Borack\u2019s law office, the \u201cLaw Office of David Borack, P.A.\u201d According to Starosta, only entities that are registered as professional service corporations under Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 621.03-12 are permitted to use the abbreviation \u201cP.A.\u201d in connection with their name. Since Borack\u2019s office is not organized as a professional service corporation, Starosta argues that the use of that abbreviation not only violates Florida\u2019s fictitious name registration statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 865.09(14), and Rule 4-7.10 of the Florida Rules of Professional Conduct, but she also contends that using the abbreviation violates 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(10), (14). Starosta likewise argues that NCOP is vicariously liable for Borack\u2019s violation, because Borack was NCOP\u2019s agent in the debt collection action.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-9\">Initially, we note that the relevant portion of Florida\u2019s fictitious names statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 865.09(14), prohibits the use of the words \u201ccorporation\u201d or \u201cincorporated\u201d or the abbreviations \u201cCorp.\u201d or \u201cInc.\u201d unless \u201cthe business for which the name is registered is incorporated or has obtained a certificate of authority to transact business in this state pursuant to chapter 607 or chapter 617.\u201d It says nothing about the use of the abbreviation \u201cP.A.\u201d Similarly, except for a few exceptions not relevant to this case, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 621.12 requires any professional service entity that either incorporates or organizes itself as a limited liability company in Florida to include the phrase \u201cprofessional association\u201d or the abbreviation \u201cPA.\u201d in its name. The statute does not address the use of the abbreviation \u201cP.A.\u201d by an entity other than an L.L.C. or a corporation. As for Rule 4-7.10 of the Florida Rules of Professional Conduct, it allows a law firm to use a trade or fictitious name so long as that name does not deceive or mislead.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-10\">In any event, the issue in this appeal is not whether Borack is in compliance with Florida state law, the issue is whether Borack\u2019s law office made a false or misleading communication in violation of the FDCPA. And there is nothing in the record indicating that it did. The name of Borack\u2019s law office, the \u201cLaw Office of David E. Borack, P.A.\u201d is the name by which Borack holds himself out to the public, and it is also the name by which the firm has been registered with the state of Florida since 2001, in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>Florida\u2019s fictitious names registration statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 865.09. Furthermore, it is the name that has appeared on the firm\u2019s letterhead and other correspondence with Starosta\u2019s attorney. Most importantly, there is no indication that the letters \u201cP.A.\u201d misled, confused, or deceived Starosta or her attorney. <em>See Lewis v. ACB Bus. Servs., Inc., </em>135 F.3d 389, 400-01 (6th Cir.1998) (concluding that debt collector\u2019s use of a synonym did not violate \u00a7 1692e(10) because such conduct did not \u201cmisrepresent the amount of a debt, the consequences of its non-payment, nor the rights of the contacted debtor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b962-10\">. MBNA America was originally named as a defendant, but Starosta voluntarily dismissed MBNA. Wachovia was not named as a defendant in Starosta\u2019s second amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b962-17\">. Because it dismissed Starosta's federal claim, the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
