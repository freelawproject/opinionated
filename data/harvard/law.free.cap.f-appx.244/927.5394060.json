Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we will review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We review factual determinations \u2014 including the determination that an alien is unentitled to asylum\u2014 under the substantial evidence test. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1230; <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1323 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cUnder this highly defer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>ential test, we affirm the IJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir. 2005) (internal quotation and alteration omitted). \u201cTo reverse the IJ\u2019s fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">An alien may obtain asylum if he is a \u201crefugee\u201d: a person unable or unwilling to return to his country of nationality, and who is unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country, \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of\u2019 a protected ground, including political opinion and membership in a particular social group. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); 1158(a)(1), (b)(1). The asylum applicant bears the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status with specific and credible evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Rodriguez argues that he has established past persecution based on a protected ground because he was threatened repeatedly by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (\u201cFARC\u201d) in person and over the telephone and, on one occasion, was detained by the FARC for two hours. Rodriguez contends that the FARC threatened him because he supported the Liberal Party as well as Colombia\u2019s fish hatchery industry, which provided opportunities for peasants and reduced their interest in joining the FARC. On the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s conclusion that Rodriguez failed to show that he was unable to avail himself of the protection of his country, Rodriguez contends that he attempted to file a police report but was unsuccessful in receiving police assistance because he could not name the persons who had threatened or detained him.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the determination that Rodriguez did not meet his burden of showing that he was a refugee. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). Although Rodriguez testified that he approached the police one time after being threatened by the FARC, he never identified the perpetrators to the police, even after Rodriguez saw and recognized one of the perpetrators on a second occasion. Rodriguez asserts that he was unable to give the police the names of his perpetrators; but he has not shown\u2014 nor even asserted \u2014 that he attempted to provide Colombian authorities with other information that could be used to identify the perpetrators. Rodriguez has not demonstrated that the police were unwilling to assist him. Therefore, the record does not compel the conclusion that Rodriguez was a refugee on the basis of past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">Substantial evidence also supports the determination that Rodriguez did not have an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution. After Rodriguez came to the United States in January 2001, he voluntarily returned to Colombia just two months later to continue supporting fish hatchery projects there. He applied for asylum after arriving in the United States for the second time in May 2001. And, as the BIA discussed, the record does not show that the FARC would continue to pursue Rodriguez many years after the group last threatened him. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 (\u201cAlthough the evidence shows Sepulveda exercised leadership in the nonviolence movement while a university student, ... the evidence does not indicate her notoriety as an activist would outlast her four-year absence from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>Colombia.\u201d). Rodriguez has failed to establish that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution in Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Therefore, the evidence does not compel us to conclude that Rodriguez is eligible for asylum; and we deny the petition for review on this claim. Because Rodriguez has not satisfied the less stringent standard for asylum, we also deny his petition for review of his claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Zheng v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1292 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Rodriguez next argues \u2014 for the first time \u2014 that the IJ violated his due process right to a full and fair hearing because the IJ\u2019s statements at the asylum hearing indicated that she was biased against Rodriguez and did not fully analyze his claims. Because Rodriguez failed to present his due process claim to the BIA, and therefore failed to exhaust his administrative remedies on this claim, we lack jurisdiction to consider it. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining that an alien\u2019s \u201callegation of a due process violation \u2014 that he was denied a full and fair hearing before a neutral factfinder \u2014 is precisely the kind of procedural error which requires exhaustion\u201d). Therefore, we dismiss this part of the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b950-11\">. Rodriguez included his wife and children as derivatives in his asylum application. We refer only to Rodriguez in this opinion; but our decision about Rodriguez also applies to his wife and children.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b950-19\">. On appeal, Rodriguez does not offer argument on the denial of CAT relief; therefore, this claim is abandoned. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining that petitioner abandons issue by failing to offer argument on that issue).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b951-8\">. We have noted that \"only in a rare case does the record compel the conclusion that an applicant for asylum suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d <em>Silva v.
