The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AED-PA), Pub.L. No. 104-32, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), governs this appeal because Crawford filed his \u00a7 2254 petition after the effective date of the AEDPA. On Crawford\u2019s motion, we granted the following certificate of appealability (COA): whether Crawford received ineffective assistance of trial counsel as a result of his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the fact that Crawford was forced to appear before the jury in prison-issued clothing. On appeal, Crawford raises two arguments: (1) a substantive claim that the state trial court unconstitutionally forced him to- appear before the jury in prison-issued clothing; and (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to preserve for direct appeal the issue of his appearance in prison-issued clothing. We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition because, as discussed more fully below, we conclude that his arguments are outside the scope of the COA and that he abandoned the sole issue presented in the COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Crawford, a state prisoner who is serving four consecutive life sentences for first-degree robbery and first-degree assault, filed a \u00a7 2254 petition in the district court, alleging, among other things, that he received ineffective assistance of counsel based upon his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the fact that he had to appear before the jury in prison-issued clothing. Specifically, Crawford claimed that he was forced to wear a shirt that was branded with the mark \u201cJefferson County Jail,\u201d as well as prison-issued shower shoes, an identification armband, pants that were too large, and a jacket that was three sizes too small. Crawford admitted that his counsel objected to his appearance off-the-record and prior to trial, by requesting that Crawford be permitted to change his clothing, but the trial court denied the request. In its answer, the state phrased Crawford\u2019s prison-issued clothing claim as follows: \u201cineffective assistance of trial counsel for allowing Crawford to appear in court in jail attire.\u201d The state conceded that this claim had been exhausted in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The state also submitted documents from Crawford\u2019s state court proceedings, setting forth the following history. On direct appeal, Crawford raised various issues concerning his trial, but he failed to raise the issue of his appearance before the jury in prison-issued clothing. The Alabama appellate court affirmed Crawford\u2019s convictions. Crawford next filed a post-conviction petition for relief from his convictions or sentence, pursuant to Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure 32. In his Rule 32 petition, Crawford claimed, <em>inter alia, </em>that his counsel was ineffective because he was forced to appear before the jury in prison-issued clothing. He alleged that he was prejudiced by having to appear in the prison-issued clothing because it undermined his credibility and his defense that he was a \u201cwell respected, self employed business person.\u201d The state court summarily dismissed Crawford\u2019s Rule 32 petition. Crawford appealed the state court\u2019s denial of his Rule 32 petition to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals. In his brief before that court, he claimed that the state court erroneously denied his motion for an evidentiary hearing and erred in summarily denying his petition without further fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals denied Crawford\u2019s appeal. In its decision, the court first identified the claims that Crawford raised in his Rule 32 petition, splitting Crawford\u2019s claims into two groups: (1) substantive claims, in which the court included Crawford\u2019s claim \u201cthat he was forced to stand trial in prison clothing;\u201d and (2) ineffeetive-assistance-of-trialcounsel claims, in which the court did <em>not </em>include any claim regarding Crawford\u2019s clothing at trial. As to the \u201csubstantive\u201d claims, the court noted that all of them, with the exception of two claims that are not relevant to the instant appeal, were precluded because Crawford failed to raise them on direct appeal. As to Crawford\u2019s ineffeetive-assistance-of-counsel claims, the court found that \u201cassuming, without deciding, that Crawford\u2019s allegations constituted deficient conduct on the part of trial ... counsel, Crawford did not in any instance allege with any specificity how he was prejudiced by this allegedly deficient conduct.\u201d In so finding, the court cited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>Strickland, v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The magistrate judge recommended denying Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation over Crawford\u2019s objections and denied Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition. We thereafter granted Crawford a COA on the following issue only: whether Crawford received ineffective assistance of trial counsel as a result of his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the fact that he was forced to appear before the jury in prison-issued clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">We review a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition <em>de novo, </em>while the court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>See Sims v. Singletary, </em>155 F.3d 1297, 1304 (11th Cir.1998). Mixed questions of law and fact, including ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, are reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">(A) Scope of the COA</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Crawford\u2019s appeal is governed by the COA requirements of the AEDPA. Under the AEDPA, appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(3); <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir. 1998). In his <em>pro se </em>brief, Crawford raises two distinct issues on appeal: (1) a substantive claim that the trial court erroneously forced him to appear before the jury in prison-issued clothing; and (2) his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object at trial to his appearance in prison clothing in order to preserve the issue for direct appeal. As to the substantive claim, that claim centers on a decision of the trial court, as opposed to the actions of counsel. Therefore, we will not address that claim, as it is outside the scope of the COA. <em>See Murray, </em>145 F.3d at 1250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">With regard to the failure-to-preserve claim, we similarly must determine whether that claim is within the scope of the COA. We have drawn a distinction between the following claims: (1) a claim that, while efficacious in raising an issue, i.e., objecting to the alleged error, counsel nonetheless was ineffective for failing to preserve the issue for appeal; and (2) a claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to an alleged error at trial. <em>See Davis v. Secretary for Dept. of Corrections, </em>341 F.3d 1310, 1316 (11th Cir.2003). In the former case, with respect to <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong, we ask \u201cwhether there is a reasonable likelihood of a more favorable outcome on appeal had the claim been preserved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast, in the latter case, with respect to <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice prong, we ask whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Purvis v. Crosby, </em>451 F.3d 734, 741 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 587, 166 L.Ed.2d 436 (2006). Recently, we reaffirmed the distinction between the above-listed claims and, in doing so, explicitly stated that <em>Davis </em>\u201cwas a case involving \u2018peculiar circumstances\u2019 where the only effect of trial counsel\u2019s error was on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">Here, in his briefs to this Court, Crawford admits that counsel objected to his clothing in the state trial court, and instead asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing to preserve the issue for appeal, explicitly relying on <em>Davis </em>and its failure-to-preserve language. However, the COA only asks whether Crawford\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Crawford\u2019s appearance. It does not ask whether Crawford\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to preserve the prison clothing issue for appeal. In light of <em>Davis </em>and <em>Purvis, </em>which establish that Crawford\u2019s failure-to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>preserve claim differs from the failure-toobjeet claim, the COA does not include the failure-to-preserve claim. Thus, we conclude that Crawford\u2019s failure-to-preserve claim falls outside the scope of the COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">(B) Abandonment</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Upon concluding that we will not address either of Crawford\u2019s two main arguments on appeal, the lingering question is what argument, if any, Crawford submits with regard to the issue as presented in the COA. After a liberal reading of Crawford\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief, it is not clear that Crawford makes any argument with regard to the COA issue. In fact, Crawford never asserts that his counsel was ineffective for failing to object to his appearance, thereby subjecting him to prejudicial judgment in the eyes of the jury. Rather, Crawford concedes that counsel made a \u201cgeneral objection\u201d and requested that he be allowed to change his clothing, which the trial court denied. As such, Crawford has abandoned the only issue properly before us. <em>See Atkins v. Singletary, </em>965 F.2d 952, 955 n. 1 (11th Cir.1992) (concluding that an appellant abandons an issue not raised on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">In sum, the scope of the COA does not include Crawford\u2019s sole arguments on appeal. Furthermore, Crawford has raised no argument as to the COA issue and, therefore, he has abandoned the only issue properly before us. Thus, the district court\u2019s denial of Crawford\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition is</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
