He appeals, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conviction. He also argues that the district court erred in providing the jury with corroborative transcripts of his recorded conversations, without proper safeguards, and that this error caused him prejudice. Upon review, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Facey\u2019s conviction arises out of a conspiracy to import approximately 600 pounds of marijuana from Jamaica to the United States. In January 2004 the DEA was informed by Rohan (\u201cRon\u201d) Gordon, a paid confidential informant operating in Jamaica, that two Jamaican smugglers, Patrick Thompson and Denton Hall, were attempting to smuggle a large amount of marijuana into the United States by boat. The DEA instructed Gordon to move forward with the operation, and to act as the facilitator between the Jamaican smugglers and the recipients of the marijuana here in the United States. Gordon was instructed to provide a boat and a boat captain to the smugglers. He was also authorized by the DEA to travel to the United States, in order to liaise with the recipient members of the trafficking operation who were based in south Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Upon arriving in the United States, the DEA provided Gordon with a recording device, and he was instructed to record all of his telephone conversations with the putative traffickers in south Florida. The Jamaican smugglers had given Gordon phone numbers for two contacts in Florida. One of these contacts was Lawton \u201cSturdy\u201d Blackwood, who phoned Gordon from a Tampa area code and asked about the marijuana being smuggled in from Jamaica. Gordon subsequently arranged to meet Blackwood at the Coral Square shopping mall in Coral Springs, Florida, on 3 May 2004. The 3 May meeting was recorded, via a hidden recording device on Gordon\u2019s person, and was also videotaped via a surveillance platform that the DEA had assembled at the mall. Both the audio and the video recordings of the meeting were later submitted into evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">In the meeting, Gordon arrived at the Coral Springs Mall in a \u25a0 minivan, and Blackwood arrived in a BMW, with the appellant, Facey, seated in the passenger seat. Upon arrival, Blackwood exited the BMW and conversed with Gordon inside the minivan for approximately twenty minutes, while Facey remained seated in the BMW. The recording of the meeting, which was subsequently transcribed, demonstrates that Gordon and Blackwood discussed the marijuana that Gordon was seeking to smuggle into Florida. Black-wood stated that he had been advised by his Jamaican contacts that Gordon had some \u201ccheese,\u201d and that the Jamaicans had asked Blackwood whether he could take it. R 1-106, Exh. 1 at 7.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Gordon asked Black-wood \u201cwhat kind of market\u201d he had for such a product and Blackwood advised that the market was very good. <em>Id. </em>at 7. Blackwood inquired whether Gordon\u2019s product was \u201chigh grade,\u201d and Gordon stated that it was. <em>Id. </em>at 14. Blackwood stated that he was not prepared to \u201cdo anything today,\u201d but that he just wanted to \u201csee\u201d Gordon, to \u201ctalk to [him],\u201d and to \u201clet [him] meet [Blackwood\u2019s] driver,\u201d Fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>cey.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 15. He advised that Facey was a \u201cgood friend,\u201d and indicated that when Gordon was ready to move forward with the transaction Blackwood could instruct Facey to contact him and he would \u201cknow what to do.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15-16. Black-wood also asked Gordon how soon he could have the product, because he \u201cneed[ed] to move it by next weekend.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Approximately 21 minutes into the meeting, Facey entered the minivan and joined Gordon and Blackwood in conversation. After a short introduction, the conversation shifted to the marijuana. Blackwood said \u201c[i]f you give me a container load or truck load then I\u2019ll be responsible for that,\u201d and Facey stated: \u201cI will take the green [unintelligible].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. Black-wood then reiterated the purpose of the introduction: \u201cI brought this man here. So when ... [m]e send him down here ... [y]ou know exactly who you are going to see.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35-36. Blackwood stated to Gordon that Facey was flexible, because he was in the area. Facey asked Gordon, \u201c[w]hat gonna happen when [lengthy untelligible]?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39-40. After Black-wood suggested that he would await Gordon\u2019s getting back in touch with them, Facey exited the van and left the meeting, while Gordon and Blackwood remained in the van for further conversation. <em>Id. </em>at 40-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Subsequent to this meeting, Blackwood provided Gordon with the fuel money for the boat trip. On 18 June 2004, Gordon transported by boat approximately 668 pounds of marijuana from Jamaica to the United States. After doing so, Gordon placed a phone call to Facey on 8 July 2004; this conversation was also recorded and admitted into evidence. In that conversation Gordon indicated that he had the \u201cfish\u201d and that he was going to \u201cfix it up nice\u201d prior to giving it to Facey. R 1-106, F,xh. 2 at 2. Gordon indicated that the item was going to be \u201cseparate[d]\u201d into \u201cbig white sugar bags,\u201d and that he was planning on getting it out the next day. <em>Id. </em>In response, Facey stated: \u201cOkay. I\u2019m definitely [going to] have to make preparations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>They agreed to communicate the following day, and Facey stated, \u201c[j]ust give me time to go get the proper things, the accommodations^] and then get back in touch with you.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">The next day, the two again spoke by phone, and Facey indicated that he was awaiting word on \u201cwhat kind of big van to get.\u201d Rl, Doc. 130, Gov. Exh. 13B at 2. Facey stated that he also wanted to ascertain from Gordon \u201cwhat time frame [he was] looking for,\u201d and Gordon indicated that he would call Tampa to find out. <em>Id. </em>After this conversation, Facey rented a cargo van under the name of Robert Scarlette. The van was delivered to Gordon.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">On 13 July 2004, Gordon, with the assistance of DEA Officer Parry and other DEA agents, loaded the van with marijuana and drove it to an undercover warehouse. Gordon arranged to meet Facey across the street. Once Gordon arrived, Gordon and Facey walked across the street to the warehouse. Facey observed the marijuana in the van, and was apparently upset at the way that marijuana had been packaged; Facey stated, \u201c[i]t can\u2019t work like this now.\u201d R5 at 38. Gordon had been instructed by the DEA to tell Facey that the van keys were on a shelf in the warehouse. When Facey went to look for the keys, he was arrested. After being read his Miranda<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> rights, Facey waived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>his rights and stated to DEA Officer Parry that he had been planning on transporting a van load of marijuana. Subsequently, however, Facey modified that statement and indicated that he had only been planning on picking up and transporting a load offish. R4 at 78-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">After his arrest, Facey was charged with one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1)(B) and 846, and one count of attempted possession with intent to distribute 100 or more kilograms of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1)(B) and 846. A jury trial was held in February 2006. The jury convicted Facey of the drug conspiracy count, but acquitted him of the attempted possession count. Facey then moved, pursuant to Rule 29(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, for a judgment of acquittal on the drug conspiracy charge, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction on that count. The district court denied his motion, and Facey was sentenced to 75 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">On appeal, Facey makes two arguments. First, he contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction on the drug conspiracy count, and that, therefore, the district court erred in denying his Rule 29 motion for acquittal. Second, he argues that the transcripts of the recorded conversations that took place during the course of this smuggling operation should not have been provided to the jury without additional safeguards, and that the court\u2019s doing so caused him prejudice. We address each of these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">A. <em>Facey's Motion For Judgment of Acquittal/Sufficiency of The Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">\u201cWe review the denial of a defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Perez-Tosta, </em>36 F.3d 1552, 1556 (11th Cir.1994) (citations omitted). In considering the sufficiency of the evidence, we view all of the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the government, with all inferences and credibility choices drawn in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>United States v. LeCroy, </em>441 F.3d 914, 924 (11th Cir.2006). We \u201ccannot reverse a conviction for insufficiency of the evidence unless ... we conclude that no reasonable jury could find proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>913 F.2d 1552, 1557 (11th Cir.1990) (citation omitted). We keep in mind that \u201c[i]t is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except guilt, provided that a reasonable trier of fact could find that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>20 F.3d 445, 452 (11th Cir.1994) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">A conspiracy is \u201can agreement to commit an unlawful act.\u201d <em>United States v. Toler, </em>144 F.3d 1423, 1425 (11th Cir.1998) (citation and internal quotations omitted). In order to support a conviction for a drug conspiracy pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that an illegal agreement existed to possess with the intent to distribute illegal drugs; (2) that the defendant knew of the agreement; and (3) that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily joined in, or participated in, the agreement. <em>United States v. Charles, </em>313 F.3d 1278, 1284 (11th Cir.2002) <em>(per curiam). </em>Once the drug conspiracy has been shown to exist, \u201ca defendant can be convicted even if his or her participation in the scheme is \u2018slight\u2019 by comparison to the actions of other co-conspirators.\u201d <em>Toler, </em>144 F.3d at 1428. We have stated, however, that mere presence at the scene of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>crime will not support a drug conspiracy conviction; the government must establish, by direct or circumstantial evidence, the defendant\u2019s \u201cknowing participation\u201d in the conspiracy. <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>911 F.2d 623, 627-28 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In this case, it is undisputed that a conspiracy existed to import approximately 648 pounds of marijuana from Jamaica. Rathei\u2019, Facey\u2019s appeal hinges on the latter requirements of a conspiracy charge, that is, his \u201cknowing participation\u201d in the conspiracy. <em>See id. </em>First, Facey contends that his presence at the 3 May 2004 meeting between Blackwood and Gordon\u2014 in which the trafficking operation was discussed at length \u2014 was not enough to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he \u201cknowingly participated\u201d in the drug conspiracy, because he said very little during the meeting and was not present for a large portion of the discussion. Moreover, Facey contends that none of the subsequent phone calls between Gordon and Facey demonstrate his awareness of, or his knowing participation in, the drug conspiracy. Facey maintains that he was wholly unaware of the contents of the van when he coordinated the meeting with Gordon on 13 July, and that he thought he was transporting fish in the rented cargo van. Accordingly, Facey contends that his Rule 29 motion for acquittal should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">We disagree. First, with respect to the 3 May meeting at the shopping mall, evidence was presented that tended to establish Facey\u2019s knowing participation in the marijuana smuggling operation. Although Facey was not present for the entirety of the conversation in the minivan, Black-wood made clear at the outset that one of the purposes of the meeting was to \u201clet you meet my driver,\u201d that is, Facey, so that when Gordon was ready to move forward with the transaction Blackwood could instruct Facey to contact Gordon and Facey would \u201cknow what to do.\u201d Rl-106, Exh. 1 at 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">After Facey entered the minivan, the three further discussed the marijuana that was being brought in from Jamaica, referring to it as \u201cReggae Boy,\u201d which Gordon\u2019s subsequent testimony established was a slang term for marijuana. Blackwood stated \u2014 in Facey\u2019s presence \u2014 that if Gordon gave him \u201ca container load or truck load then [Blackwood would] be responsible for that,\u201d to which Facey interjected: \u201cI will take the green [unintelligible].\u201d Rl-106, Exh. 1 at 29. Blackwood also reiterated the purpose of the introduction, stating that he had brought Facey to meet Gordon so that when the time came to move the marijuana, Gordon would \u201cknow exactly who you are going to see.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 35-36. Before leaving the meeting, Facey asked Gordon what was going to happen, and when. This evidence suggests that Facey knowingly participated in the drug operation. Although he was reticent at times during the discussion, Facey\u2019s statements at the meeting suggest that he knew the purpose of the 3 May meeting, and that he was willing to take steps to effectuate its purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Moreover, the evidence of the subsequent phone conversations between Gordon and Facey established that Facey discussed how best to transport Gordon\u2019s contraband (after Gordon proposed separating it into large sugar bags). Facey also agreed to make arrangements to secure a van of the appropriate size for Gordon. Finally, Gordon and DEA Officer Parry both testified \u2014 and the video surveillance tapes confirmed \u2014 that at the July 13 rendezvous, when the marijuana \u2014 laden van was ready, Facey arrived at the scheduled time and place, viewed the marijuana in the van, rearranged it to his satisfaction, and was preparing to retrieve the key <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>to the van when he was arrested. This evidence certainly could have led a reasonable jury to find that Facey knowingly participated in the plan to possess and distribute marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">On appeal Facey attempts to analogize his case to our line of \u201cinnocent bystander\u201d or \u201cmere presence\u201d cases. In some of those cases, we have reversed drug conspiracy convictions because the evidence failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt either that the defendant knew that drugs were involved in a particular transaction, see <em>Charles, </em>313 F.3d at 1284-85; <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>763 F.2d 1215, 1219 (11th Cir.1985), or that the defendant took any steps to participate in or to further the drug conspiracy. <em>See Toler, </em>144 F.3d at 1433-34. We find, however, that Facets case is closer to <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>53 F.3d 1198 (11th Cir.1995). In <em>Lyons, </em>the defendant was present at an initial meeting in which an undercover agent discussed purchasing crack cocaine from a co-conspirator; the record reflected that the defendant \u201cwas well aware of the nature of the transaction taking place,\u201d and the co-conspirator made no effort to conceal the nature of the exchange from her. <em>Id. </em>at 1200. Subsequent to that meeting, the defendant in <em>Lyons </em>had traveled to the crack house with her co-conspirator to procure the crack cocaine, and had been present when the crack cocaine was sold to the agent on two separate occasions. <em>Id. </em>at 1200-01. The defendant argued that she had merely been present; that she had not negotiated about the drug prices with the agent; and that she had \u201ccontributed nothing to ... [the] criminal venture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1201.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We disagreed, and affirmed her conviction. First, we noted that while the defendant had been present, and that \u201cmere presence\u201d was not enough, presence at drug trafficking transactions \u201craise[d] a permissible inference of participation in the drug conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1201; <em>accord United States v. McDowell, </em>250 F.3d 1354, 1365 (11th Cir.2001) (stating that \u201cpresence [ ] is a probative factor which the jury may consider in determining whether a defendant was a knowing and intentional participant in a criminal scheme\u201d). Second, we noted that the defendant had been <em>repeatedly </em>present at these crack-dealing transactions, and that the co-conspirator had made no effort to hide the drugs from her, or to hide the fact that she was dealing them. Thus, we stated that it \u201cstrainfed] credulity\u201d that the defendant was nothing more than a hapless bystander observing these transactions. <em>Lyons </em>at 1203. In light of these facts, we stated that a jury could have inferred \u201cnot only [that she] knew she was present at a drug deal, but that she intended to contribute to the conspiratorial objective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1202; <em>see also United States v. Cruz-Valdez, </em>773 F.2d 1541, 1546 (11th Cir.1985) <em>(en banc) </em>(\u201cA jury may find knowledgeable, voluntary participation from presence when the presence is such that it would be unreasonable for anyone other than a knowledgeable participant to be present.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Similarly, here we find that Facey\u2019s reliance on the \u201cmere presence\u201d cases is misplaced. As in <em>Lyons, </em>Facey was not just present at the 3 May meeting between Blackwood and Gordon, but was \u201cpresen[t] under a particular set of circumstances,\u201d that is, a lengthy discussion about purchasing Gordon\u2019s marijuana shipment. See <em>Lyons, </em>53 F.3d at 1201 (quoting <em>Cruz-Valdez, </em>773 F.2d at 1546). In addition, as in <em>Lyons, </em>Facey was <em>repeatedly </em>present as the conspiracy moved forward-coordinating with Gordon not just at the 3 May meeting but also in subsequent phone calls and at the 13 July rendezvous. And Facey\u2019s coconspirators made no effort to hide the nature of the transaction from him; in fact, they entrusted him with the responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>bility of driving a van that had been loaded with 600 pounds of marijuana. <em>See, e.g., Cruz-Valdez, </em>773 F.2d at 1547 (noting that it is unlikely that \u201cin the course of transporting or distributing millions of dollars of readily marketable marijuana\u201d a smuggler would use \u201cunaffiliated bystanders\u201d). Under <em>Uyons, </em>the evidence adduced at Facey\u2019s trial was sufficient to support his conviction for conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The \u201cmere presence\u201d cases are also in-apposite because, as noted previously, Facey did far more than be \u201cmerely present\u201d; in fact, he volunteered to help \u201ctake the green,\u201d Rl-106, Exh. 1 at 29, he arranged to pick it up in a cargo van (rented in someone else\u2019s name), and he seemed comfortable with the contents of the van when he saw that the van was loaded with marijuana. This evidence was more than sufficient, taken together, for a jury to infer that he was a knowing participant in the operation. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Carrazana, </em>921 F.2d 1557, 1566 (11th Cir. 1991) (stating, where the defendant \u201cplann[ed] the pickup of a large quantity of cocaine,\u201d and \u201cexecut[ed] the delivery,\u201d that a \u201cjury could presume that [the defendant] was familiar with [the illegal acts], and infer his knowledge of the broader, ongoing conspiracy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In summary, in light of the evidence presented, a reasonable jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Facey was aware of the nature of the conspiracy, and that he knowingly participated in it by his conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus the district court did not err in denying his motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">B. <em>Transcripts of Facey\u2019s Recorded Conversations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">Facey also argues that the district court erred in allowing into evidence transcripts of the taped audio recordings of his conversations concerning the smuggling operation. Facey\u2019s argument on appeal is not, apparently, that the district court erred in <em>admitting </em>the transcripts into evidence, but, rather, that once the transcripts had been admitted, \u201csome safeguards\u201d were needed to ensure that the jury did not use the transcripts improperly during deliberations. Br. of Appellant at 27. Specifically, Facey argues that the district court needed to give a limiting instruction \u2014 immediately prior to jury deliberations \u2014 to remind the jury that the transcripts were not to be overly relied upon, and that the transcripts were intended to be only corroborative of the audio recordings.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">In Facey\u2019s ease, DEA Officer Parry had prepared a corresponding transcript of each recorded conversation between the confidential informant Gordon, Facey, and the other drug traffickers involved this case. At trial, Officer Parry testified about his method of preparing the transcripts from the audio recordings. He indicated he had transcribed the recordings himself, and that if there were portions that were not understandable, he would put the word \u201cunintelligible\u201d in brackets in the transcription. He also testified that the transcripts were accurate to the best of his ability, and that they accurately captured both the content and the identification of the speakers. When the government sought to introduce the transcript of the 3 May meeting into evidence, Facey\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>counsel objected. The district court indicated, consistent with its pre-trial ruling on this issue, that it would overrule Facey\u2019s objection to the transcripts, subject to a motion to strike the transcripts if the court subsequently determined (in listening to the audio recordings) that they were not sufficiently accurate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court then gave this limiting instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3d\">I have admitted the transcript for the limited and secondary purpose of aiding you in following the content of the conversation as you listen to the tape recording and also aid you in identifying the speakers. However, you are specifically instructed that whether the transcript correctly or incorrectly reflects the content of the conversation or the identity of the speakers is entirely for you to determine based upon your own evaluation of the testimony you have heard concerning the preparation of the transcript and from your own examination of the transcript in relation to your hearing of the tape recording itself as the primary evidence of its own contents. And, if you should determine that the transcript is in any respect incorrect or unreliable, you should disregard it to that extent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">R3 at 78-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">On the second day of trial, before direct examination of Officer Parry was to resume, Facey\u2019s counsel renewed-outside of the presence of the jury \u2014 his objection to the government\u2019s transcripts. The court reiterated that the transcripts of Facey\u2019s conversations could be admitted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">I am going to listen along when the tapes are played in front of the jury, and if I am satisfied that the transcripts are sufficiently accurate \u2014 they are not going to be a hundred percent. I have never seen one that\u2019s a hundred percent \u2014 but if I am convinced that they are sufficiently accurate and authenticated, then I will let them go back to the jury room. If not, then they were just demonstrative aids. And I have already instructed the jury as to their use in that regard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">R4 at 10. The court also advised Facey\u2019s counsel that he was free to cross-examine Officer Parry about the transcripts and his methods of preparation, in order to cast doubt on the accuracy of the transcripts. Facey\u2019s counsel did, in fact, cross-examine Officer Parry, attempting to cast doubt on his methods of transcribing the tape and his familiarity with Jamaican slang.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">Direct examination of Officer Parry then re-commenced. When the government offered into evidence an audio tape and its accompanying transcript of a July 2004 telephone conversation between Gordon and Facey, Facey again objected to the authenticity of the transcript. The court received the transcript with the same limiting instruction that it had given the jury regarding the earlier transcripts. This same process repeated itself a number of times, with Facey\u2019s counsel objecting to the transcripts being admitted and the court permitting them to be admitted, subject to its earlier limiting instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">Towards the conclusion of the government\u2019s case in chief, the court observed: \u201c[s]o far, I don\u2019t see any problem with any of the transcripts. I think the transcripts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>are among the more accurate transcripts I have ever seen.\u201d R4 at 193. The jury was subsequently permitted to take the transcripts of the phone conversations into the deliberations room, along with the audio recordings. Although the district court gave the same limiting instruction to the jury prior to its receiving each individual transcript, no such limiting instruction was given prior to deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">On appeal, Facey argues that \u201csome safeguards\u201d should have been imposed pri- or to giving the transcripts to the jury, such as a limiting instruction <em>\u201cimmediately prior to deliberations.\u201d </em>Br. of Appellant at 27-29. He contends that the district court\u2019s failure to do so created the risk that the jury overly relied on the corroborative transcripts rather than the (more accurate) audio recordings, thereby causing him prejudice. As to the admission of evidence, \u201c[w]e review on an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>918 F.2d 1501, 1510 (11th Cir.1990); <em>see also United States v. Onori, </em>535 F.2d 938, 947 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We have stated that it is a \u201cwell-established\u201d rule that a district court may permit a corroborative transcript of an audio recording to be admitted and provided to a jury during deliberations, so as to assist the jury in understanding the original recording. <em>United States v. Reed, </em>887 F.2d 1398, 1407 (11th Cir.1989). In <em>Onori, </em>our predecessor circuit explained the purpose behind this rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">The need or desire for transcripts arises generally from two circumstances. First, portions of a tape may be relatively inaudible. Second, without the aid of a transcript, it may be difficult to identify the speakers. In either of these cases, it has been said that it is within the discretion of the trial court to allow a transcript to be used by the jury to assist the jury as it listens to the tape. We believe that the use of a transcript as a guide is analogous to the use of expert testimony as a device aiding a jury in understanding other types of real evidence.... They are evidence and, like other evidence, may be admitted for a limited purpose....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">535 F.2d 938, 947-48 (citation and internal quotations omitted). We have further indicated that when there is a dispute over the accuracy of a transcript, the proper protocol is for \u201ceach side [to] produce its own version of a transcript or its own version of the disputed portions. In addition, each side may put on evidence supporting the accuracy of its own version or challenging the accuracy of the other side\u2019s version.\u201d <em>United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1376 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">In this case, Facey did not produce his own version of the disputed transcripts, nor did he cast significant doubt on the accuracy of the government\u2019s version, other than through a brief cross-examination of Officer Parry. In fact, the record suggests that the transcripts were accurate reproductions of the recorded conversations; Officer Parry testified that they were accurate both as to the content and the identity of the speakers, and the district court found them to be \u201camong the more accurate transcripts [it] [had] ever seen.\u201d R4 at 193. In addition, as noted, the district court gave a limiting instruction to the jury \u2014 carefully delineating the limited purpose for which the transcripts were to be used \u2014 before admitting each one into evidence. That instruction was wholly congruent with the reasoning of <em>Onori.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">Moreover, on appeal Facey has failed to show how, if at all, the transcripts were inaccurate; rather, his argument is that the failure to take proper safeguards with the transcripts could hypothetically have led the jury to misuse them, thereby caus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>ing him prejudice. This contention is not sufficient to warrant a reversal of his conviction. <em>See, e.g., Reed, </em>887 F.2d at 1407 (affirming conviction where defendant \u201chas not questioned the accuracy of the transcripts\u201d but \u201chas asserted only a general claim that he was prejudiced by the jury\u2019s alleged use of the transcripts\u201d). In summary, Facey has failed to establish that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the transcripts and providing them to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Facey appealed his drug conspiracy conviction pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 848, contending: (1) that there was insufficient evidence to support his drug conspiracy conviction and that therefore the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c); and (2) that the district court erred in submitting transcripts of recorded conversations to the jury without using additional safeguards to ensure that they were used for a limited purpose. Upon careful review of the record, we conclude that there was ample evidence from which a reasonable jury could have found Facey guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on the drug conspiracy conviction, and that therefore the district court acted properly in denying Facey\u2019s Rule 29 motion. We also find no evidence that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the transcripts of Facey\u2019s recorded conversations and in providing them to the jury with a limiting instruction. Accordingly, Facey\u2019s conviction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\">. Gordon, the Jamaican informant, testified at trial that \"cheese\u201d referred to marijuana.

He also testified that the Jamaican dealers used a number of slang words \u2014 such as \u201cReggae Boys,\u201d \u201cbush\u201d and \u201cfish\u201d \u2014 to refer to marijuana. <em>Id. </em>Clyde Parry, the DEA officer who oversaw this investigation, confirmed that drug traffickers frequently speak in coded words in discussing illicit drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\">.

The district court had advised, \"We will introduce them into evidence subject to a motion to strike if when I listen to the tapes I find that they are not accurate enough to be evidence and that they are only demonstrative. But we will introduce them into evidence at least as demonstrative exhibits for the jury to be able to follow along with. And then if you think that they are not accurate enough for the jury to take them back into the jury room, then you can move to strike them ... as exhibits. They would still be demonstrative but they wouldn't go back into the jury room.\u201d R3 at 9.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
