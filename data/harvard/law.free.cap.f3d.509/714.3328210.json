EUGENE DAVIS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b740-28\">In response to the Petition for Rehearing filed by the government, we withdraw the prior panel opinion in its entirety and substitute the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b740-29\">The question before this court is whether a charge and conviction for \u201cpossession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>with an intent to deliver\u201d a controlled substance under section 481.112(a) of the Texas Health and Safety Code can be used as a basis for a sentence enhancement as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) (2005). \u201cControlled substance offense\u201d is defined in USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(b). USSG \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 1. USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">The term \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d means an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">We hold that the conviction in this case for \u201cpossession with intent to deliver\u201d under this Texas statute qualifies as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d \u201cPossession with intent to deliver\u201d is indistinguishable from the offense of \u201cpossession with intent to distribute,\u201d one of the offenses listed in USSG\u2019s definition of a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d We therefore AFFIRM Ford\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">On July 14, 2005, Houston police officers Tran and Ponder responded to a call from an individual stating that he had just seen the person who shot him a few days earlier. The officers went to the stated address and saw the alleged shooter inside the apartment who matched the description provided. Returning to the apartment with a Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, and Tobacco (ATF) Special Agent, the agents confronted the suspect, later identified as defendant Jason Jermaine Ford, and the apartment lessee, Crystal McConnell, at the door. McConnell denied having a firearm in the apartment and consented to a search. While searching, the defendant informed the officers that there was a .32 caliber firearm on a chair, which Officer Tran immediately recovered. Ford was then arrested and advised of his rights. The ATF agent determined that the firearm was manufactured outside of the state of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">On September 8, 2005, a federal grand jury indicted the defendant on one count of possession of a firearm after being convicted of a felony offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). Ford entered a guilty plea on November 18, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">The presentence report calculated Ford\u2019s total offense level to be seventeen, starting with a base offense level of twenty, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A) for a prior \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d and then subtracting three levels for the acceptance of responsibility pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3E1.1(a) and (b). A total offense level of seventeen combined with a criminal history category of IV resulted in an imprisonment range of thirty-seven to forty-six months. Ford objected to the presentence report, arguing that his conviction was under a Texas statute that penalized acts and intents outside the USSG\u2019s \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d definition. As a result, Ford argued that his conviction should not qualify as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d Ford\u2019s charging documents, the indictment, and the judgment were available to the district court judge. No underlying facts about the conviction were provided in these documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">Based on a comparison between the language of the conviction offense and underlying statute as found in these documents with the definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d in the USSG, the court below overruled Ford\u2019s objection. Ford was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>therefore sentenced on February 10, 2006, to serve thirty-seven months followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the USSG <em>de novo. United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006). Because Ford\u2019s objection was preserved at trial, we review the record <em>de novo </em>to determine whether the district court\u2019s error was harmless. <em>United States v. Lopez-Urbina, </em>434 F.3d 750, 765 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The issue presented before this court is whether a conviction for \u201cpossession with intent to deliver\u201d criminalizes conduct beyond that which is subject to sentencing enhancement as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d Ford relies on two cases which he contends demonstrate that his prior offense \u2014 possession of intent to deliver \u2014 criminalizes conduct not subject to this enhancement. In two closely analogous decisions, this court held similar convictions to be broader than a nearly identical USSG definition of another offense subject to sentencing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">In <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 271 (5th Cir.2005), the defendant was previously convicted for \u201ctransporting/selling a controlled substance\u201d under section 11379(a) of the California Health &amp; Safety Code and for that previous conviction, the district court added a sentence enhancement for a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i). <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(B)(iv) (defining \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court held that the \u201ctransporting/selling a controlled substance\u201d offense under the California statute was broader than the USSG\u2019s definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274-75. <em>See also United States v. Kovac, </em>367 F.3d 1116, 1119 (9th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Navidad-Marcos, </em>367 F.3d 903 at 907-08 (9th Cir.2004). The California statute, for instance, \u201ccriminalizes the transportation of a controlled substance for personal use and offers to transport, sell, furnish, administer, or give away a controlled substance.\u201d <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 274. None of the listed activities is covered by the \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d definition, which \u201ccovers only the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or possession with the intent to do any of these things).\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore this court concluded the district court had committed plain error in adding a sentencing enhancement, because the basis for defendant\u2019s underlying conviction could be conduct that lies outside the narrow definition of a \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">In <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714-15 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam), this court held that a conviction for unlawful delivery of a controlled substance under a different subsection of section 481.112 of the Texas Health and Safety Code, was broader than the limited set of offenses subject to a sentencing enhancement under the USSG\u2019s definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense.\u201d In <em>Gonzales, </em>the court noted that \u201cdelivery\u201d encompasses an \u201coffer to sell\u201d under the Texas statutory definition, and an \u201coffer to sell\u201d is not one of the acts included within the \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d definition. <em>Id. See also </em>Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>\u00a7 481.002(8) (defining \u201cdeliver\u201d); <em>Donley v. State, </em>140 S.W.3d 428, 429 (Tex.App.2004) (interpreting \u201cdelivery\u201d as any actual transfer, constructive transfer, or offer to sell); <em>Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d at 273 (listing \u201coffers to ... sell\u201d as conduct outside USSG\u2019s definition of \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Neither of the above cases controls the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">The significant distinction in this case is that unlike the two cases discussed above, the conviction here was for possession with the intent to deliver rather than just delivery or transportation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the instant case, Ford\u2019s indictment charged him with possession with intent to deliver. According to the USSG, the term \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d includes offenses that prohibit the \u201cpossession of a controlled substance ... with intent to ... distribute.\u201d USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(b). We agree with the government that it is pure sophistry to distinguish between the conduct of one who possesses drugs with intent to deliver those drugs and one who possesses drugs with intent to distribute them. <em>United States v. Palacios-Quinonez, </em>431 F.3d 471 (5th Cir.2005), demonstrates this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">In <em>Palacios-Quinonez, </em>the defendant had previously been convicted under a California statute that prohibited both possession of drugs for sale (which was conceded to be a drug trafficking offense) and purchase of drugs for purpose of sale. Because it was impossible to determine under which prong Palacios-Quinonez was convicted, the court had to determine whether a \u201cpurchase for purpose of sale\u201d also fell within the definition of a drug trafficking offense. In <em>Palacios-Quinonez, </em>this court noted one major difference between a conviction for an \u201coffer to sell\u201d controlled substances and a conviction for a \u201cpurchase for sale\u201d of a controlled substance. One may \u201coffer to sell\u201d drugs without possessing those drugs. One who \u201cpurchases for sale\u201d however has either actual or constructive possession of the controlled substance. We concluded that the offense of \u201cpurchase for sale\u201d was equivalent to the controlled substance \u201cpossession with intent to distribute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">For purposes of qualifying as a controlled substance offense, Ford\u2019s conduct is indistinguishable from Palacios\u2019 conduct. Ford possessed drugs with intent to deliver or pass them on to another. Palacios purchased drugs (and thereby actually or constructively possessed them) and intended to sell them to another. The conduct in both instances is equivalent to the drug trafficking offense, possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in enhancing Ford\u2019s sentence pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>sons stated above, we therefore AFFIRM the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-8\">. \" 'Drug trafficking offense\u2019 means an offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(B)(iv).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b743-8\">. \"Drug trafficking offense,\u201d and not \"controlled substance offense,\" is the operative USSG offense in the two analogous cases described above. However, the definitions of \"drug trafficking offense\u201d and \"controlled substance offense\u201d are almost identical. <em>Compare </em>USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(B)(iv) (\"drug trafficking offense\u201d), <em>with </em>USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(b) (\"controlled substance offense\u201d). Any minor textual differences do not control in this case. Therefore, the definitions of \"controlled substance offense\u201d and \"drug trafficking offense\u201d are identical for our purposes here. <em>Cf. United States v. Gonzalez-Borjas, </em>125 Fed.Appx. 556, 559 &amp; n. 9 (5th Cir.2005) (unpublished).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b743-13\">. In order to preserve the argument for further review, Ford also contends that his indictment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) is unconstitutional both facially and as applied. An indictment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) requires an effect on interstate commerce. Ford argues that where the only interstate commerce nexus is the fact that the firearm at some point in the past traveled across state lines contravenes the limits of the commerce power as defined in <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 551, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). But he concedes his argument is foreclosed by several opinions by this court. <em>See e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b744-5\">DENNIS, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AP7\">dissenting from grant of panel rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Our original unanimous panel decision was based solidly on our prior panels\u2019 precedents. Nevertheless, despite our basic rule of <em>stare decisis, </em>the new panel majority now refuses to follow those circuit precedents because it deems them to be founded on \u201csophistry.\u201d As the Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">Very weighty considerations underlie the principle that courts should not lightly overrule past decisions. Among these are the desirability that the law furnish a clear guide for the conduct of individuals, to enable them to plan their affairs with assurance against untoward surprise; the importance of furthering fair and expeditious adjudication by eliminating the need to relitigate every relevant proposition in every case; and the necessity of maintaining public faith in the judiciary as a source of impersonal and reasoned judgments. The reasons for rejecting any established rule must always be weighed against these factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-10\"><em>Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., </em>398 U.S. 375, 403, 90 S.Ct. 1772, 26 L.Ed.2d 339 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">These weighty considerations are acutely important on a seventeen-member court sitting in panels of three. Because the majority disregards these considerations and the additional needs underlying our own circuit rules requiring adherence to precedent, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">\n<em>1. Logic not sophistry supports Ford\u2019s position and the original panel opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b744-15\">Our original opinion correctly concludes that the Texas offense of \u201cpossession with an intent to deliver\u201d is \u201cbroader\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> than the federal sentencing guideline\u2019s \u201cpossession with an intent to distribute\u201d offense, a controlled substance offense that triggers a federal sentence enhancement. This conclusion is a direct logical consequence of our prior panel\u2019s comparison of the same state statute and a substantively identical sentencing guideline in <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712 (5th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As in <em>Gonzales, </em>our task is to engage in a <em>Taylor </em>categorical analysis to determine whether the elements of the state statutory offense is a type of offense that triggers federal sentence enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 714-15. A quick review of the straightforward logic that applies here should avoid any hint of \u201csophistry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>\n<em>A.Texas Offense of \u201cDelivery\" Is Not A Controlled Substance Offense of \u201cDistribution\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">The Texas offense of \u201cdelivery of a controlled substance\u201d provides three ways that this offense may be committed: the actual transfer, the constructive transfer, and the offer to sell a controlled substance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\"><em>Gonzales </em>establishes that because the mere offer to sell controlled substances can form part of a crime under the Texas statute but not under the federal guidelines, there is a discrepancy between the state and federal offense definitions in this respect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, when a Texas offender enters an undifferentiated guilty plea to delivery of controlled substances he may be convicting himself only of delivery by offer to sell, a type of Texas crime that is not defined as the \u201cdistribution of controlled substances,\u201d a controlled substance offense under the federal guidelines.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Therefore, under <em>Gonzales, </em>a Texas \u201cdelivery\u201d offense is broader than the controlled substance offense of \u201cdistribution\u201d that triggers a federal sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\"><em>B. </em>Taylor <em>Analysis Requires Us to Compare the Elements of the Offenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">In <em>Garzar-Lopez, </em>we said \u201ca district court looks to the elements of a prior offense, rather than to the facts underlying the conviction, when classifying a prior offense for sentence enhancement purposes.\u201d 410 F.3d at 273 (citing <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-16\">Texas case-law holds \u201cpossession with an intent to deliver\u201d comprises two separate elements: \u201cpossession\u201d and an \u201cintent to deliver.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Federal case-law holds \u201cpossession with an intent to distribute\u201d comprises two separate elements: \u201cpossession\u201d and an \u201cintent to distribute.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-17\">Therefore, under <em>Taylor, </em>we should compare the offense elements: \u201cpossession\u201d with \u201cpossession\u201d and \u201cintent to distribute\u201d with \u201cintent to deliver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-18\">\n<em>C. There Is No Dispute About the Equivalence of \u201cPossession\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b745-19\">The parties do not question whether \u201cpossession\u201d in Ford\u2019s conviction means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>\u201cpossession\u201d for federal sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">\n<em>D. \u201cIntent to Deliver\u201d Encompasses Intent Not Defined as an \u201cIntent to Distribute\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Texas case-law holds that an \u201cintent to deliver a controlled substance\u201d is the intent to complete a \u201cdelivery of a controlled substance\u201d offense.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Federal case-law holds that an \u201cintent to distribute a controlled substance\u201d is the intent to complete a \u201cdistribution of controlled substance\u201d offense.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">A Texas \u201cdelivery of a controlled substance\u201d offense is broader than a \u201cdistribution of a controlled substance\u201d offense that triggers a federal sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Therefore, Taylor*s comparison of elements concludes that \u201cpossession with intent to deliver\u201d is \u201cbroader\u201d and not equivalent to \u201cpossession with intent to distribute,\u201d because the \u201cintent to deliver\u201d element includes a different kind of intent, <em>i.e., </em>intent to \u201coffer to sell,\u201d which is a type of intent that is not an \u201cintent to distribute\u201d under the federal sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">\n<em>E. Gonzales and Taylor Require The Conclusion Reached by the Original Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Based on previous sections, because the mere intent to offer to deliver drugs can form part of a crime under the Texas statute but not under the federal guidelines, there is a discrepancy between the state and federal crime definitions in this respect. When a Texas offender enters an undifferentiated guilty plea of possession with intent to deliver he may be pleading guilty to only possession with intent to deliver by offer to sell, a type of Texas crime that is not defined as a controlled substance offense by the federal guidelines.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">\n<em>II. Other Panels Agree With the Original Opinion\u2019s Logic</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">The previous section demonstrates that the reasoning in the original opinion was not sophism, but straightforward syllogistic logic and required by previous case-law. The mere feeling by even a number of federal judges that a statutory offense of \u201cpossession with intent to offer to sell\u201d should either be included in the guidelines definition or deleted from the Texas statute is, of course, not grounds for us to alter the plain words of the statute and the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Herrera-Roldan, </em>414 F.3d 1238, 1244 (10th Cir.2005) (\u201cWe cannot rewrite the Sentencing Guidelines simply because they might, in future cases, produce an anomalous result.\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As concluded above, our original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>panel decision in <em>Ford </em>is the logical consequence of <em>Gonzales </em>and <em>Taylor. </em>By concluding otherwise, the majority ignores the clear logical implications of precedent</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Subsequent unpublished decisions by other panels have reached the same result as our original panel opinion. For example, one panel applied the same reasoning to the same Texas statute of conviction, <em>i.e., </em>possession with intent to deliver, even though our original opinion did not bind their decision as our opinion was pending panel rehearing. <em>See United States v. Barrera-Castro, </em>232 Fed.Appx. 429 (5th Cir.2007) (Smith, Wiener, Owen, JJ.) (citing <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 715-17 (5th Cir.2007) (King, Wiener, Owen, JJ.)); <em>United States v. Lozoya, </em>232 Fed.Appx. 431 (5th Cir.2007) (Smith, Wiener, Owen, JJ.). A different panel adopted and applied the reasoning of our original panel decision to a Colorado conviction for possession of drugs with intent to either sell or distribute in which \u201csell\u201d was statutorily defined to include an \u201coffer to sell.\u201d <em>See United States v. Flores-Meras, </em>234 Fed.Appx. 307 (5th Cir.2007) (Jolly, Clement, Owen, JJ.). In other words, the panel concluded that \u201cpossession with intent to offer to sell\u201d under Colorado law is not \u201cpossession with intent to distribute\u201d for federal sentence enhancement purposes. <em>Id. </em>The panels in <em>Garza-Lopez </em>(King, Garza, Benavides, JJ.) and <em>Gonzales </em>(King, Wiener, Owen, JJ.) considered and agreed with defendants who successfully raised arguments very similar to the arguments in this case. In sum, by pejoratively calling the reasoning of our original panel opinion \u201csophistry,\u201d the new majority here is hurling the epithet of \u201csophist\u201d at no less than a majority of this court, including all members of this panel.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">\n<em>III. Adopting the New Rule Creates An Inconsistency in Sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">Not only does the majority\u2019s opinion fail to follow the logical implications of precedent, the majority\u2019s new opinion will also create an inconsistency in our sentencing practice. Under Texas law, \u201cpossession with intent to deliver a controlled substance\u201d is a lesser-included offense of \u201cdelivery of a controlled substance.\u201d <em>See Pena-Mota v. Texas, </em>986 S.W.2d 341, 346 (Tex.App.1999) (\u201cPossession with intent to deliver a controlled substance is a lesser-included offense of delivery of that same controlled substance in the same transaction.\u201d). Under <em>Gonzales, </em>a federal sentencing court <em>cannot </em>impose guidelines enhancement because of a prior Texas conviction for \u201cdelivery.\u201d Now the new majority opinion concludes that a court <em>can </em>enhance a sentence for \u201cdelivery\u2019s\u201d lesser included offense, \u201cpossession with intent to deliver [by offer to sell].\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">Under the majority panel opinion, a defendant is now punished more severely in the federal sentencing context for the lesser Texas crime of possession with intent to deliver controlled substances than for the greater Texas crime of delivery of eon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>trolled substances if he chooses to plead, or if a Texas jury convicts, on a lesser-included offense instead of the more serious general offense. Thus, a Texas culprit who possesses drugs with intent to offer them for sale is exposed to USSG enhancement while a Texas criminal who is guilty of the greater and more serious crime of delivery of drugs is not. <em>See Stockton v. Texas, </em>756 S.W.2d 873, 876 (Tex.App.1988) (\u201cThe word \u2018lesser\u2019 appears to refer not to the punishment range, but to the factor that distinguishes the included offense from the offense charged, <em>ie., </em>less than all facts, less serious injury or risk of harm, less culpable mental state.\u201d). Further, the new panel majority opinion conflicts, rather than conforms, with the purpose of the USSG. Such a result arguably contravenes the purpose of the Sentencing Guidelines. \u201c \u2018The Guidelines were enacted to bring uniformity and predictability to sentencing.\u2019 The goal is \u2018to reduce unjustified disparities and so reach toward the even-handedness and neutrality that are the distinguishing marks of any principled system of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Ramirez, </em>477 F.3d 310, 313 <em>&amp; </em>nn.15-16 (5th Cir.2007) (citing <em>United States v. Ashburn, </em>20 F.3d 1336, 1347 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 113, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">\n<em>IV. The Majority Mischaracterizes Ford\u2019s conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The majority reaches its conclusion relying on three flawed justifications. The majority unsuccessfully attempts to justify its inference of an intent to distribute from Ford\u2019s guilty plea conviction in three different ways: (1) by mis-characterizing Ford\u2019s conviction; (2) by inferring an \u201cintent to distribute\u201d from simple possession; and (3) by comparing Ford\u2019s conviction with <em>United States v. Palacios-Quinonez, </em>431 F.3d 471 (5th Cir.2005). Each proffered justification is fundamentally flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">First, the majority attempts to (mis)characterize Ford\u2019s \u201cintent to deliver\u201d as an \u201cintent to distribute.\u201d The majority concludes quite summarily that \u201cFord possessed drugs with intent to deliver <em>or pass them on to another.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The majority obviously believes and desires to characterize Ford as intending to \u201cpass\u201d drugs onto another, which is \u201cdistribution\u201d for federal sentencing purposes. However, no document informs this panel that Ford was convicted for intending to \u201cpass\u201d controlled substances. He was only convicted for an \u201cintent to deliver controlled substances,\u201d which includes an intent to \u201coffer to sell controlled substances.\u201d <em>Gonzales </em>clearly forbids us today to characterize the term \u201cdelivery\u201d in this Texas statute as necessarily including the \u201cpassing\u201d of controlled substances to another, ie., actually or constructively transferring controlled substances to another. 484 F.3d at 715 (\u201cThat is, even though the indictment charged [the defendant] with actually transferring, constructively transferring, and offering to sell a controlled substance, the jury could have convicted him based on an offer to sell alone.\u201d). <em>Gonzales </em>logically requires us today to consider Ford\u2019s conviction as possession with intent to offer to sell and not, as the majority desires, a conviction that implicates an intent to actually or constructively transfer controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">In essence, the majority opinion is asking us to disregard precedent concluding that \u201ca disjunctive statute may be pleaded conjunctively and proven disjunctively.\u201d <em>Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d at 715 (quoting <em>United States v. Still, </em>102 F.3d 118, 124 (5th Cir.1996)). The majority now re-characterizes Ford\u2019s guilty plea as necessarily convicting him of possession with intent to <em>transfer, </em>rather than with intent to <em>offer to sell, </em>although the latter is the only intent or offense imputable to him under the <em>Taylor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>categorical approach. Thus, the majority disregards <em>Gonzales </em>and an established line of precedent under which we are required to assume that the conviction was necessarily established under only the least culpable of the disjunctive possibilities, <em>ie., </em>possession with intent to offer to sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">V. <em>Inferring Distribution from Possession Disregards the Taylor Categorical Approach</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The majority attempts to distinguish <em>Gonzales </em>by noting that the conviction in this case involved possession in addition to an intent to deliver. In other words, the majority infers from the \u201cpossession\u201d element in the offense that an \u201cintent to deliver\u201d is equivalent to an \u201cintent to distribute\u201d for federal sentencing purposes. A majority of Circuit courts explicitly forbids any inference <em>from </em>possession or other aspects of the defendant\u2019s underlying conduct with respect to the \u201cintent to distribute\u201d element.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See Herrera-Roldan, </em>414 F.3d at 1241 (\u201cWe therefore decline the government\u2019s invitation to draw inferences about an intent to distribute from [the defendant\u2019s] underlying conduct.\u201d); <em>Montanez, </em>442 F.3d at 491 (\u201c[C]riminal intent to distribute must be proven and not merely implied.\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Foster, </em>28 F.3d 109, 1994 WL 201201 (9th Cir. May 23, 1994) (unpublished)); <em>United States v. Villa-Lara, </em>451 F.3d 963, 965 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201cThe Information states that [defendant] was charged with possession of a \u2018trafficking quantity\u2019 of a controlled substance. This does not reveal that he had any trafficking intent.\u201d). One Circuit court allows such an inference only if the statutory scheme clearly mandates such an inference. <em>See United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228, 1232 (11th Cir.2003). As I note below, other Circuits persuasively criticize even this limited inference of an \u201cintent to distribute\u201d from mere possession as violating <em>Taylor. </em>Therefore, <em>Madera-Madera </em>appears to have been incorrectly decided, and furthermore, is readily distinguishable, because it relies on explicit statutory intent, which does not exist here.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-9\">In <em>Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d at 1232, based on a close reading of a Georgia statute, the Eleventh Circuit determined that Georgia\u2019s legislature intended a conviction for the possession of a certain elevated amount of drugs to be an offense so serious that federal sentencing courts should infer that the statute intends such possession to \u201crepresent an intent to distribute and thereby traffic.\u201d In <em>Villa-Lara, </em>the Ninth Circuit rejected the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s approach, because it failed to \u201cundertake a proper <em>Taylor </em>categorical analysis of only the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 965 n. 2. Moreover, the Tenth Circuit in <em>United States v. Herrera-Roldan, </em>414 F.3d 1238, 1241-43 (10th Cir.2005) addressed the same Texas statute at issue in this case and concluded that the approach in <em>Madera-Madera </em>does not apply to this Texas statute, because of material differences between Georgia\u2019s and Texas\u2019 statutory schemes. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cThe Texas statutory scheme therefore does not imply an intent to distribute from the fact of possession ... \u201d). <em>Madera-Madera </em>is either incorrectly decided or readily distinguishable as it relies on a specific reading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>of legislative intent of a unique Georgia statute. Therefore, there is no justification or case that permits the majority to avoid the elements approach under <em>Taylor </em>and create an unwarranted inference of an \u201cintent to distribute\u201d from the \u201cpossession\u201d element if the Texas offense\u2019s \u201cintent to deliver\u201d element, by itself, is broader than the federal definition of an \u201cintent to distribute.\u201d <em>Cf. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d at 715-17; <em>Villa-Lara, </em>451 F.3d at 965; <em>Montanez, </em>442 F.3d at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">\n<em>VI. Palacios-Quinonez is irrelevant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The majority\u2019s heavy reliance on <em>United States v. Palacios-Quinonez, </em>431 F.3d 471 (5th Cir.2005) as an analogous precedent is misplaced. In that case we concluded that a California conviction for a \u201cpurchase for sale\u201d of controlled substances is a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d for federal sentencing purposes. In <em>Palacios, </em>the statutory terms and the issues on appeal were markedly dissimilar.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">First, Palacios was convicted of a \u201cpurchase for sale\u201d of controlled substances under a California statute. Ford was convicted for \u201cpossession with an intent to deliver\u201d under a Texas statute. The elements \u201cpurchase\u201d and \u201cintent to sell\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in Palacios\u2019 statutory offense are entirely unlike Ford\u2019s statutory offense elements of \u201cpossession\u201d and \u201cintent to deliver.\u201d The majority provides no reason why dissimilar elements in these statutory offenses are comparable under a <em>Taylor </em>approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Second, the only issue on appeal in <em>Pa-lacios </em>was whether the \u201cpurchase\u201d element in the California offense is broader than the \u201cpossession\u201d element in the \u201cpossession with intent to distribute\u201d offense in the federal sentencing guideline. <em>Palacios, </em>431 F.3d at 474 (\u201c[We] do not agree [with Palacios] that \u2018purchase for purposes of sale\u2019 does not involve \u2018possession\u2019 with intent to distribute as required by the guidelines.\u201d). <em>Palacios </em>held that the \u201cpurchase\u201d element under the California statutory offense is not broader, but narrower, than the \u201cpossession\u201d element. <em>Id. </em>at 474, 476 n. 6 (\u201cBy contrast, to accomplish a purchase of a drug for sale, one must have at least constructive possession.\u201d). <em>Palacios\u2019 </em>holding regarding the relationship between the \u201cpurchase\u201d element in a California statutory offense and \u201cpossession\u201d element in the federal sentencing guidelines is completely irrelevant to the issue before us now.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">The majority\u2019s decision finds no basis in law, ignores the fact that our original panel opinion was a logical consequence of Gonzales<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> under the <em>Taylor </em>categorical approach, and creates irrational disparities in sentencing. For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-9\">. That is, the state statute contains one or more crime definitions, or ways that the statute may be violated, that do not constitute a \"controlled substance offense\u201d under USSG \u00a7 4B 1.2(b).

Whether possession is involved does not change the truth of this statement, because an offense of \"delivery,\u201d including an \"offer to sell\u201d offense, does not differentiate between delivery or \"offer to sell\u201d convictions with possession and those without. <em>See Lopez v.
