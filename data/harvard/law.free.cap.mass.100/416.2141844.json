The declaration also contained general counts, for the price of one hundred shares of stock of the Huron Mining Company, bargained and sold by the plaintiff to the defendant; for money paid by the plaintiff for the defendant; and on an account annexed ; all the counts being for the same cause of action. The answer denied all the plaintiff\u2019s allegations; alleged that any sum owed by the defendant to the plaintiff had been fully paid; and set up the statute of frauds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">At the trial in the superior court, before Reed, J., the plaintiff introduced evidence tending to show \u201cthat in February 1867 the defendant employed Greely as his agent to buy for him one hundred shares of the stock of the Huron Mining Company on a sixty days\u2019 buyer\u2019s option; that Greely gave the order to the plaintiff, who was a stock broker and member of the brokers board in Boston; and that the plaintiff afterwards, on the same day, for the purpose of fulfilling this order, at the regular meeting of the board, bought from Hubbard &amp; Co., stock brokers, who were also members thereof, one hundred shares of said stock for cash, at thirty-six dollars per share, and immediately thereafter sold to himself the same stock at thirty-seven dollars per share, sixty days\u2019 buyer\u2019s option ; that these two transactions were recorded by the secretary of the board, at the times thereof, on the record of purchases and sales at the board, kept by him as secretary, the one immediately following the other on the record, said record being in writing and being signed by the secretary at the close of each day\u2019s transactions; that, soon after the close of the session of the board on that day, the plaintiff reported to Greely that he had filled his order at the price of thirty-seven dollars per share j and Greely expressed himself sat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>isfied therewith; that Greely, either at the time of giving the order, or at the time of this report to him by the plaintiff, told the plaintiff that he (Greely) was acting for the defendant; and that the market value of a sixty days\u2019 buyer\u2019s option on a sale of Huron Mining Company stock, at the time of the transactions in question, was from seventy-five cents to a dollar and a half per share more than the cash price of the stock, varying within those limits according to the parties.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended further to show that, about a week after these transactions, <em>\u201c </em>the stock having depreciated in value in the market, the plaintiff, through Greely, applied to the defendant for a deposit, advance, or margin, on account thereof, which the defendant declined to make, saying, in so declining, that he would * take care of the stock at its maturity; \u2019 that near the end of the sixty days the plaintiff gave notice to the defendant of the time when said period would expire, and requested him then to take up and pay for the shares, and such request was also duly made at the expiration of said sixty days; but that the defendant declined then to take the shares or to pay for them, as requested, but turned over to the plaintiff certain claims against other persons, and certain shares of other mining stock, to be applied towards payment for the hundred shares in question, out of which claims and stock so turned over the plaintiff realized the amount credited in the account annexed to his declaration. There was no evidence that at the time when the defendant turned over to the plaintiff the claims and other mining stock, he had any knowledge of the manner aforedescribed of the purchase of said hundred shares of stock.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-6\">The plaintiff offered to show \u201ca custom of the brokers of Boston, on receiving an order like the one in this case, to fill it by buying of themselves as in this case ; \u201d but the judge ruled that such evidence was incompetent; and also ruled \u201c that the memorandum in writing of the transactions in question, made by the secretary of the brokers\u2019 board, at the times thereof, and signed by him at the end of the day\u2019s transactions of the board, was not sufficient to take the contract out of the statute of frauds; that the plaintiff, on an order to buy on a sixty days' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>buyer\u2019s option, could not buy for cash and receive the stock, so as to change the legal obligation of the person giving the order to take the stock ; that a broker receiving such an order could not lawfully buy of himself; that a part payment, as in this case, would not operate as a ratification and take the contract out of the statute if the defendant was ignorant of the foregoing facts of the manner of the purchase; and that on the evidence the plaintiff could not maintain his action.\u201d Under these rulings, a verdict was taken for the defendant, and the case reported for the revision of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-5\">S. <em>Bartlett </em>4* <em>A. G. </em>Browne, Jr., <em>(W. E. Parmenter </em>with them,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY4_\">The judge ruled, in effect, that the plaintiff \u201c could not buy for cash, and receive the stock.\u201d To determine the correctness of the ruling, the first step is to ascertain what the defendant authorized the plaintiff to do: whether merely to make a contract with some person for a hundred shares of stock, to be taken and paid for by the defendant at such time within sixty days as he might elect; or to purchase and pay for a hundred shares of stock, himself, and hold, or, in the phrase of the market, \u201ccarry\u201d it, to be taken and paid for by the defendant at such time within sixty days as he might elect. The declaration alleges that the authority was to purchase and carry; not merely to contract with some other person for a future transfer. If the proofs support the declaration, then the judge\u2019s ruling was wrong. If they leave the question in doubt, then the case should have been sent to the jury.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-6\">Which was authorized by the defendant would seem clear from the conduct of both parties. The plaintiff bought, paid for, and carried the stock. He did not contract to purchase. He applied to the defendant for a margin, to be advanced to himself, not to any third party with whom he had contracted. The defendant thus knew that the plaintiff had purchased and paid for the stock and was carrying it himself, and made no suggestion then, nor at any other time, that the authority he had given was merely to contract with others. After the expiration of the sixty days, the defendant transferred to the plaintiff certain things, to be applied towards payment for the shares so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>held by the plaintiff; thus recognizing the fact that he was the debtor of the plaintiff, and not of any third person.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-5\">If the authority was to purchase and hold, and not merely to contract, then the words \u201c on a sixty days\u2019 buyer\u2019s option \u201d must import that the defendant was to pay to the plaintiff, in addition to the sum expended by the plaintiff in the purchase, the market value of said option ; and the case shows that the market value of such an option is a separate and well known subject of sale and negotiation in stock transactions. In order to fix such market value, the plaintiff went through the process of offering the shares at sixty days\u2019 option at the brokers\u2019 board. This mode of fixing the value of the option must rest on usage, which the plaintiff offered to show. One employing a broker notoriously a member of the brokers\u2019 board, impliedly empowers him to deal according to the usage of the board, whether the employer knows such usage or not. <em>Mitchell </em>v. Newhall, 15 M. &amp; W. 308. <em>Bayliffe </em>v. Butterworth, 1 Exch. 425. <em>Sutton </em>v. <em>Tatham, </em>10 Ad. &amp; El. 27. <em>Pollock </em>v. <em>Stables, </em>12 Q. B. 765. <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>19 N. Y. 170. Whether such usage be sustained or not, the plaintiff has a right to recover such market value of the option as he can, and in fact did, prove. At all events, if the authority under which the plaintiff acted was to purchase, and not merely to contract to purchase, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum expended by him in purchasing, and his commission; even if it did not include an agreement on the part of the defendant o pay the plaintiff for the option.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-6\">That the authority of the defendant to Greely embraced the power of substitution, and that the plaintiff was duly substituted, is established by the subsequent negotiations between the plaintiff and the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-7\">Finally, the usage offered to be shown by the plaintiff was not merely one by which the price of a buyer\u2019s option on stock is fixed by a quotation at the brokers\u2019 board. That was but a small part of it. The substance of the usage which he offere to show was, that, when a broker in Boston is employed to buy stocks on time, he may make himself personally responsible for the price, and \u201c carry,\u201d himself, the stock so purchased. Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>if that part of the usage by which the quotation at the board fixes the price of \u201ccarrying\u201d the stock should fail to be approved, the rest remains a good and reasonable usage. <em>Cropper </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>Law Rep. 3 C. P. 194 <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Shepherd, </em>Law Rep. 2 C. P. 228.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b429-5\"><em>A. A. Ranney, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b429-6\">Foster, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnF\">The final ruling of the judge who presided at the trial was, that upon the evidence the plaintiff could not maintain his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The declaration alleges that the defendant employed the plaintiff to purchase for him certain shares of stock, the same to be delivered to him in sixty days from the time of the purchase. Assuming this to import, as the plaintiff claims, an order to buy the stock and carry it on the defendant\u2019s account for sixty days, we find no evidence of any such employment. The evidence was merely of an order to buy the stock \u201c on a sixty days\u2019 buyer\u2019s option,\u201d that is, with a right on the part of the purchaser to take and pay for it at any time within sixty days he might choose. If the course pursued by the plaintiff amounted to a purchase and \u201c carrying \u201d of the stock, then it was an unauthorized proceeding; one which the order given to the plaintiff did not warrant him in pursuing. If that course could be treated as the valid execution by a broker of an order to purchase on a sixty days\u2019 buyer\u2019s option, which was the only thing the defendant employed the plaintiff to do, then there is no such contract declared upon, and for this reason the action must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">It would be very difficult to support a usage by which a broker, employed to purchase stock, might, without the knowledge of his principal, buy the stock of himself. But we do not find it necessary to enter upon this discussion in order to dispose of the present case. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
