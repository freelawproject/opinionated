Dexter, a constable of that town, and committed to the jail, where he was kept imprisoned for seventy days. The defendant was sheriff during that time, and Samuel S. Daggett was keeper of the jail, appointed by him. The defendant personally did no act in regard to the imprisonment of the plaintiff, except that, in September, on being applied to by an attorney of the plaintiff to order his discharge, he de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>dined to give any order or take any action in the matter, and said he should not release the prisoner, as he deemed his authority sufficient to hold him. Before then, the plaintiff also frequently asked the defendant to let him out; and the defendant refused to do anything about it.

The commitment was by a constable, by virtue of a warrant issued by Dunham, the collector of taxes for the town of Edgartown for the year 1865. As collector for that year, Dunham had only the ordinary power of a collector of taxes, and this did not include the power to issue suelva warrant. At a town meeting held April 2,1866, the town voted to pay Dunham $125 for collecting taxes the ensuing year, and that he be a constable, with the authority given by law to town treasurers. Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>18, \u00a7 73. But this vote did not by its terms apply to the collection of the taxes for the prior year; so that this warrant was issued by him without authority; and it contained no recitals sufficient to protect the defendant, there being no authority in faci <em>Cheever </em>v. <em>Merritt, </em>5 Allen, 565 <em>Judgment for the plaintiff.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
