We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">This appeal involves a question of statutory interpretation of the Randolph-Sheppard Act (the Act). More precisely, the issue is whether a regulation of the Department of Defense (DOD) reasonably interprets the scope of the statutory exemption provided for military exchanges from the requirements of the Act that income from vending machines on federal property be shared with blind vendors and/or state blind agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">In 1936, Congress passed the Randolph-Sheppard Act, Ch. 638, 74 Stat. 1559 (1936) (current version at 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 107-107\u00cd (1982)), to provide blind persons with remunerative employment and economic opportunities by permitting them to operate vending stands in federal buildings. The program was only moderately successful. Part of the problem was general apathy to the program among the agencies. In addition, civilian employee welfare and recreation groups were being permitted by agencies to place vending machines in federal buildings to finance the activities of such groups. The competition from these machines diverted income from blind vendors and made the establishment of new vending stands economically unattractive.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">The practice of allowing employee groups, such as unions, to utilize federal property free of charge and to retain the funds without any accountability was of questionable legality. In 1952, the Comptroller General issued an opinion advising the Attorney General that funds derived from vending machines at the Federal Bureau of Investigation were received \u201cfor the use of the United States\u201d within the meaning of that phrase in 81 U.S.C. \u00a7 484 and were required to be deposited into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. Comp. Gen.Dec. B-111,086, 32 Comp.Gen. 124 (1952). In view of that opinion, the Comptroller General, in a related opinion that year, ruled that the practice of allowing postal employee groups to install vending machines on federal property and retain the profits was of \u201cdoubtful\u201d legality. However, the Comptroller General concluded that his office would \u201cinterpose no objection to the continued use of proceeds by employee groups\u201d pending action on clarifying legislation which the Controller General had recommended to Congress.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-15\">In 1954, Congress amended the Randolph-Sheppard Act to make it more effective. Amendments to the Randolph-Sheppard Vending Stand Act, Pub.L. No. 83-565, \u00a7 4, 68 Stat. 663 (1954). These amendments mandated that blind vendors be given a \u201cpreference,\u201d so far as feasible, in establishing new stands on federal property and authorized the heads of agencies to assign vending machine income to blind vendors with whom vending machines directly competed in order to assure such \u201cpreference.\u201d However, it appears that the assignment of income power was virtually ignored. In 1962, Senator Randolph, in proposing further amendments to improve the opportunities for the blind, specifically recognized that vending machines of civilian employee groups were the source of the problem and urged that such groups could and should find \u201cother means of financing [their] projects.\u201d <em>Operation of Vending Stands for the Blind in Federal Buildings: Hearing on S. 39J\u00a1. Before </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><em>the Special Subcomm. of the Senate Comm, on Government Operations, </em>87th Cong., 2d Sess. 10 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">In 1974, over strong opposition by civilian employee groups, particularly the Postal Workers Union, significant changes were made in the Act because of continued congressional dissatisfaction with the limited expansion of the blind vendor program. Randolph-Sheppard Act Amendments, Pub.L. No. 93-516, Title II, 88 Stat. 1622 (1974). These amendments were in large part, again, the result of the efforts of Senator Randolph and included provisions by which blind vendors were given \u201cpriority\u201d (not merely a preference) in operating new facilities so as to increase their numbers; the items allowed to be sold were expanded; and income from vending machines\u2014with some exemptions\u2014was required to be shared either with blind vendors directly or with state agencies for the blind. The sharing percentages are 100% for machines in direct competition with blind vendors; 50% where there is no direct competition unless at least half of the hours worked on the premises where the machines are located are outside normal working hours; and 30% in the latter case. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d-3(b)(l) (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The exemption provided in the 1974 amendments, which concerns us here, is found in 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d-3(d) (1982) and provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-6\">Subsections (a) and (b)(1) [income sharing] of this section shall not apply <em>to income from vending machines within retail sales outlets under the control of exchange or ships\u2019 stores systems </em>authorized by title 10, or to income from vending machines operated by the Veterans Canteen Service, or to income from vending machines not in direct competition with a blind vending facility at individual locations, installations, or facilities on Federal property the total of which at such individual locations, installations, or facilities does not exceed $3,000 annually. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">A DOD regulation, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 260.-3(i)(3)(i) (1985), interprets this exemption to exclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-8\">Income from vending machines operated by or for the military exchange or ships\u2019 stores systems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">A number of state agencies, TSCB being one, nevertheless, sought to share in the income of military exchanges. In May, 1979, TSCB filed a complaint with HEW which resulted in the convening of an arbitration panel, as provided in the statute (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d-l(a) (1982)), to adjudge the validity of its asserted right to a share of vending machine income of the military exchanges. TSCB argued that the statutory exemption covered only those vending machines of the military exchanges physically located within the four walls of military exchange stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">In a split decision, the arbitration panel of three held that the position of TSCB was the correct interpretation of the statute. <em>Texas (Texas State Commission for the Blind) v. Department of Defense, </em>No. RS 79-4 (Sept. 2, 1981). The majority of the arbitrators stated that the statutory language did not \u201cappear to be ambiguous.\u201d Slip op. at 11. \u201cWithin retail sales outlets,\u201d per the two arbitrators, would normally be understood to mean \u201cinside the four walls of an exchange system store.\u201d They then recognized that \u201cwithin\u201d could also mean \u201ca part of\u201d but concluded that this would render the phrase \u201cretail sales outlets\u201d meaningless. Slip op. at 11-12. On the other hand, the unequivocal legislative history against reaching income of the military exchanges raised questions in their minds as to the \u201cclarity\u201d of the language. Slip op. at 12. Ultimately, the two arbitrators resolved the question of the scope of the military exemption by reliance \u201con the general intent and approach of the legislation itself. These facts argue for a narrow reading of any limitation on opportunities for the blind.\u201d Slip op. at 15. To be exempt, they concluded, vending machines had to be \u201cwithin the four walls of an exchange system store\u201d but \u201cexpressly [did] not decide the issue of whether vend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>ing machines directly outside retail sales outlets are to be deemed inside or outside these stores.\u201d Slip op. at 18 and n. 27. The majority found final support for its position in regulations of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW), the principal agency under the Act charged with its administration. The majority did not rely on specific language in the HEW regulations (the regulations simply repeat the statute), but on HEW\u2019s refusal to amend its regulations to include the broad exemption language requested by DOD. Slip op. at 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">The dissenting arbitrator, in reaching his conclusion that DOD\u2019s position was correct, relied on the essentially different nature of the military exchanges from civilian employee welfare and recreation groups. Through the profits generated by military exchanges, essential governmental support services were provided for military service personnel and their families. He noted that extracts from Congressional Hearings and Reports of record dated 1949, 1953, 1970, 1972, 1974, 1978 and 1979 on non-Randolph-Sheppard legislation established that this arrangement had been recognized and approved by Congress as mutually beneficial to service personnel and to the public fisc. In his view, the legislative history unequivocally indicated that the military exchange systems were intended to be exempt and that that purpose could be given effect without a strained reading of the words of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">In the minority arbitrator\u2019s view, the statutory language had no \u201cplain meaning.\u201d Indeed, TSCB had conceded that the statutory words \u201cretail sales outlet\u201d and \u201cwithin\u201d were susceptible to more than one interpretation, and the majority opinion had expressly left open the question whether vending machines directly outside exchange stores should be deemed \u201cwithin\u201d such stores under the statute. The \u201cplain language\u201d of the statute seen by the majority, in his words, \u201cturned out not to be so plain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">Following the decision of the arbitration panel, on September 2, 1981, TSCB sought to obtain enforcement of the arbitration decision by the Department of Education (DOE), which had succeeded to HEW\u2019s authority under the Randolph-Sheppard Act. Act of October 17, 1979, Pub.L. No. 96-88, Title VI, 93 Stat. 696. In the interim, the State of Oklahoma had initiated litigation in federal district court against DOD on a comparable claim to military exchange income.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because of the conflict between the interpretations of the statute by two government departments (DOE and DOD), DOE referred the matter to the Department of Justice for resolution, as required by Executive Order No. 12,146, 3 C.F.R. \u00a7 409.411 (1980). On February 1, 1982, the Department of Justice advised that it resolved the conflict in favor of DOD. Therefore, the Department of Justice undertook to defend the Oklahoma suit on the basis of DOD\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">The decisions in the Oklahoma litigation are reported at <em>Oklahoma v. Weinberger, </em>582 F.Supp. 293 (W.D.Okla.1982), <em>aff'd, </em>741 F.2d 290 (10th Cir.1983). In sum, those courts held that the statutory language was not without some ambiguity as evidenced by the changes in HEW\u2019s position during the drafting of its own regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In their view, the proposed narrow interpretation was contrary to the intent of Congress, since limiting the exemption to vending machines physically within exchange stores would effectively deprive the exchanges of any exemption. On the other hand, the DOD regulation, endorsed by the Department of Justice, was consistent with the statutory language, the purpose of the exemption, and congressional intent in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>overall purpose of the Act. Thus, both the Oklahoma district court and the 10th Circuit held DOD\u2019s regulation valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">The suit by TSCB, seeking enforcement of the arbitration award in its favor, was filed in the United States Claims Court in March, 1983. The Claims Court rendered its decision, upholding the award, after the 10th Circuit decision, thereby creating a clear conflict in interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The Claims Court\u2019s decision turned particularly on the meaning of the statutory term \u201cwithin.\u201d The common usage of the term, per the court, \u201ccontemplates spatial boundaries.\u201d 6 Cl.Ct. at 738. The court discounted the significance of the legislative history relied on by the 10th Circuit since the Claims Court considered the history to be \u201cat odds\u201d with the concept of \u201cwithin physical boundaries.\u201d 6 Cl.Ct. at 740. A particular colloquy on the House floor between Messrs. Brademas and Sikes (which specifically supports DOD\u2019s interpretation) was discounted because it occurred after the Senate passed the bill and could not have been considered by that body.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 741. The Claims Court viewed other portions of the legislative history as supporting TSCB\u2019s position because of the use of the words \u201cretail outlet\u201d therein which, in its understanding, meant a store.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 740. The court also noted the Conference Report characterizing the exemption as excluding \u201ccertain locations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>citing S.Rep. No. 1270, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 35 (1974); H.R.Rep. No. 1457, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 35 (1974). Further, the legislative history\u2019s reference to the Marine Corps base in Albany, Georgia, as a \u201cmodel\u201d because of the number of blind vendors was seen to overcome DOD\u2019s argument that the income-sharing provisions were directed to the civilian groups only. 6 Cl.Ct. at 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">Finally, since the majority of vending machines on DOD-controlled property are operated by the exchange system, the congressional purpose of the act would be frustrated, per the Claims Court, if these were exempt. To avoid \u201cnullifying\u201d the statute, the court ruled in favor of TSCB. <em>Id. </em>at 741-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">The court certified the question of statutory interpretation to this court which accepted jurisdiction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">Upon consideration of the statutory language, the legislative history, the purpose of the exemption, and the status of the military exchanges as non-appropriated fund instrumentalities performing essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>governmental services, we conclude that the Claims Court erred in voiding the DOD regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">The task before us of interpreting the statutory language of the military exchanges exemption is succinctly summarized in <em>United States v. Turkette, </em>452 U.S. 576, 580, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 2527, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-5\">In determining the scope of a statute, we look first to its language. If the statutory language is unambiguous, in the absence of \u201ca clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary, that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.\u201d <em>Consumer Products Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108 [100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980). Of course, there is no errorless test for identifying or recognizing \u201cplain\u201d or \u201cunambiguous\u201d language. Also, authoritative administrative constructions should be given the deference to which they are entitled, absurd results are to be avoided and internal inconsistencies in the statute must be dealt with. <em>Trans Alaska Pipeline Rate Cases, </em>436 U.S. 631, 643 [98 S.Ct. 2053, 2061, 56 L.Ed.2d 591 (1978); <em>Commissioner v. Brown, </em>380 U.S. 563, 571 [85 S.Ct. 1162, 1166, 14 L.Ed.2d 75 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">In this case, the statement of the difficulty in identifying \u201cplain\u201d or \u201cunambiguous language\u201d is particularly apropos. Whether or not words of a statute are clear is itself not always clear. Even if the \u201ccommon\u201d understanding of \u201cwithin retail sales outlets\u201d were physically within the walls of a store, as the Claims Court held, that does not make the subject phrase \u201cplain\u201d or \u201cunambiguous.\u201d The determination of what usage of particular words is <em>common </em>must be rejected as an \u201cerrorless test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A1h\">Moreover, even where a statute is clear on a purely linguistic level, interpretation may be necessary if that interpretation does not do justice to the realities of the situation. As stated by the Supreme Court in <em>Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States, </em>143 U.S. 457, 459, 12 S.Ct. 511, 512, 36 L.Ed. 226 (1892), it is a \u201cfamiliar rule that a thing may be within the letter of the statute, but not within its spirit nor within the intention of its makers.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc., </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 106 S.Ct. 455, 461, 88 L.Ed.2d 419 (1985) (argument that it is \u201cunreasonable to classify \u2018lands,\u2019 wet or otherwise, as \u2018waters\u2019 \u201d is \u201csimplistic.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">Finally, the question in this case is not what interpretation this court would give to the statute were it the executive branch. The issue to be decided by this court is whether the statute is capable of more than one interpretation and whether the agency\u2019s interpretation is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">With these premises in mind, we turn to the statutory analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-13\">The arbitration award represents an amount estimated to be in excess of $10 million which must be paid from DOD current funds for <em>essential </em>government services for the military and their families. The brief review of legislative history noted above indicates that the funds Congress anticipated would be used for the state agencies for the blind were funds which could be diverted at <em>no cost </em>to the government and <em>no diminution </em>in essential government services. In keeping with that expectation, Congress over a period of 11 years has failed to appropriate any moneys to make up for the loss of exchange funds which the Claims Court held Congress intended to be transferred to the blind.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-14\">No rational reason can be advanced to conclude that Congress intended military personnel and their families to support the blind by giving up essential services. Indeed, the whole rationale behind the Claims Court\u2019s finding that it had jurisdiction over the claim here shows the special nature of the funds generated by the military exchange systems and differentiates such funds from those of private groups organized by civilian employees, such as employees\u2019 unions, which were clearly intend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>ed to be diverted to the blind.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As indicated, the funds of the latter-type of organizations were being used without any governmental control for whatever group activities their membership wished, such as flowers for the sick, birthday and wedding gifts, band uniforms, scholarships, furnishings for recreation rooms, and general social activities.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> No funding by Congress can be provided for such activities. In contrast, the only services financed by the funds of the military exchanges are child care centers, libraries, youth activities, gymnasiums, arts and crafts facilities and similar essential support services, which are furnished around the world for military personnel and families. Such services are of a nature for which appropriated funds are also used, indeed, have been provided by yearly Congressional appropriation. The amount of exchange-generated funds is taken into account in determining the amount of the appropriation. Precisely because of this interrelationship, the Claims Court found it had jurisdiction over this claim under the precedent of <em>United States v. General Electric Corp., </em>727 F.2d 1567, 1570 (Fed.Cir.1984) and cases cited therein. <em>Texas State Commission for the Blind v. U.S., </em>6 Cl.Ct. at 737-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">The Claims Court avoided what it called the \u201cdifficult question\u201d which would be raised were additional <em>appropriated </em>funds necessary as a result of its judgment (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304) by characterizing the judgment which will result as \u201cin the nature of a refund.\u201d 6 Cl.Ct. at 737. Under this theory, the judgment is then payable by DOD from the account which was credited with the revenues collected by the exchanges, or from other appropriated funds used by DOD to fund its morale, welfare and recreational programs.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">The concept that the judgment is a \u201crefund\u201d is not only a tortured theory, but also ignores the realities of the judgment. The judgment of the Claims Court would require an immediate cut in essential government services to satisfy the retroactive liability, as well as additional appropriations indefinitely into the future to provide essential government services which otherwise must be reduced. It is unlikely that such a major change in financing for, or in the amount of, military support services would have been undertaken by Congress without serious controversy. <em>There was none. </em>Moreover, if the bill were intended to have such an effect, it would have been taken up by appropriate finance and military affairs committees. <em>It was not. </em>Skirting these problems, the Senate Subcommittee on the Handicapped, which reported the bill, inserted a last-minute amendment exempting the military exchanges, and the Senate Report states unequivocally that the exchanges were wholly exempt. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 937, 93d Cong., 2nd Sess. 24 (1974). The House floor debate agreed with the Senate\u2019s understanding of the scope of the exemption. <em>See </em>120 Cong.Rec. 35,712 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">The 1973 statement submitted on behalf of <em>organizations for the blind, </em>in support of enactment of the 1974 amendments, was limited to the funds of civilian employee groups:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>The mandatory assignment of vending machine revenue would provide substantial sums of <em>new money </em>for the achievement of the purpose of the Randolph-Sheppard Act <em>without creating any hardships </em>for federal employees. Likewise, the mandatory assignment of this revenue to achieve the purpose of the Randolph-Sheppard Act <em>would place no burden upon the United States Treasury because the funds in question have not been collected by the government. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-4\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b930-5\">Over a period of several years, unions of federal employees have been increasingly successful in acquiring the possession and use of revenue from vending machines operated on federal property. This has been accomplished by the <em>cooperation </em>and <em>acquiescence </em>of the administrative branch of government through the recognition of de facto \u201cemployee welfare committees\u201d and \u201cemployee welfare funds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b930-6\"><em>Randolph-Sheppard Act for the Blind Amendments of1973: Hearings on S.2581 Before the Subcomm. on the Handicapped of the Senate Comm, on Labor and Public Welfare, </em>93d Cong., 1st Sess. 139 (1973) (statement of representatives of various organizations for the blind).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">The funds of such employee groups were attractive targets for diversion. No similar motive existed for reaching the earnings of military exchanges. Diversion of that income to state agencies for the blind would make no economic sense. It would simply be robbing Peter to pay Paul, and then appropriating money for Peter to make up for the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">The government does not argue here that the Randolph-Sheppard Act does not apply to military bases. There is no question that Congress sought more opportunities for blind vendors on all DOD properties, and other provisions of the 1974 amendments effectively reach DOD.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These include expansion of blind opportunities from vending \u201cstands\u201d to vending \u201cfacilities,\u201d e.g., cafeterias, including rooms with vending machines only; expansion of items to be sold; the granting of a mandatory \u201cpriority\u201d in allocating sites rather than merely a \u201cpreference\u201d to blind vendors; a requirement for sites for blind vendors in all new or renovated Federal buildings; and, of course, income sharing, which reaches the numerous non-military exchange groups within DOD. At this time, DOD is second only to GSA in implementing the program for the blind both in numbers of sites and in the amount of income turned over to the states for their programs.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">As initially drafted, that is, before the exemption, the bill amending the Act was so broad that it could be read to cover every vending machine on federal property. The circumstances surrounding insertion of the subsection providing exemptions were not conducive to precision in drafting.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The subsection simply appeared in a markup of the entire bill put before the January 29, 1974, executive meeting of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, Subcommittee on the Handicapped.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There was no opportunity for input from other committees or from DOD. The minutes of the meeting, which are in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>record, disclose that the <em>sole </em>topic of discussion was the continuing controversy with the Postal workers and other unions over diverting funds from their vending machines and what compromise (such as grandfathering) could be worked out to mollify them.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">On June 5, 1974, at another executive session, Senator Williams asked the sponsor of the bill, Senator Randolph, to explain it. Senator Randolph said the bill would enable more blind persons to become active so that they would not have to rely on relief or charity. \u201cThe moneys that should go to the blind are going to Federal employee unions.\u201d He hoped that \u201can accommodation would be reached with the unions.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Senator Dominick asked again \u201cTo whom does the income from vending machines now go?\u201d Mr. Robert Hum-phreys (of the staff) replied, \u201cTo the Employee Union Welfare Committees.\u201d Since Senator Randolph was the sponsor of the amendments, his explanation and that of the staff cannot be viewed as casual, off-the-cuff comments. The subcommittee was conscientiously restricting itself to reaching only funds of civilian organizations which were being withheld from the Treasury. The compromise worked out with the unions was that the blind would share in the vending machine income earned by private employee groups in exchange for Congress\u2019 sanctioning the retention of the balance by such private groups. There was no similar compromise necessary with respect to exchange funds inasmuch as the retention of exchange funds had for years been approved and the exchanges were recognized as official government instrumentalities.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-9\">On June 17, 1974, the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare issued Senate Report 93-937, which is the principal Congressional report on the 1974 amendments. The Senate Report interprets the exemption to apply to all exchange operated machines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-10\">Subsection (d) exempts certain activities from vending machine income assignment. Both military exchange systems and the Veterans Canteen Service operate under specific statutory authority, and are thus, as a matter of policy, excluded.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">S.Rep. No. 937, <em>supra, </em>at 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">A House version of the bill had been passed as part of H.R. 14225 on May 21, 1974; the Senate version on September 10, 1974. In presenting the conference version to the House for final passage, Mr. Brade-mas, floor manager of the bill and Chairman of the House Select Education Subcommittee, gave the following explanation of the military exchange exemption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-13\">Other provisions of the conference report, Mr. Speaker, address the question of the assignment of vending machine income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b931-14\">Briefly, this is what the bill would do: First. One hundred percent of income from machines in direct competition with a vendor, and 50 percent of income from machines not in direct competition shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>accrue to blind vendors and their state licensing agencies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-4\">Second. At facilities where at least 50 percent of the hours worked are outside normal working hours, 30 percent of income from vending machines shall accrue to the vendors; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-5\">Third. Facilities with less than $3,000 annual vending machine income are totally exempt, as are retail military sales outlets and the Veterans Canteen Service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-6\">Mr. Speaker, the conferees are confident that these provisions will help blind vendors and adequately protect the rights of the Government and its employees with respect to the availability at all times of vending facilities and the assignment of income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-7\">Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate my friend in the other body, Senator Randolph, for his persistence in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Mr. Sikes, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, sought explicit confirmation of the extent of that exemption and the following exchange occurred between them:<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-9\">Mr. SIKES. <em>I would like the distinguished subcommittee chairman to verify for the record, that this provision exempts from the revenue-sharing plan all those vending machines which are operated by the military post exchanges, Navy exchanges, officer and enlisted messes, and so forth.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-10\">As you are aware, the profits from those vending machines are utilized by the services to finance such worthwhile endeavors as the base libraries, the youth activities, the gymnasium, and other sports activities, hobby shops and motion picture programs, ashore and afloat. The servicemen finance these programs themselves through the revenues collected in the retail sales outlet systems as I have mentioned. <em>To require that these revenues be shared might well necessitate the appropriation of additional funds for the defense budget. Since work in the fiscal year 1975 defense appropriations bill has been completed, the effect would be to cut off these needed programs without support.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-14\">\n<em>Would the gentleman confirm for me the fact that it is the intent that this paragraph shall not apply to the military services, and that this is in keeping with the language on page 24 of the Senate report [S.Rept. No. 93-937] which is more specific on this issue that [sic] is the conference report?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-15\">Mr. BRADEMAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for his fine remarks about this legislation. <em>I am pleased to tell the gentleman that the answer to both his questions is \u201cYes.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-16\">120 Cong.Rec. 35,712 (Oct. 16, 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-17\">Immediately following that exchange, the House passed the bill. It could not be clearer that Congress did not intend to cut back on funds for the military or to make additional appropriations as a result of 1974 Randolph-Sheppard amendments. The exemption for the exchanges was intended by both the Senate and the House to be complete. The Claims Court opined that the colloquy\u2019s:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-18\">significance is further diminished by the fact that it occurred on the House floor several weeks <em>after </em>the Senate passed the legislation and several days <em>after </em>the Senate unanimously agreed to the Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ference Report. Clearly, one cannot say that the Senators who voted for the language in issue did so with any understanding of the meaning reflected in this subsequent colloquy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">6 Cl.Ct. at 741 (citations omitted). The Claims Court\u2019s analysis discounts the Senate\u2019s own legislative history. The House was adopting the Senate\u2019s understanding not vice versa. In any event, because of a presidential veto, Congress passed the bill again.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Mr. Brademas\u2019s explanation, confirmed by the colloquy, thus, is a major factor in determining the intent of both houses, as Mr. Brademas was not simply \u201canother member\u201d but the floor manager and chairman of the sponsoring committee whose remarks are entitled to particular weight. <em>See Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>470 U.S. 768, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">All legislative history expressly addressing the possible diversion of income from the exchanges indicates that income was to be exempt. The records contain not even a suggestion of cutting funds for essential military services or making up the loss with additional appropriations. The exchanges simply were not to be affected, as the blind organizations themselves represented. The portions of the congressional report, relied on by the Claims Court (and accepted by the dissent) as support for its view, do not, in fact, indicate a contrary purpose. Rather, the portions were deemed supportive to its theory that \u201cwithin retail sales outlets\u201d must be given a <em>spatial </em>connotation, as a matter of linguistics. Further, Congressional approval of the \u201cmodel\u201d Marine Corps base was made with reference to providing <em>additional sites </em>for blind vendors, not with reference to income-sharing. The Marine Corps base was not then sharing income generated by exchanges and never has.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-9\">\n<em>HEW\u2019s Interpretation of the Exemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AoW4\">HEW had responsibility for coordinating the administration of the Act among the government agencies and was to draft regulations in consultation with them. There was substantial dispute between HEW and DOD as to the extent of the exemption provided for the military. None of the dispute, however, initially concerned the exemption of military exchanges. HEW agreed these organizations were exempt. Principally the dispute was over an exemption for enlisted and officers\u2019 <em>messes </em>(not part of the exchanges). DOD pressed for such an exemption on the basis of the legislative history despite the absence of any language in the statute directed to the <em>messes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">HEW vacillated on allowing this exemption. The negotiations between HEW and DOD and the series of proposed HEW draft regulations, as well as correspondence discussed below, confirm that the HEW position that military exchange income was to be diverted to the blind was a change from its original interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-11\">That the scope of the military exemption was not \u201cplain\u201d to HEW from the statutory language is evidenced by the various drafts of regulations which HEW considered over a period of two years. One of the first HEW drafts, dated March 20, 1975, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-12\">[T]he provisions of this section shall not apply to income from <em>vending machines </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number><em>under the control of post exchange or ships\u2019 stores systems </em>authorized under Title 10, United States Code, or to Department of Defense morale, welfare, and recreation activities <em>or to Department of Defense clubs, messes, civilian restaurant and welfare </em>funds____ [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">This version continued through several drafts. An HEW memorandum dated June 2, 1975, clarified HEW\u2019s position with respect to DOD civilian employee funds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqVY\">However, the latest revision of the proposed regulation proposed by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) contains an exemption for these activities in recognition of legislative history (referring to discussions between Mr. Brademas and Mr. Sikes on October 18, 1974). While it is realized that this exemption could be interpreted to include both military and civilian morale, welfare, and recreation activities, HEW officials drafting the implementing regulation stated that such <em>exclusion is not intended to provide relief for civilian nonappropriated fund </em>activities____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-8\">The latest revision of the proposed regulation is being circulated within HEW with its <em>expected publication </em>in the Federal Register <em>in about 60 days. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">The proposed regulation was not, however, published and the next version in July, 1975, while continuing the exemption for the exchanges, eliminated the exemption for officer and enlisted messes and civilian groups. This version read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-10\">The provisions of this section shall not apply to income from vending machines under the control of post exchange or ships\u2019 stores systems authorized under Title 10 of the United States Code____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b934-12\">DOD pressed for revision to exclude all vending machines in military base communities. The first suggestion by HEW that the exchange income was not exempt appears to have been made in October, 1975. DOD was continuing at that time to argue that messes and civilian DOD groups on military bases should be excluded. On December 23, 1975, HEW published proposed regulations simply repeating the statutory language with no interpretation of what the language meant. 40 Fed.Reg. 59,408, 59,414 (1975). DOD and HEW continued their negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-16\">On April 26, 1976, Congressman Sikes wrote Secretary Matthews of HEW, confirming that the intent of Congress was to exempt the military exchanges, stating: \u201cAlthough the law was designed to expand opportunities for blind persons, it was not intended to cripple certain Armed Forces morale and welfare activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-17\">At an April 28, 1976, meeting with DOD, HEW personnel proposed defining \u201cvending machine\u201d in the regulations to exclude any \u201cmachines from which the revenue accrues to the Federal Government for credit to the Federal Government.\u201d HEW verified that the intent of this change was to exempt DOD non-appropriated fund instru-mentalities.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-18\">DOD then wrote HEW as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b934-19\">The revised wording of Section 1369.1(y) of the proposed regulations furnished to the attendees of the 28 April meeting and your <em>Mr. Shay\u2019s explanation that the revised wording is intended to accomplish the purpose of exempting vending machine income of Department of Defense (DOD) nonappropriat-ed fund instrumentalities (NAFIs) </em>from the income-sharing provisions of the Amendments have, of course, <em>greatly eased our concern. </em>Assuming that the provisions of said Section 1369.1(y) are issued as revised, it would appear that the <em>Congressional intent </em>reflected in the 16 October 1974 exchange between Congressman Brademas and Congressman Sikes on the House floor will have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>been appropriately incorporated in the HEW regulations. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">On May 11, 1976, Secretary Matthews answered Congressman Sikes\u2019 letter, reassuring him that HEW appreciated his clarification of congressional intent with respect to officers and enlisted messes and that HEW was working closely with DOD. No mention was made of HEW\u2019s intention to deny exemption to income from exchange vending machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">In June, 1976, Congressman Brademas wrote Congressman Sikes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-6\">[T]he problem with the Randolph-Sheppard Act proposed regulations which you recently brought to my attention ... <em>appears to be solved.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-7\">The <em>Department of Health, </em>Education and Welfare <em>has advised my subcommittee that the interpretation </em>which we agreed upon in our colloquy on the House floor <em>would be adhered to. </em>Needless to say, I am glad that DHEW had decided to follow the intent of Congress in formulating its regulations. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">However, no regulations \u201cconforming\u201d to the intent of Congress were issued and HEW ceased consultation with DOD.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">On March 23, 1977, HEW published final regulations which were exhaustive in other details but, with respect to the military exemption, did little more than repeat the statutory language. 42 Fed.Reg. 15,802-17 (1977), now 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.32 (1985).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Interestingly, the preamble to the regulations, in explaining why officers and enlisted messes were not considered exempt, states that the act \u201climits exemptions from the income sharing requirements <em>to systems authorized </em>under Title 10 of the United States Code____\u201d (Emphasis added.) 42 Fed.Reg. at 15,807. To exclude <em>messes </em>would, HEW stated, require statutory clarification despite their \u201clinkage to Title 10.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, HEW did exempt (without an explicit statutory basis) stamp vending machine, copy machines, pay telephones, coin-operated game machines, juke boxes and certain NASA and National Park Service concessions, 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.30 (1985), citing such reasons as \u201cvending that is uniquely supportive of the Postal Service mission,\u201d too \u201csignificant\u201d a change, probable \u201cCongressional intent,\u201d and \u201cnot traditionally found in blind operated vending facilities.\u201d 42 Fed.Reg. at 15,806.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">On July 7, 1977, DOD published its own proposed regulations which stated flatly that income sharing did \u201cnot apply to: Income from vending machines operated by or for the military exchanges or ships\u2019 stores systems.\u201d 42 Fed.Reg. 34,895 (1977). The identical provision was included in DOD\u2019s final regulations. 43 Fed.Reg. 25,337, 25,341 (June 12, 1978), now 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 260.3(i)(3)(i) (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">The agencies were then at logger-heads. DOD attempted to get clarifying amendments before Congress. As acknowledged in the majority decision of the arbitrators:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYC9\">It should be noted, further, that DOD\u2019s inability to convince Congress to pass an amendment making clear the broad nature of the exemption is not helpful in assessing Congressional intention since HEW and its successor, the Department of Education, has, through the Office of Management and Budget, effectively blocked this legislation from being considered by Congress.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">In 1979, HEW proposed to DOD that the Department of Justice resolve the conflict between the agencies, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-16\">Since the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare believes that only income generated <em>within </em>retail sales outlets is exempt, we believe that at this time, as suggested at the meeting held by the Office of Management and Budget, this issue of statutory construction is appropriate for referral to the Department of Justice for resolution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-17\">However, it was not until the Oklahoma litigation that the matter was referred to the Department of Justice for resolution of the conflicting HEW/DOD interpretations. Justice upheld DOD. HEW acknowledges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>that it is bound by Justice\u2019s ruling and no longer advances its former unpublished interpretation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Under these circumstances, there is no basis for deference to the interpretation by HEW. Internally, HEW has vacillated. Its published regulations have <em>never </em>set forth an interpretation of the statutory language. Its late-adopted private interpretation was never published or given effect. It is bound by Justice\u2019s interpretation. And, finally, in the face of Justice\u2019s interpretation, which conflicted with HEW\u2019s, HEW has found it unnecessary to <em>revise </em>its regulations. This is understandable since HEW\u2019s regulations have never done more than repeat the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">\n<em>The Statutory Purpose</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">The Claims Court looked to the overall purpose of the legislation and concluded that an exemption for the exchanges would leave \u201clittle or no opportunity\u201d for blind vendors on DOD installations since the majority of vending machines were operated by the- exchanges. That finding is clearly erroneous in view of DOD\u2019s large contributions to state agencies for the blind.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">In any event, the statutory purpose to be considered here is not simply the purpose of the legislation, but the purpose of the <em>exemption. </em>That exemption was designed to keep the financial support of essential services by the exchanges intact so that Congress need not appropriate additional funds. <em>Congress expected </em>the exchange income to continue to supplement <em>essential </em>programs approved by Congress. Senator Randolph, the blind groups, Mr. Brademas, Mr. Sikes, and both chambers of Congress all agreed on this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">\n<em>TV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">\n<em>The Statutory Language</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AY8\">Given the congressional purpose of the exemption, the question becomes whether the language can reasonably be interpreted, as in DOD\u2019s regulation, to effectuate that purpose. We conclude that the statutory language has sufficient ambiguity to make DOD\u2019s interpretation reasonable.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">The first phrase which must be looked at is \u201cincome from vending machines.\u201d \u201cVending machine income\u201d requires interpretation, as reflected by the definitions of these terms in HEW regulations setting out exclusions for vending machines of various types and at certain of the National Park Service and NASA facilities. 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 395.30 (1985). No statutory provision authorizes these exemptions. HEW simply deemed it necessary and within its power to exclude certain categories of vending machine income which came within the literal words of the statute but were not, in HEW\u2019s view, within its intended scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-13\">\u201cWithin retail sales outlets\u201d is not without some ambiguity. \u201cWithin\u201d can mean \u201ca part of\u201d a system as well as \u201cinside\u201d a structure. \u201cRetail sales outlets\u201d need not mean \u201cstores.\u201d The military exchanges operate movie theatres and other recreation facilities, which easily fall within the term \u201cretail sales outlets\u201d and are not \u201cstores.\u201d Indeed, an area with only vending machines has become a typical \u201cretail sales outlet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b936-14\">TSCB argues that the phrase \u201cwithin retail sales outlets\u201d, is surplusage if DOD\u2019s interpretation is accepted.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> By the same token, the words \u201cunder the control\u201d are surplusage under the contrary interpretation. No real significance can be attached to either argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>TSCB also argues that Congress narrowly drafted the exchange exemptions in comparison with the Veterans Canteen Service exemption. However, the Canteen Service does not have retail outlets which generate a surplus to be used for other services. It simply provides articles and services in veterans hospitals and any surplus income is required by statute to be turned in to the Treasury. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4201. Thus, this difference in exemption language can be explained. In any event, both the Senate and the House said that <em>both </em>were intended to be wholly exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">This parsing of sentences is a meaningless exercise here. Undoubtedly, in some instances where statutory language has been finely tuned to cover or to exclude, it is important to consider each word and its relationship to others with great care. This statutory provision was not drawn with great care or precision. For example, the reference to the exchanges systems being authorized by Title 10 is erroneous. <em>See supra </em>note 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">We do not have an instance here where the words of an exemption were selected after debate over its scope. Indeed, in light of the legislative history, had no exemption been specifically granted, an interpretation by regulation to exclude the military exchanges from the definition of \u201cvending machine income\u201d\u2014which HEW has concluded is proper for other agencies\u2014would appear appropriate. The language selected to insure that the military exchanges were unquestionably exempt \u201crepresents an instance of inartful drafting rather than the intentional drawing of a subtle distinction.\u201d <em>Exxon Corp. v. Hunt, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 106 S.Ct. 1103, 1113, 89 L.Ed.2d 364 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">\u201cAn agency\u2019s construction of a statute it is charged with enforcing is entitled to deference if it is reasonable and not in conflict with the expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>United States v. Riverside Bay-view Homes, Inc., </em>106 S.Ct. at 461. After considering the ambiguities in the statutory language, the legislative history supporting DOD\u2019s position, the purpose of the exemption, and the status of the military exchanges as non-appropriated fund instru-mentalities performing essential government services, we are convinced that DOD\u2019s regulation is reasonable and is not in conflict with the intent of Congress as expressed in the statute. For the foregoing reasons, we agree with the 10th Circuit that DOD\u2019s regulation is not void. The judgment of the Claims Court is reversed.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b924-12\">. 6 Cl.Ct. 730 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b924-16\">.

That the Claims Court was incorrect on this point is analyzed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b927-8\">. The court quoted from the Senate Report, S.Rep.

No. 937 at 30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b927-9\">. Faced with the 10th Circuit decision, TSCB sought to prevent the government from raising any legal question attacking the merits of the award. TSCB contended that the Claims Court lacked \"jurisdiction\" to consider such a defense for two reasons: (1) the Act provides for a right to appeal from an arbitration award only specifically in favor of the claimant, and (2) alternatively, the government\u2019s challenge should be considered barred by a statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">We need not decide whether the U.S. could have taken an appeal from the award. The issue is whether the presence of a specific provision in the Act allowing appeal by the claimant bars the U.S., by implication, from defending against enforcement of the award on the ground that the award is not authorized by statute. As a matter of statutory interpretation, we hold that it does not. With respect to the assertion of a bar based on a statute of limitations, none is applicable here against the United States. <em>United States v. Summerlin, </em>310 U.S. 414, 416, 60 S.Ct. 1019, 1020, 84 L.Ed. 1283 (1940) (United States is not bound by state statutes of limitations); <em>Guaranty Trust Co. v.

Finally, TSCB makes no argument that the government is improperly making a collateral attack on the arbitration award. In this connection, we note that the parties agreed before the arbitration panel that \"the meaning of the exemption will be finally resolved by the courts.\u201d Accordingly, we hold that the Claims Court properly considered the issue of the legality of the award under the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b929-5\">.

The record shows DOD contributed $784,613 to state blind agencies in 1983; $729,471 in 1981. The dissent errs in its assertion that DOD can somehow keep blind vendors off military bases because of the subject exemption. The exemption has no applicability to the mandatory requirement to provide sites for blind vendors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b930-14\">. <em>See infra </em>note 16 and section IV.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b930-15\">. The exemption may have been in response to a brief comment by Lieutenant General Benade of DOD during a 1973 hearing, but contrary to the dissent, there is no evidence of a \"compromise\u201d with respect to the military exchanges. Even TSCB does not so assert. All evidence is that the exchanges were to be entirely exempt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b931-6\">.

Technically the exchanges and ships\u2019 stores systems are not \"authorized by title 10\u201d as stated in the statute, but are established by the Secretary of Defense under general authority to regulate the department. Although there were earlier federal court cases dealing with the exchange activities and their employees, the most significant decision is <em>Standard Oil Company of California v. Johnson, </em>316 U.S. 481, 485, 62 S.Ct. 1168, 1170, 86 L.Ed. 1611 (1942), in which the Supreme Court stated, \u201c[W]e conclude that post exchanges, as now operated, are arms of the government deemed by it essential for the performance of government functions. They are integral parts of the War Department, share in fulfilling the duties entrusted to it, and partake of whatever immunities it may have under the constitution and federal statutes.\" The court further stated, \"[t]hat the establishment and control of post exchanges have been in accordance with regulations rather than specific statutory directions does not alter their status, for authorized War Department regulations have the force of law.\u201d 316 U.S. at 484, 62 S.Ct. at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">This misstatement in the statute is symptomatic of its inherent flaws which must be overlooked to carry out congressional intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b932-11\">. The dissent's comments on lack of a quorum are entertaining but legally in error. A quorum was established by a count of the members prior to debate on the conference report. Under House procedures a quorum is deemed present at all times until it is determined by a count of the House on a proper point of order that no quorum is present. Further, a member may make the point of order that no quorum is present whether there is, in fact, a quorum present or not. <em>See </em>VI C. Cannon, Cannon\u2019s Precedents of the House of Representatives, 805, 853 (1935). However, the question of a quorum cannot be raised once established by vote until \u201cthe Speaker has put the pending motion or proposition to a vote.\" H.Rep. Rule XV 6(e)(1); <em>see abo </em>W. Oleszek, Congressional Procedures and the Policy Process, 125-26 (2d ed. 1984). Thus, during the debate, a quorum was legally present under House rules and the number of members present may, in fact, have constituted a quorum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b933-7\">. Following initial passage, President Ford vetoed the bill, the veto was overridden. However, the President returned the bill to Congress claiming that the veto was a pocket veto (which could not be overriden) and not a return veto. Congress\u2019 override was based on the assumption that the veto was a return veto. To eliminate uncertainty, both the House and Senate again passed a bill with the identical military exchange exemption, S.4194, on November 26, 1974. <em>See </em>S.Rep.

The dissent, despite its length, has only one argument: the statutory language is unambiguous. If the slightest ambiguity were to be acknowledged by the dissent, its position crumbles away. In stark contrast, HEW, DOD, Justice, the three arbitrators, the Oklahoma district court and the judges of the Tenth Circuit all found the language subject to various interpretations. If the dissent did not distort the Tenth Circuit opinion on this point, the dissent would have no basis for characterizing our sister circuit\u2019s reasoning as \"weak.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b937-14\">DAVIS, Circuit Judge, with whom MAR-KEY, Chief Judge, and FRIEDMAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Avo\">join, concurring in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-15\">This case presents, in acute form, the recurrent problem of the tension between statutory language and legislative history. I write separately because, for me, the plurality opinion overstresses the alleged \u201cambiguity\u201d of the statute, while the dissenters underplay the role of the legislative history. My general position is that pertinent legislative history is never wholly irrelevant in the construction of a statute but that the interrelationship of that history with the statutory text follows a continuous spectrum measuring the strength of the language, on the one hand, and the strength of the history, on the other. The more compelling and definitive the words are, the less controlling the legislative history; conversely, the less compelling and definite the language, the more controlling the history to the extent of its strength.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>In this particular instance, my judgment is that Congress\u2019 words can permissibly accommodate a certain degree of breadth which is required by the very strong legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">I start with the statutory words. If there were no pertinent legislative history (or if it were amorphous or weak) I would certainly adopt the appellees\u2019 reading. To me, the normal meaning of section 107d-3(d) (exempting \u201cincome from vending machines <em>within the retail sales outlets </em>under the control of exchange or ships\u2019 stores systems authorized by title 10\") (emphasis added) covers only vending machines within post exchange stores (or perhaps immediately outside and adjacent to those facilities). However, that wording is not as precise or as definite as if the statute reached only vending machines <em>\u201cinside\u201d </em>exchange stores or ships\u2019 stores; rather, the words Congress actually <em>used\u2014\u201cwithin </em>the retail sales <em>outlets </em>under the control of [military] exchange ... <em>systems </em>\u201d (emphasis added)\u2014can have a wider reach and potentially be read, without necessarily turning white into black, as including all vending machines operated by the military exchange systems. As I have said, I would not take that course unless the legislative history compelled (or very strongly supported) that broader interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">I agree with the plurality\u2019s view of the statute because, as I see it, the germane legislative history is very strong and points directly to the wider construction. The colloquy, on the floor of the House of Representatives, between Congressman Brade-mas and Congressman Sikes<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> inescapably states that all vending machines operated by the military exchanges are exempt from the income sharing provision. This colloquy was not simply a floor exchange between two individual, ordinary members of the House. Congressman Brademas was Chairman of the House Select Education Subcommittee and floor manager of the very bill containing the disputed language; Congressman Sikes was Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, obviously interested in the military exchange systems. Each spoke in that official capacity, and I think their joint views represented the position of their two committees. As the plurality opinion points out, the bill was passed by both Houses of Congress after the Sikes-Brademas colloquy. To me there is very little doubt that the colloquy had a primary role in the enacting of. this amendment to the Randolph-Sheppard Act\u2014 equivalent in essence to a formal statement in a committee report. In fact Congressman Brademas referred (in June 1976 at the time the Department of Health, Education and Welfare was drafting its regulations) to the Sikes-Brademas exchange as representing \u201cthe intent of Congress\u201d <em>(see </em>plurality opinion, <em>supra, </em>p. 413). There is nothing in the remainder of the legislative history which contradicts or conflicts with the Sikes-Brademas colloquy; on the contrary, the relevant part of the Senate Report (S.Rep. No. 937, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. 24 (1974)) seems in its generality to exempt all vending machines operated by military exchange systems. The sum of it, for me, is that the significant legislators concerned with the precise question before us deliberately and knowingly chose the military version of the meaning of the disputed phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">I add, however, that I disassociate myself from the emphasis in the plurality opinion on the position of the Department of Justice as relevant to this interpretive issue. As the main dissent points out, the statute expressly gives to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services (HHS)) the power to promulgate regulations necessary to assure compliance with the provision before us (20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d-3(g))\u2014not to the Department of Justice or to the Department of Defense. The fact is, though, that the current HHS regulations are of no help <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>because they do not deal at all with the dispute we are asked to resolve; an internal or unpublished HHS position (not promulgated in a regulation) does not have the status of a proper regulation, and need not be considered. In a word, there is now no regulation of which account should be taken in construing the statute.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-17\">. I believe my general position does not contravene any established or definitive Supreme Court rule. There are many different variations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>in Supreme Court opinions on the use of legislative history, but in my understanding no definitive rule has emerged either that there are certain instances in which legislative history should not be considered at all, or that such history should always be taken into account.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b938-12\">.

The majority also relies on a colloquy which took place on the House floor <em>when a quorum was not present. </em>On this tenuous basis, the majority established \u201ccongressional purpose\u201d in the face of the admittedly clear language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-14\">\n<em>Plain Meaning of Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b939-15\">I can see nothing ambiguous or superfluous in the statutory exemption for \u201cincome from vending machines within retail sales outlets under the control of exchange or ships\u2019 stores systems.\u201d HEW, GAO, the arbitration panel, and the Claims Court reached the only possible conclusion when they decided that vending machines which are <em>not </em>within such retail sales outlets are <em>not </em>exempt from income sharing.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-16\">The majority, at the urging of DOD, has rewritten the statute by deleting the words \u201cwithin retail sales outlets\u201d from Congress\u2019 own language. The statutory exemption, as rewritten by the majority, now reads: \u201cincome from vending machines under the control of exchange or ships\u2019 stores systems.\u201d Only after rewriting the statute is it possible to conclude that the exemption covers <em>all </em>vending machines operated by the military exchanges, without regard to the machines\u2019 location.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-17\">The word \u201cambiguity\u201d has been defined as \u201cuncertainty of meaning\u201d or \u201cadmitting of two or more meanings.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As for \u201cuncertainty of meaning,\u201d it is not difficult to understand \u201cwithin retail sales outlets\u201d as having the certain meaning \u201cinside the four walls of an exchange system store\u201d (commonly known as \u201cthe PX\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As for \u201cadmitting of two or more meanings,\u201d the majority never reveals what <em>other </em>meaning \u201cwithin retail sales outlets\u201d has.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-18\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the Tenth Circuit did not hold or even imply that the statute was at all ambiguous. The</p>\n<p id=\"b940-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Tenth Circuit stated in <em>Oklahoma v. Wein-berger: </em><footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-4\">We agree with DHS [Department of Health and Services of the State of Oklahoma] that a literal reading of the exception limits the exception from revenue sharing only to \u201cvending machines <em>within </em>retail sales outlets under the control of exchange or ships\u2019 store systems.\u201d * * [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Similarly, the district court in <em>Oklahoma </em>found that \u201c[^ejection of the \u2018plain meaning' of the exemption\u201d was necessary because: <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-6\">Following the literal meaning of the words would, in this case, compel concurrence with the plaintiff\u2019s position as \u201cvending machines within retail sales outlets\u201d would appear to refer to machines within an exchange store. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">Rather, the rationale of the Tenth Circuit and the Western District of Oklahoma was that:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-8\">a court has \u201csome [\u2018]seope for adopting a restricted rather than a literal or usual meaning of its words where acceptance of that meaning would lead to absurd results ... or would thwart the obvious purpose of the statute[.\u2019] ...\u201d * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">I agree with the Tenth Circuit that the statute is unambiguous. But notwithstanding my great respect for the Tenth Circuit, I cannot agree that the literal meaning of the words would lead to \u201cabsurd results\u201d or \u201cthwart the obvious purpose of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-19\">A. <em>Clear, Customary Meaning.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-20\">Section 107d-3(d) states:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axau\">(d) Income from vending machines in certain locations excepted</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"acv-dedup-0\">Subsections (a) and (b)(1) of this section shall not apply [1] to income from vending machines within retail sales outlets under the control of exchange or ships\u2019 stores systems authorized by title 10, or [2] to income from vending machines operated by the [V]eterans Canteen Service * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-21\">This section creates distinct exemptions: one for the exchange systems and another for the veterans canteen service.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-22\">The exemption provided for the exchange systems, unlike the one provided for the canteen system, contains <em>two </em>phrases of modification. Not only must the machines be \u201cunder the control of\u201d the exchange system, the machines must also be \u201cwithin [its] retail sales outlets.\u201d As the Claims Court correctly determined, the plain and customary meaning of the word \u201cwithin\u201d clearly connotes spatial boundaries.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The common usage of the word \u201cwithin\u201d is \u201cto indicate enclosure or containment.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, as the majority concedes, the customary meaning of \u201cwithin retail sales outlets\u201d is \u201cphysically within the walls of a store.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b940-23\">DOD argues that \u201cwithin\u201d implies more than just \u201ccontained in\u201d and that the exemption protects all machines operated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the military exchanges.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> DOD contends that \u201cwithin\u201d can mean something other than <em>spatial </em>proximity\u2014for example when used to mean \u201cwithin the law.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">In the context of section 107d-3(d), DOD\u2019s interpretation would require this court to hold that \u201cwithin\u201d really means \u201cwithin and without.\u201d DOD\u2019s interpretation completely reads out of the statute the phrase \u201cwithin retail sales outlets.\u201d Basie principles of statutory construction require that effect should be given to every word of the statute so that no part will be rendered meaningless.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The two distinct phrases of modification in the statute clearly suggest that vending machines must be more than \u201cunder the control of\u201d the military exchanges. The machines must also be \u201cwithin [a] retail sales outlet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">No definition for \u201cwithin\u201d urged by DOD makes sense when read in the context of section 107d-3(d). If Congress had simply meant \u201cunder the control of\u201d the military exchanges, it would not have included the phrase \u201cwithin retail sales outlets\u201d in the statute at all. DOD considers the word \u201cwithin\u201d in isolation and discusses the almost metaphorical meanings that it can take on in other contexts. As this court has recently explained, statutory words \u201ccannot be considered in a vacuum. We sit to interpret a statute, not a word.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">The majority also accepts DOD\u2019s argument that the phrase \u201cretail sales outlet\u201d can describe \u201ca cluster of vending machines or even a single vending machine\u201d and that the statute, thereby, exempts all machines. The first error in this strained interpretation is that it is contrary to the accepted meaning of the word \u201coutlet.\u201d The term outlet has a common, everyday meaning of \u201ca market for a commodity\u201d or \u201ca retail store.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is well settled that unless Congress has clearly indicated a contrary meaning, a word\u2019s customary, everyday meaning is favored.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">A second problem with DOD\u2019s construction of the phrase \u201cretail sales outlet\u201d is that, in context, it makes the statute meaningless. By equating a vending machine with a \u201cretail sales outlet,\u201d DOD construes the statute to exempt \u201cincome from vending machines within vending machines.\u201d Such a bootstrapped definition would read all meaning out of the exemption. The Claims Court reached the correct interpretation by accounting for all of the words in the statute, without nullifying any of its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">B. <em>Veterans Canteen Service Exemption.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-14\">DOD\u2019s construction of the statute is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>The literal words of the statute may fairly be read as exempting from income sharing <em>any vending machine </em>that is a part of [\u201cwithin\u201d] a network of sales facilities [\u201cretail sales outlets\u201d] <em>operated by or for a military exchange. </em>* * * [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Thus, DOD is really arguing to be treated like the veterans canteen service. Section 107d-3(d) specifically exempts \u201cvending machines <em>operated by </em>the Veterans Canteen Service\u201d (emphasis supplied). The wording of the exemption for the canteen service proves two things. First, Congress knew how to draft the exact exemption that DOD wants, because it did so in the very next clause. Second, this exemption proves that Congress <em>only </em>wanted to provide this broad exemption (encompassing all machines, regardless of location) to the veterans canteen service.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">\n<em>Legislative History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Where the words of a statute are clear, there is no need to review the legislative history.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> A corollary is that the legislative history cannot be used to create ambiguity where there is none in the statute.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">The majority has placed great reliance on excerpts from the legislative history; how-</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">ever, other portions of the same reports give a clear indication that Congress fully addressed a much broader problem than that spotlighted by the majority. In addressing that part of the majority opinion, the words of our predecessor court, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, give us guidance:<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">We have dwelt at some length upon this phase of the case not because we regard the statute as ambiguous, because we do not so regard it, but out of respect for the views of those who think otherwise. Even if we be in error as to this, however, we do not regard such legislative history as has been cited here controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-14\">A. <em>Purpose of the Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-15\">The majority unacceptably narrows the purpose of the act by focusing only on \u201ccivilian employee groups.\u201d Thus, the majority ignores Congress\u2019 language reaching \u201call Federal property,\u201d including DOD and military bases in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-16\">Notwithstanding the appeal of arguments made on behalf of the military, the Randolph-Sheppard Act is primarily legislation in support of the blind. The primary purpose of Congress was to create a 2-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>pronged approach to establish a <em>priority </em>for blind vendors. First, Congress ordered that one or more blind vending stands must be placed on <em>all federal property.</em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Congress recognized, however, that since 1936 the act had already required a \u201cpreference\u201d for blind vending <em>stands </em>on all federal property. The act had been unsuccessful because of competition from vending machines:<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-4\">Blind vendors collectively have been confronted with obstacles at virtually every turn. Competition from automatic vending machines has increasingly threatened to suffocate the blind vendor program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The act had been amended in 1954 to require the assignment of vending machine income to blind vendors, where vending machines were in direct competition with the blind:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-6\">The provision was believed necessary due to the unanticipated growth of automatic vending machines on Federal property, which were beginning to affect blind vendor operations. Unfortunately, that language did not have the desired effect of protecting the livelihood of blind vendors. On the contrary, in the intervening twenty years since the enactment of the provision, the automatic vending machine has been vastly improved, the kinds of food and other merchandise sold through such machines have greatly expanded, and the numbers of machines on Federal property have grown exponentially. Not only has the existing language failed to protect the blind vendor, in many cases the language has been disregarded, and vending machines now constitute a major threat both to the livelihood of individual blind licensees and to the growth of the program as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">The existing law in 1974 <em>already </em>required a preference for blind vendors on military bases. Yet there were only 46 blind vending stands on 490 military bases.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Congress was forced to take decisive action to achieve its stated goal of one or more blind vendors on <em>every </em>military base.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">Thus, Congress created the second prong, called \u201cincome sharing\u201d to \u201cachieve and protect\u201d the priority for blind vendors.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Income sharing was enacted to prevent competitors from driving blind vendors out of business. A competitor who placed vending machines at the same location as the blind vendor was required to assign <em>100 percent </em>of the vending machine net income to the blind vendor.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">Similarly, the competitor could not continue to block the placement of a blind vending stand. Even if the competitor succeeded at keeping the blind vendor off the federal property altogether, the competitor was still required to share 50 percent of the vending machine net income with state blind associations.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Congress designed income sharing to \u201cremedy the evil\u201d of vending machine competition facing blind vendors.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The two prongs of Congress\u2019 approach go hand-in-hand. The admitted <em>priority </em>for blind vendors on military bases simply cannot be \u201cachieve[d] and protect[ed]\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> without the income-sharing provisions of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">There can be no doubt that Congress specifically targeted the \u201cevil\u201d of DOD abuses of the Randolph-Sheppard Act when it enacted the 1974 amendments:<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"a9j-dedup-0\">Commanders of military installations are singularly insensitive to the need to develop the program. The vast Defense establishment can report only 9 blind vendors at Air Force facilities, 17 on Army posts, and 16 at Navy bases. The parent Defense Department association at a major Federal space installation demanded that blind vendors give a portion of their income to the <em>association\u2014precisely the reverse of what should be taking place on Federal property. </em>* * It can be concluded from this and other evidence that there are widespread, major abuses of blind vendors and of the Randolph-Sheppard program. It is the firm resolve of the Committee that such abuses must cease. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-5\">&gt;K $ &gt;ic \u2666 jfc</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Very few blind vendors are to be found at military installations. Witnesses before the Committee have stated that each military post or base commander is in charge of his particular installation, and that, for the most part, commanders are either hostile or indifferent to the Randolph-Sheppard program. This attitude has severely curtailed the growth of the program within the Defense Department. Lt. General Leo Benade, the department\u2019s witness in the hearings on S. 2581, recognized the deficiencies. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-11\">\u201cI do not think the military departments ... are insensitive, but I am not very proud of our record, and I think we can do better, and we will.!\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">The majority concedes that one or more blind vending stands must be placed on every military base, but the majority takes the <em>teeth </em>out of the statute by recognizing only the first prong (priority for blind vendors on every base) and not the second prong (income sharing \u201cto achieve and protect such priority\u201d).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">B. <em>Sound and Meaningful Distinction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">DOD argues that the interpretation arrived at by the Claims Court leads to an \u201cabsurd result\u201d because it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApnX\">creates a distinction\u2014between machines physically located inside the four walls of retail stores and machines in other locations\u2014that cannot be justified by reference to any logical policy <em>* * *]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATAQ\">Although this contention is stated emphatically, DOD offers no argument or reasons to back it up.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-15\">The distinction between machines within retail stores and those in other locations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>appears to be consistent with Congress\u2019 goals and of the compromise struck between the exchange system and the blind. Congress exempted from the income-sharing provisions the revenue from machines located <em>within </em>the exchanges, thereby allowing the exchanges to sell within the store, by machine, whatever they could sell ordinarily. Thus, a blind vendor could not claim that, because an exchange store was selling cigarettes or drinks from a machine rather than by a human, he was entitled to share the income. On the other hand, the exemption does not allow the exchanges to nullify the priority for blind vendors by placing competing vending machines over the entire base.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">It is DOD\u2019s interpretation that leads to a result plainly at variance with the purpose of the statute, because the interpretation would grant DOD the power to completely circumvent the act. DOD regulations expressly deny the priority for blind vendors with respect to vending machines operated by the exchange system.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Thus, if DOD's interpretation prevails, it could keep all blind vendors off military bases by ruling that a blind vendor would be competing with a machine operated by the exchange system. This self-appointed power was pointed out to Congress by GAO and it formed a basis for the narrow compromise exemption.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">\n<em>C.Congress\u2019 Silence on PX Appropriations.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">One of the consequences of the Randolph-Sheppard Act is that military exchanges are subject to income sharing from vending machines outside the PX stores. The cost of compliance with the act would be less than 4 percent of the exchanges\u2019 total annual income.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The act is completely silent about additional appropriations for the military exchanges to make up for the income sharing. This is not surprising, since this particular act was intended to help the blind; its primary purpose was not to help soldiers and sailors.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">The majority, however, attaches great significance to Congress\u2019 silence. Under the majority\u2019s view, it is not sufficient for Congress to require the military exchanges to share income with the blind. Congress also must demonstrate that it has considered whether additional appropriations will be necessary for the military exchanges.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-13\">The Supreme Court has warned of the danger in the majority\u2019s approach: \u201c[t]he search for significance in the silence of Congress is too often the pursuit of a mirage.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In still another case, the Supreme Court stated:<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-G\">[I]t would be a strange canon of statutory construction that would require Congress to state in committee reports or elsewhere in its deliberations that which is obvious on the face of a statute.

It is foolish to abandon this presumption where the legislative history is perceivably full of pitfalls that cannot readily be avoided.

This seeming repartee is not accidental. In fact it is just the opposite. It has been carefully planned by the parties for the express purpose of providing a legislative interpretation of a statutory provision which might otherwise be differently interpreted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-18\">Turning now to the colloquy relied upon by the majority, it can be seen that under the \u201cguise of interpretation]\u201d Congressman Sikes \u201ccontradicts the plain language of the statute\u201d and makes \u201cmanifestly incorrect statements about it or what it does.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Sikes quotes the statutory language limiting the exemption to \u201cvending machines \u2018within the retail sales outlets,\u2019 \u201d and then in the next sentence \u201cpresume[s] * * * that this provision exempts from the revenue-sharing plan <em>all </em>those vending ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>chines which are operated by the military post exchanges * * * and so forth.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.) He continued by stating that the income-sharing provisions <em>\u201cshall not apply to the military services </em>\u201d (emphasis supplied), a statement so clearly erroneous that even DOD acknowledges that the exemption is not so broad as Sikes claimed. Sikes also indicated his concern for the funding of the \u201cworthwhile endeavors\u201d of the military exchange program, stating his belief that additional appropriations for that year would be impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The majority opinion would give legislative effect to the overbroad statements of one member of Congress by means of the terse answer \u201cyes\u201d given by another member. The classic response to this is that a shorter and more accurate answer by the second gentleman would have been \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"asc-dedup-0\">Perhaps the greatest danger in rewriting the statute on the basis of this colloquy, not addressed in the majority opinion, is that <em>there was not a quorum present when the colloquy took place</em><footnotemark><em>52</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, the \u201ctwo men [were] able to legislate more effectively than all of Congress.\u201d <footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ail-dedup-0\">With apologies to Gilbert and Sullivan,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> it may be observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-5\">\u201cThings are seldom what they seem Skim milk masquerades as cream.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-6\">Two and two aren\u2019t always four</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aft-dedup-0\">In dialogue upon the floor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI9\">Of any legislative forum,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-7\">In the absence of a quorum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-8\">This circumstance may be revised,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-9\">Now all debates are televised.

Nor do I question the authority of Congress to enact a statute such as Sikes would have preferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">There is no doubt that if Sikes had been successful in amending the bill to delete the words \u201cwithin retail sales outlets,\u201d and if Congress had passed such a bill, this court would give effect to the resulting statute. The only hitch is that the bill was <em>not </em>amended to delete the language to which Sikes objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-16\">DOD comes to this court asking us to give effect to the language of Congressman Sikes (before less than a quorum of 1 house) rather than the language of the statute enacted by Congress. This we cannot do under the precedent of the Supreme Court and our predecessor courts. \u201cEven assuming, for the time being,\u201d that it would make more \u201ceconomic sense\u201d to exempt <em>all </em>vending machines instead of only those machines \u201cwithin retail sales outlets\u201d: <footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"ahq-dedup-0\">[W]e would only be left with the fact that Congress could have promulgated a better and more meaningful statute. Nevertheless, to improve legislation is certainly not the function or responsibility of the court. \u201c[0]ur problem is to construe what Congress has written.

The exemption from income sharing applies to \u201cvending machines within retail sales outlets under the control of exchange or ships\u2019 stores systems.\u201d All other vending machines under the control of the exchange systems are subject to income sharing, as provided by the Randolph-Sheppard Act.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">E. <em>Subsequent Letters from Congressmen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">The majority errs in relying on letters, written by individual congressmen subsequent to the bill\u2019s enactment, as evidence of \u201cthe intent of Congress.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> As the Court of Claims has stated:<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-11\">How [a congressman] could possibly have \u201cpersonal knowledge of the object or intention of the enactment\u201d by both Houses of Congress is not easy to comprehend. At most he could have only personal knowledge of his own object and intention, and that would not go far towards showing the object and intention of each, or of a majority of the several hundred members of the House of Representatives and of the members of the Senate in passing the act, * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-19\">Furthermore, if subsequent interpretations were relevant, the 1979 Oversight Hearings indicate that Congress enacted exactly the words it intended in the 1974 statutory exemption. Senator Randolph, the author of the act, was highly critical of DOD\u2019s <em>noncompliance </em>with both the act and the HEW regulation concerning vending machine income sharing.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-20\">Just as the colloquy was ineffective to amend the language of the bill, the subsequent letters were ineffective to amend the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-21\">In sum, the legislative history of the act reveals its sweeping purpose to combat the \u201cwidespread, major abuses\u201d of the blind vendor program and to double the number of blind vendors on all federal property. DOD alone was characterized as \u201csingularly insensitive\u201d and \u201chostile or indifferent\u201d to the program. DOD was criticized not only for its abuses of blind vending stands but specifically for the military exchanges\u2019 use of vending machines to compete with blind vendors.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The amendments were adopted to protect the blind from the military exchanges and not vice versa.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\n<em>HEW Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"az_-dedup-0\">Congress expressly stated its desire and reason for regulatory supremacy in HEW:<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-4\">The Committee finds that there is a record of abuses and neglect of the Randolph-Sheppard program by officials of various Federal agencies that is adequate to justify the placement of increased overall authority for its operation with the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-5\">The Committee believes that the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare should be the overseer of the Randolph-Sheppard program throughout the Federal government. As such, it is inevitable that there will be some, incursion by that department in matters traditionally handled by other agencies. The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, however, has the expertness and the sensitivity to the problems inherent in the blind vendor program which may be lacking in other agencies. If the program is to be coordinated, well run and consistent, it must have a coordinator. The only possible choice for this function is HEW.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">Congress acted on the committee\u2019s recommendations by granting both broad and specific powers to <em>HEW </em>alone. Thus, <em>HEW </em>shall prescribe regulations to assure the priority for blind vendors (including income sharing \u201cto achieve and protect such priority\u201d).<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> <em>HEW </em>shall prescribe regulations establishing one or more vending facilities on all federal property.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> \u201cA determination made by the Secretary [of HEW] pursuant to this provision shall be binding on any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States affected by such determination.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AptC\"><em>HEW </em>shall \u201cmake annual surveys of concession vending opportunities for blind persons * * * particularly with respect to * * the Department of Defense.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> <em>HEW </em>shall convene arbitration panels to decide disputes under the Randolph-Sheppard Act.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-14\">Finally, and most significantly:<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"a8v-dedup-0\">The Secretary [of <em>HEW~\\ </em>shall take such action and promulgate such regulations as he deems necessary to assure compliance with this section [concerning vending machine income sharing].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-15\">Given the statute and the express statements of Congress, the majority\u2019s conclusion that HEW is \u201conly on a par with DOD\u201d in promulgating regulations under the act is surprising, to say the least.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-16\">For two reasons, the majority misplaces its reliance on Executive Order No. 12,-146,<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> which only states that if two <em>executive agencies </em>disagree on the interpretation of a statute, they may submit the dispute to the Attorney General <em>\u201cprior to proceeding in any court\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). First, the Department of Justice is not allowed to issue a ruling on a matter already in litigation.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Thus, in <em>Oklahoma v. Weinberger,</em><footnotemark><em>73</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Department of Justice was not functioning in the neutral position that the Tenth Circuit assumed. As the letter upon which DOD bases its argument clearly states, the issue reached the Department of Justice only <em>after </em>suit was filed in Oklahoma. The Department of Justice was already functioning as the Government\u2019s lawyer in response to pending litigation against the United States. The Department of Justice was merely advising its client not to take any action that would compromise the litigation in progress. The Department of Justice thus issued no formal opinion, nor could it have under federal law, because the matter was under litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\">The majority errs in stating that Justice\u2019s interpretation in litigation is binding. The United States is always a party in the Claims Court, where it is represented by the Department of Justice. Under the majority\u2019s analysis, the Department of Justice could issue a binding ruling in every case, and there would be no need for a Claims Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">Second, it is inaccurate for the majority to suggest that conflicting regulations of two agencies are entitled to equal weight, without regard to the statutory authority of the agencies. Here, the respective authority of HEW and DOD can be determined only in reference to the act, which overwhelmingly rejects the majority\u2019s assertion that the agencies are \u201conly on a par.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">The majority criticizes the HEW regulation because it merely \u201crepeat[s] the statutory language.\u201d In my view, a better basis for disregarding a regulation of the authorized agency would be if the agency did <em>not </em>follow the statute.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Furthermore, the fact that HEW did not find it necessary to depart from the statutory language, stating that only an amendment by Congress could effect such a change, is a powerful indication that the statute was clear and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-10\">The majority states that \u201cthere is no basis for deference to the interpretation by HEW\u201d because HEW has \u201cvacillated internally.\u201d A close reading of the majority opinion, however, discloses the fact that HEW published its final regulation on March 23, 1977, and <em>HEW has never changed or withdrawn </em>this regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-11\">Advocates for DOD wrote letters attempting to prevail upon HEW to change its regulation. It is this flurry of correspondence which the majority describes as evidence of \u201cinternal vacillation.\u201d If the correspondence proves anything, it is that HEW carefully considered the views of DOD as well as the language of the statute before it promulgated its regulations. This initial correspondence was never promulgated or published, but even if it had been, it would not be sufficient to undermine HEW\u2019s credibility. The United States Supreme Court has recently explained:<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1tu\">The fact that the agency has from time to time changed its interpretation of the term \u201csource\u201d does not, as respondents argue, lead us to conclude that no deference should be accorded the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute. An initial agency interpretation is not instantly carved in stone. On the contrary, the agency, to engage in informed rulemak-ing, must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-12\">When it became clear to DOD that HEW would not change its regulations, DOD acted upon HEW\u2019s advice and attempted to introduce legislation to amend the Randolph-Sheppard Act to delete the words \u201cwithin retail sales outlets.\u201d DOD\u2019s legislative proposal was not acted on, however, and the statutory exemption remained unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-13\">Undaunted, DOD proceeded to publish its own final regulations exempting <em>all </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>vending machines \u201coperated by or for the military exchanges.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> DOD acknowledged comments disagreeing with its version of the exemption, but it refused to change the DOD regulation.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The majority \u201cconclude[d] that the interpretation of DOD, as the agency compelled to apply the statutory exemption, is the only authoritative administrative construction.\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Clearly, the majority has erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">The majority has rewritten a clear statute despite its plain meaning, the legislative history supporting that plain meaning, and the interpretation of the authorized agency. Thus, DOD has accomplished through the courts what it was unable to accomplish in the legislature or in the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">I would affirm the judgment of the United States Claims Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-10\">. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 107d-3(d) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b939-11\">.

DOD repeatedly expressed its concern for the impact of the Randolph-Sheppard Act on the military exchange system, with particular emphasis on vending machines.

It cannot be said that Congress was unaware of the consequences of its act, since it was warned of consequences far more severe than would actually result from applying the statute. Congress was fully aware of the military exchanges\u2019 use of vending machines income, both from Lt. Gen.

DOD\u2019s actions are inconsistent with its argument of ambiguity. Query: If the statute contained any support for DOD\u2019s interpretation, why was DOD so vigorous in attempting to change the statute and the HEW regulation which tracked the statute?

The majority misplaces its reliance on <em>Riverside Bayview Homes, </em>106 S.Ct. at 461, since Congress charged HEW and not DOD with enforcing the statute. Thus, it is HEW\u2019s regulation which is entitled to deference.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b952-8\">NEWMAN, Circuit Judge, with whom SMITH, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ady-dedup-1\">joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">I generally agree with Judge Smith\u2019s opinion in dissent, and offer the following additional remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">Both sides of this issue pose questions that are inappropriate for judicial answer, yet answer we must. The literal words of the statute, on which Judge Smith\u2019s opinion turns, are challenged by the fact that DOD has apparently never implemented those words; this in turn is balanced by the contrary reading of the statute by HEW (the agency charged with administering the statute). The 10th Circuit has held one way, and the Texas arbitrators (split 2-1) and the Claims Court held the other way. The legislative history can support both interpretations, as the preceding opinions demonstrate at length.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-14\">No fundamental law of nations or peoples is at stake; rather, at stake is the choice of Congress on how to aid both the blind and military recreation. This is a decision of national policy, and it cries for the voice of Congress, not a court\u2019s conclusion that Congress did not intend the legislation that it enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-15\">Until that voice is heard, I conclude that the balance is on the side of the position supported by Judge Smith. This result does not require explaining away the plain words of the statute, as is eloquently done by the majority of the court. I find it anomalous to conclude that the House and Senate <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> believed that the simple clause \u201cwithin retail sales outlets\u201d really means \u201canywhere on the base\u201d. Although the government has cited precedent for judicial rewrite of acts of Congress, none of this authority goes as far as the dramatic rewrite advanced by the court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b952-18\">The House voted 398 for, 7 against, and the Senate 90 for, 1 against, to override President Ford's veto.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
