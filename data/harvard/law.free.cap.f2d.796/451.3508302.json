Heine-mann (Heinemann), pro se, from summary judgment by the United States Claims Court (Claims Court) dismissing Heine-mann\u2019s claim of patent infringement and holding that the United States is the owner of patent No. 4,050,381 (\u2019381 patent) on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>invention made by Heinemann, while he was a Government employee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Claims Court affirmed the ownership determination pursuant to Executive Order No. 10096 (Exec. Order No. 10096)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> made by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks (Commissioner). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">\n<em>Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">The three issues in this appeal are (1) what is the standard to be used by the Claims Court in reviewing an administrative determination pursuant to Exec. Order No. 10096; (2) whether Exec. Order No. 10096 allows a taking of property without due process of law in contravention of the fifth amendment; and (3) whether the Claims Court erred in entering summary judgment against Heinemann, affirming the administrative determination pursuant to Exec. Order No. 10096, that the Government was the owner of the \u2019381 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">The facts material to this appeal are set forth below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">Heinemann was employed as a chemist and physical scientist by the Government from 1957 until 1985 at the Army\u2019s Picatin-ny Arsenal located near Dover, New Jersey. In 1963, Heinemann was transferred to the Warheads and Special Projects (WASP) laboratory at Picatinny Arsenal. The WASP laboratory was responsible, among other things, for developing improved nonnuclear, conventional munitions. Heinemann\u2019s primary duties in the WASP laboratory were to coordinate and assist the laboratory chief in performing technical management of the exploratory development work being conducted in the laboratory. He was also expected to keep abreast of the state of the art in technology applicable to the work of the laboratory and to bring such knowledge and information into the laboratory from other Government facilities and from private industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-13\">In the mid-1960\u2019s, the WASP laboratory was engaged in developing improved conventional munitions for use against armored vehicular targets such as tanks, armored personnel carriers, and trucks. One concept being pursued was the development of an intelligent anti-armor munition. An intelligent munition is one that can independently detect the location of the target during the terminal phase of its trajectory and deliver its destructive force directly to that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-14\">A co-worker of Heinemann, Theodore Malgeri (Malgeri), was engaged in a search for an effective sensor to be used in an intelligent anti-armor munition. Malgeri envisioned that such a sensor might be used in a barrage rocket having an intelligent warhead. The sensor would, detect the target and cause the warhead to \u201chome\u201d on the target during the final phase of its trajectory.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-15\">Heinemann became aware of Malgeri\u2019s program and became very interested in it. In an effort to improve and simplify the barrage rocket, Heinemann conceived the idea of eliminating the need for terminal homing by having the warhead detonate and project a spray of metal fragments at the target as soon as the target was detected.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-16\">Heinemann submitted a written disclosure of his concept in January 1966. A patent application was prepared from the disclosure and from further information provided by Heinemann. When the patent application was ready for filing, Heine-mann was requested to assign the ownership of the invention to the Government and he did so on March 23, 1972. The assignment has been held invalid, a determination not challenged in this appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>The patent application\u2019was filed and matured into the patent in suit which was issued on September 27, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Development of the intelligent anti-armor munition continued under the supervision of Malgeri. In the early 1970\u2019s, development in electronics and warhead technology made the nonhoming, immediate-fire warhead approach appear feasible. Funds to develop such a weapon were provided and the work resulted in the development of the Search and Destroy Armor (SA-DARM) munition. SADARM is an 8-inch artillery projectile containing three intelligent submunitions. SADARM is expected to become an operational weapon in the near future.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">\n<em>Prior Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">Heinemann brought suit in the United States Court of Claims on May 15, 1979, contending that the SADARM munition infringed the \u2019381 patent, that his 1972 assignment of the invention to the Government was voidable, and that he was properly the owner of the patent. Heinemann contended that the Government\u2019s use of the invention covered by the \u2019381 patent was a taking without due process afforded by the fifth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">The Court of Claims, our predecessor court, remanded the case to the trial division for further proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsequently, the Court of Claims ordered a bifurcated trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The first trial was to determine \u201cthe contested ownership issue\u201d and was to consider the Government\u2019s allegation that, at a minimum, it was \u201centitled to a royalty free license to practice the invention.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The outcome of the first trial was to \u201cdetermine whether a trial for the alleged infringement would be necessary.\u201d (In October 1982 the trial division of the Court of Claims became the United States Claims Court.)</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">On March 1, 1984, the Claims Court directed that \u201cthis case is remanded to Pica-tinny Arsenal for a final determination, in accordance with Executive Order 10096, of the respective rights of plaintiff and the government in plaintiff\u2019s invention.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> After the case was remanded, the Army followed its established regulations, in accordance with Exec. Order No. 10096, governing invention rights determinations. The Army was aided by the information developed in the trial record developed by the Claims Court. Under Army regulations, an initial recommendation was prepared by Pi-catinny Arsenal, Heinemann\u2019s immediate command, and forwarded through the Army Materiel Command (formerly the Army Materiel Development and Readiness Command or \u201cDARCOM\u201d) to the Patents, Copyrights, and Trademarks Division of the Army Legal Services Agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-14\">On July 23, 1984, the Army Legal Services Agency issued the rights determination on behalf of the Department of the Army which concluded in the following language that the Government is entitled to an assignment of the invention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-15\">The inventor is within those categories of employees specified in paragraph 1(c), Executive Order 10096 * * * thereby creating the presumption that [the] Government shall obtain the entire right, title and interest in the invention. This presumption has not been rebutted. The invention bears a direct relation to and was made in consequence of the official duties of the inventor * * *. Accordingly, it is the determination of the Department of the Army that, pursuant to paragraph 1(a), Executive Order 10096, the Government is entitled to an assignment of the entire domestic right, title, and interest in and to the invention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"auf-dedup-0\">Throughout the Army\u2019s rights determination, Heinemann was represented by competent legal counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Heinemann appealed the Department of the Army determination to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks pursuant to 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.7 on August 22, 1984. On November 30, 1984, Donald J. Quigg (Quigg), then Deputy Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, issued a decision which concurred with the Army determination and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-4\">A presumption has been established under the Provisions of Executive Order 10096(lc)(iii) and (iv) that appellant\u2019s invention falls within the provisions of paragraph 1(a). Appellant has failed to overcome that presumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-5\">Hence, Government is entitled to retain all right, title and interest in and to the invention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">On December 28, 1984, Heinemann filed a request for reconsideration pursuant to 37 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.7(d) of the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s decision on appeal. On March 1, 1985, Quigg, then Acting Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, issued a decision which granted the request for reconsideration but again concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-7\">Appellant has failed to overcome the presumption under the Provision of Executive Order 10096(lc)(iii) and (IV) [sic] that Appellant\u2019s invention falls within the provisions of Paragraph 1(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">The decision made no modification of the decision dated November 30, 1984. Throughout the proceedings before the Commissioner, Heinemann was represented by competent legal counsel who submitted written briefs on Heinemann\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-10\">On May 15, 1985, Heinemann filed a motion in the Claims Court for partial summary judgment on the question of whether he is entitled to any right, title, or interest in or to the \u2019381 patent. While Heinemann\u2019s partial summary judgment motion was pending, the Government filed a summary judgment motion to dismiss the complaint on the basis that Heinemann was neither the legal nor the equitable owner of the \u2019381 patent and, therefore, was not entitled to bring this suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498 or under the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution. On July 11, 1985, a hearing was held before Chief Judge Kozinski. After hearing oral arguments by counsel for each party, Chief Judge Kozinski issued an order granting the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint and dismissing Heinemann\u2019s motion with costs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-15\">On September 3, 1985, Heinemann appealed the July 12, 1985, judgment of the Claims Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-16\">\n<em>Standard of Review in the Claims Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b956-17\">The regulations issued pursuant to Exec. Order No. 10096<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provide for an administrative determination by the Government agency employing the inventor, with review available by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks. The Government points to section 4(d) of Exec. Order No. 10096 which section provides that the Commissioner\u2019s determination is \u201cwith finality * * * between any Government agency and its employees.\u201d The Government argues that if the Commissioner\u2019s determination is final, there can be no judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-18\">The Government\u2019s argument against judicial review is without merit. The Commissioner\u2019s determination is a final agency action reviewable under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b956-19\">The Government is correct, however, in asserting that if the Commissioner\u2019s determination is reviewable, the appropriate standard of review in the Claims Court is the \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d standard set forth in the APA. The Claims Court shall \u201chold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be * * * arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>tion, or otherwise not in accordance with law[.]\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Here, the Claims Court stated that the Commissioner\u2019s determination under Exec. Order No. 10096 would have to be affirmed under either the \u201carbitrary or capricious\u201d standard <em>or </em>the \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard. We must affirm because, under the appropriate standard, the Commissioner\u2019s determination was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">\n<em>Fifth Amendment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">The Government\u2019s only argument concerning the constitutionality of Exec. Order No. 10096 is its assertion that Heinemann is precluded from raising this \u201cnew issue\u201d on appeal. Although Heinemann\u2019s arguments may not have been clearly stated, the very core of his case is, and always has been, that he believes himself to be the true owner of the patent and that the Government has taken his property without due process of law. Therefore, we must address the fifth amendment issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-8\">In <em>Kaplan v. </em>Corcoran,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the President was authorized by statute to promulgate Exec. Order No. 10096. The Seventh Circuit held that the executive order was not prohibited by the 1933 Supreme Court decision in <em>United States v. Dubilier Condenser Corp.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">In <em>Dubilier, </em>there existed no executive order such as Exec. Order No. 10096, nor were there any statutes or regulations concerning invention rights determinations. The Supreme Court held that the common law of invention rights was controlling, in the absence of any authority for the courts or the administrative officers to determine otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">There have been several important occurrences since 1933 which have created a different situation from that in <em>Dubilier. </em>There are several statutes which authorize the President to prescribe regulations concerning the conduct of Government employees and the ownership of Government property.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Executive Order No. 10096 and the related regulations have been promulgated pursuant to the authority vested in the President by statute. Also, as the Seventh Circuit stated, there was congressional acquiescence in the order as shown by \u201cthe failure of Congress to modify or disapprove it.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We agree with the <em>Kaplan </em>holding that Exec. Order No. 10096 is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-14\">Heinemann has contended that Exec. Order No. 10096 is not uniformly applied in patent rights disputes. Contrary to Heinemann\u2019s assertions, Exec. Order No. 10096 has made possible a uniform policy for determining ownership rights with respect to patents on inventions made by Government employees.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The executive order provides procedural safeguards by requiring the agency to conform to specified standards in making the invention rights determination. In addition, Heinemann has availed himself of review by the Commissioner, appeal to the Claims Court, and subsequent appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-15\">The Army correctly determined, in accordance with Exec. Order No. 10096, that \u201c[t]he invention [bore] a direct relation to and was made in consequence of the official duties of the inventor.\u201d The Army found that Heinemann\u2019s responsibilities included coordinating laboratory work and acting as a liaison for researchers. The Army also found that Heinemann had failed to rebut the presumption that, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>he was within those categories of Government employees specified in Exec. Order No. 10096, his invention became the property of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">The Army\u2019s determination was affirmed by the decision of the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, which decision was affirmed by the United States Claims Court. There has been no \u201ctaking\u201d because the invention was not the property of Heinemann, and there has been no lack of due process afforded Heinemann under the provisions of Exec. Order No. 10096 as administered and reviewed by the agencies and by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">\n<em>Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">Summary judgment shall be rendered if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d and if \u201cthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, where both parties have filed dispositive motions, and neither has challenged nor denied the material facts relied upon by the other, the trial court may properly enter judgment on the issue of law, based upon the material facts contained in the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">In the Claims Court\u2019s proceedings below, both Heinemann and the Government brought cross-motions for summary judgment. Heinemann\u2019s motion was for partial summary judgment declaring that he had title to the \u2019381 patent. The Government\u2019s motion was for summary judgment dismissing the complaint because of the Exec. Order No. 10096 determination that Heine-mann did not have title to the \u2019381 patent. Heinemann did not challenge the material facts relied upon in the Government\u2019s motion, and likewise the Government did not challenge the material facts relied upon in Heinemann\u2019s motion. Accordingly, there were no genuine issues of material fact, and the Claims Court correctly granted the Government\u2019s motion after carefully Reviewing the Commissioner\u2019s determination and deciding that it was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">Executive Order No. 10096, relating to ownership determinations on inventions made by Government employees, is constitutional. Under the appropriate standard of review, the Claims Court correctly entered summary judgment dismissing Heine-mann\u2019s claim of patent infringement and holding that the Government is the owner of the \u2019381 patent obtained on Heinemann\u2019s invention. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b954-9\">. <em>Heinemann v. United States, </em>No. 202-79C (Cl.Ct.
