BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-15\">In June and July of 1982 Solomon, the owner of Leonardo\u2019s Pizza, was notified by the City of Gainesville that a sign above Leonardo\u2019s was in violation of a city ordinance, section 29-100(b)(2) of the Gaines-ville Code, outlawing signs of an \u201cobscene, indecent or immoral nature.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prosecution was threatened if the alleged violation was not corrected. In response, Solomon filed an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982) for monetary damages, alleging a deprivation of his rights under the first and fourteenth amendments. Additionally, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201-02 (1982), Solomon sought injunctive relief and a declaratory judgment that the subject ordinance was facially invalid on first amendment grounds of overbreadth. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the City, holding that Solomon had no standing to maintain either his section 1983 damages claim or his constitutional claim for which declaratory relief was sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-20\">In a prior appeal, this court reversed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on the issue of Solomon\u2019s standing to challenge the constitutionality of the ordinance and, further, found the ordinance \u201cfacially unconstitutional because of overbreadth and vagueness.\u201d <em>Solomon v. City of Gainesville, </em>763 F.2d 1212, 1215 (11th Cir.1985) (per curiam). The issue of Solomon\u2019s standing to maintain his section 1983 claim was not reached as this court concluded that, \u201c[plaintiff\u2019s action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 was waived on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1213. Subsequent to the decision in <em>Solomon, </em>the challenged ordinance, section 29-100(b)(2), was repealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-21\">Upon remand of this action to the district court, Solomon filed his motion for an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The City opposed the motion arguing that because Solomon waived his section 1983 claim, there was no statutory basis upon which to award attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1466\">*1466</page-number>ney\u2019s fees under section 1988. The district court agreed, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-4\">Plaintiff has prevailed in this litigation. <em>Cf. Hanrahan v. Hampton, </em>446 U.S. 754 [100 S.Ct. 1987, 64 L.Ed.2d 670] (1980). However, plaintiff prevailed on his constitutional claim and not under any of the statutes enumerated [in section 1988]. If plaintiff were to receive an award of attorney\u2019s fees in this case, the General American Rule regarding fees could be entirely subverted by including a \u00a7 1983 claim in every cause, regardless of the merits ... Plaintiff did not prevail under \u00a7 1983 and is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1542-5\">Accordingly, the district court denied the requested fees and costs. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-7\">Our review of the district court\u2019s denial of section 1988 attorney\u2019s fees is limited to determining whether there was an abuse of discretion. <em>Ellwest Stereo Theatre, Inc. v. Jackson, </em>653 F.2d 954, 955 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A court\u2019s discretion to deny such fees is, however, \u201cexceedingly narrow.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, absent special circumstances that would render an award unjust, a prevailing plaintiff under section 1988 should be awarded fees \u201cas a matter of course.\u201d <em>Gates v. Collier, </em>616 F.2d 1268, 1275 (5th Cir.1980), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>636 F.2d 942 (5th Cir.1981);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> thus, ordinarily in order to recover such fees, a plaintiff need only establish that he is the \u201cprevailing party\u201d within the context of section 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-8\">We find the district court erred in the instant case in concluding that section 1988 does not authorize an award of fees to a litigant, such as Solomon, who prevails only under a constitutional claim. As we recently reiterated in <em>Martin v. Heckler, </em>773 F.2d 1145, 1149 (11th Cir.1985) (en banc), the test of whether one is a prevailing party is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-10\">\u2018whether he or she has received substantially the relief requested or has been successful on the central issue,\u2019 <em>Watkins v. Mobile Housing Board, </em>632 F.2d 565, 567 (5th Cir. Unit B 1980), or, stated another way, whether \u2018plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit was a catalyst motivating defendants to provide the primary relief sought in a manner desired by litigation.\u2019 <em>Robinson v. Kimbrough, </em>652 F.2d 458, 465 (5th Cir.1981).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1542-11\">There is simply no doubt that Solomon satisfies this test. He succeeded in one of the primary objectives of this litigation, namely having the city sign ordinance declared violative of the first amendment and, further, due to his successful challenge, having the ordinance repealed. The fact that Solomon waived his section 1983 damages claim does not diminish his successful challenge of the ordinance nor, deprive him of his claim to fees.</p>\n<p id=\"AWK\">Even though he succeeded only on his first amendment claim, for which declaratory relief was sought, he prevailed upon a claim which established a right \u201csecured by the Constitution.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. By its express terms, section 1988 authorizes an award to the prevailing party \u201cin any action ... to enforce a provision\u201d of section 1983. As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 129 n. 11, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 2574-75 n. 11, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980) \u201c[although the reference to actions \u2018to enforce\u2019 \u00a7 1983 is somewhat imprecise in light of the fact that \u00a7 1983 does not itself create substantive rights, the legislative history makes it perfectly clear that the Act was intended to apply in any action for which \u00a7 1983 provides a remedy.\u201d Following this reasoning, the Eighth Circuit stated in <em>Consolidated Freight-ways Corp. v. Kassel, </em>730 F.2d 1139, 1141-42 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 105 S.Ct. 126, 83 L.Ed.2d 68 (1984):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1542-15\">[T]he fact that a party prevails on a ground other than \u00a7 1983 does not pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1467\">*1467</page-number>elude an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988. If \u00a7 1983 would have been an appropriate basis for relief, then [a prevailing party] is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988 even though relief was actually awarded on another ground. See <em>Maher v. Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 132 n. 15, 100 S.Ct. 2570, 2576 n. 15, 65 L.Ed.2d 653 (1980).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1543-5\">We, therefore, find that Solomon is the prevailing party under section 1988 and, further, that there are no special circumstances justifying a denial of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the district court denying section 1988 attorney\u2019s fees, and remand to the district court with instructions to determine a reasonable fee award in accordance with the twelve criteria set forth in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1541-16\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 (1982) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1541-17\">In any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of [section 1983] ... the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1541-18\">.
