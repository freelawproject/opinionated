This is a troubling case in which the claimant\u2019s treating physician concluded that the claimant is totally disabled because of massive heart enlargement while the AU relied upon a consulting physician\u2019s single examination and the report of the agency\u2019s medical consultant that the claimant retained the ability to perform a full range of sedentary activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-11\">Bell was bom May 24,1928, has a college degree, and had performed clerical functions essentially sedentary in nature until he stopped working April 16, 1982. It is undisputed that Bell has a severe cardiac problem, probably congenital having its origin in rheumatic fever and resulting in cardiac irregularities, fatigue, and shortness of breath. The claimant\u2019s physician who had treated him at least ten years concluded from various tests that Bell had a gross enlargement of the right atrium and right ventricle, as well as apparent mitral and tricuspid prolapse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-13\">There is no dispute that Bell\u2019s condition constitutes a severe impairment. The inquiry is whether Bell\u2019s impairment meets or equals a listed impairment which would qualify him for a disability rating. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d) and app. 1 to pt. 404 (list of various impairments based on certain objective symptomatology). Bell\u2019s impairment relates to category 4.01, Cardiovascular System. If Bell\u2019s impairment does not qualify him for a disability rating, he could still qualify for such a rating if he could prove that his illness prevents him from performing his past work or any other work. Bell failed to establish disability under any of these methods of qualifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-14\">Three doctors presented evidence for consideration by the AU, all in memorandum or letter form. Dr. John J. Rahaim is Bell\u2019s regular physician and has treated Bell since 1971. Dr. Rahaim\u2019s letter (Record at 99) describes Bell\u2019s history, medications, and the results of an echocardiogram. After describing the damage to Bell\u2019s heart, Dr. Rahaim concludes: \u201cHis condition will not improve and he will continue to suffer from severe disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-15\">Dr. A.E. Anderson examined Bell at the request of the agency and gave the following diagnosis and comment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1427-16\">DIAGNOSIS: Probable rheumatic heart disease with severe cardiomegaly, probable mitral insufficiency, right bundle branch block, AV heart block, ST segment T-wave abnormalities and PAC\u2019s. Class II, C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1427-17\">COMMENT: Although there was no evidence of congestive heart failure, this patient is felt to be restricted to a program of light physical activity by his cardiac difficulty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1427-18\">Record at 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b1427-19\">Dr. Sanford Cobb, a regular employee of the agency, reviewed Bell\u2019s file, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>the medical reports of Dr. Rahaim and Dr. Anderson. He concluded that Bell had a severe cardiac problem, probably congenital in origin and, while concluding that Bell had a severe impairment, he found him not to have congestive heart failure. <em>See </em>category 4.02, app. 1 to pt. 404 in 20 C.F.R. Dr. Cobb concluded that Bell could do sedentary work, but that he should not stand or walk as much as 6 hours a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-4\">In light of this medical evidence and Bell\u2019s education and work history, the AU found that Bell \u201chas the residual functional capacity to perform essentially a full range of \u2018sedentary work\u2019 activities as defined by the applicable Social Security Regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-5\">Appellant contends that this finding is not supported by substantial evidence since the AU did not give proper weight to the opinion of Bell\u2019s treating physician.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have held that good cause must be shown if the opinion of the treating physician is discounted. We have further held that a non-examining physician\u2019s opinion is entitled to little weight if it is contrary to the opinion of the claimant\u2019s treating physician. See <em>Broughton v. Heckler, </em>776 F.2d 960 (11th Cir.1985), for a discussion of these principles. In this case we do not find any particularized difference, let alone actual conflict, in the medical diagnoses of the three physicians. The variance among them is largely a matter of expression, as neither Dr. Rahaim nor Dr. Anderson described Bell\u2019s impairment in terms of the detailed objective symptoms of cardiovascular impairment set out in the Regulations. All three opinions reach about the same medical conclusion. They only diverge with respect to disability to work, but that divergence is not sufficiently articulated in Bell\u2019s behalf to warrant a reversal that Bell could not do a full range of sedentary work. Consequently, we conclude that the ALJ's finding that Bell is not unable to engage in substantial gainful activity is supported by substantial evidence. The treating physician\u2019s opinion on disability was properly discounted here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1428-9\">The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-10\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-11\">In an attempt to explain our consideration of Dr. Rahaim\u2019s diagnosis, we will elaborate on our opinion. All doctors who have examined Bell, the AU, and all judges who have reviewed the case conclude that Bell has a severe cardiac problem and impairment. However, the issue is whether Bell is unable \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-12\">Appellant argues (1) that claimant\u2019s severe impairment met or equalled the Secretary\u2019s listed impairments (2) that the evidence established claimant could not perform his past relevant work and (3) that the AU applied the incorrect legal standard in evaluating claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of disability. <em>See supra </em>note 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-13\">The appellant and the dissent miss the mark if they believe Dr. Rahaim\u2019s medical opinion and conclusions meet the requirements of \u00a7 404.1520(d) of the regulations which provides, \u201cif you have an impairment which meets the duration requirement and is listed in Appendix 1, or we determine that the impairment is equal to one of the listed impairments, we will find you are disabled without considering your age, education, and work experience.\u201d We include in the Appendix B 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 401, pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1 which describe the listed impairments that detail various types of cardiovascular diseases and the objective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>symptoms which must be found to support a finding of disability under regulation 404.1520(d) and subsection 4.02. The type of cardiac illness suffered by Bell comes within the purview of subsection 4.02, congestive heart failure. Dr. Cobb was of the opinion that his condition is cor pulmonale, listed under paragraph D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-4\">At no point in his opinion, did Dr. Rahaim compare his objective findings with respect to Bell\u2019s illness with the listed objective findings under subsection 4.02 and conclude that Bell met the listed impairments. In fact Dr. Rahaim does not mention the regulations or the listed impairments. Nor does Dr. Rahaim state that Bell has an impairment that is equal to one of the listed impairments as required by the regulation. Nor does Dr. Rahaim state that Bell had several different impairments which in combination would prevent Bell from engaging in substantial gainful activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-5\">We hold that when a claimant contends that he has an impairment meeting the listed impairments entitling him to an adjudication of disability under regulation 404.1520(d), he must present specific medical findings that meet the various tests listed under the description of the applicable impairment or, if in the alternative he contends that he has an impairment which is equal to one of the listed impairments, the claimant must present medical evidence which describes how the impairment has such an equivalency. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1525 and 404.1526. Dr. Rahaim\u2019s conclusion that Bell is \u201ctotally disabled,\u201d and that \u201c[h]is condition will not improve and he will continue to suffer from severe disability\u201d is not sufficient. Bell has not met the burden of furnishing the medical findings which would permit a determination of disability under regulation 404.1520(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-6\">Appellant next argues that the Secretary erred in finding that he could perform his past relevant work. We have stated that the ALJ was correct in concluding that Bell did not have an impairment listed in Appendix 1 or an impairment equivalent to such an impairment. Regulation 404.1520(e) provides, \u201cIf we cannot make a decision based on current activity or on medical facts alone, and you have a severe impairment(s), we then review your residual functional capacity and the physical and mental demands of the work you have done in the past. If you can still do this kind of work, we will find that you are not disabled.\u201d Dr. Rahaim\u2019s opinion was dated July 16, 1982. He wrote in reference to Bell: \u201cHe has been under my care since 1971 and has been permanently and totally disabled almost from the time I originally started treating Mr. Bell.\u201d This is belied by Bell\u2019s testimony if Dr. Rahaim\u2019s testimony is to be construed as a conclusion that Bell could not engage in substantial gainful activity. Bell stated that he left his work with Paragon Productions in March of 1982 but that it was his intention to return to Paragon later in August. He stated that Paragon \u201chad decided to take a break because business was slow and I thought it would give me a good chance to rest because I had been extremely fatigued over the last few months.\u201d Bell testified that he went to his doctor in late April, had an examination, but when \u201c[I] received his report back, he told me that I should have been receiving [social security] ever since 1967.\u201d He says that his doctor told him not to return to work, and that he had not sought any employment since that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-8\">The dissent errs in urging that Dr. Rahaim\u2019s conclusion that Bell is \u201ctotally disabled\u201d and that \u201chis condition will not improve and he will continue to suffer from severe disability\u201d inescapably conflicts with the opinions of Drs. Anderson and Cobb that Bell can perform a full range of \u201csedentary work activities.\u201d Dr. Rahaim never discusses the subject of sedentary work activities and never discusses in what manner Bell\u2019s cardiac condition prevents him from performing his past type of light sedentary work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-9\">The regulation in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527 provides that although a claimant's physician may state he is \u201cdisabled\u201d or \u201cunable to work\u201d the agency will neverthe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>less determine disability based upon the medical findings and other evidence. Dr. Rahaim's conclusory statement that Bell is \u201ctotally disabled\u201d is not explained by his medical findings. We conclude that in this case the ALJ had good cause not to accord substantial weight to Dr. Rahaim\u2019s evidence in light of the conflicting medical evidence from the other two doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-4\">APPENDIX B</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-5\">The applicable regulations, 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.01, pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1, state that the claimant must have:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-6\">4.02 <em>Congestive heart failure (manifested by evidence of vascular congestion such as hepatomegaly, peripheral or pulmonary edema). </em>With:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1430-7\">A.

The dissent suggests that we do not discuss \u201cgood cause\" for discounting Dr. Rahaim\u2019s diagnosis. We discuss this in Appendix A to this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1428-7\">. The ALJ was also correct in discounting appellant's subjective complaints of disability. The ALJ considered appellants claims of nausea, palpitations and shortness of breath. He elicited testimony that some of appellant\u2019s symptoms had been diagnosed as the result of anxiety rather than organic infirmities. The ALJ then made a proper credibility- determination that appellant\u2019s subjective complaints were caused in part by overreaction to his heart condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1430-27\">JOHNSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A17\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1430-28\">I cannot agree with the conclusion of the majority that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) gave proper legal weight to the opinion of Noah Bell\u2019s attending physician, Dr. Rahaim. The Court acknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1355\">*1355</page-number>edges the well-established rule that an ALJ must accord substantial weight to the opinion of a claimant\u2019s treating physician unless good cause is shown to the contrary. <em>Broughton v. Heckler, </em>776 F.2d 960, 961 (11th Cir.1985) (per curiam). However, the majority finds no actual conflict among the medical diagnoses of the three doctors presenting opinions, and a divergence only \u201cwith respect to disability to work\u201d that is \u201cnot sufficiently articulated in Bell\u2019s behalf to warrant a finding that Bell could not do a full range of sedentary work.\u201d The Court therefore discounts the opinion of Bell\u2019s treating physician with no further discussion of \u201cgood cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-5\">The majority\u2019s somewhat tortured analysis obscures a simple case. Bell clearly suffers from a debilitating heart ailment. Dr. Rahaim\u2019s conclusion that Bell is \u201ctotally disabled,\u201d and that \u201c[h]is condition will not improve and he will continue to suffer from severe disability\u201d seems to me a well-articulated and quite powerful expression of Bell\u2019s incapacity to work. Further, that conclusion inescapably conflicts with the opinions of Drs. Anderson and Cobb that Bell can perform a full range of \u201csedentary work activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1431-6\">Given such a conflict, we are charged by precedent and by common sense to weigh the conclusion of the physician who has treated Bell for eleven years over the views of two consulting doctors who actually examined Bell, respectively, once and not at all. \u201cIt is not only legally relevant but unquestionably logical that the opinions, diagnosis, and medical evidence of a treating physician whose familiarity with the patient\u2019s injuries, course of treatment, and responses over a considerable length of time, should be given considerable weight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 962, quoting <em>Smith v. Schweiker, </em>646 F.2d 1075, 1081 (5th Cir.1981). Since the ALJ did not accord sufficient weight to Dr. Rahaim\u2019s opinion of Bell\u2019s \u201ctotal disability,\u201d his decision was simply erroneous as a matter of law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
