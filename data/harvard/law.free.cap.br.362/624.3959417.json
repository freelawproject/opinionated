HARDIN, JR., Bankruptcy Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b656-18\">Before the Court are defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the amended complaints in ninety-five adversary proceedings pursuant to Bankruptcy Rules 7009 and 7012 and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6). The adversary proceedings were commenced by debtors-plaintiffs to recover alleged fraudulent conveyances under Sections 544 and 548 of the Bankruptcy Code and Sections 273-276 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law (\u201cDCL\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-19\">The plaintiffs in these 95 adversary proceedings (Bayou Superfund, LLC, Bayou No Leverage Fund, LLC and Bayou Accredited Fund, LLC) are three hedge funds organized in 2003 (collectively, the \u201cBayou Hedge Funds\u201d or, together with other Bayou-related entities, the \u201cBayou Entities\u201d). The defendants are persons and entities who invested in the Bayou Hedge Funds. The gravamen of the amended complaints is that the Bayou Entities including the Bayou Hedge Funds were operated by their pre-petition principals \u2014 Samuel Israel III and Daniel E. Marino (\u201cIsrael\u201d and \u201cMarino\u201d) \u2014 as a \u201cmassive Ponzi scheme.\u201d As summarized at page 2 of plaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum of Law in response to the motions to dismiss (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Memorandum\u201d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-20\">Israel and Marino siphoned many millions of dollars from the Bayou Hedge Funds for their personal benefit, disseminated false financial reports indicating that the Bayou Hedge Funds had enjoyed substantial investment gains when in fact they had experienced substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>losses, created a phony accounting firm to certify those false financial reports, and caused the Bayou Hedge Funds to make redemption payments to certain investors in inflated amounts derived from those false reports. When the fraudulent scheme collapsed, hundreds of investor creditors lost all of their principal investments totaling approximately $250 million....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-5\">Essential to the fraudulent investment scheme was the transfer of over $135 million in inflated redemption payments of non-existent principal and fictitious profits to the Defendants, each of whom redeemed during the fourteen months preceding the Bayou Hedge Funds\u2019 demise in August 2005. To effect the fraud, the Bayou Entities purposefully paid Defendants substantially more than their investments were actually worth in order to validate the falsified performance reports and financial statements, with the specific intent to conceal the fraud from existing investors and to induce prospective investors to entrust new investments to the Bayou Hedge Funds. As such, these redemption payments were the <em>sine qua non </em>of the fraud, and thus were made with actual intent to defraud present and future creditors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The alleged fraudulent conveyances sought to be recovered are payments to the defendants of \u201cnon-existent principal and fictitious profits\u201d in redemption of defendants\u2019 purported but non-existent interests in the Bayou Hedge Funds as reflected in the Funds\u2019 false financial reports <em>(id. </em>at 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">\n<em>Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">This Court has jurisdiction over these core proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1334(b) and 157(a) and (b)(2) and the standing order of reference to bankruptcy judges dated July 10, 1984 signed by Acting Chief Judge Robert J. Ward.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b657-10\">The material facts alleged in the amended complaints may be briefly summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-11\">It is alleged that the original Bayou Fund was organized by Israel and Marino in 1996. Soon after the Bayou Fund opened and started trading, it sustained heavy losses amounting to millions of dollars during 1997 and 1998. To conceal those losses, the Bayou Fund began falsifying its financial disclosures and fraudulently misrepresenting its investment performances. Because the Bayou Fund\u2019s losses could not withstand the scrutiny of an independent audit of year-end 1998 financial results, the Bayou Fund\u2019s independent auditor was terminated and, in its place, Marino (an accountant) created a fictitious accounting firm (Richmond-Fair-field Associates, CPA, PLLC) to pose as the independent auditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-12\">Beginning in 1999 and continuing through 2005 Israel and Marino caused the Bayou Entities, under cover of purported \u201caudits\u201d by Richmond-Fairfield, to continue to generate false performance summaries and false financial statements designed to mislead investors. Because the Bayou Entities were self-administered and lacked a truly independent auditor, they were able to and did maintain books and records that fraudulently misrepresented their true financial performance. As alleged in the amended complaints (quoting from the amended complaint in adversary proceeding no. 06-08354):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b657-13\">14. As Israel and Marino both admitted in their respective plea allocutions, they and their co-conspirators:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9h\">caused to be mailed quarterly reports to investors that contained fictitious rates of return on trading in the funds and annual financial statements that contained fictitious rates of return on trading and inflated net asset[] values. [They] also had faxed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>mailed weekly newsletters that also misrepresented the performance of the funds at various times during the time period set forth in the information. All these communications to investors [ ] made it appear that Bayou was earning profits on trading when in fact it was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b658-4\">Israel further admitted that this false financial information concerning Bayou\u2019s performance was disseminated to \u201ccurrent and prospective clients of Bayou\u201d in order to \u201cinduce [ ] people to invest in Bayou or continue to keep their money in Bayou.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">From 1999 to 2003 the Bayou Fund continued to lose substantial amounts of money and never earned a profit, all the while drawing in hundreds of millions of dollars of new investments. As a result of a reorganization in February 2003, the original Bayou Fund was liquidated and four separate on-shore hedge funds were created, including the three Bayou Hedge Funds which are the debtor-plaintiffs in these adversary proceedings. Investors could transfer their investment in the original Bayou Fund to one of the four new Bayou Hedge Funds. Each of the new Bayou Hedge Funds subsequently sustained millions of dollars in losses, which were concealed through dissemination of false investment performance reports and false financial statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">In addition to trading losses, the Bayou Hedge Funds were depleted for the personal financial benefit of the principals of the Bayou Entities. Tens of millions of dollars in high volume trading commissions were paid to a broker-dealer wholly owned by the principals, and millions of dollars of incentive bonus payments were made to the principals based on non-existent profits. The Bayou Hedge Funds made a series of bank transfers exceeding $100 million out of the Bayou Entities\u2019 accounts to various bank accounts in Europe, which were eventually deposited in a bank account in the United States. This bank account was seized by the Arizona Attorney General in May 2005, and the funds were eventually transferred to the United States Marshals Service, apparently for distribution <em>pro rata </em>to victims of the Bayou fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">During the summer of 2005 the Bayou Entities\u2019 Ponzi scheme finally collapsed. Despite assurance of full payment to the investors, the Bayou Hedge Funds did not repay any money to their investor-creditors. It is alleged on information and belief that the Bayou creditors lost approximately $250 million principal invested.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">\n<em>Fraudulent Redemption Payments to Investors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">The fraudulent conveyance claims asserted in these adversary proceedings seek to recover payments made to the defendant Bayou investors in purported redemption of part or all of their investment interests in the several Bayou Hedge Funds as reflected in the published financials for each of the Funds. Since the financials fraudulently overstated the assets and failed to disclose the losses of the Bayou Hedge Funds and, therefore, overstated the investment accounts of all of the redeeming investors, the redemption payments in respect of greatly reduced or non-existent principal and fictitious profits exceeded the redeeming investors\u2019 contractual entitlements. The Bayou fraud is characterized in the amended complaint as in the nature of a Ponzi scheme because the fraudulent payments to the redeeming investor-defendants were necessarily funded by monies received from new investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">The fraudulent redemption payment scheme alleged in the amended complaints is set forth in the following paragraphs common to all the amended complaints <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>(quoting from the amended complaint in adversary proceeding no. 06-08854):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-5\">24. Prior to August 2005, and during the period of the Bayou Entities\u2019 fraudulent financial scheme, various Bayou investors, including [the named defendants) ], sought to, and did, redeem all or part of their investment in the Bayou Hedge Funds (the \u201cRedeeming Investors\u201d). At the time, the Bayou Hedge Funds\u2019 falsified financial statements reported that the Redeeming Investors\u2019 accounts included substantial gains on their investments. In reality, the Bayou Hedge Funds had lost a substantial portion of investors\u2019 principal and had not made any profits. A true statement of the Redeeming Investors\u2019 accounts would have shown an amount significantly less than the Redeeming Investors\u2019 principal contributions and of course no profits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">25. In an attempt to conceal the ongoing fraud and thereby hinder, delay, or defraud other current and prospective investors, the Bayou Entities paid the Redeeming Investors the inflated amount reflected in the falsified financial statements, including non-existent principal and fictitious profits, not the Redeeming Investors\u2019 true depleted account balances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">26. Due to heavy trading losses and the siphoning of additional funds, the Bayou Entities did not have the funds to pay these redemptions of non-existent principal and fictitious profits to the Redeeming Investors. Accordingly, the Bayou Entities aggressively pursued new investors, and used the incoming capital from those new investors to continue operations and pay redemption proceeds to investors who sought to exit the Bayou Hedge Funds. The Bayou Entities were able to stay afloat only by using the principal invested by new clients to pay the Redeeming Investors. In this way, the Bayou Entities operated as a \u201cPonzi\u201d scheme.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">\n<em>Section 548 Fraudulent Conveyance Claims and Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A8mR\">\n<em>Actual fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">Fraudulent conveyance claims based on actual fraud arise under Bankruptcy Code Section 548(a)(1)(A), which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-11\">(a)(1) The trustee may avoid any transfer (including any transfer to or for the benefit of an insider under an employment contract) of an interest of the debt- or in property, or any obligation (including any obligation to or for the benefit of an insider under an employment contract) incurred by the debtor, that was made or incurred on or within 2 years before the date of the filing of the petition, if the debtor voluntarily or involuntarily\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-12\">(A) made such transfer or incurred such obligation with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any entity to which the debtor was or became, on or after the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, indebted; or</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-13\">Several observations may be made concerning this statute which are germane to the motions to dismiss. This provision, like analogous provisions under state law, avoids the <em>entire </em>amount of \u201cany transfer\u201d which was made by the transfer- or with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors. Moreover, the entirety of the transfer is avoidable whether or not the debtor received value in exchange, and the plaintiff need not allege and prove that the transfer was for less than fair value if actual intent is alleged and proved under Section 548(a)(1)(A). <em>See Sharp Int\u2019l Corp. v. State Street Bank and Trust Co. (In re Sharp Int\u2019l Corp.), </em>403 F.3d 43, 56 (2d Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>McCombs, </em>30 F.3d 310, 328 (2d Cir.1994)) (\u201c[W]here actual intent to defraud creditors is proven, the conveyance will be set aside regardless of the adequacy of consideration given.\u201d) (applying the actual fraudulent conveyance provision of the DCL); <em>see also Scholes v. Lehmann, </em>56 F.3d 750, 757 (7th Cir.1995), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>1995 U.S.App. LEXIS 17088 (7th Cir. 1995), <em>cert. denied sub nom. African Enterprise, Inc. v. Scholes, </em>516 U.S. 1028, 116 S.Ct. 673, 133 L.Ed.2d 522 (1995) (under analogous Illinois fraudulent conveyance statute, \u201cif fraudulent intent is proved, then ... the defendant, unless he had no knowledge of the transferor\u2019s fraudulent intent must return the entire payment that he received rather than just the amount by which it exceeded the consideration that he gave in exchange for the payment\u201d); <em>Hayes v. Palm Seedlings Partners-A (In re Agric. Research and Tech. Group, Inc.), </em>916 F.2d 528, 538 (9th Cir.1990) (under Section 548(a)(1)(A), \u201cthe entire transfer may be avoided, even if reasonably equivalent value was given, so long as the transferor actually intended to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors and the transferee accepted the transfer without good faith\u201d); <em>Kendall v. Turner (In re Turner), </em>335 B.R. 140, 145 (Bankr.N.D.Cal.2005), <em>modified on reconsideration by, </em>345 B.R. 674 (Bankr.N.D.Cal.2006) (\u201cthe entire transfer is avoided\u201d under Section 548(a)(1)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code); 5 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 548.01[1] at 548-11 (15th ed. 2006) (\u201c[I]f the transaction is fraudulent within the rules set forth in section 548, the trustee may avoid it in its entirety without any limitation on the extent of the recovery other than those imposed by \u00a7 548(c) to protect transferees and obligees in good faith.\u201d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Consistent with the statutory language (\u201cany transfer\u201d) and the foregoing authorities, the courts have held in the context of fraudulent investment schemes that the entirety of redemption payments made to investors may be avoided including repayments of principal actually invested by the defendants. <em>See Jobin v. McKay (In re M &amp; L Business Machine Co., Inc.), </em>84 F.3d 1330, 1334 (10th Cir.1996) (upholding district court\u2019s affirmance of bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling that \u201cthe trustee was entitled to avoid all of the challenged transfers under \u00a7 548(a)(1)\u201d); <em>Terry v. June, </em>432 F.Supp.2d 635, 642 (W.D.Va.2006) (\u201ca defendant who wishes to retain the principal he received back must establish the good faith defense when the plaintiff has established that the transferor conveyed funds to him with actual intent to defraud creditors\u201d); <em>see also </em>Mark A. McDermott, <em>Ponzi Schemes and the Law of Fraudulent and Preferential Transfers, </em>72 Am. Bankr. L.J. 157, 173 (1998) (A claim of actual fraud \u201cpresents a substantial advantage to the trustee in a fraudulent conveyance action ... [since] under an actual fraud theory, the trustee may be able to recover all amounts transferred to an investor, including both fictitious profits and returns of the investor\u2019s principal investments, regardless of the investor\u2019s subjective good faith.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">One of the defendants has argued mistakenly that redemption of principal investments cannot be avoided under Section 548(a)(1)(A) and that the cases \u201care legion\u201d holding that \u201crepayment of less than all of the principal investment to a defrauded investor cannot be a fraudulent conveyance.\u201d Two of the cases this defendant relies upon, <em>Scholes v. Lehmann </em>and <em>Terry v. June </em>(both cited above), hold precisely the opposite, and the other cases relied upon (including this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Balaber-Strauss v. Sixty-Five Brokers (In re Churchill Mortgage Investment Corp.), </em>256 B.R. 664 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.2000), <em>aff'd sub nom. Balaber-Strauss v. Lawrence, </em>264 B.R. 303 (S.D.N.Y.2001)) involved constructive fraud claims under Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>548(a)(1)(B), rather than actual fraud claims under Section 548(a)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Note that the three kinds of misconduct mentioned in the statute are in the disjunctive \u2014 the mischief at which the statute is aimed is to \u201chinder, delay, or defraud.\u201d Moreover, the statute covers such mischief whether aimed at present or future creditors of the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">As is clear from the statutory language (\u201cif the <em>debtor ... </em>made such transfer ... with actual intent..\u201d), the claim of actual fraud looks only to the fraudulent intent of the transferor/debtor. Neither the language of Code Section 548(a)(1)(A) nor the case law requires the plaintiff to allege or prove that the transferee had any intent to hinder, delay or defraud or any knowledge of the transfer- or\u2019s fraudulent intent. Although the knowledge or innocence of the transferee is irrelevant to a plaintiffs claim based on the transferor\u2019s intent to \u201chinder, delay, or defraud,\u201d it is central to the defendant-transferee\u2019s affirmative defense under Section 548(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">\n<em>The defense of good faith and value</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">\u201cGood faith\u201d and \u201cvalue\u201d may be a defense to a fraudulent conveyance claim under subsection (c) of Section 548, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-9\">(c) Except to the extent that a transfer or obligation voidable under this section is voidable under section 544, 545, or 547 of this title, a transferee or obligee of such transfer or obligation that takes for value and in good faith has a lien on or may retain any interest transferred or may enforce any obligation incurred, as the case may be, to the extent that such transferee or obligee gave value to the debtor in exchange for such transfer or obligation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">The good faith/value defense provided in Section 548(c) is an affirmative defense, and the burden is on the defendant-transferee to plead and establish facts to prove the defense. <em>Silverman v. Actrade Capital, Inc. (In re Actrade Fin. Techs. Ltd.), </em>337 B.R. 791, 805 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.2005) (quoting <em>Breeden v. L.I.

It bears repeating on these motions that the plaintiff in a Section 548(a)(1)(A) claim does not have the burden to allege and prove that the defendant-transferee did not give value for or act in good faith in receiving the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-12\">\n<em>Constructive fraud</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b661-13\">Claims based on constructive fraud arise under subpart (B) of Section 548(a)(1), which provides in pertinent part [omitting new subsection (IV) ]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-14\">... if the debtor voluntarily or involuntarily:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-15\"># * * \u2756 <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-16\">(B) (i) received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for such transfer or obligation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-17\">(ii) (I) was insolvent on the date that such transfer was made or such obligation was incurred, or be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>came insolvent as a result of such transfer or obligation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\">(II) was engaged in business or a transaction, or was about to engage in business or a transaction, for which any property remaining with the debt- or was an unreasonably small capital;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">(III) intended to incur, or believed that the debtor would incur, debts that would be beyond the debtor\u2019s ability to pay as such debts matured; or</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The plaintiff in a claim for constructive fraud under Section 548(a)(1)(B) has the burden of pleading and proving that the debtor received less than reasonably equivalent value for the transfer, and also that the debtor was insolvent at the time of or was rendered insolvent by the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">\n<em>The Motions to Dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The motions to dismiss are based on Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 9(b) and 12(b)(6), made applicable in bankruptcy proceedings under Bankruptcy Rules 7009 and 7012. Rule 12(b)(6) provides for a motion \u201c(6) to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Rule 9(b) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">Rule 9.

They assert that the Bayou facts do not constitute a classic Ponzi scheme so that the \u201cPonzi scheme presumption\u201d does not apply, and that plaintiffs have not alleged \u201cbadges of fraud\u201d sufficient to give rise to an inference of actual intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Defendants\u2019 restricted definition of \u201ca <em>true </em>Ponzi scheme\u201d (promise of high returns, no legitimate underlying business activity and the certainty that later investors cannot possibly be repaid) does not accord with the case law. Numerous decisions have established two broad principles. First, the label \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d has been applied to any sort of inherently fraudulent arrangement under which the debtor-transferor must utilize after-acquired investment funds to pay off previous investors in order to forestall disclosure of the fraud. <em>See Rosen v. Neilson (In re Slatkin), </em>310 B.R. 740, 743 n. 3 (C.D.Cal.2004) (citing <em>Danning v. Bozek (In re Bullion Reserve of N. Am.), </em>836 F.2d 1214, 1219 n. 8 (9th Cir.1988)) (\u201cA \u2018Ponzi\u2019 scheme is any sort of fraudulent arrangement that uses later acquired funds or products to pay off previous investors.\u201d); <em>Hayes v. Palm Seedlings Partners (In re Agric. Research and Tech. Group, Inc.), </em>916 F.2d 528, 536 (9th Cir. 1990) (\u201cDistributing funds to earlier investors from the receipt of monies from later investors is the hallmark of Ponzi schemes.\u201d); <em>Cuthill v. Kime (In re Evergreen Sec., Ltd.), </em>319 B.R. 245, 249 (Bankr. M.D.Fla.2003) (finding a Ponzi scheme where the debtor \u201cused most funds received from new investors to pay prior investor claims\u201d). Second, where funds acquired from the later investors are used to make payments to earlier investors in redemption of impaired or non-existent account balances and fictitious profits, \u201cactual intent\u201d to hinder, delay and defraud is presumed. <em>Quilling v. Stark, </em>2006 WL 1683442, at *6 (N.D.Tex. June 19, 2006) (\u201cThe existence of a <em>Ponzi </em>scheme as alleged in the complaint makes the transfer of investor funds fraudulent as a matter of law.\u201d(citation omitted)) (emphasis in original); <em>Terry v. June, </em>432 F.Supp.2d 635, 639 (W.D.Va.2006) (\u201c[C]ourts have widely found that Ponzi scheme operators necessarily act with actual intent to defraud creditors due to the very nature of their schemes.\u201d); <em>Jobin v. Lalan (In re M &amp; L Business Machine Co., Inc.), </em>160 B.R. 851, 857 (Bankr.D.Colo.1993), <em>aff'd, </em>167 B.R. 219 (1994) (\u201c[I]n a Ponzi scheme the only inference that a court can make is that the Debtor had the requisite intent to hinder, delay or defraud under \u00a7 548(a)(1).\u201d). <em>See also, Bauman v. Bliese, et al. (In re McCarn\u2019s Allstate Fin., Inc.), </em>326 B.R. 843, 850 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.2005) (\u201cBankruptcy courts nationwide have recognized that establishing the existence of a Ponzi scheme is sufficient to prove a Debtor\u2019s actual intent to defraud.\u201d); <em>Rieser v. Hay slip, et al. (In re Canyon Sys. Corp.), </em>343 B.R. 615, 636-37 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 2006) (holding that \u201c[a]ctual intent to hinder, delay or defraud may be established as a matter of law in cases in which the debtor runs a Ponzi scheme or a similar illegitimate enterprise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">A \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d within the broader scope defined in these authorities is precisely what is alleged in the amended complaints in these adversary proceedings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>The presumption of \u201cactual intent\u201d to hinder, delay and defraud is both intuitive and inescapable on the facts which are alleged in the amended complaints \u2014 that redemption payments of wholly- or partially-nonexistent investment account balances and wholly-fictitious profits, as reflected on fraudulent financial statements, were made to earlier investors requesting redemption using funds invested by subsequent investors. Indeed, it is impossible to imagine any motive for such conduct other than actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Putting aside the Ponzi scheme presumption, the \u201cbadges of fraud\u201d alleged in the amended complaints are more than ample to comply with the requirement of Rule 9(b) that fraud be pleaded with particularity. The amended complaints alleged that the Bayou Hedge Funds never earned a profit and suffered heavy trading losses; that the Bayou Entities\u2019 former principals siphoned money from the Bayou Hedge Funds for their own personal use; that the Bayou Entities intentionally disseminated false financial statements and performance reports misrepresenting that the Funds had earned substantial investment gains; that from 1998 on the Bayou Entities made use of a fictitious \u201cindependent\u201d auditor, Riehmond-Fairfield, to certify the false financial statements; that the Bayou Entities\u2019 principals, Israel and Marino, pleaded guilty to felonies related to the fraudulent conduct alleged in the amended complaints; and that Israel\u2019s plea allocution, which is quoted in the amended complaints, acknowledges that the fraud was designed to \u201cinduce[ ] people to invest in Bayou or continue to keep their money in Bayou.\u201d It is difficult to imagine a more comprehensive compendium of alleged \u201cbadges of fraud,\u201d all of which compel the inference that the redemption payments sought to be recovered here were made by the Bayou Hedge Funds with the actual intent to hinder, delay and defraud both present and future creditors, <em>ie., </em>present investors who were induced to continue their investments and prospective investors which the principals of the Bayou Hedge Funds hoped to and did induce to invest in the Funds in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">\n<em>Value; fictitious profits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">Defendants assert that by returning investment principal to the defendants the Bayou Hedge Funds satisfied their antecedent debt to the defendants and thereby received \u201cvalue.\u201d A few simple propositions will suffice to demonstrate why this proposition, although true, does not support dismissal of the amended complaints for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The defendants cannot and do not claim that they, as investors, had any contractual right to repayment or redemption of amounts invested to the extent that their investments had been depleted by losses or misappropriation by Bayou insiders. It is also clear under the case law, as defendants assert, that persons who were induced by fraud to invest in the Bayou Hedge Funds or predecessor funds may have a state law claim for rescission, and that this tort claim is an antecedent debt which constitutes value for purposes of Section 548(a)(1)(B) and Section 548(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Plaintiffs acknowledge that defendants\u2019 tort claims for rescission of the entire amount of their principal invested constitute value for purposes of Section 548(a)(1)(B). Consequently, plaintiffs\u2019 constructive fraud claims under Section 548(a)(1)(B) are limited to any fictitious profits which were paid to any of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">But as noted above, plaintiffs\u2019 claims under Section 548(a)(1)(A) based on actual intent seek to recover the entirety of \u201cany transfer\u201d by the Bayou Hedge Funds to the defendants, not simply those transfers as to which the Funds did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>receive any value. Plaintiffs are entitled to recover the entirety of any transfer made with actual intent to defraud whether or not the plaintiffs received value in exchange for the transfer. Accordingly, the fact that the Bayou Hedge Funds received value on account of the redemption payments by reason of the extinguishment of the defendants\u2019 rescission tort claims is irrelevant to plaintiffs\u2019 claims under Section 548(a)(1)(A) and does not constitute a ground to dismiss those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Several defendants have advanced alternate theories that the fictitious profits portion of redemption payments which they received should be deemed to constitute payments on antecedent debts for interest on their Bayou investments, either contractual interest relying on <em>Daly v. Deptula (In re Carrozzella &amp; Richardson), </em>286 B.R. 480 (D.Conn.2002) and <em>Lustig v. Weisz and Associates, Inc. (In re Unified Commercial Capital, Inc.), </em>No. 01-MBK-6004L, 2002 WL 32500567 (W.D.N.Y.2002), or as statutory \u201cprejudgment interest\u201d under New York Civil Practice Law and Rules Section 5001. Neither theory is sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The <em>Carrozzella </em>and <em>Unified Commercial Capital </em>cases both involved contractual rights to interest. Bayou investors had no contractual right to interest. The concept of prejudgment interest is not applicable because there is no generalized right, or claim to, or cause of action for such interest independent of a judgment. CPLR \u00a7 5001 provides for prejudgment interest \u201cupon a sum awarded.\u201d When the defendants demanded redemption of and were paid their Bayou account balances including the fictitious profits recorded in the fictitious Bayou financial statements, there was no \u201cpresent or antecedent debt\u201d for prejudgment interest. Defendants\u2019 receipt of their redemption payments extinguished any putative rights to statutory prejudgment interest which might have been awarded if they had sought and obtained a judgment against the Bayou Hedge Funds, which they did not. \u201cAn acceptance of payment on a principal indebtedness extinguishes the claim for prejudgment interest....\u201d <em>Guy James Constr. Co. v. Trinity Indus., Inc., </em>644 F.2d 525, 532 (5th Cir.1981), <em>opinion modified by, </em>650 F.2d 93 (1981); <em>see also Bedard v. Martin, 100 </em>P.3d 584, 589 (Colo. Ct.App.2004) (finding that where plaintiff accepted payment \u201crepresenting the full purchase price of the property, he lost his right to recover prejudgment interest.\u201d); <em>Hammond v. Carthage Sulphite Pulp &amp; Paper Co., </em>34 F.2d 157, 158 (N.D.N.Y. 1928) (\u201cInterest, except in cases where there is a contract to pay it, does not constitute a debt capable of a distinct claim.... [T]he acceptance of the principal, even under protest, without a separate agreement for the payment of interest, extinguishes the claim and bars a claim for its payment.\u201d(eitations omitted)); 47 <em>C.J.S. Interest &amp; Usury </em>\u00a7 136 (West 2006) (\u201c[W]here interest is recoverable other than under a contract, and payment of the principal as such is made and accepted, no interest can be recovered, the payment of the debt extinguishing the right to recover interest thereon. Interest, in such a case, is merely incidental to the debt or principal and cannot exist without it. Thus interest cannot be recovered in a separate action.\u201d(footnotes omitted)). The Second Circuit has held that \u201ccontingent, inchoate interests in property\u201d such as the theoretical right to receive prejudgment interest on a putative judgment for fraudulent inducement claims that were never asserted do not constitute \u201cfair consideration\u201d under the analogous provision of DCL \u00a7 272. <em>HBE Leasing Corp. v. Frank, </em>61 F.3d 1054, 1058-59 (2d Cir.1995) (transferee did not provide \u201cfair consideration\u201d by giving up \u201ccontingent rights that otherwise <em>might </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>accrue to [transferee\u2019s] benefit <em>in the future\u201d) </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Plaintiffs are correct in asserting in their brief \u201cthat -virtually every court to address the question has held unflinchingly \u2018that to the extent that investors have received payments in excess of the amounts they have invested, those payments are voidable as fraudulent transfers,\u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Soule v. Alliot (In re Tiger Petroleum Co.), </em>319 B.R. 225, 239 (Bankr. N.D.Okla.2004). <em>See also, Scholes v. Lehmann, </em>56 F.3d at 757; <em>Sender v.

(In re Canyon Sys. Corp.), </em>343 B.R. 615, 643-45 (Bankr. S.D.Ohio 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">\n<em>Misplaced reliance on Sharp and Churchill decisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The defendants rely heavily on a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in <em>Sharp International Corp. v. State Street Bank and Trust Company (In re Sharp International Corp.), </em>403 F.3d 43 (2d Cir.2005). In that case debtor Sharp, a closely-held corporation, was looted by its controlling shareholders. Through its trustee in bankruptcy Sharp sued one of the company\u2019s former lenders, State Street Bank and Trust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d), for (i) aiding and abetting the insiders\u2019 breaches of fiduciary duty, and for receiving payment from Sharp that constituted (ii) a constructive fraudulent conveyance or (iii) an intentionally fraudulent conveyance. The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s dismissal of these claims was affirmed by the District Court and by the Second Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">State Street began to suspect fraud on the part of Sharp in the summer of 1998, conducted a private investigation and concluded in November 1998 that its suspicions were well founded. As noted by the Second Circuit, \u201c[t]he nub of the complaint is that State Street then arranged quietly for the Spitzes [controlling Sharp insiders] to repay the State Street loan from the proceeds of new loans from unsuspecting lenders.... \u201d 403 F.3d at 47. When State Street demanded repayment, Sharp arranged for a financing from certain investor-noteholders in the amount of $25 million, $10 million more than Sharp owed to State Street. Sharp paid State Street approximately $12.25 million from the proceeds, and the Sharp insiders gave personal promissory notes for the remaining $2.75 million of the State Street debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">The Court of Appeals rejected the aiding and abetting claim on the grounds that State Street had come by whatever knowledge it had of the fraud by the Sharp insiders \u201cthrough diligent inquiries that any other lender could have made. Sharp fails to identify any duty on State Street\u2019s part to participate in its own loss in order to protect lenders that were less diligent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52-53. The constructive and actual fraudulent conveyance claims, asserted under the New York DCL, were also dismissed. The constructive fraudulent conveyance claim failed because there was no basis to allege lack of \u201cfair consideration\u201d in Sharp\u2019s repayment to State Street of $12.25 million of the $15 million for which Sharp was indebted to State Street. As such, the repayment constituted no more than a preference of one non-insider creditor over others which was not within ninety days of the bankruptcy filing and therefore was not recoverable under Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">In rejecting the intentional fraudulent conveyance claim, the Court of Appeals began by noting that under DCL \u00a7 276 a creditor must show intent to defraud on the part of the transferor, and that where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>such intent is shown the conveyance will be set aside regardless of the adequacy of consideration. After adverting to the New York case law under which actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud may be established circumstantially by reference to \u201cbadges of fraud,\u201d the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">Sharp argues that the district court inappropriately focused on \u201cbadges of fraud\u201d even though the Spitzes\u2019 fraud was so clearly established that it need not be detected by indicia. However, the intentional fraudulent conveyance claims fails [sic] for the independent reason that Sharp inadequately alleges fraud with respect to the transaction that Sharp seeks to void, i.e., Sharp\u2019s $12.25 million payment to State Street, [citation omitted]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">The fraud alleged in the complaint relates to the manner in which Sharp obtained new funding from the Note-holders, not Sharp\u2019s subsequent payment of part of the proceeds to State Street. The $12.25 million payment was at most a preference between creditors and did not \u201chinder, delay, or defraud either present or future creditors.\u201d [citations omitted]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">The reliance of several defendants on a passage quoted from this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Balaber-Strauss v. Sixty-Five Brokers (In re Churchill Mortgage Investment Corp.), </em>256 B.R. 664 is also inapposite. The decision in the <em>Churchill </em>case granted motions to dismiss in 65 adversary proceedings against individual brokers who were employed as independent contractors by the Churchill entities to identify and solicit investors in the various Churchill investment funds. The adversary proceedings sought to recover as constructive fraudulent conveyances the commissions paid to the brokers for success in finding investors. It was not alleged that any of the brokers had any knowledge of the fraud perpetrated by the Churchill entities. The passage relied upon by several defendants was part of this Court\u2019s discussion of legal authorities concerning constructive fraudulent conveyance claims, <em>not </em>claims based upon actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud. The passage in question reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">Suffice it to say that <em>Independent Clearing House </em>stands for the universally-accepted rule that investors may retain distributions from an entity engaged in a Ponzi scheme to the extent of their investments, while distributions exceeding their investments constitute fraudulent conveyances which may be recovered by the Trustee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-11\">256 B.R. at 682. As shown by the discussion and citations above, this is a correct statement of the law with respect to constructive fraudulent conveyance claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-12\">In the <em>Churchill </em>case, the Trustee acknowledged that there was no basis to assert that the Churchill entities acted with intent to hinder, delay or defraud in paying the brokers the commissions which the brokers concededly earned. Rather, the Trustee argued that the brokers did not provide equivalent \u201cvalue\u201d or \u201cfair consideration\u201d in exchange for their commission payments because the new investors which their efforts produced for the Churchill funds enabled the Churchill Ponzi scheme to continue and increased the ultimate universe of defrauded investors. This theory was rejected by this Court, and by the District Court which affirmed, because the transaction at issue \u2014 the good faith rendition of services by the brokers and their compensation in the form of commissions at fair market rates \u2014 were not constructively fraudulent because the services rendered constituted fair value in exchange for the commissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-13\">The Court of Appeals decision in <em>Sharp </em>and the Bankruptcy and District Court decisions in <em>Churchill </em>all stand for a cen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>tral postulate in fraudulent conveyance analysis. That is, the Court must focus precisely on the specific transaction or transfer sought to be avoided in order to determine whether that transaction falls within the statutory parameters of either an intentional or constructive fraudulent conveyance. In <em>Churchill, </em>the specific transaction at issue was the payment of commissions to brokers who were lawfully hired for a lawful purpose to render lawful services at commission rates which were concededly fair compensation for the services actually rendered. The fact that the Churchill entities were engaged in fraudulent activities which were collateral to the lawful and good faith work of and payments to the brokers was not germane under the language of the statutes (both the Bankruptcy Code and the DCL) which require the Court to focus on the specific transfers at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">In the <em>Sharp </em>case, the specific transfer at issue was the repayment of a loan which Sharp owed to State Street. The satisfaction of a legitimate antecedent debt constituted fair value, which foreclosed any constructive fraudulent conveyance claim. The repayment of State Street doubtless resulted in the preference of State Street over other creditors, and as such the repayment would have been avoidable under Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code if it had occurred within ninety days of Sharp\u2019s bankruptcy filing. But there was nothing inherently fraudulent, deceitful, unlawful or otherwise wrongful in Sharp\u2019s fully-disclosed repayment of a valid antecedent debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The contrast with the redemption payments at issue in these adversary proceedings is stark and erystalizes the fundamental difference between <em>Sharp </em>and the Section 548(a)(1)(A) claims here. In contrast to the lawful and disclosed payment of a valid contractual antecedent debt in <em>Sharp, </em>the redemption payments at issue here of non-existent investor account balances as misrepresented in fraudulent financial statements were themselves inherently fraudulent and constituted an integral and essential component of the fraudulent Ponzi scheme alleged in the amended complaints. The payments alleged here of fictitious account balances and profits were inherently deceitful and unlawful and were necessarily made with intent to \u201chinder, delay or defraud\u201d present and future creditors. No such allegation was made in <em>Sharp, </em>which involved only a disclosed repayment of a valid antecedent debt actually owed to State Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Sharp </em>focused on the specific transaction there at issue\u2014 Sharp\u2019s repayment of its loan indebtedness to State Street \u2014 and concluded that there was nothing inherently fraudulent in that repayment. Noting that \u201c[t]he fraud alleged in the complaint relates to the manner in which Sharp obtained new funding from the Noteholders, not Sharp\u2019s subsequent payment of part of the proceeds to State Street,\u201d the Court of Appeals refused to attribute to Sharp\u2019s lawful repayment to State Street an \u201cactual intent to hinder, delay or defraud\u201d based not on the lawful payment to State Street, but upon a separate and different transaction, Sharp\u2019s fraudulent obtaining of funds from the Noteholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Unlike the lawful repayment of loan indebtedness to State Street, the redemption payments in this case were themselves inherently fraudulent, and Bayou\u2019s only possible intent in making the redemption payments was to hinder, delay and defraud creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">\n<em>The good faith defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">Little need be said of defendants\u2019 contentions that they received the redemption payments in good faith and without knowledge of any fraud, and that the amended complaints do not adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>plead want of good faith on their part. It is sufficient to point out that the defendants\u2019 good faith is an affirmative defense under Section 548(c) which must be pleaded in the first instance as a defense by the defendants. It is not incumbent on the plaintiffs to plead lack of good faith on defendants\u2019 part because lack of good faith is not an element of a plaintiffs claim under Section 548(a)(1). Moreover, the plaintiffs are entitled to conduct discovery on the issue of defendants\u2019 good faith and, if the plaintiffs discover evidence which they believe may be sufficient to rebut the defense under Section 548(c), the issue generally would entail disputed issues of fact requiring a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">In any event, the plaintiffs\u2019 failure to adequately plead a lack of good faith on the part of the defendants is not a ground for dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Accepting as true the facts pleaded in the amended complaints and drawing all inferences which may be warranted by such facts, the plaintiffs in these adversary proceedings have pleaded valid, <em>prima facie </em>claims for avoidance of the redemption payments in their entirety under Section 548(a)(1)(A) based on actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud, and valid claims for avoidance of payments in redemption of purported fictitious profits as constructive fraudulent conveyances under Section 548(a)(1)(B). Plaintiffs may or may not be able to prove the requisite facts to establish the elements of their claims under Sections 548(a)(1)(A) and (B) or to rebut the defendants\u2019 assertions of good faith under Section 548(c) after discovery and a trial on the merits. But the plaintiffs\u2019 claims have been adequately pleaded, and the motions to dismiss under Rule 9(b) and Rule 12(b)(6) must be denied. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel are directed to prepare an appropriate order and circulate it to all defense counsel for approval as to form before submission to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">_Schedule A_</p>\n<p id=\"AHd\">Bayou Accredited Fund, LLC v.
