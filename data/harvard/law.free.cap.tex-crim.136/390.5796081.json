Consequently the punishment which he received was authorized by Art. 62 P. C., which provides that \u201cIf it be shown on the trial of a felony less than capital that the defendant has been before convicted of the same offense, or one of the same nature, the punishment on such second or other subsequent conviction shall be the highest which is affixed to the commission of such offenses in ordinary cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">The record is before us without a statement of facts or bills of exceptions. The objections to the court\u2019s charge cannot be properly appraised in the absence of a statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-17\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b416-5\">Graves, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aan\">The appellant asks for the granting of a motion for rehearing because of the fact that due to his inability to employ an attorney in his original trial in the lower court, his defense to the charge was not properly presented. There is no statement of facts in the record, and we are unable to tell what the proof was against him, nor can we speculate as to what his d\u00e9fense was, or should have been. However, we do find that he was represented by an attorney upon his trial, and a defense of insanity was presented to the trial court, and by the trial court charged upon in his charge to the jury. A further charge upon circumstantial evidence seems to have been refused. Doubtless the court did not think such a charge was called for by the facts, and in the absence of a statement of facts we presume that his ruling thereon was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
