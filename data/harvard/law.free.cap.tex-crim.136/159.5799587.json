The only proof offered in support of the averment in the indictment that appellant had been previously convicted in Massachusetts was a judgment naming Joseph Angus as the convict. The judgment alone was not sufficient to establish the identity of appellant as the person named therein. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The court submitted the question whether appellant had theretofore been previously convicted, as alleged in the indictment, and, in response to such instruction, the jury found that he had been convicted, and assessed his punishment at confinement in the penitentiary for life. In order to enhance the penalty, it was imperative that the state establish the identity of appellant as the person convicted under the indictment returned in the State of Massachusetts. Huston v.
