The offense was charged to have been committed upon the person of Louise Henson, she being a child of the age of eleven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The testimony of the little girl shows that appellant was a friend of the family, and was present at their home at the noon hour of the day of the alleged assault and ate the noon meal with the family then at home, consisting of the mother and two sisters and one brother, all the children being younger than Louise; that appellant left the house after the noon meal with the mother; that appellant soon returned by himself, the mother not being with him, his conduct being evidenced by the following quotation from Louise\u2019s testimony: \u201cWhen he came back, he came in, he brought some candy back to the children and he gave me the candy and told me they could go on the porch and make a playhouse, so they went on the porch and I locked the screen door and came back in and sat down and the first thing he did then, he said \u2018You sure are getting pretty, in two ways,\u2019 and I said, \u2018What do you mean.\u2019 And he put his hand up like that and after he did that he told me to come over he wanted to tell me something, so I went over and he put his hand on my shoulder and said T am going in the toilet, you watch me.and I\u2019ll watch you and I will show you how it is done and it will be between me and you. Well, I didn\u2019t go to the bathroom but told him to get out but he went in the bath room and when I went over to get a newspaper off the Victrola, it was over in that corner of the room, he had the door open and he had his privates out playing with them and I told him to get out right now, and he said T will now but don\u2019t tell your mother, I will go but don\u2019t tell your mother,\u2019 and I said T will tell my mother everything,\u2019 and so, he left. I just felt so ashamed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">While this conduct complained of by the little girl is reprehensible and punishable under the statute as an indecent exposure of the person, we must confess that we have searched the record for any evidence of violence of any kind, or any threatening gesture upon the part of appellant toward\u2019s the little girl\u2019s person upon which could be predicated a conviction for an assault. There is nothing in the record that can inform us as to how appellant \u201cput his hand like that,\u201d and the sentence immediately following shows that such was but a gesture, for the witness continues: \u201cand after he did that he told me to come <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>over, he wanted to tell me something.\u201d The only time that the testimony shows that appellant touched the witness was when \u201che put his hand on my shoulder\u201d and made the statement about her watching him when he went into the toilet. If this statement was strong enough to have come under subdivision 6 of Art. 1147 of the Penal Code, it is sufficient to say that the complaint and information did not contain allegations sufficient to charge an offense under such a subdivision;'instead he was held and tried under another and different subdivision thereof, it being subdivision No. 5, denouncing the offense of an assault by an adult male upon a female.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Under the facts as presented to us, we are forced to the conclusion that they are insufficient, and this judgment therefore is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
