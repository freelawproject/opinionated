The State then introduced the confession of appellant, as follows: \u201cMy name is Phillip Cooper and I work for Mr. Will Allen. Some time in December, 1937, I met Henry Lynch and Ivory Clifton over at Steve Lynch\u2019s house and we left there and went over into Mrs. Ada Lee\u2019s field and roped a cow that belonged to Mr. J. B. McKenzie and drove her over to Mr. Dick Coulter\u2019s house. About 50 yards before we got to Mr. Coulter\u2019s house, Henry and Ivory told me that I had better not go up to the house, that Mr. Coulter wouldn\u2019t like it if too many of us got in on it. I waited there until Henry and Ivory came back and I didn\u2019t get any money out of this deal until Christmas eve day, when Ivory paid me $1.50. We knew this cow belonged to Mr. J. B. McKenzie and we took it without his knowledge or consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">The appellant was working for Mr. W. J. Allen, a surety on his bond, and after appellant\u2019s release on bond he had the following conversation with Mr. Allen: \u201cWith reference to this cow, he (defendant) told me he was into it and wanted me to help him get out of it, easiest way he could. I said, \u2018Philip\u2019, if you want me to help you get out of it, tell the truth. I don\u2019t know where you were at or what you did,\u2019 and I asked him, \u2018Are you guilty ?\u2019 He said \u2018Yes, sir, I am guilty. I was over at Uncle Steve Lynch\u2019s and Henry Lynch approached him and asked him to go across the field and help him. He told him he wouldn\u2019t do no such thing but Henry over-persuaded him and he went over there and Ivory Christian and Henry Lynch got <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the cow a little before sundown, roped her and carried her to Dick Coulter\u2019s in the night. When they got about one hundred yards from Dick Coulter\u2019s, they told him to go down there, that they wouldn\u2019t want too many there. Said he remained there until they came back. Then Mr. Coulter said, \u2018This is Mr. McKenzie\u2019s cow and I wont pay for her now, but if he doesn\u2019t locate her I will pay for her later on.\u2019 Said Christmas day some of them gave him a dollar and a half for helping take the cow over there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Appellant offers the proposition that the corpus delicti can not be established by the confession alone, and that therefore the testimony is insufficient to show his guilt. While the proposition above advanced is true as an abstract proposition, we do not think the same applies in this case. The confession can be looked to in aid of the establishment of the corpus delicti, and when taken into consideration herein, in conjunction with the loss of the animal by Mr. McKenzie, and appellant\u2019s reiteration of his professions of guilt before Mr. Allen, we are constrained to hold that the testimony is sufficient upon which to uphold the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt. This heifer was missed from the pasture where she was kept about December 15, 1937, and had not been recovered on the date of the trial June 27, 1938, and we think that the testimony as a whole is convincing that appellant and others took this cow as set forth in his confessions. So believing, the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
