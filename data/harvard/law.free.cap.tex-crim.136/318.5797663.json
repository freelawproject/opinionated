However an inspection of the transcript evidences an error in the complaint and information that is fatal to the conviction. The information, in the charging part thereof, alleges \u201cThat Americus Evage on or about the 15th day of September, A. D. 1938, and before the filing of the complaint and this information in the County of Wichita, and the State of Texas, did then and there unlawfully on or about his person a pistol against the peace and dignity of the State;\u201d and the complaint is identical therewith in the charging part thereof. These pleadings are defective in two particulars. In the first instance in that neither alleges that the appellant \u201ccarried\u201d such pistol; and in the second instance that they do allege that he carried same on <em>or </em>about his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Mr. Branch\u2019s Penal Code, p. 556, Sec. 967, says: \u201cAn indictment or information alleging that defendant did carry on \u2018or\u2019 about his person a pistol is bad for uncertainty, because the allegation is in the alternative,\u201d citing many cases. The complaint and information should have alleged the matter in the conjunctive, and further they should have contained an allegation that appellant \u201ccarried\u201d such a pistol on and about his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Both of these reasons will cause us to reverse this judgment and order the prosecution dismissed on account of the failure of the complaint and information to charge a violation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">Judgment reversed and prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
