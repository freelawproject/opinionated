It appears, however, that the sentence herein does not conform to the provisions of the indeterminate sentence law,. Vernon\u2019s Ann. C. C. P., Art. 775. The same is therefore reformed so as to sentence the appellant to serve a term of not less than two nor more than twenty-five years in the state penitentiary, and as reformed the judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
