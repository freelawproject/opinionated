On the 11th day of December, 1936, the case against Paradis was called for trial. He failed to appear and judgment nisi was entered against him and his sureties on his- bond. Upon proper notice the judgment nisi was made final on the 29th day of June, 1938, against Paradis and J. A. Petty, from which judgment the said Petty brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">The evidence heard to determine whether the judgment nisi should be made final is substantially the same as that set out in cause No. 20,109, Henry Darwin \u2022 Caldwell, et al vs. State, this day decided (Page 524 of this volume), and appellants\u2019 contention in this case is the same as that made in the case mentioned; viz: that the forfeiture was not taken in compliance with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">The same reason which lead to the judgment of affirmance in cause No. 20,109 is operative here and results in theaffirmance of the present case, and it is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b572-11\">ON APPELLANTS\u2019 MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b572-12\">Christian, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AeB\">After carefully re-examining the record in the light of appellants\u2019 motion for rehearing, we are constrained to adhere to the conclusion expressed in the original opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
