State, No. 19,981, this day decided by us. (Page 381 of this volume). The facts proved in this case are in all essential respects similar to those proved upon the trial of that case and the same legal questions are involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-18\">For the reasons there stated, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-19\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>ON MOTION FOR REHEARING TO MODIFY OR ENLARGE OPINION.</p>\n<author id=\"b411-5\">Hawkins, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Aq0\">We think appellant\u2019s request for postponement of his motion should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">It occurs to us that our observations as to certain evidence in our opinion in the companion case, No. 19,981, Raymond Ballew v.
