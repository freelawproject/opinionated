(Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211 and 211a.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">The main thrust of the appeal is that reversal is required, based upon evidence not adduced at trial; that by virtue of the failure to interview a witness and thereafter to exercise a reasonable tactical decision as to whether to call said person to testify, the trial was relegated to a farce and a sham. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ibarra, </em>60 Cal.2d 460, 464 [34 Cal.Rptr. 863, 386 P.2d 487].)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">The issue was not raised before the trial court by way of motion for new trial, hence determination is properly by way of writ of habeas corpus and not by direct appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pena, 25 </em>Cal.App.3d 414, 423 [101 Cal.Rptr. 804].)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">There is another contention, however, which has merit and necessitates reversal, i.e., that \u201cThe trial court erred in admitting the testimony of Alex Freedland to a dissimilar robbery from which he could not identify appellant.\u201d The testimony relative to the uncharged crime was admitted under the theory of \u201ccommon plan, scheme and design, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>and further [to] identify\u201d defendant. We conclude that the evidence of the uncharged offense was reversible error. Even were we to concede similarity of the modus operandi (which we do not), in the instant case defendant was identified by the victim of the charged offense (Swislow) as having, on August 25, 1973, robbed him and having threatened him with a knife at the time of the crime. The victim also identified defendant as the perpetrator of the crime when shown four photographs, each of a different person, one of which portrayed defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Mr. Alex Freedland testified as to a robbery which took place on August 26, 1973 in which he was the victim, and that the robbery was accomplished with the use of a gun. \u201cA day or so after\u201d the robbery, Freedland was shown some photographs for the purpose of possibly identifying the perpetrator of the robbery. Freedland \u201crecognized the black turtleneck sweater\u201d on one of the depicted persons, but did not recognize the face.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the basis of this recognition of clothing only, Freedland told the investigating officers that this was a picture of the person who had robbed him. Freedland also testified that in none of the other pictures exhibited to him were the persons wearing turtleneck sweaters. The witness was not asked to make an in court identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Officer Lynn Franklin testified that he had exhibited six or seven photos to Freedland and that Freedland \u201cpicked out the picture of the defendant, stating \u2018This is one of the persons who robbed me\u2019 and T am sure this is one of the persons.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The defense was one of alibi, and therefore any evidence bearing upon the identity of the Swislow robber was of importance. It was to provide additional evidence of identity that the Freedland testimony was admitted. It is conceded that, in the proper case, a defendant\u2019s commission of another (uncharged) crime is admissible to prove a material fact such as identity, motive, or intent, and modus operandi common to both the charged and uncharged crimes. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (b); <em>People </em>v. <em>Enos, </em>34 Cal.App.3d 25, 35 [109 Cal.Rptr. 876].) However, the Freedland testimony at the time of trial failed to identify the perpetrator of the uncharged crime. In fact (as we noted), Freedland was not asked if he could identify the perpetrator as a person in the courtroom at that time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Instead, the prosecution was content to rely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>upon what it considers to be \u201cimpeaching\u201d testimony produced by Officer Franklin. The prosecution relies upon the principle that a contradictory statement may be admitted both for impeachment purposes and to prove the facts therein related (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1235; <em>People </em>v. <em>Strickland, </em>11 Cal.3d 946, 954 [114 Cal.Rptr. 632, 523 P.2d 672]) and for the propriety of the admission of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Defendant argues that the prior statement by Freedland (as related by Officer Franklin) was not inconsistent with the in court testimony of Freedland. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Courts in California have consistently adhered to the rule that the \u201c \u2018The right of impeachment does not exist where the witness states he has no recollection of the fact concerning which he is examined.\u2019 This is not only the rule in California, but according to Wigmore, it is the general English and American rule confirmed by similar holdings in other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sam, </em>71 Cal.2d 194 [77 Cal.Rptr. 804, 454 P.2d 700].) (Citations and fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The single exception to the general sweep of this rule was carved out in <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, </em>3 Cal.3d 981 [92 Cal.Rptr. 494, 479 P.2d 998], where the California Supreme Court held a witness\u2019 deliberate evasion of the question of whether or not the defendant had transferred marijuana to the witness amounted to an \u201cimplied denial that defendant did in fact furnish him with the marijuana as charged.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 989.) However, the <em>Green </em>court reaffirmed the general rule that \u201cthe testimony of a witness that he does not remember an event is hot \u2018inconsistent\u2019 with a prior statement by him describing that event.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 988.) Any doubts about the extent to which <em>Green </em>displaced the general rule were resolved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Parks, 4 </em>Cal.3d 955 [95 Cal.Rptr. 193, 485 P.2d 257]. There the court held that a witness\u2019 prior report about a conversation with the defendant could not be admitted into evidence when, at trial, the witness could not recall what was said. The court found that her lapse of memory \u201c[was not] inconsistent with her original remarks. ... It was not established that she was deliberately evasive or that her asserted lapse of memory was untrue.\u201d <em>(Id, </em>at p. 960, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, </em>3 Cal.3d, <em>supra, </em>at p. 987.) (See: <em>People </em>v. <em>Petersen, </em>23 Cal.App.3d 883, 892 [100 Cal.Rptr. 590]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>23 Cal.App.3d 290, 309 [100 Cal.Rptr. 198]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barranday, </em>20 Cal.App.3d 16, 22 [97 Cal.Rptr. 345]; <em>Peoples. Jackson, </em>3 Cal.App.3d 921, 925, fn. 2 [83 Cal.Rptr. 829].)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">In this case, according to his testimony, Freedland never identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>defendant; he identified a turtleneck sweater. This explanation at time of trial was entirely consistent with his identification of the photo to Officer Franklin. While the facts of the Freedland robbery were admitted to establish the identity of the Swislow robber, no identification of the perpetrator of the Freedland crime resulted. Certainly, the facts of uncharged offenses cannot be admitted unless the identity of the perpetrator is clearly established. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Banks, </em>2 Cal.3d 127, 138 [84 Cal.Rptr. 367, 465 P.2d 263].) This error of admission could not but have adversely affected defendant\u2019s trial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>46 Cal.2d 818, 835-837 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">There is another reason why this case should be reversed, though we do not rely upon it to support our decision because it is, at best, but tangentially raised in the briefs and before the trial court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Freedland\u2019s \u201cidentification\u201d of defendant, if it can be so described, occurred by way of a photographic lineup.  Such means of identification is proper where the procedure is not unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to mistaken identification. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>4 Cal.3d 273, 280 [93 Cal.Rptr. 204, 481 P.2d 212].) The totality of the circumstances surrounding the lineup is determinative of its fairness. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>274 Cal.App.2d 826 [79 Cal.Rptr. 352].) Where an identification procedure is shown to be constitutionally infirm, the prosecution must then establish by clear and convincing proof that the in court identification is not tainted. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams, 9 </em>Cal.3d 24, 37 [106 Cal.Rptr. 622, 506 P.2d 998].)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The instant case differs from <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>12 Cal.3d 731, 766 [117 Cal.Rptr. 393, 528 P.2d 1], where, of the group of pictures shown to the witness, defendant was the only one depicted wearing a beard and the witness had stated that his assailant \u201ceither wore a mask or had a beard, the witness nevertheless made his identification solely from the features of eyes, cheeks, nose, and hairline.\u201d Here, the sole item of identification was the turtleneck sweater, and only one picture of the six or seven displayed showed a person so dressed. Also, no identification of defendant at the trial was even attempted so far as the Freedland robbery was concerned.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The cases of <em>People </em>v. <em>McDaniels, </em>25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Cal.App.3d 708 [102 Cal.Rptr. 444] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>18 Cal.App.3d 1 [95 Cal.Rptr. 468] are likewise distinguishable from the instant case for the same reasons expressed above. The purport of each of those cases, however, supports the conclusion we here reach. The statements contained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>54 Cal.2d 621, 631 [7 Cal.Rptr. 273, 354 P.2d 865] are particularly apropos here. There, the court stated: \u201cThe only evidence tending to connect Marudas with the burglary, therefore, was the evidence of Mrs. Fenwick\u2019s extrajudicial identification of his photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u201cAn extrajudicial identification that cannot be confirmed by an identification at the trial is insufficient to sustain a conviction in the absence of other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the crime. (See <em>Reamer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>229 F.2d 884, 886.) Moreover, the probative value of an identification depends on the circumstances under which it was made. Mrs. Fenwick merely selected one of a small group of photographs. The small size of the group increased the danger of suggestion. (See 3 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940), \u00a7 786a, p. 164.) Identification from a still photograph is substantially less reliable than identification of an individual seen in person. (See <em>id., </em>pp. 165-166.) It becomes particularly suspect when, as in the present case, the witness subsequently fails to identify the subject of the photograph when seen in person and there is no other evidence tending to identify him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">In concluding that the photographic identification resulted in a denial of due process <em>(Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377 [19 L.Ed.2d 1247, 88 S.Ct. 967]), we recognize that we do not adopt the finding on this subject made by the trial judge. Since the sole evidentiary consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>is the group of photographs, we may make our independent determination. (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>4 Cal.3d 273, 279 [93 Cal.Rptr. 204, 481 P.2d 212].)</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Kaus, P. X, and Hastings, X, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 14, 1975, and respondent\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 14, 1975.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b254-12\">A petition for habeas corpus also has been lodged with us by defendant which we have this day disposed of (dismissed as moot) in a separate opinion. (Unpublished opn. (2 Crim. 26129).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Swislow described his assailant as having worn a black turtleneck sweater. A fair inference is that Freedland had similarly described his assailant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b255-8\">Since such a question would have produced stronger evidence than that produced on the subject, we may infer that the response to such question would not have been favorable to the prosecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b257-6\">While defendant did not specifically object to the unfair photographic lineup as presented to Freedland at trial, we believe that this issue is included within the issue of incompetency of counsel which defendant has raised. There certainly could not have been a tactical reason for having failed to raise this issue at trial. (Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1974 Supp.) \u00a7 905 A-2, pp. 585-587.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b257-7\">We find support for our conclusion, albeit by negative expression, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lawrence, supra </em>(at p. 280): \u201c... We are of the opinion that the photographic lineup was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>not \u2018unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification.\u2019 <em>(Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, supra, </em>388 U.S. 293, 302 [18 L.Ed.2d 1199, 1206].) It is true that in the three color photographs defendant is the only participant wearing a gold shirt and gold sweater, whereas the four other men wore white shirts or white sweaters. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Beivelman, supra, </em>70 Cal.2d 60, 78 [73 Cal.Rptr. 521, 447 P.2d 913], we held, however, that the fact that appellant wore light-colored pants while the other men wore dark-colored pants did not render that lineup unfair, <em>the clothing worn by defendant was not similar to that described^ to the police by Mrs. Ward, </em>and each man wore a shirt or sweater dissimilar from each of the others. The participants all appeared to be of a comparable age and of similar build. None had distinctive features. As there was nothing in the conduct of the procedure whereby Mrs. Ward was shown the photographs that was \u2018so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification\u2019 <em>(Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>390 U.S. 377, 384 [19 L.Ed.2d 1247, 1253]), the identification testimony was properly admitted.\u201d (Italics added.) (See also Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1974 Supp.) \u00a7 905 A-6, p. 593.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
