Code, \u00a7 602; Pen. Code, \u00a7 192, subd. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">On June 27, 1973, police discovered the body of juvenile Lupe Torres in a vacant field in Salinas. The victim had been strangled with a belt and his skull had been fractured with a rock. Appellants D.L. and T.R. were taken into custody on the basis of information, given by M.A., that appellants and two other juveniles, R.C. and C.G., had killed the victim following a party on the night of June 22, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">At a joint jurisdictional hearing pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 602, involving appellants, R.C. and C.G., M.A. testified that he, the victim, appellants, and the two other youths went to a vacant field after the party to sniff paint fumes. He testified that appellant T.R. got into a fight with the victim and that appellant D.L. and the two others joined in the fight on T.R.\u2019s side. According to M.A., appellant D.L. pulled on a belt which had been placed around the victim\u2019s neck, hit, kicked and stabbed the victim. While M.A. did not see appellant T.R. pull on the belt, he did see him hit and kick the victim and stab him once or twice after. R.C. dropped a rock on the victim\u2019s head. M.A.\u2019s testimony was corroborated by a statement made to police by a girl who had attended the party. The statement was admitted as a prior inconsistent statement (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1235) when at the hearing she denied witnessing the events at the field. In the prior statement she indicated that she had been present at the party and had seen appellants, C.G., R.C. and the victim leave. She stated that she had followed them to the vacant field and then saw them fighting. She also saw someone whom she could not identify place a belt around someone else\u2019s neck. At the scene of the crime, police found a knife, an empty spray can, and a sock into which the paint had been sprayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Appellant D.L. contends that the court erred in receiving in evidence a drawing made by D.L. while he was at juvenile hall. The drawing was a pencil sketch of a figure wearing a frown, and with tears in its eyes; the figure had a belt around its neck and a dagger protruding from its torso. The figure, labeled \u201cLupe,\u201d had the words \u201cNo, No, No, Not the Rock\u201d coming'from its mouth. A juvenile hall teacher who saw appellant make the drawing and post it on a bulletin board, took it and turned it over to police. The drawing was admitted in evidence over D.L.\u2019s hearsay objection (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1200).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While the referee did not indicate the basis for his ruling, it appears that he considered the drawing as coming within the declaration-against-interest exception to the hearsay rule (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1230).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">On appeal, argument is focused on whether the drawing qualified as a declaration under section 1230; it has apparently been assumed that the drawing was subject to the hearsay rule. The arguments made regarding the applicability of section 1230 fail to take into account that declarations against interest are exceptionally admitted only if made by a nonparty witness and such a witness is \u201cunavailable.\u201d  Here, the declaration in question was made by D.L. himself, a party to the action, who was not \u201cunavailable\u201d within the meaning of Evidence Code section 240. Section 1230 is therefore inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">The drawing, having been posted publicly by D.L., may reasonably be taken as evidence of an implied statement (Evid. Code, \u00a7 225) to prove the truth of its contents; offered for that purpose, the drawing was hearsay subject to Evidence Code section 1200. However, as evidence of a statement offered \u201cagainst the declarant in an action to which he is a party\u201d it was admissible under Evidence Code section 1220.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Appellant D.L. also contends that his Sixth Amendment<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> right to confront witnesses against him was violated by the admission of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>out-of-court confession made by C.G., despite editing of the confession to remove certain references to him. He relies on <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 518 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265], <em>People </em>v. <em>Massie </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 899 [59 Cal.Rptr. 733, 428 P.2d 869], and <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 123 [20 L.Ed.2d 476, 88 S.Ct. 1620]. In <em>Aranda </em>the court held, regulating state procedure governing joint trials, that instructions limiting the admissibility of an out-of-court statement made by a defendant implicating a codefendant were not adequate to protect the nondeclarant defendant from prejudice; the court held that when the prosecution proposed to introduce such an out-of-court statement the trial should be severed unless the references implicating the nondeclarant were deleted before the statement was admitted against the declarant. <em>Massie </em>extended the <em>Aranda </em>requirement to nonjury criminal trials. <em>Bruton, </em>involving a federal prosecution, held that admitting against the declarant only, his out-of-court statement implicating a codefendant, violated the codefendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. California cases subsequent to <em>Aranda </em>and <em>Bruton </em>have held that the <em>Aranda </em>requirement is constitutionally compelled in state prosecutions. <em>(In re Hill </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 997 [80 Cal.Rptr. 537, 458 P.2d 449]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 563 [68 Cal.Rptr. 161, 440 P.2d 233].)</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">The question is whether <em>Aranda </em>is to be applied in juvenile jurisdictional hearings. The United States Supreme Court has held that the right to confront witnesses is among the essentials of due process and fair treatment and, as incorporated by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, must be secured in state juvenile proceedings. <em>(In re Gault </em>(1967) 387 U.S. 1 [18 L.Ed.2d 527, 87 S.Ct. 1428]; see <em>In re Winship </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 358, 368 [25 L.Ed.2d 368, 377, 90 S.Ct. 1068].) In California, Welfare and Institutions Code section 702.5<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> recognizes in minors the right to confront witnesses in jurisdictional proceedings, a right guaranteed by the due process clause. <em>(In re Michael M. </em>(1970) 11 Cal.App.3d 741 [96 Cal.Rptr. 887].)  On the basis of <em>Bruton, In re Gault, </em>and <em>In re Winship, </em>as well as <em>In re Michael M., </em>out-of-court statements made by one juvenile implicating another cannot be admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>in a joint jurisdictional hearing unless the references implicating the nondeclarant have been effectively deleted; if the inculpatory references cannot be effectively deleted, the hearing must be severed if the statement is to be admitted against the declarant.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In his out-of-court statement C.G. admitted pulling on the belt while it was wrapped around the victim\u2019s neck and kicking him while he was down. The statement was read by the officer who took it; the names of the other three youths and the term \u201ceverybody\u201d were deleted and replaced in each instance by the word \u201cblank.\u201d References to the victim and M.A. were not deleted. Concerning the nondeclarants, the statement reveals that: three \u201cblanks\u201d were present at the scene of the crime, one \u201cblank\u201d got into a fight with the victim, another \u201cblank\u201d joined the fray, \u201cwe\u201d hit him with a rock, C.G. and the \u201cother people\u201d kicked him, \u201cthey\u201d stopped kicking, and that \u201cwe\u201d left the victim while he was still breathing because \u201cwe\u201d just wanted to beat him up.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In <em>Aranda, </em>the court defined \u201ceffective deletion\u201d as requiring not only deletion of direct identifications of codefendants, but deletion of any statements that could be employed against nondeclarant codefendants once their identity was otherwise established (63 Cal.2d at p. 530). In a footnote, the court provided additional guidance as to the meaning of the \u201ceffective deletion\u201d requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">\u201cThe rules governing the cases in which deletion would be a permissible alternative cannot be set out fully. Use of the procedure would depend on the evidence linking the defendants together before and after the crime and on the actual statements made by the declarant defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">\u201cIn the present case, deletion would have been an effective solution to the joint trial problem. All that Martinez\u2019s confession added to the case against Aranda was Aranda\u2019s identity. No evidence linked the two together at any other time relevant to the commission of the robbery. Deleting all references to Aranda would not have prejudiced Martinez and what remained would have prejudiced Aranda no more than if Martinez had in fact said that T was one of the persons who robbed the store but I will tell you nothing more.\u2019 \u201d (63 Cal.2d, fn. 10, pp. 530-531.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Massie, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 899, 919, the court held that deletions would be ineffective within the meaning of <em>Aranda </em>where references in an out-of-court confession were to \u201cme and John\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>\u201cwe\u201d where the declarant and nondeclarant defendant were linked to one another by other admissible evidence. In our case, the use of three distinct \u201cblanks\u201d ih a series to replace the names of the three nondeclarant participants unequivocally placed appellant D.L. at the scene of the crime. Moreover, the nondeleted references to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cthey,\u201d and \u201cothers,\u201d which could technically refer to less than all of the nondeclarants and therefore did not directly implicate appellant D.L., left little doubt, in light of M.A.\u2019s previous testimony implicating all three nondeclarants, that all the youths against whom petitions had been filed had participated in the commission of the crime.  The deletions made in the C.G. statement were not adequate to avoid implicating appellant D.L.; the admission of the statement, containing direct and indirect references to appellant D.L., violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Since the error in admitting the statement was of constitutional dimensions, reversal is required unless the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Bruton </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>391 U.S. 123; <em>In re Hill, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 997; see <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065].) <em>Aranda-Bruton </em>errors may be rendered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where there is competent and overwhelming evidence against the implicated nondeclarant defendant. <em>(In re Hill, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 997; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores, supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 563; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 536 [58 Cal.Rptr. 340, 426 P.2d 908].) Here M.A. testified that he saw appellant D.L. pull on the belt which was wrapped around the victim\u2019s neck, as well as hit, kick, and stab him. Even if the C.G. statement had been admitted without any deletions it would have done no more than second M.A.\u2019s uncontradicted testimony at trial; it did not implicate appellant D.L. to a greater extent than M.A.\u2019s eyewitness testimony. Moreover, M.A.\u2019s testimony was not the only evidence supporting the finding: another witness who had attended the party placed appellant D.L. at the scene of the crime; appellant\u2019s drawing reasonably implied that he had been present; and the physical evidence found at the scene corroborated M.A.\u2019s testimony.  In light of this overwhelming evidence against appellant D.L., we are persuaded that admission of the ineffectively edited C.G. statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Appellant T.R. does not challenge the admission of the C.G. statement; its effect on his case is nevertheless considered. The admission of the C.G. statement had the same impact on appellant T.R\u2019s case as on appellant D.L.\u2019s: one series of \u201cblanks\u201d effectively placed him at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>scene of the crime and the words \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cthey,\u201d and \u201cothers,\u201d viewed against the backdrop of M.A.\u2019s testimony, connected him with its commission. Since the deletions were inadequate to avoid implicating appellant T.R., the admission of the C.G. statement was error as to him. However, as in appellant D.L.\u2019s case, the C.G. statement, at worst, was only cumulative. The uncontradicted and corroborated testimony of M.A. placed appellant at the scene of the crime and implicated him in its commission; so did the girl\u2019s statement, which was properly considered as substantive evidence. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1235; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 981 [92 Cal.Rptr. 494, 479 P.2d 998].) The admission of the C.G. statement, in light of the overwhelming evidence against appellant T.R., was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Finally, appellant D.L. contends that the evidence against him was insufficient to sustain the referee\u2019s finding that he committed voluntary manslaughter. In so doing, he focuses exclusively on the testimony given by M.A. and attacks it by arguing that (1) Penal Code section 1111<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> required it to be corroborated by other evidence, (2) M.A.\u2019s perception was not to be relied upon because it was impaired by glue sniffing, and (3) M.A.\u2019s credibility was impeached.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention that Penal Code section 1111 required corroboration of M.A.\u2019s testimony and his tacit contention that it lacked corroboration are incorrect for two reasons: (1) accomplice testimony in juvenile proceedings is not subject to section 1111 <em>(In re R. C. </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 887 [114 Cal.Rptr. 735]) and (2) even if it were, M.A.\u2019s testimony was corroborated as required by the section by the girl\u2019s statement to the effect that appellant left the party with the victim and the other three youths, and that she saw the five fighting where Lupe\u2019s body was later found. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perry </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 756 [103 Cal.Rptr. 161, 499 P.2d 129].)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Appellant attacks the reliability of M.A.\u2019s testimony because he had sniffed paint fumes on the night of the crime. He correctly asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>that evidence of intoxication is relevant to the issue of a witness\u2019 capacity to observe, recollect and communicate. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Singh </em>(1937) 19 Cal.App.2d 128 [64 P.2d 1149].) However, he fails to show that M.A. was intoxicated or that his perception was impaired on the night in question. According to M.A.\u2019s uncontradicted testimony, during the night of the crime he was aware of what he was doing at all times.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In a statement made to a psychiatrist prior to the jurisdictional hearing, M.A. stated that appellant T.R. had pulled on the belt which was around the victim\u2019s neck. At the hearing, M.A. testified that from his vantage point he could not see appellant T.R. pull on the belt, but that appellant T.R. was in such a position that he appeared to be pulling on it. The statement made to the psychiatrist was admitted as a prior inconsistent statement. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1235.) On this basis appellant contends that M.A.\u2019s testimony, thus impeached, was insufficient to sustain the finding that the allegation of involuntary manslaughter was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The trier of fact is charged with determining the credibility of witnesses. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 780; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 312.) While M.A.\u2019s testimony was impeached, it cannot be said that M.A.\u2019s testimony was entirely unworthy of belief. (See 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) at p. 4236.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The evidence was sufficient to sustain the finding that appellant D.L. had committed voluntary manslaughter and therefore had come within the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Appellant T.R.\u2019s sole contention is that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the finding of voluntary manslaughter; in so contending, he focuses exclusively on the sufficiency of M.A.\u2019s testimony in light of Penal Code section 1111. M.A.\u2019s uncontradicted testimony indicated appellant T.R. was the first to attack the victim and that in the course of the struggle appellant T.R. hit, kicked and stabbed the victim. This evidence was sufficient to sustain the finding that appellant had committed voluntary manslaughter. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 192, subd. 1.) Although this testimony did not require corroboration under Penal Code section 1111 <em>(In re R. C., supra, </em>39 Cal.App.3d 887), it was corroborated by the girl\u2019s statement and by the police findings at the scene. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Perry, supra, 7 </em>Cal.3d 756, 769.) The evidence was sufficient to sustain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the finding that appellant T.R. had committed voluntary manslaughter and had thereby come within the court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The orders are affirmed. The appeal from the trial court\u2019s order denying rehearing is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Caldecott, P.
