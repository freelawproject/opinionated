The People appeal from trial court orders exonerating bail and denying the People\u2019s motion for summary judgment forfeiting bail.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Resolute Insurance Company, defendant in this proceeding, posted bond for Stanley Howard Saltz. In this case (A-428815) Saltz was charged in July 1972, in a two-count information with attempted arson and burglary. Resolute posted a $20,000 bond for Saltz on these charges. Earlier, in February, Saltz had been charged with several felony drug offenses (A-281890) and Resolute had posted a $3,125 bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Saltz failed to appear on the drug charges in September 1972; a bench warrant was issued and bail ordered forfeited.. Saltz also failed to appear on the charges in this case; a bench warrant was issued and bail ordered forfeited on September 26, 1972. Resolute was notified on October 4.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">In March 1973, Resolute noticed a motion calendared for March 28 to vacate the forfeiture of Saltz\u2019s bond in the drug case (A-281890). The ground of the motion was that Saltz\u2019s failure to appear \u201cwas excusable and/or was without the connivance or collusion of his bail.\u201d Resolute\u2019s declaration was attached, stating that the bondsman had traced Saltz to Mexico, where he was arrested by the Mexican army, that he was finally extradited to the United States and that it had cost the bondsman $7,000 to locate him. Also attached were a copy of a letter dated February 5, from the Los Angeles sheriff to the United States marshal in Laredo, Texas, stating, in substance, that California was eager to have Saltz returned, and a copy of a telegram dated February 14, apparently from the United States marshal in Laredo to the sheriff\u2019s office, stating that Saltz would not waive extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>When the drug case bail forfeiture came up for hearing on March 28, Saltz was still in the Laredo jail, and the court continued the matter for 60 days, finding that defendant Saltz was temporarily disabled from appearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">At this point, we reach the proceedings in this case. On March 19, Resolute noticed a motion set for April 3, to vacate the forfeiture. The notice of motion was signed by Resolute\u2019s attorney; the supporting documentation consisted of Xerox copies of all the paper work attached to the notice of motion in the drug case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">On April 3, 1973, Resolute\u2019s motion to vacate the bond forfeiture and to exonerate the bond was denied. The court granted a \u201ctemporary disability\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for a period of 60 days, calendaring the matter for further hearing on May 31. The People\u2019s motion for summary judgment <em>{supra, </em>fn. 1) was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">On May 4, the People noticed a motion for summary judgment to declare a bond forfeiture and to set aside the April 3 temporary disability order. This motion was denied, and, Saltz having been retrieved by the sheriff on about May 1, on May 16, Resolute\u2019s motion to set aside the forfeiture and exonerate bond was granted, subject to payment of reasonable county costs. Costs were determined to be $1,488, which Resolute paid; the bond was exonerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">This case involves section 1305, subdivision (a), of the Penal Code, dealing with bail forfeitures. The section provides that if a defendant without sufficient excuse fails to appear in court, bail \u201cmust thereupon be declared forfeited, . . . .\u201d The statute then provides that if the surety and the defendant appear within 180 days, under certain circumstances bail may be reinstated or the forfeiture of bail discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">The statute also provides for the situation in which the defendant does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>not appear within 180 days, through no fault of the surety. If the surety makes a motion within the 180-day period, which motion can be heard up to 30 days later, and \u201cit is made to appear to the satisfaction of the court that the defendant is temporarily disabled\u201d from appearing, the period of disability is deducted from the 180 days. Also, the court can set a reasonable time within which to produce the defendant and that time too is not deemed part of the 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">In brief, unless a defendant is \u201cpermanently unable to appear in court,\u201d if the surety wants a bail forfeiture vacated and bond exonerated, he must produce the defendant within 180 days, exclusive of disability or retrieval time.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">This People\u2019s appeal involves solely the quality of the supporting papers submitted by defendant Resolute in support of the April 3 motion to vacate the bond forfeiture. To summarize their contentions, they claim to be aggrieved because the notice of motion did not state grounds to support the requested relief\u2014exoneration of bond; the attachments to the notice of motion were Xerox copies of the attachments to the notice of motion in the drug case; the surety\u2019s declaration constituted incompetent evidence; and there was no evidence that defendant Saltz could not be produced in time for the April 3 hearing. Finally, these arguments are restated in terms of the court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction to grant relief, because of the time limits set forth in section 1305, subdivision (a), which we will discuss below.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\n<em>Grounds for Relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">Penal Code section 1305, subdivision (a), provides that \u201cno order discharging the forfeiture of the undertaking . . . shall be made without opportunity for hearing and the filing of a notice of motion for such order setting forth the basis for relief, ... in compliance with the provisions of Section 1010 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d That section provides, as relevant, that notices \u201cmust be in writing, and the notice of a motion,... must state ... the grounds upon which it will be made ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">The People contend that Resolute did not comply with section 1010 because the caption on Resolute\u2019s March 19 notice of motion reads: \u201cNotice of Motion to Vacate Forfeiture and Exonerate Bond and for Judicial Notice,\u201d and, admittedly, it was not entitled to exoneration at that time. The contention is without merit. The People confuse the requirement that the \u201cgrounds\u201d for relief be stated with a novel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>requirement that the relief sought not exceed that to which the moving party is entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">It is, apparently, the People\u2019s position that\u2014-other defects in the moving papers aside\u2014if Resolute had captioned the notice of motion, \u201cNotice of Motion Re Exoneration of Bond to Grant Temporary Disability,\u201d the motion would have been properly before the court, but absent such a designation, the court had no jurisdiction to grant a temporary disability. The People are mistaken. If, as here, the grounds are properly set forth, the surety is entitled to whatever relief is appropriate in the circumstances. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pugh, 9 </em>Cal.App.3d 241, 251-252 [88 Cal.Rptr. 110]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>United Bonding Ins. Co., </em>12 Cal.App.3d 349, 354-355 [90 Cal.Rptr. 714].)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\n<em>Non-Collusion Declaration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Among the documents filed was a \u201cNon-Collusion Declaration,\u201d stating, in substance, that Resolute did not collude or connive with defendant Saltz to jump bail. The People contend that this declaration is invalid because it fails to state the date and place that the declaration was executed. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2015.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Again, the People elevate form over substance. The notice of motion filed by Resolute consisted of a package of papers: the notice of motion, discussed above; a declaration, under penalty of perjury, that defendant failed to appear on the appropriate date:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-8\">\u201cI Dan Majors, under penalty of perjury declares as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">\u201cThat we are surety in the above entitled action, whose Bond was ordered forfeited on 9-26-72 by reason of Defendants failure to appear on that date;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-10\">\u201cSee Attached</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-11\">\u201cThat Surety did not willfully disobey the orders of the above Court; that defendants failure to appear as aforesaid was without the knowledge or consent of the bail.\u201d The \u201cAttached\u201d was the surety\u2019s affidavit concerning his pursuit of defendant Saltz, and the correspondence between the U.S. marshal and the sheriff, noted above. This was followed by the challenged \u201cNon-Collusion Declaration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>It is at least arguable that the \u201cSee Attached\u201d document, signed and dated in Los Angeles under penalty of perjury, encompassed the undated \u201cNon-Collusion Declaration.\u201d In any event, assuming\u2014and we do not so decide\u2014that the \u201cNon-Collusion Declaration\u201d counted for naught, the declaration is repetitious of the surety\u2019s sworn statements in the \u201cSurety\u2019s Declaration\u201d that he did not wilfully disobey the orders of the court and that defendant\u2019s failure to appear was without the knowledge and consent of the surety. Section 1305 of the Penal Code does not demand repetition.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">\n<em>Competent Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The People next contend that Resolute\u2019s declarations in support of the motion decided on April 3d do not contain sufficient competent evidence to justify the \u201ctemporary disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The point has no merit. The People want us to fly-speck Resolute\u2019s moving papers with the same severity with which we are bound to examine the documentation adduced in support of a successful motion for summary judgment in a civil trial. <em>(Dugar </em>v. <em>Happy Tiger Records, Inc., </em>41 Cal.App.3d 811, 817 [116 Cal.Rptr. 412].) They overlook, however, that on April 3 the court did not discharge the forfeiture of Resolute\u2019s undertaking, but merely declared itself satisfied that because of Saltz\u2019s detention in Texas, he was temporarily unable to appear for a period of 60 days. The language of section 1305 of the Penal Code is significantly different with respect to the quantum of evidence which the surety must produce to discharge the forfeiture of its undertaking after actual appearance of the defendant and the quantum necessary to support the type of order challenged on this appeal. The section provides that to obtain a complete discharge of forfeiture on the defendant\u2019s appearance, the surety must <em>\u201cshow\u201d </em>the necessary facts to the satisfaction of the court; on the other hand, to obtain temporary relief, it is only necessary that <em>\u201cit is made to appear </em>to the satisfaction of the court that the defendant is temporarily disabled ....\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">We do not believe that the Legislature\u2019s use of different words was inadvertent. The word \u201cshow\u201d is synonymous with \u201cestablish\u201d or \u201cprove.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davenport, </em>13 Cal.App. 632, 637 [110 P. 318]; <em>Wistrom </em>v. <em>Redlick Bros., Inc., 6 </em>Cal.App. 671, 676 [92 P. 1048].) \u201cAppear,\u201d on the other hand, has been equated with \u201cseem\u201d and \u201c \u2018have the semblance or aspect of being; seem or seem likely; without implying reality or unreality.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Hancock Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Hopkins, 67 </em>Cal.App.2d 218, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>221 [153 P.2d 993].) In <em>Kind </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>143 Cal.App.2d 100, 102 [299 P.2d 414], the court interpreted section 872 of the Penal Code, which starts as follows: \u201cIf, however, it appears from the examination . . . .\u201d It specifically held that by using the word \u201cappears\u201d the Legislature did not intend to require the People \u201cto prove the offense, but only [to produce] sufficient evidence to give a rational appearance that the offense charged had been committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Examining Resolute\u2019s moving papers with this distinction in mind, we have no doubt that they adequately support the order of April 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The surety declared that he learned that Saltz was participating in an international narcotic ring, involving, inter alia, Guadalajara and Nogales, and that he furnished this information to the FBI; that it was the \u201chigh reward\u201d offered by him that caused Saltz\u2019s arrest in Mexico and his extradition to the United States; and that he spent $7,000 in the effort to cause Saltz\u2019s recapture. Copies of a letter from the Los Angeles sheriff to the United States marshal in Texas, and of a telegram from the United States marshal to the sheriff make it clear that Saltz was in jail in Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">No useful purpose would be served by discussing every technical objection to this documentation. Undoubtedly, it contained a certain amount of hearsay, but none of the hearsay is essential to support the order. The only point which might be well taken if section 1305 called for strictest proof in \u201ctemporary disability\u201d situations is that the copies of the letter from the sheriff to the United States marshal in Laredo, Texas, and of the telegram received in reply are inadequately authenticated as copies .of writings \u201cin the custody of a public entity.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1530, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While this technicality might be sufficient to have prevented Resolute from \u201cshowing\u201d that Saltz was detained in Texas, we do not believe that the trial court committed reversible error in finding that it had been \u201cmade to appear\u201d that Saltz was temporarily disabled from appearing in court in Los Angeles. If there had been any genuine doubt concerning the authenticity of the copy of the sheriff\u2019s letter, Resolute could undoubtedly have rectified this particular technical deficiency before April 18 when the court\u2019s power to act on the motion filed on March 19 expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The People contend that there was no evidence that defendant Saltz could not be produced before the 180 days ran out, that is, by April 2. We disagree. The communications between the United States Marshal and the sheriff make clear that Saltz refused to waive extradition as of February 1973. Having in mind the length of contested extradition proceedings and the fact that the district attorney represented the People in <em>People </em>v. <em>Saltz, </em>as well as in this matter, the trial court could infer that if Saltz had been extradited by April 2, it would have learned of it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\n<em>Other Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The People repeat their argument that the notice of motion did not set forth the grounds of the motion under the rubric that the court had no jurisdiction to grant a \u201ctemporary disability,\u201d because the 180 days had run. The contention still has no merit. The People acknowledge that the bail forfeiture motion must be made within 180 days but may be heard up to 30 days thereafter\u2014in this case, up to May 2. The hearing was held on April 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The People contend that the trial court \u201cfound\u201d that the temporary disability existed starting April 3, and that under section 1305, the temporary disability must exist during the 180-day period, which . expired April 2. The rule is correct, but misapplied here.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The court, at the April 3 hearing, recognized, based on the documents discussed above, that defendant Saltz was being held and had been held in Laredo, Texas. The court then \u201cgranted the 60 day disability.\u201d The minute order stated that \u201cA Temporary Disability is granted for a period of sixty (60) days from today....\u201d Hearing was set for May 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The 60-day period starting April 3 granted by the court was not a determination that defendant Saltz was disabled from appearing in court <em>starting </em>April 3, but that the court, pursuant to section 1305, subdivision (a) determined that a \u201creasonable period of time\u201d was \u201cnecessary in order to return the defendant to court upon the termination of the disability, . . .\u201d and set that time at 60 days. The People seem to be contending that the minutes must reflect the court\u2019s finding of the exact amount of time, during the 180-day period, that defendant was \u201ctemporarily disabled\u201d from appearing in court. We are cited to no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>authority for this proposition, and, absent a showing of any prejudice whatsoever, decline to establish the absolute rule demanded by the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Moreover, when the matter was next heard on May 16, the court made clear that \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything as to the disability presently existing April 3rd, but the evidence certainly indicates that it was that on which I acted, and it showed it was a continuing disability from February.\u201d Had the court corrected the April 3 order <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>the People would not have even a lead-in to an argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The People also contend that the declarations were all defective, because they were Xerox copies of the declarations filed in the drug case. This contention too is without merit. The court properly treated the documents as originals. Moreover, the court had before it a conformed Xerox copy of the papers filed in the drug case (A-281890), and could see that the papers submitted were identical except for case number, and could take judicial notice of the files in the drug case which did consist of signed originals.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">Stephens, J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 7, 1975, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 14, 1975.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-9\">To be exact, the People appeal from \u201cthe orders of April 3, 1973 and May 16, 1973, denying the People\u2019s motion for a summary judgment, and from the orders of May 16 and May 30, exonerating bail, and from the order of May 16, 1973, denying the People\u2019s motion to vacate the order of April 3, 1973.\u201d As will appear, the People recognize that if the trial, court acted properly on April 3, the orders which followed are proper; if the trial court acted improperly on April 3, the People were entitled to summary judgment under the statutory bail forfeiture and exoneration scheme. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1305, 1306.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Penal Code, section 1305, subdivision (a), requires that the court \u201cmust\u201d declare bail forfeited if a defendant does not appear \u201cwithout sufficient excuse ....\u201d and must notify the surety of this fact. A 180-day period within which the surety can attempt to vacate the forfeiture runs from the date the notice of the forfeiture is mailed or entered. In this case it expired on April 2, 1973.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b245-10\">The People requested that the record be augmented with the superior court file so that this court could see for itself that the signatures on the declarations were not originals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Section 1305, subdivision (a), requires, as we will discuss, that to discharge a bond forfeiture, the surety must produce the defendant, unless the defendant is permanently unable to appear. The court may find that the defendant is temporarily disabled and make an order accordingly, thus extending the time within which the surety may have the bond forfeiture vacated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\">If the copies were properly authenticated as such, the sheriff\u2019s letter would probably be self-authenticating (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1421, 1453.) The telegram would be authenticated under the so-called \u201creply doctrine.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1420.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b250-9\">In fact, Saltz was not returned until May 1, 1973. This is established by a declaration of the acting head of the extradition section of the district attorney\u2019s office, filed May 30, in connection with the People\u2019s claim for costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
