Burch and Michael J. Thomas of the Los Angeles Police Department were on patrol in a marked police vehicle at Topanga Canyon and Saticoy. They received an \u201call units call\u201d that a \u201ccat burglaiy\u201d had occurred at 20216 Delita. This location is two or three blocks south of Ventura and within a block or two of Winnetka.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The officers arrived at the intersection of Winnetka and Ventura within three or four minutes and parked at the northwest corner. They saw a yellow van proceeding on Winnetka. The defendant, a male Negro, was driving. Only four or five minutes had elapsed. The direction in which the van was proceeding was away from the location of the burglary. The officers caused the vehicle to stop. Burch went up on the passenger side of the van and saw defendant reaching over toward the passenger seat. He told defendant to put his hands on the steering wheel. He looked into the van and saw an orange furniture dolly, a stereo and a plastic container normally used for going on picnics or storing frozen items. He also saw on the floor a knife, screwdriver, flashlight and a pair of brown gloves.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Thomas, suspecting the defendant of having possibly committed a burglary, asked him to alight from the vehicle and patted him down for tools and weapons. He saw a screwdriver in defendant\u2019s left front pocket. Thereafter, appellant was arrested and transported to the West Valley police station. The van was driven there by another officer. The van was searched at the station and certain property found therein was booked. At the trial Burch testified that following a search of the van at the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>station, he recovered an ice chest containing frozen meat and butter, a stereo, a small television set, a chess set, a handbag and a small .25 caliber automatic pistol with a clip. All of these items excepting the pistol were identified by Don Paul and Irmgard Huth as having been taken from their respective homes some time between the night of June 21 and 6 or 7 a.m. of June 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">Prior to seeing the yellow van, Burch had received the following information: He had heard on the radio that \u201ca cat burglar[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] was working south of the Boulevard . . . south of Ventura.\u201d He had information from \u201cDO sheets\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that there was a \u201ccat burglar working . .. south of the Boulevard; North Hollywood-Van Nuys Division; West Valley Division, hitting approximately two to three houses each time he would hit. Also that it was a male Negro, 5T0\", 170-180 pounds.\u201d Being taken in the burglaries were \u201clarge items . . . such as color TV\u2019s, larger TV\u2019s. And it would take approximately either two men to carry these items or a mover\u2019s dolly to move them.\u201d These burglaries were occurring between approximately 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. Burch had known of the cat burglar for at least a month prior to June 22. He had heard on two occasions about a yellow van being used, once over the radio and once, three or four nights later, at roll call from Investigator (Sergeant) Lee. On both occasions a Negro male had been described. The radio call further described the suspect as 5T0\" to 5T1\", 170-180 pounds. The roll call was on June 18 or 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Lee had discussed a number of \u201ccat burglaries\u201d.: \u201cthe one in Van Nuys, also the ones south of the Boulevard [s/c] in the Van Nuys Division, North Hollywood, West Valley.\u201d He talked about one burglary where a shot was fired <em>at </em>the burglar<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and where mace was used on a victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Prior to seeing the yellow van, Thomas had received the following information: At roll call Lee had spoken of burglaries south of \u201cthe Boulevard\u201d where he suspected the existence of a dolly or multiple suspects because of the large items taken; a yellow van was also mentioned. He had heard a broadcast five or six days prior from Van Nuys concerning the burglary where a yellow van was involved. He had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>seen daily occurrence sheets which listed information several days prior, including numerous burglaries which had occurred south of the boulevard involving large items taken with possible dollies. Also, Lee had told of an occasion where a suspect shot a pistol at a victim and an occasion where mace was used on a victim. The modus operandi was that of a \u201ccat burglar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Defendant contends initially that the detention of June 22 was unlawful but, should that argument be rejected, the People did not meet their burden of proving the source of the \u201cprobable cause\u201d information in their possession. We discuss those contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u201cWhile a detention of a citizen by a police officer based on a \u2018mere hunch\u2019 is unlawful, if there is a rational <em>suspicion </em>that some activity out of the ordinary is taking place, and some <em>suggestion </em>that the activity is related to crime, a detention is permissible. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gravatt, </em>22 Cal.App.3d 133, 136-137 [99 Cal.Rptr. 287], cited with approval in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gale, 9 </em>Cal.3d 788, 797-798 [108 Cal.Rptr. 852, 511 P.2d 1204]; italics in original.)  It is manifest that the appearance of defendant in the yellow van in such close proximity in time and space to the \u201ccat burglary\u201d reported at 20216 Delita, the direction of movement of the van, and the sex and race of the defendant\u2014coupled with the information already possessed by Officers Burch and Thomas \u2014lent credence to a \u201crational suspicion that some activity out of the ordinary [was] taking place, and some suggestion that the activity [was] related to crime.\u201d An objective perception of events should have indicated to reasonable men that the detention and questioning of defendant was not only appropriate, but necessary to the proper discharge of their duties. (Cf. <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>1 Cal.3d 423, 426 [82 Cal.Rptr. 484, 462 P.2d 12].)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Once the stopping of defendant\u2019s vehicle and his detention had been completed, no \u201csearch\u201d was necessary for Burch to discern possible fruits of the burglary<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as well as instrumentalities of burglary. In addition, Thomas found a screwdriver in defendant\u2019s left front pocket. We are satisfied that there was probable cause to arrest the defendant for burglary. (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 836, subd. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Defendant next claims a violation of the so-called <em>Harvey-Madden </em>principle,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as articulated in <em>Remers </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>2 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>659, at pages 666-667 [87 Cal.Rptr. 202, 470 P.2d 11]: \u201cIt is well settled that while it may be perfectly reasonable for officers in the field to make arrests on the basis of information furnished to them by other officers, \u2018when it comes to justifying the total police activity in a court, the People must prove that the source of the information is something other than the imagination of an officer who does not become a witness.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Adkins, </em>273 Cal.App.2d 196, 198 [78 Cal.Rptr. 397]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lara, </em>67 Cal.2d 365, 374 [62 Cal.Rptr. 586, 432 P.2d 202]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 789, 792 [61 Cal.Rptr. 394]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pease, </em>242 Cal.App.2d 442, 448-450 [51 Cal.Rptr. 448]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>156 Cal.App.2d 516 [319 P.2d 689].) To hold otherwise would permit the manufacture of reasonable grounds for arrest within a police department by one officer transmitting information purportedly known by him to another officer who did not know such information, without establishing under oath how the information had in fact been obtained by the former officer. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Adkins, supra, </em>273 Cal.App.2d 196, 198; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harvey, supra, </em>156 Cal.App.2d 516, 523.) \u2018If this were so, every utterance of a police officer would instantly and automatically acquire the dignity of official information; \u201creasonable cause\u201d or \u201creasonable grounds,\u201d . . . could be conveniently fashioned out of a two-step communication; and all Fourth Amendment safeguards would dissolve as a consequence.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pease, supra, </em>242 Cal.App.2d 442, 449.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u201cIn sum, when an officer furnishes to another officer information which leads to an arrest, the People must show the basis for the former officer\u2019s information. More specifically in relation to the instant case, when an officer furnishes to another officer information as to alleged prior criminal activity of an individual relied upon for an arrest relating to subsequent activities of that individual, then the People must show the basis for the former officer\u2019s information. The absence of such a requirement would allow a police officer to manufacture reasonable grounds to arrest while circumventing the necessity of pointing to \u2018specific and articulable facts\u2019 <em>(Terry </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>392 U.S. 1, 21 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 906]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Collins, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 658, 662 [83 Cal.Rptr. 179, 463 P.2d 403] justifying his suspicions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The prosecution produced as a witness Sergeant Gilbert F. Lee of the Los Angeles Police Department (undoubtedly the same \u201cInvestigator Lee\u201d referred to by Officer Burch) who testified that he was during the months of February through June 1973 coordinator for burglary investigations in the West Valley Investigation Division; early in February a series of burglaries began \u201cwhich we classify as hot prowls,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>in which victims in the residence are asleep when the burglary occurs; these incidents were taking place primarily south of the Ventura Freeway in the West Valley division; sometimes there were two or three in an evening, mostly after midnight; he coordinated with other police divisions and met twice per week with other investigators, \u201calmost daily\u201d; he read all applicable reports and discussed distinctive matter with other investigators; he met with radio car officers; he would go to roll calls and impart the information in his possession. Shortly prior to defendant\u2019s arrest he was told of one North Hollywood \u201chot prowl\u201d burglary where the victim reported hearing a van type of vehicle leave the scene; in another Van Nuys burglary, a woman saw a male black driving a yellow van; in another West Valley burglary a gray or off-white station wagon was described as leaving the scene of a \u201chot prowl\u201d burglaiy. He described other incidents in which a shot was fired by a burglary suspect either at the victim or into the ground, and another incident in which a black burglary suspect sprayed mace into a victim\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Sergeant Louis H. Holland of the Los Angeles Police Department testified that between February and June of 1973 he was burglary coordinator for the Van Nuys Investigative Division and had six burglary investigators working directly under him. In mid-June 1973, he attended a \u201cnorth-south Mulholland burglary investigators\u2019 meeting\u201d at the Van Nuys police station. Sergeant Lee was present during the meeting when a yellow van was described as having been seen in the southwest district of the Van Nuys division. Holland recalled a yellow van and a light colored station wagon both being mentioned. He remembered seeing information regarding the yellow van being on a report. It might have been either an Investigator Watson or himself who related the incident of a yellow van. He believed it would have been Investigator Watson, but was not certain, who interviewed the victim who mentioned the yellow van. He did recall that the report in which the yellow van was mentioned was a \u201chot prowl burglary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The prosecution also called Officer Terry L. Wessel, who sent out the June 22 radio call reporting the burglary at 20216 Delita Drive. He put the call out at 4:20 a.m. as a \u201cCB,\u201d meaning \u201ccat burglary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">In addition, the prosecution offered into evidence, and the trial court received, 48 crime reports from the West Valley division representing a portion of the \u201ccat burglaries\u201d described by Sergeant Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>We are satisfied that the requirements of <em>Remers, Madden </em>and their predecessors were met, and that the \u201csource of the information\u201d in the possession of Officers Burch and Thomas was <em>not </em>\u201cthe imagination of an officer who [did] not become a witness.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Adkins, </em>273 Cal.App.2d 196, 198 [78 Cal.Rptr. 397].)</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The Arrest of November 20, 1973</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">On November 20, 1973, at about 2 a.m. Officers Charles S. Melvin and Dennis Ulick were driving westbound on Mulholland Drive about three to five miles east of Canoga Avenue. A light green or gray Oldsmobile, which appeared to be a 1965 or 1966 Cutlass, approached them in a desolate area. They stopped their car, turned and looked back toward the direction of the vehicle that just passed them, when they observed the brake lights on the vehicle come on. The vehicle backed up to the officers\u2019 location. The officers had in their possession a reproduced intelligence card and a map given to them by Sergeant Lee. They recognized the individual driving the Cutlass to fit the general description given by Lee and to be a William Adrian Taylor whose name was on the intelligence card.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Three vehicles had been previously described to the officers, one of which was a two-door 1966 Oldsmobile. The possible license on that vehicle was SKM 372, according to Ulick; Melvin was sure about the SKM but not of the numbers, which at one time he testified were \u201c275.\u201d He did notice, however, that the license number on the Cutlass operated by defendant matched the license number given him by Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">The officers had been told of defendant\u2019s arrest in June and, knowing that he had been armed at that time, suspected that he might be armed again. The officers had exited their vehicle when defendant told Ulick that he was lost and asked him how to leave the area. Melvin shined his flashlight into the vehicle looking for other people or weapons. He saw a glove immediately in front of the driver\u2019s seat and on the console between the front seats he saw a screwdriver, kitchen knife, a pair of wire or tin snips, and a flashlight. On the left rear floor board he observed what appeared to be a handgun, although Ulick thought it was only a plastic replica of a pistol.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> After observing the plastic pistol, Ulick asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>defendant, who had already produced his driver\u2019s license, to exit the vehicle and step over to the police vehicle and he complied, stating, \u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d or \u201cHow did you guys know about me?\u201d Ulick replied something to the effect, \u201cWell, we know all about you, Mr. Taylor,\u201d and conducted a cursory search for weapons, but did not find any.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Melvin asked for permission to look in defendant\u2019s trunk and defendant responded to the effect of: \u201cSure, man. Go ahead.\u201d Or \u201cYeah, it\u2019s okay. Yeah, man, go ahead.\u201d In the trunk Officer Melvin found a red typewriter case, a woman\u2019s suede jacket or coat, a woman\u2019s brown purse, two flashlights, a set of sockets, and a ceramic doll or figurine type. He turned to Ulick and \u201ctold him to cuff Mr. Taylor, yes, that he was under arrest.\u201d He was of the opinion that the items he had seen in the trunk might have been \u201ctaken in a burglary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">As soon as Ulick reached for his cuffs, Mr. Taylor said something like, \u201cYou are going to have to shoot me, because I\u2019m leaving,\u201d or \u201cYou are going to have to shoot me to catch me,\u201d and started running. Defendant fell over the edge of the roadway onto an abandoned car and the officers went down, cuffed him and brought him back to the roadway. They transported him to a hospital because he complained of an injury to his leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Manifestly the original stopping of defendant\u2019s vehicle was not a detention at all, but initiated by defendant to make a request for information. Both of the officers recognized defendant before they detained him. Defendant was driving at 2 a.m. in a desolate area in a vehicle which matched the description of one which might have been used by a burglary suspect. The officers knew of the series of \u201ccat burglaries\u201d; they knew defendant had been previously arrested for such burglaries and that a handgun had been recovered. Failure to undertake at least a cursory interview of the defendant would, in our judgment, have been a serious dereliction of duty. There was no impropriety in the initial detention. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>23 Cal.App.3d 23, 27-28 [99 Cal.Rptr. 858]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rosenfeld, </em>16 Cal.App.3d 619, 622 [94 Cal.Rptr. 380].)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">The following additional facts transpired subsequent to the detention: Defendant confirmed his identity as a known burglary suspect; he uttered the equivocal but certainly suspicious remark, \u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d; such not always innocuous items as a glove, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>screwdriver, kitchen knife, wire snips, and flashlight\u2014as well as a handgun, real or simulated\u2014were seen in the car. Pursuant to what the trial court found to be defendant\u2019s free and voluntaiy consent, the opening of his trunk revealed a typewriter case, a woman\u2019s jacket or coat, and a purse. Then defendant attempted an immediate escape. We have no doubt that the arrest, under these circumstances, was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">We have made only passing reference to the search of defendant\u2019s trunk. The evidence on the issue of consent was, as is not unusual in cases of this nature, conflicting. Officers Melvin and Ulick each testified that prior to defendant\u2019s being placed under arrest, he approved the inspection by saying something to the effect of: \u201cSure, man. Go ahead.\u201d Defendant\u2019s testimony is to the contrary. It was for the trial judge, who saw and heard the respective witnesses, to determine their credibility. We are unwilling and unable to hold that as a matter of law, upon conflicting evidence, there was either an absence of consent or a \u201csubmission to authority.\u201d The trial judge\u2019s determination was based upon substantial evidence and as such is binding upon the reviewing court. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lawler, 9 </em>Cal.3d 156, 160 [107 Cal.Rptr. 13, 507 P.2d 621]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>26 Cal.App.3d 404, 409 [102 Cal.Rptr. 625]; Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure (1963) Appeal, \u00a7 683.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">In any event, we are satisfied that even in the absence of a search of the trunk, there was probable cause to arrest defendant upon suspicion of burglaiy. Similarly, there was reasonable cause to believe that the vehicle contained contraband or instruments or evidence of a crime, and thus it was subject to search even in the absence of consent. (See <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 48-49 [26 L.Ed.2d 419, 426-427, 90 S.Ct. 1975]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Laursen, </em>8 Cal.3d 192, 201-202 [104 Cal.Rptr. 425, 501 P.2d 1145]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Dumas, 9 </em>Cal.3d 871, 881-886 [109 Cal.Rptr. 304, 512 P.2d 1208], and concurring opinion of Sullivan, J., at p. 886; <em>People </em>v. <em>McKinnon, </em>7 Cal.3d 899, 907, 911 [103 Cal.Rptr. 897, 500 P.2d 1097].)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Challenge To The Jury Panel</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">On February 11, 1974, defendant filed a challenge to the jury panel which was heard on February 25, 1974. This date was prior to jury impanelment and the challenge was timely (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1060).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>Counsel stipulated to the following matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">\u201c1. That the panel of trial jurors for the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, Central District, is comprised of persons selected from all the judicial districts of Los Angeles County in proportion to the number of inhabitants therein;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\u201c2. That the panel of the trial jurors for the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, Northwest District, is comprised only of persons who live in said Northwest District and not from all the judicial districts in the County of Los Angeles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">\u201c3. That sessions of the Superior Court of the State of California, for the County of Los Angeles, Northwest District, including sessions of Department Northwest \u2018S\u2019 of said court, are held within the City of Los Angeles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">\u201c4. That the City of Los Angeles is the county seat for the County of Los Angeles;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">\u201c5. That Los Angeles County is a county of the first class within the meaning of the California Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">It was further stipulated that the \u201cpercentage of Negroes on the jury panel for the Central District is greater than the percentage of Negroes on the jury panel for the Northwest District.\u201d The court took judicial notice that more than one million individuals lived in the Northwest District and, upon submission of the motion, denied it without comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">On appeal defendant contends that the jury selection procedure used for his trial is violative of express statutory provisions and further deprives him of due process of law and the equal protection of the laws.

The trial jury list shall be kept separate and distinct from the grand jury list. In a county of the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>class, where sessions of the superior court are held in cities other than the county seat, the names for such list to serve in the city shall all be selected from the district in which the city is located and no names from such district shall be selected to serve as trial jurors for any other part of the county, other than in the county seat.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Fundamental to the proper analysis of defendant\u2019s argument is some discussion of the legislative history of section 206 and of the Los Angeles County superior court branch court system.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Prior to 1875-1876 section 206 read: \u201cSuch lists must contain not less than one for every hundred inhabitants of each township or ward . . . .\u201d The 1875-1876 amendment provided that \u201c[t]he names for all such lists shall be selected from the different wards or townships of the respective counties, in proportion to the number of inhabitants therein, as nearly as the same can be estimated by the persons making such lists.\u201d The 1880 reenactment and the 1881 amendment carried forward the same language as to \u201cdifferent wards or townships.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In 1923 the section was for the first time amended to make specific reference to so-called branch court trials in Los Angeles County: \u201c. . . in counties of the first class, where sessions of the superior court are held in cities therein, other than the county seat, the names for such lists to serve in said city shall all be selected from the townships in which said city is located; and provided, further, that no names from said township shall be selected to serve as trial jurors for any other part of the county.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">In 1951 the term \u201ctownship\u201d was replaced by \u201cjudicial districts\u201d and \u201cdistricts.\u201d The 1959 amendment provided for separate lists for trial and grand jurors. The 1963 amendment added the words \u201cother than in the county seat\u201d at the end of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Although recognized by section 206 in 1923, it appears that branch courts did not come into existence until 1928, with the advent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Long Beach branch.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the next decade Pasadena, Pomona and Santa Monica were established as branch courts, and by 1959 superior court sessions were being conducted in Glendale, Inglewood, San Fernando and Burbank as well, on a full-time basis. Sessions were also being conducted in Lancaster once a week.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The statutory basis for the full-time branch courts\u2014all of which, it will be noted, were located in incorporated cities \u201cother than the county seat\u201d\u2014was a series of \u201cspot\u201d enactments by the Legislature requiring or authorizing sessions in various cities having a specified minimum population and minimum distance from the county courthouse or county seat.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The Lancaster situation was dealt with by a specific law authorizing a session at least weekly \u201cat any designated place in the county, not less than 45 miles distant from the county seat, measured by air line. The place designated shall be within a judicial district, composed wholly of unincorporated territory, with a population of more than 40,000 . . . .\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 69744.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Until 1959 the Government Code made no provision for establishing \u201csuperior court districts\u201d within a county, but simply required or authorized the holding of \u201csessions of the superior court\u201d in the qualifying cities<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> or unincorporated county area.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cUpon qualification of a city or area for a branch court, the Superior Court Rules Committee set up district limits which were then ratified by majority vote of the judges. These boundaries were not formalized by legislative enactment ....\u201d (Study, p. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>At the initiative of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and Superior Court a \u201cmoratorium\u201d was effected during the 1957 legislative session to preclude establishment of new branch courts within 14 miles of each other. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 69749.) The effect of this legislation was to forestall single-judge branch courts in such cities as Redondo Beach, West Covina, Pico Rivera, Norwalk and Whittier.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The 1959 Legislature, acting at the request of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors and Superior Court, enacted Government Code sections 69640-69650, pertaining only to Los Angeles County (\u201cany county [with] a population of not less than 4,000,000\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 69641)), which authorized the board of supervisors to then divide the county into not more than nine (but potentially as many as eleven) superior court districts at which \u201csessions of the superior court shall be held.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 69641, 69643, 69645.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Thus by 1972 the Los Angeles County Superior Court branch court system had developed as stated by Presiding Justice Ford in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>27 Cal.App.3d 719, at page 722 [104 Cal.Rptr. 144]: \u201cHistorically, the courthouse has been located at the county seat. While the county seat of Los Angeles County is the City of Los Angeles, the gradual and substantial increase in population [fn. omitted] and the unusually large geographical area of the county have resulted in the establishment of branch courts as a means of maintaining efficient judicial administration. That growth has culminated in the establishment of eight judicial districts, supplementing that portion of the court system retained at the county seat and which is geographically within the area presently designated as the Central District. Thus, there are now nine geographical areas constituting specifically named districts. [H] The designation and functions of the various districts are set forth in the Rules of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Although section 206 purported to limit the service of a juror resident in an outlying district to that district from the 1923 amendment until the 1963 amendment, it is noteworthy that from at least 1948 until December 23, 1969, \u201cjurors for the Central District [were] drawn from the entire county but . . . jurors for any other district [were] drawn solely from the geographical area of that district.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.3d at p. 724; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Crossan, </em>87 Cal.App. 5, 11 [261 P. 531].)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Defendant contends that since Van Nuys\u2014unique among all Los Angeles Superior Court courthouse sites apart from the Los Angeles Civic Center\u2014is a part of the City of Los Angeles, it is a part of the \u201ccounty seat\u201d and thus, according to section 206, defendants tried there are entitled to a county-wide draw for jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Initially we reject defendant\u2019s premise as to the court facilities at Van Nuys being a part of the \u201ccounty seat\u201d: \u201cHistorically, the center of administration of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County has been at the county seat. As the growth of the population led to the creation of branches of the court, the center of administration remained unchanged and is in the geographical area which is presently designated as the Central District.\u201d <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.3d at pp. 730-731.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">It is readily understandable why the Legislature referred in section 206 to sessions being held in \u201ccities other than the county seat\u201d since branch courts until 1959 were, with the single exception previously noted,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> statutorily authorized only in specially qualified <em>cities. </em>That factor explains the prior use of the terms \u201cwards\u201d and \u201ctownships\u201d in section 206.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>However, since enactment of the comprehensive scheme for superior court districts in 1959, a court divided into such districts has been required to \u201chold its sessions . . .

Code, \u00a7 69741.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Construing together section 206 and the pertinent sections of the Government Code, we think they can be harmonized without doing violence to the intent of the Legislature. (See <em>Ingram </em>v. <em>Justice Court, </em>69 Cal.2d 832, 839 [73 Cal.Rptr. 410, 447 P.2d 650, 36 A.L.R.3d 1391]; <em>Burks </em>v. <em>Poppy Construction Co., </em>57 Cal.2d 463; 470 [20 Cal.Rptr. 609, 370 P.2d 313]; 45 Cal.Jur.2d, Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 117 and 118, pp. 626-628, and \u00a7 121, pp. 629-630.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u201cThe fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citations.] Moreover, \u2018every statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part so that all may be harmonized and have effect.\u2019 [Citation.] If possible, significance should be given to every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose. [Citation.] Such purpose will not be sacrificed to a literal construction of any part of the act.\u201d <em>(Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of Equal., </em>51 Cal.2d 640, 645 [335 P.2d 672].)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The only sensible interpretation of section 206, we feel, is that the Legislature intended in enacting Government Code sections 69640-69650 to vest discretion in the board of supervisors and superior court as to the location of branch courts and to provide that jurors should be drawn from the residents of the superior court district in which the court is located\u2014with the exception of the \u201ccounty seat\u201d (the Los Angeles Civic Center), in which case jurors would be drawn from the county at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">This interpretation requires that where section 206 read \u201ccities other than the county seat,\u201d we construe it to mean <em>\u201clocations </em>other than the county seat.\u201d We are satisfied that this is what the Legislature meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Assuming that view to be erroneous, for the sake of argument only, if there was less than literal compliance with section 206, we point out that its provisions have been held to be directory only, not mandatory. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Crossan, supra, </em>87 Cal.App. at p. 11; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tennant, </em>32 Cal.App.2d 1, 8 [88 P.2d 937].)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>\u201cAs a general rule, errors and irregularities in failing to comply strictly with the statutes in making up a jury list, when there is no resultant prejudice to the parties involved in litigation, does not invalidate the list [citations]. A defendant cannot complain if he is tried by an impartial jury and can demand nothing more.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hess, </em>104 Cal.App.2d 642, 669 [234 P.2d 65].)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">On the other hand, it would be anomalous if not absurd to impute to the Legislature an intent to require a county-wide draw for jurors in the largest and remotest court district solely because of the fortuity that the board of supervisors chose to locate a multi-branch courthouse facility in Van Nuys (part of the City of Los Angeles), rather than, say, in San Fernando (an incorporated city) or in Palmdale or Lancaster (unincorporated county territory). (See <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>65 Cal.2d 666, 673-674 [56 Cal.Rptr. 265, 423 P.2d 193]; <em>County of Orange </em>v. <em>Heim, </em>30 Cal.App.3d 694, 713 [106 Cal.Rptr. 825].)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">We now discuss defendant\u2019s contention that the lesser percentage of black residents in the Northwest District than in the county at large deprives him of due process of law and of the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">We commence with the premise that the jury selection system must draw jurors from a fair cross-section of the community <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Butera </em>(1st Cir. 1970) 420 F.2d 564, 567), but nevertheless, \u201c[n]either the jury roll nor the venire need be a perfect mirror of the community or accurately reflect the proportionate strength of every identifiable group.\u201d <em>(Swain </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 208 [13 L.Ed.2d 759, 766, 85 S.Ct. 824].)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">We accept the principle that either a county-wide or district-wide drawing for jurors is constitutionally valid. <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.3d at pp. 728, 730; <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones, 9 </em>Cal.3d 546, 556 [108 Cal.Rptr. 345, 510 P.2d 705].) <em>Adams </em>involved the converse of our facts\u2014a jury challenge based on use of a county-wide, rather than district-wide, basis for selection of criminal trial jurors. Nevertheless, the reasoning of that case seems equally appropriate to the present facts: \u201cIn view of the permissible state objectives attained by the selection of jurors on a county-wide basis for the Central District and on a district-wide basis for each of the other districts of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, under the traditional equal protection criterion the classification embodied in section 206 of the Code of Civil Procedure is constitutional because it is not palpably arbitrary but is based upon sound reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>cognizable by the Legislature. [Citation.] But since the classification relates to the fundamental right to a trial by jurors drawn from a fair cross-section of the community, its constitutionality must be judged by the stricter standard of whether it is <em>necessary </em>to promote a <em>compelling </em>state interest. <em>(Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>394 U.S. 618, 638 [22 L.Ed.2d 600, 617, 89 S.Ct. 1322]; <em>Purdy &amp; Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>State of California, </em>71 Cal.2d 566, 578-579 [79 Cal.Rptr. 77, 456 P.2d 645, 38 A.L.R.3d 1194].)\u201d <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.3d at p. 732.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">We reiterate that there is such a <em>\u201ccompelling </em>state interest\u201d: \u201cAn essential concern of the state is that there be a system for the administration of justice in criminal cases which assures a meaningful adherence to constitutional principles. The population and geographical area of Los Angeles County necessitate a system of a complex and flexible nature. Only by use of branch courts in designated districts can the superior court function in such a manner as to reasonably accommodate litigants, jurors, witnesses and other interested persons.\u201d <em>(Adams </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.3d at p. 732.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The trial court did not err in rejecting defendant\u2019s challenge to the jury panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Denial Of Motion For Mistrial</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">While Sergeant Lee was testifying out of the presence of the jury, one of the jurors, a Mrs. Grau, was observed by the trial judge to enter the courtroom, at which time the testimony was interrupted until the juror had left the courtroom. The trial judge stated, \u201c[I]t was a matter of two or three seconds between her entry into the courtroom and my interruption of Sergeant Lee.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel stated that Mrs. Grau entered the courtroom as Sergeant Lee was saying, \u201cHe said.\u201d Defendant speculates that Mrs. Grau \u201capparently could have overheard the following testimony\u201d: \u201cSgt. Lee: He said, \u2018Yes,\u2019 he wore gloves. Mr. Weldon: Could he locate the specific houses he mentioned or you mentioned? Sgt. Lee: No. I asked him If he knew where he had been and he said no. I asked him why he didn\u2019t leave the scene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Defense counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial was taken under submission and thereafter counsel made a new motion for a mistrial on the ground that four more jurors, possibly six, entered the courtroom on their way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>into the jury room while Sergeant Lee was on the stand. The court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">There was no showing that Mrs. Grau actually heard any of the out-of-jury testimony of Sergeant Lee nor that any of the other jurors did; there was no request for an interview of any of the jurors to determine what, if anything, the jurors had heard; there was no request for an admonition to the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">As it developed, whatever might have been heard by Mrs. Grau was later repeated in the presence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Defendant\u2019s contention is that \u201cwhether or not the jurors heard anything, the fact that they observed Sgt. Lee testifying, prior to his continued testimony in the jury\u2019s presence, could well lead them to give extra credence to any of his testimony as having already passed some kind of scrutiny by the court.\u201d But this speculation is simply not justified by the record. We detect no abuse of discretion.

The minutes for that date reflect that \u201cdefendant personally and all counsel waive time for trial.\u201d On February 14, 1974, the case was transferred from department NW \u201cS\u201d to Department NW \u201cR\u201d and thereafter was trailed to February 15, February 21, February 22 and ultimately February 25. On that date, the case was transferred to department NW \u201cE,\u201d where it was ultimately tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">On February 25, 1974, defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a dismissal of the action on the ground that the defendant had not been granted his right to a speedy trial.

Code, \u00a7 1157). Defendant was sentenced to state prison consecutively on counts I and VII. He was also sentenced to state prison on counts VIII and IX, but sentences on those counts were stayed, the stays to become permanent upon completion of the sentences on counts I and VII. The likely purpose of the trial court\u2019s action was to follow the procedure approved in <em>People </em>v.
