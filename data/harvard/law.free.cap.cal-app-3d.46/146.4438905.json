J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ach\">Petitioner seeks review and annulment of portions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> decision reducing temporary total disability benefits awarded her by the referee and setting aside a penalty which the referee had assessed against the employer\u2019s insurer. The issues raised by the petition are: (1) The proper method of determining average weekly earnings for the purpose of computing benefits; (2) the sufficiency of the evidence as to the terms of petitioner\u2019s employment; and (3) the propriety of the penalty assessed against respondent- insurer for unreasonably refusing to pay more than the minimum benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Petitioner applied for an adjudication of her worker\u2019s compensation claim against respondents Alta Vista Convalescent Hospital and its insurer, Argonaut Insurance Company. The testimony of the only two witnesses who testified at the referee\u2019s hearing, petitioner and Judy Gileno (nee Busick), may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">On August 19, 1969, petitioner applied to Alta Vista for a position as a nurse\u2019s aide. She was then 22 years old and had successfully completed one year of nursing school. She had previously worked at Alta Vista as a nurse\u2019s aide in 1966 but had left to take a better job with a doctor. The hospital administrator, Judy Gileno, remembered her as a valuable employee and agreed to hire her full time as a nurse\u2019s aide. Petitioner was to begin work in about two weeks when a position would become available. It was agreed that her hours would be adjusted to avoid conflict with her nursing classes. The hospital needed good registered nurses and so Judy Gileno had petitioner promise that in a year\u2019s time, upon receiving her nursing license, she would continue to work for the hospital at an appropriate increase in salaiy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">On August 24th Judy Gileno telephoned petitioner and asked her to work a full shift that day in place of an aide who was ill. Petitioner agreed and while working that evening suffered the severe back injury for which she claims compensation. She finished her shift that day and a full shift the next day before seeing a doctor who advised her to cease work immediately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Petitioner completed her nursing studies and, having passed a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>examination, was licensed as a registered nurse in August of 1970. Except for a short period in 1971, when she worked as a registered nurse at $5 per hour, her injury has prevented her from working in spite of three corrective surgical operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Petitioner was paid at the rate of $1.75 per hour for the two days she worked. Judy Gileno testified that she had agreed to pay petitioner $2.15 per hour for the first 60 days, $2.25 thereafter and $5 per hour upon receiving her license as a registered nurse. She explained that $1.75 was a part-time rate because petitioner was substituting for a sick employee. Petitioner thought she had been offered $2.15 per hour but could not be sure.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Respondents took the position that petitioner had never been hired to work full time, or at a rate higher than $1.75 per hour, and therefore qualified only for the minimum compensation benefits which she had been receiving. Respondents introduced an employer\u2019s report of industrial injury dated August 27, 1969, which reported petitioner\u2019s \u201chours worked per week\u201d as 16 and petitioner\u2019s wages as $1.75 per hour. Judy Gileno acknowledged she had completed and signed the form. Respondents also introduced three pages of computer-printed payroll records. The parties stipulated the wage records showed that \u201cnurse\u2019s aid[e]s usually have been hired at the rate of $1.65 to $1.75 per hour and have been advanced to no more than $2.00 per hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The referee found: (1) The work-related injury had caused temporary total disability; (2) petitioner\u2019s earnings were $70 per week ($1.75 x 40 hours) from August 26, 1969 to November 3, 1969, $80 per week ($2 x 40 hours) from November 4, 1969 to July 8, 1970,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and maximum thereafter; and (3) by paying compensation at the minimum rate of $25 per week, respondent insurer had unreasonably refused benefits. The referee made an award in accordance with his findings of earnings, together with an additional 10 percent as a penalty for unreasonable refusal to pay more than the minimum benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The board granted respondent\u2019s petition for reconsideration, annulled the referee\u2019s award, and entered new findings to the effect that petitioner\u2019s average weekly earnings were minimal for the entire period and that accordingly no penalty was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Petitioner\u2019s main contention is that the board erred in the method used to compute her indemnity benefits for the period after July of 1970. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Labor Code section 4653, as applicable to this case, provided that compensation benefits for employees suffering temporary total disability shall be 65 percent of average weekly earnings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cAverage weekly earnings\u201d is a term of art in the law of workers\u2019 compensation referring to the earnings base or earning capacity used to compute indemnity payments. (2 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workmen's Compensation (2d ed.) \u00a7 12.01[1].) The method of computing average weekly earnings is set forth in Labor Code section 4453, reproduced in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subdivision (d) of that section provides that when the employment is for less than 30 hours per week or where the formula set out in the preceding subdivisions \u201ccannot reasonably and fairly be applied,\u201d the \u201caverage weekly earning capacity\u201d at the time of injury must be determined.  As our Supreme Court has explained: \u201cThe purpose of this provision [Lab. Code, \u00a7 4453, subd. (d)] is to equalize for compensation purposes the position of the full-time, regularly employed worker whose earning capacity is merely a multiple of his daily wage and that of the worker whose wage at the time of injury may be aberrant'or otherwise a distorted basis for estimating true earning power.\u201d <em>(Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>57 Cal.2d 589, 594 [21 Cal.Rptr. 545, 371 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>P.2d 281].) Accordingly, the objective in such cases is to determine \u201ctrue earning power\u201d for, as stated in another decision, \u201cearning capacity at the time of injury is the touchstone of average earnings in California.\u201d <em>(West </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>79 Cal.App.2d 711, 722 [180 P.2d 972].)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">In light of the foregoing principles, the board erred in failing to treat separately the period after July of 1970 when petitioner, pursuant to nursing studies she was undertaking at the time of her injuiy, became a registered nurse. The disputed factual issues regarding the terms of petitioner\u2019s employment, which we consider in a later portion of this opinion, have no bearing on the proper computation of benefits for this later period. Whether or not petitioner was employed on a part-time or full-time basis, her earnings at the time of injuiy did not reasonably or fairly reflect her earning capacity as a registered nurse. Accordingly, Labor Code section 4453, subdivision (d), should have been applied. Under that subdivision, as interpreted by the case law, petitioner was entitled to the rate of benefits appropriate for a registered nurse if it appeared that, but for the injury, she would have been employed full time as a registered nurse during the period following her certification. (See <em>Goytia </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., </em>1 Cal.3d 889, 895 [83 Cal.Rptr. 591, 464 P.2d 47]; <em>Jeffares </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., </em>6 Cal.App.3d 548, 552 [86 Cal.Rptr. 288]; <em>Kampman </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, </em>38 Cal.Comp.Cases 439, 442.)  Factors to be considered in determining earning capacity are the employee\u2019s age and health, skill and education, and willingness and opportunities to work. <em>(Goytia </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 889, 895-896; <em>Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>57 Cal.2d 589, 595.) The term \u201cearning capacity\u201d contemplates an employee\u2019s \u201c \u2018general over-all capability and productivity\u2019 \u201d; it is a concept to be used to estimate \u201cthe monetary effects of a disability on <em>future </em>earnings.\u201d <em>(Goytia </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd., 6 </em>Cal.3d 660, 663 [100 Cal.Rptr. 136, 493 P.2d 864].) Enhancement of <em>earning potential </em>through completion of studies being pursued at the time of injury is a factor which must be considered. <em>(Jeffares </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>at p. 552.)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Relying on <em>Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>57 Cal.2d 589, respondents contend that even if post-injury developments must be considered in determining average weekly earnings for purposes of permanent disability, temporary disability benefits may be determined solely by reference to earnings at the time of injury. This position finds no support in the case relied upon or in the statutes.  Rather, it has been consistently held that the principles according to which average <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>weekly earnings are calculated apply to temporary and permanent disability alike. <em>(Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>57 Cal.2d 589, 594-595; <em>Jeffares </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>6 Cal.App.3d 548, 552.) The only difference, not material here, is that a permanent award must concern itself with a longer period of time than a temporary award.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Petitioner\u2019s employment history, as set forth in her application of employment dated August 19, 1969, shows she held medically related jobs almost continuously from August of 1966 to July of 1968 at which time she became ill, quit her job, and shortly thereafter began nursing school. At the time of her injury, she had completed half of the two-year course of nurse\u2019s training. Judy Gileno, who was acquainted with petitioner\u2019s work as a nurse\u2019s aide, testified that at the time of injury she had no doubt petitioner would become a registered nurse. Gileno also testified that positions were always available for registered nurses. In 1971 when her doctor advised her to seek employment, petitioner immediately obtained a position as a registered nurse at a salary well above that required for maximum benefits. Therefore, the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from the record is the one drawn by the referee, that petitioner was entitled to maximum indemnity benefits for the period after July of 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Maximum benefits for both permanent and temporaiy disability were awarded under similar circumstances in <em>Esparza </em>v. <em>Regents of the University of California, </em>31 Cal.Comp.Cases 433, cited with approval in <em>Goytia </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>1 Cal.3d 889, 897. In <em>Esparza </em>the employee was a part-time student research assistant who was scheduled to receive a master\u2019s degree in chemistry six months after the date of his injury. The board found that but for the injury he would have received maximum earnings after obtaining his degree and awarded maximum benefits from that date forward. (See also, <em>Goytia </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 660; <em>Jeffares </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., supra, </em>6 Cal.App.3d 548.)</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">In support of its decision the board cites only <em>Moreno </em>v. <em>W.C.A.B., 39 </em>Cal.Comp.Cases 109, in which the Court of Appeal denied a writ of review. We need not decide whether the law was correctly applied in that case for it is clearly distinguishable. Mrs. Moreno had been a full-time, permanent employee for five years on the date of her injury. Her petition to have her benefits increased to reflect wage increases granted to other employees in her former job classification after the date of her injury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>denied by the board. That decision has no application where, at the time of injury, the employee was actually in the process of improving his earning potential. (See <em>Goytia </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 660.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">As to the period covering petitioner\u2019s last year in nursing school, the problem is somewhat different. Again, the objective is to predict what would have happened but for the injury. However, as the parties appear to be in agreement that petitioner\u2019s employment contract with Alta Vista correctly reflects what she would have earned that year, average weekly earnings under Labor Code section 4453 must be calculated according to the terms of that contract. The referee found that the contract was for full-time employment but the board apparently believed otherwise. There is also disagreement as to the rate of pay petitioner was to receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Petitioner correctly points out that the board\u2019s findings must fall if not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the entire record and that, as a general rule, the board must accept as true the intended meaning of evidence both uncontradicted and unimpeached. <em>(Lamb </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd., </em>11 Cal.3d 274, 280-281 [113 Cal.Rptr. 162, 520 P.2d 978].) Moreover, when a referee\u2019s finding of compensable injury is supported by solid credible evidence, the board should accord it great weight and should reject it only on the basis of contrary evidence of considerable substantiality. <em>(Lamb </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>at p. 281.) The same principle should govern review of a referee\u2019s finding on other material factual issues. Measured against those standards, the board\u2019s finding that petitioner was hired only part-time by Alta Vista cannot be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Both petitioner and Judy Gileno testified the employment agreement was for full-time work to begin two weeks after hiring. Respondents called no witnesses and the only evidence they produced relevant to this issue was the \u201cEmployer\u2019s Report of Industrial Injury,\u201d a form which Judy Gileno filled out two days after the accident. On the questionnaire Gileno reported petitioner\u2019s \u201cdays worked per week\u201d as two. It was only natural for Gileno to interpret the form as calling for a description of past events rather than a full account of the contractual relations of the parties. Since petitioner had indeed worked only two days when she was injured, there is no inconsistency between the entry in the form and the witnesses\u2019 testimony that petitioner was to fill a full-time position which was about to become vacant.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>As no other evidence related to this issue, the only permissible conclusion is that petitioner was hired to work on a full-time basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">As to the rate of pay, the evidence was less clear. The employer\u2019s injury report form shows applicant was paid at a rate of $1.75 per hour for the two days she worked. Judy Gileno testified that when applicant began full-time employment she was to make $2.15 per hour for the first 60 days and $2.25 per hour thereafter. Applicant thought she had been offered $2.15 per hour but couldn\u2019t be sure. The employer\u2019s records showed $2 was usually the maximum pay for nurse\u2019s aides. Gileno testified an unusually high rate was justified because of applicant\u2019s abilities and the prospect she might continue at Alta Vista as a registered nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The referee set the rate at $1.75 per hour from August 26, 1969 to November 3, 1969 and $2 per hour from November 4, 1969 to July 8, 1970. In his report on reconsideration, the referee stated these rates were \u201ca fair approximation of what the record revealed,\u201d recognizing that \u201cin such a situation, after a long period of time, the memory may be understandably imprecise.\u201d He also noted Gileno had testified to the existence of hospital records showing the exact terms of petitioner\u2019s employment. Although subpoenaed by petitioner, respondents unaccountably failed to produce these records.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">In its decision the board stated, \u201cwe are of the opinion that applicant was hired to work as a nurse\u2019s aide at approximately $1.65 or $1.75 per hour.\u201d However, the only finding made by the board was that applicant\u2019s weekly earnings were minimal. Since the board based this finding on the erroneous premise that applicant was only to work part-time, it did not need to decide the precise rate of pay; even at a rate of $2.25 per hour, earnings would have been minimal when calculated on a work week of only 16 hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">Considered as a whole, the record contains no substantial evidence to support a finding that the rate of pay was lower than that set by the referee. Gileno\u2019s testimony would support a higher award, but the referee was the best judge of the accuracy of her memory and petitioner asks only that his determination be reinstated. On the other hand, the referee\u2019s findings were completely compatible with the stipulation entered regarding the employer\u2019s pay records, the only other evidence on this issue. Therefore, as to the period from August 26, 1969 to July 8, 1970, petitioner\u2019s earnings as found by the referee should not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The final issue is whether respondents are liable for the penalty provided by Labor Code section 5814 for unreasonable refusal to pay more than the minimum benefits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The principles governing application of section 5814 have been clearly stated. It is to be liberally construed in the employee\u2019s favor; the only satisfactory excuse for refusal or delay in payment of disability benefits is genuine doubt from a medical or legal standpoint as to the liability for benefits; and the burden is on the employer or its insurer to present substantial evidence on which a finding of such a doubt may be based. <em>(Kerley </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., 4 </em>Cal.3d 223, 227-230 [93 Cal.Rptr. 192, 481 P.2d 200]; <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. App. Bd., </em>276 Cal.App.2d 381, 384-385 [81 Cal.Rptr. 65].)</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">From the date of injury until the referee issued his award in May of 1974, respondent insurer paid indemnity benefits at the minimum rate of $25 per week. The insurer based its calculation solely on petitioner\u2019s earnings at the time of her injury, $1.75 per hour for a 16-hour week. Use of this standard may only be described as arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The employer\u2019s report of industrial injury informed the insurer that petitioner was working 16 hours per week when injured. To determine benefits the insurer would then have consulted Labor Code section 4453, set forth in footnote 4 <em>supra. </em>The insurer would have seen that subdivisions (a) through (c) were inapplicable. In other words, the insurer could not take the short road by using pre-injury earnings to calculate average weekly earnings. The insurer had to determine \u201cearning capacity\u201d under subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">This rather obvious proposition deserves re-emphasis.. Where an employee is working more than 30 hours per week at the time of injury, it may not be immediately apparent whether subdivision (a) or subdivision (d) of Labor Code section 4453 is controlling and an insurer may conceivably be permitted to calculate benefits on the basis of earnings at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the time of injury until notified otherwise. But we need not decide that question, for those are not the facts here.  Where, as here, initial reports indicate the employee was working less than 30 hours per week when injured, then the insurer may not calculate benefits on the basis of actual earnings at the time of injury until it has investigated further to determine the rate appropriate under subdivision (d) of Labor Code section 4453.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The reasoning just described contains no difficult legal analysis, but only a reading of the statute. That Labor Code section 4453 means what it says was determined at least by the time of <em>Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., supra, </em>57 Cal.2d 589, seven years prior to petitioner\u2019s injury. The decision in <em>Esparza </em>v. <em>Regents of the University of California, supra, </em>31 Cal.Comp.Cases 433, also preceded the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Respondent insurer introduced no evidence to show it performed its duty under subdivision (d) of Labor Code section 4453 to investigate petitioner\u2019s earning capacity. Rather, the record shows that even after respondent was informed petitioner was a licensed registered nurse, it continued compensation at the minimum rate. As to the benefits for the period prior to August of 1970, no substantial evidence was produced to support the contention that petitioner was only to work part-time while attending nursing school.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Respondents failed to produce substantial evidence tending to show a genuine doubt existed, either from a legal or a factual viewpoint, that petitioner was entitled only to minimum benefits. It follows that the referee was correct in assessing the statutory penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The decision of the board is annulled and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Kaufman, J., and McDaniel, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-10\">The board\u2019s new designation became effective January 1, 1975.
