J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEx\"><em>In People </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 180 [115 Cal.Rptr. 235, 524 P.2d 363], the Supreme Court held that \u201cas a judicially declared rule of criminal procedure a city attorney with prosecutorial responsibilities may not defend or assist in the defense of persons accused of crime.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 186-187 [citations and fn. omitted].) In each of the present proceedings, we are required to determine whether the <em>Rhodes </em>proscription applies where the criminal defense counsel involved is not a city attorney but the law partner of one; where the city which employs the partner has taken legislative action which purports to divest him of \u201cprosecutorial responsibilities\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>his role as its city attorney; and where the criminal defendant involved, acting with full knowledge of the <em>Rhodes </em>decision, has waived any effect thereof, as to him, and has affirmatively requested the trial court to permit defense counsel to represent him in his pending prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The petition in each of the present proceedings is for \u201cExtraordinary Relief In The Nature Of Prohibition And/Or Mandamus.\u201d Cleon W. Montgomeiy and Donald A. Sawyer filed as copetitioners in 1 Civil 35955; Bernard Renick McManus and F. Paul Dacey, Jr., filed as copetitioners in 1 Civil 35956. Linzie E. Kramer is named in each petition as the real party in interest in the respective proceeding. According to the petitions, read together, the following events had occurred by November 12, 1974 (upon which date both petitions were filed in this court):<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">Petitioner Montgomeiy was awaiting trial in respondent court, set by that court to commence on November 13, under an information which charged him with having committed several felonies in the cities of Fairfield and Vallejo. Petitioner Sawyer was serving as Montgomery\u2019s defense counsel under appointment as such by respondent court. Petitioner McManus was awaiting trial in that court, set by the court to commence on November 13, under an information which charged him with having committed a single felony in the City of Vallejo. Petitioner Dacey was serving as his defense counsel, and had been privately retained by McManus in that capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The cities of Fairfield, Vallejo and Vacaville are all located within the County of Solano, of which respondent court is the superior court. Fairfield is 10 miles, and Vallejo 25 miles, from Vacaville.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Petitioners Sawyer and Dacey are both members of the State Bar of California and partners in the law firm of Leggett, Gianola, Dacey, Kramer, Sawyer &amp; Intintoli (hereinafter \u201cthe firm,\u201d or \u201cthe Leggett firm\u201d). The firm maintains offices in Vallejo, Vacaville, Fairfield and Napa.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Real party in interest Kramer is also a partner in the firm. He maintains his principal office in Vacaville, is employed \u201cindividually\u201d by the City of Vacaville as its city attorney, and serves in that position on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>part-time basis. Neither petitioner Sawyer nor petitioner Dacey, nor any other member of the Leggett firm, participates in the performance of Kramer\u2019s duties as city attorney or in the \u201cremuneration\u201d paid him by the City of Vacaville for the services he renders in that position.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">On October 28, a judge of respondent court denied a motion by the Solano County District Attorney to disqualify petitioner Sawyer as defense counsel in another pending prosecution (which was not otherwise related to that of Montgomery or McManus).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">On October 29, \u201cconsidering all of the effects of the decision in . . . <em>People </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>12 C.3d 180 [115 Cal.Rptr. 235, 524 P.2d 363], and further considering the fact that the city attorney for the City of Vacaville had only prosecuted one municipal ordinance violation in a period of ten (10) years, the [Vacaville] city council ... at its regularly scheduled meeting, by unanimous vote passed a resolution revoking all prosecutorial duties and powers ... [of its] . . . city attorney and provided that future code enforcement should be accomplished by special counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">On November 6, the superior, municipal and justice court judges serving in Solano County conducted a meeting which was attended by all of them except two of respondent court\u2019s four judges. At the meeting, \u201csaid judges by a majority vote voted to disqualify . . . [petitioners Sawyer and Dacey] . . . and all other partners and associates of any city attorney and deny . . [Sawyer and Dacey] . . . the right to handle criminal proceedings in all of the courts of the County of Solano.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">The presiding judge of respondent court has informed petitioners Sawyer and Dacey \u201cthat notwithstanding the resolution passed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>City Council of the City of Vacaville, . . . [and] ... in the absence of either a termination of the partnership interest of Linzie E. Kramer in . . . [the Leggett firm] . . . ; or, in the alternative, a resignation of said Linzie E. Kramer from his duties as part-time city attorney for the City of Vacaville,\u201d Sawyer and Dacey were both disqualified from acting as defense counsel in the pending trials of Montgomery and McManus, respectively.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As to petitioner Sawyer and the Montgomery prosecution, this pronouncement was formally recorded in the minutes of respondent court on November 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">On November 11, petitioners Montgomery and McManus each signed a written waiver of the effect of any irregularity arising in their respective situation by reason of the foregoing facts and the <em>Rhodes </em>decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>The Solano County District Attorney, \u201cafter consultation with the Attorney General\u2019s office of the State of California,\u201d has evidenced to the presiding judge of respondent court, and to petitioners Sawyer and Dacey, \u201ca willingness\u201d to proceed with the trials of Montgomery and McManus on the dates set for each (and with Sawyer and Dacey continuing to act as respective defense counsel), and to stipulate to pertinent facts among those mentioned above.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Each petitioner includes allegations that, notwithstanding the actions taken by the City of Vacaville and the parties as described above, the presiding judge of respondent court stood firm in his refusal to permit petitioners Sawyer or Dacey to act as defense counsel in the respectively forthcoming trials. This position, it is stated, operates to deprive the criminal-defendant petitioners of their right to be defended by counsel of their choice and to deprive the attorney petitioners of their \u201cconstitutional right to .earn a livelihood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Petitioners further allege in effect that they did not seek an order temporarily staying respondent court, during the pendency of these proceedings, from applying its declared policy disqualifying the attorney petitioners in the two imminent trials. The reasons for this position, they stated, were that the Leggett firm is only one of three Solano County law firms whose membership includes a part-time city attorney, and that seven attorneys in the firm have extensive criminal defense practices and numerous cases pending which include \u201cseveral major felony cases in respondent court.\u201d Petitioners asserted that, for these reasons, a stay order pending resolution of the present proceedings would create an excessive backlog of criminal cases in Solano County, impose an undue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>burden upon the district attorney of that county, and .otherwise impede the ordinary administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">We issued an alternative writ in each proceeding and, for the reasons stated by petitioners as just recited, we did not stay the trials of petitioners Montgomery or McManus. Consequently, and according to statements by counsel at the oral arguments which followed herein, both trials proceeded on schedule and have long since concluded. These facts immediately suggest the view that both proceedings have been rendered moot for lack of a continuing, justiciable controversy as to these four petitioners. (See 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7\u00a7 462-468, pp. 4418-4423.) The proceedings, however, have generated substantial interest among members of the bar and among city attorneys in particular. The city attorneys of six cities have filed formal amicus curiae briefs with leave of this court, other city attorneys have informally expressed their concurrences therein by letter to the court, and still others formally appeared or were present at oral arguments in both proceedings. As will appear, the position of city attorney is widely held by individuals who serve their respective cities on a part-time basis and engage in extensive outside practice, including criminal work.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The circumstances indicate that we should not dismiss the proceedings on the basis of mootness (see <em>People </em>v. <em>West Coast Shows, Inc. </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 462, 468 [89 Cal.Rptr. 290]) and that \u201cpublic interest... in the orderly administration of justice\u201d requires determination of the issues on their merits and at this time. <em>(DiGiorgio Fruit Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Employment </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 54, 58 [13 Cal.Rptr. 663, 362 P.2d 487]. See, generally, 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7 470, pp. 4426-4428 and cases there cited.) Acting accordingly, we have concluded that a peremptory writ of mandate must be issued in each proceeding for the reasons, and upon the terms, next discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In the principal argument advanced by its counsel (the Solano County Counsel) in opposition to the relief sought, respondent court challenges the validity of the resolution adopted by the Vacaville City Council on October 29, 1974, in which that body purportedly \u201crevoked\u201d \u201call prosecutorial duties and powers\u201d held by its city attorney (real party in interest Kramer), declared that he had \u201cno further criminal prosecutorial duties or powers,\u201d and provided that \u201c[a]ll criminal code enforcement shall be accomplished by special counsel.\u201d (See the resolution\u2019s text as quoted in fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>Respondent contends that the legislative body of a general law city cannot thus divest its city attorney of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>\u201cprosecutorial responsibilities\u201d because they are imposed upon him by state law and may not be abrogated by local legislative action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Vacaville is a general law city<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Gov. Code, \u00a7 34102), as distinguished from a chartered city. (Id., \u00a7 34101.) The duties of its city attorney are stated, generally and in broad language, in sections 41801-41803, 41803.5 and 41803.7.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section 41803.7 is an enabling statute designed to implement a city attorney\u2019s prosecutorial function when he undertakes it. Section 41803.5, the only other section quoted which refers to his undertaking the function, states that he \u201cmay\u201d prosecute certain criminal actions with the consent of the district attorney. It accordingly does not impose upon him the mandatory <em>duty </em>to do so; in the construction of the Government Code, the word \u201cmay\u201d is \u201cpermissive\u201d only. (\u00a7 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">As hone of the other sections just quoted imposes upon a city attorney a mandatory duty to prosecute municipal ordinance violations, his duty to do this must be inferred from the omnibus language of section 41803 which imposes upon him a duty to render unspecified \u201cother legal services.\u201d This duty is mandatoiy because the section states that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>\u201cshall\u201d perform the services mentioned (\u00a7 14), but it further provides that he is to do so only as \u201crequired from time to time\u201d by the city council.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Since he does not have a mandatory duty to prosecute criminal actions except as so \u201crequired,\u201d it appears that the city council may validly elect (as the Vacaville City Council has elected here) <em>not </em>to require him to act as a prosecutor. Support for this conclusion is found in <em>Tri-Cor, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Hawthorne </em>(1970) 8 Cal.App.3d 134 [87 Cal.Rptr. 311], in which it was held that the above-cited statutes (see fn. 7, ante) do not authorize the city attorney of a general law city to appear and defend an action against it unless the city council has expressly \u201cauthorized\u201d (i.e., \u201crequired\u201d) him to do so by ordinance or resolution. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 138-139.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The <em>Rhodes </em>court made the unqualified statement that \u201c[t]he responsibilities of a city attorney include, inter alia, the prosecution of persons accused of violating city ordinances.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 180 at p. 182.) Although the authorities it cited for the statement included section 41803 <em>(ibid.), </em>the court did not hold that the statute irrevocably imposed prosecutorial \u201cresponsibilities\u201d upon a city attorney, nor did it analyze the statute itself. As we interpret section 41803, the <em>Rhodes </em>statement may properly be read to the effect that the \u201cresponsibilities\u201d of a city include \u201cthe prosecution of persons accused of violating city ordinances,\u201d in a general law city, if the city council has \u201crequired\u201d that he discharge this function but not otherwise. (We are not here attempting to rewrite the <em>Rhodes </em>court\u2019s statement as quoted: we are reading it in light o.f our interpretation of section 41803.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">As further authority for the statement under discussion, the <em>Rhodes </em>court cited <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Rapsey </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 636, 643 [107 P.2d 388]. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 180 at p. 182.) In the <em>Chapman </em>case, the question was whether the city attorney of a general law city could also hold the then existent office of its \u201ccity judge.\u201d <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Rapsey, supra, </em>at p. 637.) The <em>Chapman </em>court cited a current statute which imposed the duty to prosecute violations of municipal ordinances upon the city\u2019s chief of police, but held (1) that the statute did not deprive the city attorney of his \u201cright and duty to carry on <em>the legal proceedings\u201d </em>incident to any such prosecution, and (2) that, as to such prosecutions which had been initiated by the chief of police and had reached the trial stage, \u201cthe duty should devolve upon the city attorney to conduct such trials as the officer of the city <em>qualified for the performance of such duties.\u201d (Id., </em>at p. 643 [italics added].)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Thus, the \u201cduty\u201d to prosecute a municipal ordinance violation in a general law city may properly befall its city attorney because he is an \u201cofficer of the city qualified\u201d to appear in court for the purpose. <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Rapsey, supra, </em>16 Cal.2d 636 at p. 643.) This does not mean that the person who holds the regular position of \u201ccity attorney\u201d is the only one who may serve the purpose mentioned; anyone who is so \u201cqualified\u201d may serve it when employed and \u201crequired\u201d (see \u00a7 41803) by the city council to do so, and this includes the \u201cspecial counsel\u201d whose employment for prosecutorial purposes is contemplated in the Vacaville City Cbuncil\u2019s resolution of October 29, 1974. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em> We find nothing in the <em>Chapman </em>decision (nor in <em>Rhodes, </em>citing it) to dissuade us from the conclusions that the city attorney of a general law city has \u201cprosecutorial responsibilities\u201d only when \u201crequired\u201d by the city council to perform them, and that the Vacaville City Council validly divested its city attorney of such responsibilities by revoking the requirement in its resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The validity of the Vacaville resolution necessarily raises questions concerning the authority of the city to employ \u201cspecial counsel\u201d for \u201ccriminal law enforcement\u201d (as the resolution puts it: see fn. 2, <em>ante). </em>Two sections of the Government Code (\u00a7\u00a7 37103 and 53060) expressly authorize a general law city, and other public agencies, to employ and compensate personnel for the performance of \u201cspecial services.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Several authorities hold that a public body may not validly do this where a regular officer or employee thereof is obligated by law to perform such services <em>(see Skidmore </em>v. <em>West </em>(1921) 186 Cal. 212, 215 [199 P. 497]) and is willing and able to do so as part of the ordinary professional functions of his position. (15 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 46; 19 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 153; 20 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 21; <em>Jaynes </em>v. <em>Stockton </em>(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 47, 50-56 [14 Cal.Rptr. 49].)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Although this proscription applies to a chartered city whose charter imposes upon one of its regular city officers the duty to perform the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>services in question <em>(Denman </em>v. <em>Webster </em>(1903) 139 Cal. 452, 454 [73 P. 139]), it does not apply to preclude a general law city from employing special counsel to perform prosecutorial duties where it has divested its regular city attorney of such duties. Since the city may validly act in the latter respect by electing <em>not </em>to require the city attorney to prosecute criminal actions (as we have seen), there is no regularly employed city officer whose duties preclude the employment of a prosecutor pursuant to sections 37103 and 53060; his services are \u201cspecial\u201d (see <em>Jaynes </em>v. <em>Stockton, supra, </em>193 Cal.App.2d 47 at pp. 51-56) because no one else in the employ of the city is \u201cqualified\u201d to perform them. <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Rapsey, supra, </em>16 Cal.2d 636 at p. 643.)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Respondent further contends that the city attorney has mandatory prosecutorial duties under state law, of which he may not be divested by local legislative action, by reason of the language of three specific statutes. The first of these is Penal Code section 373a, which expressly refers to the city attorneys of chartered cities<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and is inapplicable here for that reason. (See text at fn. 6, <em>ante.) </em>The second (Pen. Code, \u00a7 691, subd. 5)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is an expression of legislative nomenclature which reaches members of a class \u201chaving by law the right or duty to prosecute.\u201d As it does not purport to <em>vest </em>such \u201cright or duty\u201d in anyone, those members of the class who are \u201cdesignated\u201d as \u201ccity attorneys\u201d are limited (according to our interpretation of section 41803) to persons whose city councils have \u201crequired\u201d them to perform prosecutorial functions. The third statute cited by respondent<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> must be read subject to the same interpretation. None of the statutes cited reflect a general \u201clegislative scheme\u201d under which the state has preempted the subject of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>a city attorney\u2019s duties (see <em>In re Lane </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 99, 102-103 [22 Cal.Rptr. 857, 372 P.2d 897]); according to our interpretation of section 41803, it reflects a contrary legislative intent to defer to city government in matters pertaining to that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Respondent has also cited a zoning ordinance of the City of Vacaville which expressly or impliedly refers to the \u201cduty\u201d of the city attorney in connection with its enforcement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> As we have seen, and except as provided in the ordinance itself, the Vacaville City Attorney is not \u201ccharged by law\u201d with its enforcement (see fn. 12, <em>ante, </em>at [1]), and it expressly states that he shall enforce it only \u201cupon order of the city council.\u201d (See <em>id., </em>at <em>[2]; Tri-Cor, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Hawthorne, supra, </em>8 Cal.App.3d 134 at pp. 138-139.) Proceedings for the \u201cabatement\u201d of a public nuisance (see fn. 12, <em>ante, </em>at [2]) are civil in nature. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3491, subd. 3; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 731.) If the ordinance imposes criminal prosecutorial responsibilities upon the city attorney, they may nonetheless be withheld from him by the Vacaville City Council and imposed by that body upon the \u201cspecial counsel\u201d whose employment for the purpose of \u201ccriminal code enforcement\u201d is contemplated in its resolution of October 29, 1974. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">It may be recognized that we interpret controlling law as vesting wide latitude in city councils to define and control the duties of their city attorneys. This result is consistent with the general principle that an attorney\u2019s duties are ordinarily defined and controlled by his client. It is also consistent with the principle of \u201chome rule\u201d which is the constitutional foundation of cities and other \u201ctraditional units of local government in California.\u201d (See Brooks, <em>The Metropolis, Home Rule, And Special District </em>(1959) 11 Hastings L.J. 110; Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The result is a practical one, moreover, because it acknowledges the realities attending the position of a city attorney in the cities of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>California, particularly the smaller ones.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Attorney General, having examined these realities with respect to a particular subject, described them as follows: \u201cIn a number of the smaller cities of the state the relationship between the person appointed as city attorney and the city is of a very informal nature. An attorney is appointed at a modest retainer to render certain limited services, often he has no office in the city hall and he handles the affairs of the city as he does the affairs of other clients. There is often an agreement between the city and the attorney as to just what services the city attorney is to perform and in many cases both the attorney and the city officials are prone to look upon the attorney as an independent contractor rather than as a member of the city government.\u201d (28 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 362, 364.)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Although the foregoing discussion establishes that real party in interest Kramer has validly been divested of \u201cprosecutorial responsibilities\u201d as city attorney for the City of Vacaville, this fact does not answer the terminal question: his continuing relationship with the city requires examination before we may determine whether\u2014or the extent to which\u2014he or his law partners (petitioners Sawyer and Dacey) may engage in criminal defense practice despite the <em>Rhodes </em>proscription which applies to city attorneys with \u201cprosecutorial responsibilities.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 180 at p. 182.)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The <em>Rhodes </em>court formulated the proscription upon the bases of (1) the practical conflict between the absolute duty owed by a defense attorney to his client and the rapport which a city attorney-prosecutor must reasonably maintain with his law enforcement associates in the employ of his city and \u201cneighboring law enforcement agencies\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 180 at p. 184); (2) the corollary threat to the integrity of the criminal justice system at large <em>(id., </em>at pp. 184-185); and (3) the \u201ccompelling public policy consideration\u201d that the actual or <em>apparent </em>incompatibility, between the role of defense counsel and that of the city attorney-prosecutor, would undermine the vital element of public confidence in the system. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 185-186.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>In spelling out these three factors, the court consistently referred to the disparity between the duties of a defense attorney and those of a \u201cpublic prosecutor.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 180 at pp. 184-186.) Although real party in interest Kramer is no longer a \u201cpublic prosecutor,\u201d as a result of the Vacaville City Council\u2019s resolution discussed <em>supra, </em>the petitions show that he \u201cmight still on occasion have responsibility for advising members of the Vacaville Police Force on civil matters.\u201d (See par. 5 of the waivers executed by petitioners Montgomery and McManus as quoted in fn. 4, and of the proposed stipulation as quoted in fn. 5, <em>ante.) </em>These residual details of his relationship with Vacaville\u2019s law enforcement personnel suggest that the <em>Rhodes </em>proscription might still be deemed to disqualify Kramer himself from engaging in criminal defense practice, and that, if they do, petitioners Sawyer and Dacey should be similarly disqualified because they are his partners.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">However, it does not appear that Kramer will be called upon to give advice on civil matters to personnel of \u201cneighboring law enforcement agencies\u201d outside of Vacaville. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 180 at p. 184.) If he or his partners engage in the defense of criminal prosecutions which do not involve persons employed by that city (see <em>id., </em>at p. 184 [text at fn. 6]), the conflicts of interest perceived in <em>Rhodes (id., </em>at pp. 184-185), and the \u201cappearance of impropriety,\u201d which is to be avoided in any case because of \u201ccompelling public policy considerations\u201d (i<em>d., </em>at p. 185), will be minimal or nonexistent in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Moreover, other pertinent factors have been shown by the records in these proceedings and by sources within the range of our stipulated judicial notice. (See fn. 6, <em>ante.) </em>Among the 412 cities of California, only 64 employ full-time city attorneys under arrangements which prohibit them from engaging in any outside practice. Eleven (11) of them permit their city attorneys to engage in limited outside practice. Each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>remaining 337 cities employs a city attorney on a part-time basis and permits him to engage in outside practice without limitation. Our sources also indicate that many city attorneys in the part-time category have resigned their positions, or intend to do so, because of the <em>Rhodes </em>proscription disqualifying them from criminal practice.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In some of the counties with the lowest populations in the state, part-time city attorneys are among the very few practitioners who are locally available to serve as court-appointed counsel in criminal cases.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The continuing availability of competent attorneys to the cities and to the administration of criminal justice, in these counties and elsewhere, is a \u201ccompelling public policy consideration\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 180 at p. 185) to b\u00e9 weighed in applying the <em>Rhodes </em>rule to the facts presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">We conclude that the <em>Rhodes </em>rule, its purposes, and the public interest will be served if, where a city attorney has been validly divested of prosecutorial responsibilities by the city which employs him, he or his law partners may \u201cdefend or assist in the defense\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 180 at pp. 186-187) of a criminal action in which personnel of the employing city are not involved in any significant respect. Assessment of the latter factor in a particular case, or other questions involving application of the foregoing criteria therein, should be resolved within the sound discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">This conclusion covers only the eligibility of an affected city attorney or his professional associates to defend a person accused of crime. The interests of that person must therefore be considered, because the <em>Rhodes </em>court did not reach the subject. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 180 at p. 185 [fn. 8].) Since an accused may waive his right to counsel altogether, if he \u201cknowingly and intelligently\u201d elects to do so <em>(People </em>v. <em>Maddox </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 647, 651 [63 Cal.Rptr. 371, 433 P.2d 163]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Floyd </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 694, 702 [83 Cal.Rptr. 608, 464 P.2d 64]), it follows that he may competently waive any irregularity suggested by the <em>Rhodes </em>proscription, with respect to his defense counsel, if he acts with the same knowledge and intelligence. Whether his waiver meets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>such requisites is not established by his execution of a <em>pro forma </em>writing which states them (see fn. 4, ante); it is to be determined to the satisfaction of the trial court. <em>(In re Johnson </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 325, 335 [42 Cal.Rptr. 228, 398 P.2d 420].)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">We sum up: the city attorney of a city which has validly divested him of prosecutorial responsibilities, or his professional associates in the practice of law, may defend or assist in the defense of any criminal action (1) in which personnel of the employing city are not involved in any significant respect and (2) in which the defendant has knowingly and intelligently waived any irregularity which might be perceived by reason of the <em>Rhodes </em>proscription <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rhodes, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d 180 at pp. 186-187), subject to appropriate exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion in a particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Although respondent court\u2019s purported disqualification of the attorney petitioners herein was obviously a good faith effort to comply with the <em>Rhodes </em>proscription, it amounted to an abuse of discretion according to the principles enunciated in this decision. Mandate is therefore the appropriate remedy. (See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 547, 559-562 [68 Cal.Rptr. 1, 440 P.2d 65].)</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">A peremptory writ of mandate will issue, in each of these proceedings, directing respondent court to conduct all future proceedings consistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Christian, J., and Emerson, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\">A11 dates hereinafter mentioned refer to the calendar year 1974 except where otherwise indicated.
