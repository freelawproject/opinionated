Plaintiff was awarded $230.52 and interest. It appeals from the judgment, and urges inadequacy of the recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Most of the facts are stipulated and the rest undisputed. Defendant is a corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of West Coast Burglar Alarm Systems; in turn defendant has two wholly owned subsidiary corporations, Aaron Alarm and Sylvester Alarm (hereafter referred to as affiliates). The affiliates install, maintain and sell alarm systems. Defendant\u2019s function is to act as a financial and employer \u201cconduit\u201d for the affiliates. In this respect and on behalf of its affiliates defendant sends out all billings to their customers and collects for them all sums owing, pays all of their obligations, hires, carries on its own payroll and supplies to them all of the waged and salaried persons used by them in their various functions\u2014installation, servicing, sales, central office activities and special contract labor<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2014and makes deductions and cjisbursements on behalf of these employees for all withholding taxes, social security, states disability compensation, etc. Defendant\u2019s corporate officers also serve in the same capacity for its affiliates, and defendant pays all of these salaries. At the end of each accounting year defendant by bookkeeping transaction allocates all income and expenses between the affiliates, and thus has no income or loss, and pays no income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">All of the foregoing facts having been agreed upon or undisputed, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>are called upon to resolve a question of law only <em>(Jones-Hamilton Co. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>268 Cal.App.2d 343, 347 [73 Cal.Rptr. 896]; <em>Gibbons &amp; Reed Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Motor Vehicles, 220 </em>Cal.App.2d 277, 285 [33 Cal.Rptr. 688, 927].)</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s position in the trial court was that defendant was the employer of all of the persons, including the corporate officers, who performed all of the functions of the affiliates,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and therefore defendant could be deemed to be in the business of providing all of the personnel, including the officers, to the affiliates similar to personnel agencies such as \u201cKelly Girl,\u201d \u201cManpower,\u201d etc. which furnish persons who are already <em>their </em>employees to pursue whatever endeavor the new \u201ctemporary employer\u201d requires, except that defendant did not make a profit on its services. Accordingly, plaintiff contended, defendant\u2019s entire payroll sum, for which defendant realistically should be reimbursed by the affiliates whether or not it actually was, should constitute its \u201cgross receipts,\u201d just as the total sums any personnel agency received from its customers (which in such instance would include a profit) would represent its gross receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The trial court did not agree. It did, however, find and conclude that defendant\u2019s payroll in relation to its own office salaries and 25 percent of the officers\u2019 salaries should be considered as expenditures by defendant on its own behalf and, therefore, an assumed reimbursement for these items created gross receipts for defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It further found that because all of the rest of the payroll classifications (for installation, service, central office sales, office and contract labor) represented payments to individuals who performed these duties exclusively for the affiliates, defendant had made the wage and salary payments to all these persons exclusively on behalf of the affiliates. Thus, the court concluded that reimbursement to defendant for these expenditures would create no gross receipts for it. In so ruling it relied on <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Clinton Merchandising Corp., </em>58 Cal.2d 675 [25 Cal.Rptr. 859, 375 P.2d 851], wherein the court held that reimbursement to a \u201ccentral managing, accounting and disbursing\u201d (p. 677) corporation for sums it had paid out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>on behalf of its affiliates, which sums represented obligations of the affiliates, did not create gross receipts for the paying corporation. With the trial court\u2019s ruling we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The record establishes that all of the personnel were employees of defendant thus, of course, it was required to and did pay them their wages and salaries on its own behalf, and not exclusively on behalf of the affiliates. Therefore the entire payroll, regardless of what form of or for whom work was performed by everyone carried thereon, was defendant\u2019s own obligation, and its, assumed reimbursement therefor would constitute its gross receipts. It is this circumstance which serves to distinguish this case from <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Clinton Merchandising Corp., </em>58 Cal.2d 675 [25 Cal.Rptr. 859, 375 P.2d 851], because therein the Supreme Court found that defendant corporation had met the \u201cpayroll\u201d of <em>one of its affiliates, </em>rather than its own. Reasoning again by analogy to the personnel agencies (\u201cKelly Girl,\u201d etc.), they themselves are obligated to pay all of their employees whom they furnish to other business enterprises, regardless of the type of activity performed for those businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Dispositive of the issue raised on the undisputed facts is <em>Rexall Drug Co. </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>113 Cal.App.2d 528 [248 P.2d 433]. Therein suit was brought under section 21.190. Rexall furnished \u201caccounting, financial, <em>personnel </em>[italics ours] legal, executive managerial, and directive services\u201d (p. 529) to 10 subsidiary corporations wholly owned by it; and Rexall apportioned its costs for these services (it did not include any profit) among its subsidiaries. The court held that the total sums so expended and then recovered by Rexall constituted its gross receipts subject to business tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">We conclude that respondent\u2019s entire payroll, including all officers\u2019 salaries, for the calendar years 1968, 1969 and 1970, and its assumed reimbursement therefor constitute its gross receipts subject to business tax. Although in its complaint plaintiff prays for recovery of $2,240.46, we cannot determine either from the pleading or the record exactly what this sum covers\u2014whether it represents taxes only or includes penalties and/or interest\u2014or even whether such computation is correct, thus, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause to the superior court to make such determination in accord with the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Wood, P.

None of the operating companies has a payroll. At the end of the year certain journal entries are made allocating to the operating companies on the basis of gross income, the payroll expenses incurred by Security Systems, Inc. The function Security Systems, Inc. performs is that it acts as a conduit for all of the receipts and expenses of the operating companies.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b789-6\">In opening brief appellant vigorously asserts that the evidence undisputedly establishes that it was such an employer. We find the evidence sufficient to constitute a prima facie demonstration of an employer-employee relationship between defendant and all of these persons. <em>(Robinson </em>v. <em>George, </em>16 Cal.2d 238, 242 [105 P.2d 914]; <em>Woodall </em>v. <em>Wayne Steffner Productions, </em>201 Cal.App.2d 800, 808 [20 Cal.Rptr. 572]; <em>Alford </em>v. <em>Bello, </em>130 Cal.App.2d 291, 295 [278 P.2d 962].)
