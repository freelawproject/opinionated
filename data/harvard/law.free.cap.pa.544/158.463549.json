Following a degree of guilt hearing, the trial court found appellant guilty of first degree murder in both charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a non-jury trial on the other charges filed against appellant, appellant was convicted of burglary,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> robbery<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>conspiracy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the penalty hearing, a jury was empaneled and it determined that two aggravating circumstances existed on each count of murder beyond a reasonable doubt: that the murders were committed during the perpetration of a felony (robbery)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that appellant had been convicted of another murder, committed either before or at the time of the offenses at issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No mitigating circumstances were found. As required by statute in such circumstances, the jury set the penalty at death.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See, Commonwealth v. Basemore, </em>525 Pa. 512, 582 A.2d 861 (1990)(the jury found one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances and thus, was required to impose the death sentence). On September 15, 1994, the court imposed the jury\u2019s sentence of death for both first degree murder convictions and further sentenced appellant to serve consecutively the maximum allowable prison sentences on the three remaining felonies. This direct appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\n<em>I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">Although appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence regarding his first degree murder convictions, we are required in all cases where the death penalty has been imposed, to independently undertake a review of the sufficiency of the evidence, even where a plea of guilty has been entered.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth v, Zettlemoyer, </em>500 Pa. 16, 26, 454 A.2d 937, 942 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 970, 103 S.Ct. 2444, 77 L.Ed.2d 1327 (1983), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>463 U.S. 1236, 104 S.Ct. 31, 77 L.Ed.2d 1452 (1983). When reviewing a sufficiency of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the evidence claim, an appellate court, viewing all the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the verdict winner, must determine whether the evidence was sufficient to enable the fact finder to find that all of the elements of the offenses were established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v. Burgos, </em>530 Pa. 473, 476, 610 A.2d 11, 13 (1992). Viewing the evidence presented in the trial court below in its proper light, we find that the evidence amply supports the convictions of first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">The following facts form the basis for appellant\u2019s convictions: on October 16, 1993, appellant\u2019s 78 year-old uncle, and 87 year-old grandmother were found dead in their residence located in the village of Cumbola, Pennsylvania. Their bodies were discovered after appellant\u2019s uncle had not shown up for work and his employer went to the home to see if anything was wrong. The employer entered the home through the basement door, discovered the uncle\u2019s dead body and summoned the police. When the police arrived at the home, they found appellant\u2019s grandmother with a single gunshot wound in the forehead in the upstairs bedroom. Appellant\u2019s uncle was found shot to death lying on a couch in the basement. During the subsequent investigation, the police spoke to appellant\u2019s mother who informed the police that all she knew was that the night before, appellant had taken his brother\u2019s firearm and had gone to the area in Cumbola village known as Five Points to go \u201cshooting.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> After obtaining this information, the police went to appellant\u2019s apartment and transported him to the police station for questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>At the police station, appellant was advised of his Miranda rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellant indicated that he understood his rights and that he waived those rights. He then gave a verbal statement to the police in which he indicated that on the night of the murders he was at a bar with another male, Roy Miles, and that after a few beers, he and Miles left the bar and traveled to his brother\u2019s house to pick up his brother\u2019s .22 caliber rifle. He and Miles then went to his grandmother\u2019s house where he shot his uncle. Appellant refused to give the police any information regarding the shooting of his grandmother. After his statement, the police arrested appellant for the murder of his grandmother and uncle.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Appellant\u2019s co-conspirator, Miles, testified at the degree of guilt hearing that while at a bar, he and appellant were drinking and they ran out of money.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Appellant told Miles that he knew where they could obtain more money, but that they might have to kill someone to get it. Miles agreed to this proposition and both individuals left the bar and went to appellant\u2019s house and retrieved the rifle. The two men then drove to appellant\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house several miles away. Once they arrived at the house, Miles accompanied appellant, who was armed with the rifle, down into the basement of the house where appellant\u2019s uncle was sleeping. Appellant then fired a single shot into his uncle\u2019s head killing him instantly. He then told Miles to search his uncle\u2019s pockets and take his uncle\u2019s wallet which contained a sum of cash. Thereafter, the two men went upstairs to the grandmother\u2019s bedroom. As appellant\u2019s grandmother was speaking to him, he shot her in the forehead one time killing her instantly as well. The two men then left the house and returned to the bar in Pottsville.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>A social worker who had interviewed appellant at prison testified at the degree of guilt hearing that appellant told her that he and Miles had gone to his grandmother\u2019s house to get money, that he had retrieved a rifle to take with him, that he shot his uncle and that they took money from his dead uncle\u2019s pockets. She further testified that although appellant refused to give any specific details regarding his grandmother\u2019s murder, appellant slipped more than once and stated that he killed \u201cthem\u201d and not just \u201chim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Additional testimony at the degree of guilt hearing included that of a police lieutenant who testified that the shell casings found near both deceased\u2019s bodies had been fired from appellant\u2019s rifle. Autopsy reports were also admitted which corroborated that both victims died as a result of gunshot wounds to the head fired from the rifle possessed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In first degree murder cases, the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant acted with a specific intent to kill, that a human being was unlawfully killed, that the person accused did the killing, and that the killing was done with deliberation. <em>Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 528 </em>Pa. 546, 550, 599 A.2d 624, 626 (1991).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s statements to the police and the social worker, combined with the corroborating testimony of his co-conspirator, Miles, and other evidence clearly showed that appellant, with premeditation, planned to kill, and did kill, two human beings in order to steal money from them. As such, the evidence sufficiently demonstrates that the killings here were done with premeditation, deliberation and in cold blood. Therefore, the evidence sufficiently supports appellant\u2019s two first degree murder convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\n<em>II. Improper Exclusion of Prospective Jurors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Turning to the issues appellant expressly raises herein, his first claim is that the trial court erroneously excluded for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>cause six prospective jurors on the basis that each would be unable to impose the death penalty. Appellant claims that they should not have been excused for cause because they did not have sufficient reservations about their ability to impose the death penalty in order to warrant their exclusion. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">It is well settled that a prospective juror may be excluded for cause when his views on capital punishment are such as would \u201cprevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and oath.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Holland, </em>518 Pa. 405, 410, 543 A.2d 1068, 1073 (1988). Furthermore, absent an abuse of discretion, a trial court\u2019s ruling on a challenge for cause, based upon prospective juror\u2019s answers and demeanor during <em>voir dire </em>will not be disturbed on appeal. <em>Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, </em>521 Pa. 188, 193, 555 A.2d 846, 851 (1989). Here, the <em>voir dire </em>transcript demonstrates that the six individuals in question took the following positions when asked about their ability to impose the death penalty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">\n<em>Potential Jurors:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\"><em>Juror </em>#1\u2014Question: \u201cSo you are saying you would automatically vote against the imposition of the death penalty?\u201d Answer: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\"><em>Juror </em># 2\u2014Question: \u201cDo you have a fixed opinion against the death penalty?\u201d Answer: \u201cYes, I think I do.\u201d Question: \u201cWould you say then that you would vote automatically against the imposition of the death penalty?\u201d Answer: \u201cThe way I feel right now, yes, I would. I\u2019d be against the death penalty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\"><em>Juror </em>#3\u2014Question: \u201cAre you saying that you would listen to this and whatever you heard when you went back to that room you would automatically vote against the death penalty?\u201d Answer: \u2018Wes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\"><em>Juror </em># %.\u2014Question: \u201cYou said it would be hard. Could you explain that?\u201d Answer: \u201cI guess I----don\u2019t think I can make that decision.\u201d Question: \u201cYou don\u2019t believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>you could make the decision itself? Is that the problem?\u201d Answer: \u201cNo, I think it would bother me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-4\"><em>Juror </em># 5\u2014Question: \u201cHave you as a result of anything that you read or anything that you have heard, formed an opinion concerning which punishment the defendant should receive?\u201d Answer: \u201cNot what I read; but of a matter of conscience, I would not be able to condemn a man to death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOz\"><em>Juror </em># 6\u2014Question: \u201cAnd, assume that the evidence so requires it, would you be able to return a verdict of the death penalty?\u201d Answer: \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d Question: \u201cWell, could you vote for the death penalty?\u201d Answer: \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">(N.T. 9/12/94 pp. 55, 68, 94, 160, 222 and 239). The record reveals an ample basis for the trial court\u2019s findings that the six individuals in question would have been, as a result of their preconceived beliefs or attitudes, \u201csubstantially impaired\u201d in the performance of their duties as jurors. Therefore, the trial judge did not abuse its discretion in excluding these jurors. Thus, appellant\u2019s claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\n<em>III. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AzV-\">Appellant next broadly asserts that the trial court erred in refusing to grant his request for appointment of new appellate counsel to review the record to attempt to ascertain if there were any viable issues of ineffectiveness of trial counsel such as to warrant a new trial or sentencing hearing. A review of the record fails to demonstrate that appellant made such a request to the court for new counsel and appellant fails to indicate when or how he petitioned the court for new appellate counsel. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the trial court ever ruled upon such a motion. In fact, the record indicates only that appellant\u2019s counsel filed a motion to allow him to <em>continue </em>to represent appellant <em>in forma pauperis, </em>that the trial court granted the motion, and that appellant\u2019s trial counsel continued to represent him on appeal. It is appellant\u2019s responsibility to ensure that any relevant related matter be filed or made part of the original record. <em>Commonwealth v. Ahearn, </em>543 Pa. 174, 670 A.2d 133 (1996); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>see </em>also, Pa. R.A.P. \u00a7\u00a7 1911, 1923. To the extent that the record is deficient to review appellant\u2019s claim, appellant has the opportunity to request that the omission be corrected by the trial court. Pa. R.A.P. \u00a7 1926. Because the record in this case is devoid of any ruling by the trial court on a motion for new appellate counsel, this Court can only assume that no such ruling occurred or that appellant failed to correct the apparent omission in the record of any such request for counsel and the trial court\u2019s ruling thereon. Assuming that the latter instance is the case, we will not review a claim where the record fails to demonstrate or support the allegation of error. Hence, this claim is without merit.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\n<em>IV. Admission of Photograph</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Next, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in allowing evidence at the penalty hearing (over defense counsel\u2019s objection) of a black and white photograph of appellant\u2019s grandmother after she had been shot on the grounds that the photograph was not relevant and was prejudicial. In the alternative, appellant argues that even if the photograph was relevant, the trial court still erred in admitting the photograph since its relevance was outweighed by its prejudicial nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The admissibility of photographs depicting a crime scene is within the sound discretion of the trial court and only an abuse of that discretion will constitute reversible error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number><em>Commonwealth v. Buehl, </em>510 Pa. 363, 366, 508 A.2d 1167 (1986). A photograph of a murder victim in a homicide trial is not inflammatory <em>per se. </em>Whether the photographs are admissible depends on a two step analysis. First, the court must decide whether a photograph is inflammatory in nature. If the photograph is deemed inflammatory, the court must then apply a balancing test of whether the photograph is of such essential evidentiary value that its need outweighs the likelihood of inflaming the minds and passions of the jury. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Marshall, </em>537 Pa. 336, 341, 643 A.2d 1070, 1075 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Further, this Court has stated that a capital sentencing hearing is not a sanitized proceeding limited only to evidence of aggravating circumstances. <em>Commonwealth v. Marshall, supra, </em>537 Pa. at 340, 643 A.2d at 1074 (1994). Rather, the jury must be informed of the history and natural development of the events and offenses with which appellant has been convicted, so that the jury can truly understand the nature of the offenses and appellant\u2019s character. <em>Commonwealth v. Young, </em>536 Pa. 57, 64, 637 A.2d 1313, 1320 (1993). For the jury to properly perform its function, it must be made aware of the facts of the crime for which appellant is being sentenced and the extent to which those crimes properly support the existence of aggravating circumstances. <em>Commonwealth v. Stevens, </em>543 Pa. 204, 212-13, 670 A.2d 623, 627 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Here, the black and white photograph was offered during the testimony of one of the police officers to demonstrate his description of the crime scene and the condition in which appellant\u2019s grandmother was found, that is sitting upright in her bed after she had been shot. The 87 year-old victim had often slept sitting up due to breathing difficulties and the photograph enabled the jury to visualize how appellant murdered his unsuspecting grandmother with one shot directly in the forehead after he had entered her bedroom. It is also relevant to demonstrate appellant\u2019s intent to kill by the single gunshot to the forehead and his malice aforethought. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number><em>Commonwealth v. Chester, Commonwealth v. Laird, </em>526 Pa. 578, 585, 587 A.2d 1367, 1374 (1991)(color photograph depicting a close view of the corpse was admitted to prove intent to kill in a first degree murder case). Hence, under these circumstances the trial court did not abuse its discretion by allowing the single black and white photograph to be admitted in the sentencing phase. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Buehl, </em>510 Pa. 363, 508 A.2d 1167 (1986)(blaek and white photographs admitted at trial were relevant as they depicted the victims as they were found and demonstrated the position of appellant when the fatal shots were fired); <em>Commonwealth v. Rush, </em>538 Pa. 104, 646 A.2d 557 (1994)(photographs of the murdered victim\u2019s body provided the jury with evidence of the assailant\u2019s intent). Accordingly, no relief on this claim is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">F. <em>Improper Jury Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Appellant next asserts that he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing because the court\u2019s instructions to the jury regarding mitigating circumstances was confusing and misleading to the jury. Specifically, appellant challenges the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">The Sentencing Code of Pennsylvania defines aggravating and mitigating circumstances. They are things that make a first degree murder case more or less terrible. (N.T. 9/15/94 p. 166).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">A jury charge by the trial court shall be evaluated on the basis of the entire charge and not on separate, discrete portions of the charge. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Wortham, </em>471 Pa. 243, 369 A.2d 1287 (1977)(appellate evaluation of the charge must be based on an examination of it as a whole to determine whether it was favorable or not). Furthermore, in order for a new sentencing hearing to be warranted, the instruction must have caused some articulable prejudice. <em>Commonwealth v. May, </em>540 Pa. 237, 252, 656 A.2d 1335, 1343 (1995). The trial court is free to use its own form of expression in order to explain to the jury often-difficult legal concepts. The only issue is whether the area covered by the instruction adequately, clearly and accurately presents the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>issue to the jury. <em>Commonwealth v. Faulkner, </em>528 Pa. 57, 595 A.2d 28 (1991)(the trial judge has broad discretion in phrasing points for charge and is not bound to give instructions in the form requested); <em>see also, Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>511 Pa. 343, 513 A.2d 1371 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Appellant claims that the charge regarding mitigating circumstances improperly informed the jurors that mitigating circumstances were only those that made the murders themselves less terrible, and that the instructions failed to inform the jury that appellant\u2019s character could be considered to support a finding of mitigating circumstances. Appellant claims that as a result of these faulty instructions, the jury was precluded from finding any mitigating circumstances. This claim is baseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">At the outset we note that appellant selectively omitted the remainder of the trial court\u2019s instructions given regarding mitigating circumstances which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">[I]f you find by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant, that the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired or ... any other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense, ... then you will have found mitigating circumstances. (N.T. 9/15/94 p. 171-172).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Clearly, this instruction <em>did </em>instruct the jury that it could consider appellant\u2019s character as mitigating evidence. Further, evaluating the charge as a whole, this Court finds that the jury was appropriately informed that in order to find mitigating circumstances the jury must determine that evidence existed showing appellant\u2019s character was impaired in some way so as to diminish his capacity to appreciate his criminal behavior.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, this instruction is in conformity with the Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Criminal Jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>Instructions and specifically addresses the constitutional requirements outlined in <em>Blystone v. Pennsylvania, </em>494 U.S. 299, 110 S.Ct. 1078, 108 L.Ed.2d 255 (1990)(the jury must be allowed to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence and the types of mitigating evidence must not be unduly limited). Thus, appellant\u2019s argument is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">\n<em>VI. Appeal of Discretionary Aspects of Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Finally, appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in sentencing appellant outside the sentencing guidelines on his convictions for robbery, burglary and conspiracy.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Appellant does not dispute that the sentences imposed were legislatively permitted;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> rather, appellant challenges the discretionary aspects of the sentences imposed. Such appeals are governed by Pa. R.A.P. \u00a7 2119(f) which states that an appellant who challenges the discretionary aspects of a sentence in a criminal matter must set forth in his brief a concise statement of reasons relied upon for allowance of appeal, and that such a statement shall immediately precede the argument on the merits with respect to the discretionary aspects of the sentence. Pa. R.A.P. \u00a7 2119(f). This procedural requirement allows the court to determine if an appellant has demonstrated a \"substantial question\u201d which is necessary to invoke appellate review. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9781(b). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The procedural rule, Pa. R.A.P. \u00a7 2119(f) is designed to enhance the functioning of appellate review process. <em>Commonwealth v. Gambol, </em>522 Pa. 280, 283, 561 A.2d 710, 713 (1989). The legislature has provided 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9721, a thorough, though not exhaustive, outline of considerations to focus the court\u2019s deliberations in imposing an appropriate sentence. <em>Commonwealth v. Tuladziecki, </em>513 Pa. 508, 511, 522 A.2d 17, 20 (1987). To demonstrate that a substantial sentencing question exists, a party must articulate reasons why a particular sentence raises doubts that the trial court did not properly consider these general guidelines provided by the legislature. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In the instant case, appellant has failed to provide the required prefatory <em>Tuladziecki </em>statement of reasons relied upon for appeal. Appellant has not only failed to comply with this procedural requirement, but he has also failed to articulate how his legal sentences present this Court with a substantial question regarding his sentences. Thus, this issue warrants no further review by this Court.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">\n<em>VII. Proportionality Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Finally, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. 9711(h)(3)(i), we have reviewed the sentences of death and the record below and have determined that appellant fails to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief under the three criteria set forth under 42 Pa.C.S. 9711(h)(3). Specifically, we find that: (i) his sentences were not the product of passion, prejudice or any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>arbitrary factors; (ii) the evidence supported the finding of at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d) for each murder; and (iii) the sentences of death for each murder were not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Upon reviewing the record below, it is evident that the verdict was not the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factors. Rather, it is clear that the jury\u2019s verdict was based upon appellant\u2019s cold blooded murder of two elderly, defenseless relatives for nothing more than drinking money for himself and his cohort, Miles.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">With respect to the sufficiency of the evidence regarding at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d), we find that sufficient evidence existed to support each of the two aggravating circumstances found by the jury on both murder counts (namely, that the murder was committed during the perpetration of a felony, robbery, and that appellant was convicted of another murder committed before or at the time of the offense).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The evidence of appellant\u2019s first degree murder convictions for both murders provides sufficient support for the jury\u2019s finding of an aggravating circumstance that appellant had been convicted of another murder committed at or before the time of the offense. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Crawley, </em>514 Pa. 539, 526 A.2d 334 (1987)(evidence was sufficient to support same aggravating circumstances where appellant was convicted of murdering three victims during the course of a robbery). Where there are no mitigating factors found and there is a finding of at least one aggravating circumstance, the sentencing court has no discretion but to impose the death penalty. <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>511 Pa. 343, 358-59, 513 A.2d 1371, 1378 (1986), <em>citing, </em>42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(1)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">With respect to the final factor we are required to consider, in accordance with <em>Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, </em>500 Pa. at 63, 454 A.2d at 961, this Court has conducted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>independent evaluation of all of the death penalty cases decided since September 13, 1978, in order to determine whether appellant\u2019s two capital sentences were disproportional to the sentences imposed in similar cases taking into consideration both the circumstances of the offense and the character and the record of the defendant. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Frey, </em>504 Pa. 428, 443-445, 475 A.2d 700, 707-709 (1984); <em>Commonwealth v. Santiago, </em>541 Pa. 188, 662 A.2d 610, 613 (1995).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Our review reveals that where, as here, there are no mitigating circumstances present and the Commonwealth has proven that the defendant committed the killing during the perpetration of a felony and had been convicted of another murder at the time of the killing, the defendant has been sentenced to death in essentially every instance. <em>See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Zook, </em>532 Pa. 79, 615 A.2d 1 (1992); <em>Commonwealth v. Faulkner, </em>528 Pa. 57, 595 A.2d 28 (1991); <em>Commonwealth v. Crawley, </em>514 Pa. 539, 526 A.2d 334 (1987); <em>See, </em>42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(1)(iv)(the verdict must be sentence of death if the trier of fact finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances.) Therefore, we conclude that the sentence of death imposed upon appellant is not excessive or disproportionate to the sentence imposed in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the convictions and affirm the judgment of sentence of death.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b345-15\">. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b345-16\">. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3502(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b345-17\">. 18Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3701.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\">. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 903.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b346-8\">. 42Pa.C.S.\u00a7 9711(d)(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b346-9\">. 42 Pa.C.S. 9711(d)(ll).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b346-10\">. <em>See, </em>42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iv)\u2014the verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury unanimously finds at least one specified aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b346-11\">. Although appellant chose not to in his case, generally a defendant who is convicted of first degree murder by virtue of a guilty plea to murder, may challenge the sufficiency of the evidence regarding the first degree conviction. <em>Commonwealth v. Robinson, </em>442 Pa. 512, 276 A.2d 537 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b347-5\">. Several police detectives testified at the degree of guilt hearing that immediately after securing the crime scene, they canvassed the neighborhood and questioned neighbors. Based upon the information they obtained, the police contacted appellant\u2019s mother and she informed the police where appellant was currently residing. Based on the mother\u2019s statement that appellant had taken a firearm and was in the area of Cumbola on the night of the murders, the police secured a search warrant for appellant\u2019s apartment where they confiscated a .22 caliber rifle whose bullets were later determined through ballistic tests to match bullets recovered from the victims' bodies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b348-6\">. <em>Miranda v.

In any event, whether a petition for change of court-appointed counsel should be granted is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Commonwealth v. Williams, </em>514 Pa. 62, 65, 522 A.2d 1058, 1061 (1987). Furthermore, 42 Pa. R.Crim.P. \u00a7 316(c) provides that a motion for change of counsel by a defendant to whom counsel has been assigned, shall not be granted except for substantial reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">In view of appellant\u2019s total failure to demonstrate any violation of his right to effective assistance of counsel in the context of the circumstances of this case, his failure to state any specific claim of arguable merit, and his failure to support his claim by appropriate references to the record or by citations to legal authority, the trial court's refusal of the request was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See, Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>534 Pa. 527, 633 A.2d 1119 (1993)(appellant\u2019s claims of ineffective representation by counsel were completely lacking in substance and thus, the trial court did not err in refusing to remover appointed counsel).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b355-9\">. A review of the record indicates that the mitigating circumstances appellant presented to the jury included only evidence that appellant used alcohol/drugs immediately prior to the offense and/or that he had a history of alcohol/drug abuse. <em>See, </em>42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b356-7\">. The trial court imposed the following sentences be served consecutively to one another and consecutive to the two death sentences: 10\u2014 20 years for robbery; 10\u201420 years for burglary; and 5-10 years for conspiracy. See, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">In support of the sentences imposed, the judge stated that appellant\u2019s two first degree murder convictions, the gruesome nature of appellant\u2019s brutal murder of his own elderly relatives, and the attendant circumstances provided ample justification for sentencing appellant outside the recommended guidelines. Absent an abuse of discretion, this Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the trial judge in sentencing matters. <em>Commonwealth v. Ward, </em>524 Pa. 48, 568 A.2d 1242 (1990)(since there was no mandatory sentence to be imposed for the offenses appellant had committed, the trial court had the discretion to impose a sentence outside the guidelines as long as it was within the statutorily permitted ranges).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b356-9\">. It is well-established that a sentencing court can impose a sentence that is the maximum period authorized by the statute, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9756(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\">. Although this Court is permitted to overlook a party\u2019s failure to provide a prefatory statement when the Commonwealth fails to object to the omission, it should only do so in situations where the substantial question presented is evident from appellant's brief. <em>Commonwealth v. Gambal, supra, 522 </em>Pa. at 283, 561 A.2d at 713 (1989). Appellant\u2019s boilerplate assertion that he should be resentenced simply because the trial court sentenced him outside the Sentencing Guidelines without more does not present a substantial question. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">A court has no duty to impose a sentence considered appropriate under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Commonwealth v. Sessoms, </em>516 Pa. 365, 532 A.2d 775 (1987). The guidelines are</p>\n<p id=\"AkE\">not mandatory; rather, they must only be considered. <em>Id. </em>Appellant must, at a minimum, explain specifically why he thinks his sentences were improper. This he does not do.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b358-8\">. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b359-6\">.
