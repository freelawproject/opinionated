Post-verdict motions were denied and the trial court imposed the death sentence for the murder conviction. In addition, the trial court sentenced appellant to a consecutive term of ten to twenty years imprisonment on the robbery conviction, a consecutive term of five to ten years imprisonment on the criminal conspiracy conviction and a consecutive term of two and one-half to five years imprisonment on the conviction for possessing an instrument of crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\n<em>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Although appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence, as in all cases in which the death penalty has been imposed, this Court is required to independently undertake a review of the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, </em>500 Pa. 16, 26-27 n. 3, 454 A.2d 937, 942 n. 3 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>461 U.S. 970, 103 S.Ct. 2444, 77 L.Ed.2d 1327 (1983). The standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence is whether the evidence admitted at trial and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, is sufficient to support all the elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Commonwealth v. Carpenter, </em>511 Pa. 429, 435, 515 A.2d 531, 533-34 (1986). After a review of the record, we find that the evidence is sufficient to support appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>At trial, Commonwealth witness Sondee Harmon testified that on December 6, 1986, she met with appellant, Raul Serrano and appellant\u2019s uncle to discuss with appellant a plan that appellant had for them to make some money. Appellant explained that he knew a man, whom he identified as Alvin Tyler, from whom they could steal a VCR and a substantial amount of money which Tyler had amassed from dealing drugs. Appellant cautioned Harmon that they would have to kill Tyler in order to steal the VCR and the money. Harmon testified that she would not agree to the murder of the targeted person and that appellant, therefore, had to agree that they would not kill the man or else she would not participate. Appellant explained to her that the plan was that appellant would get them all into the victim\u2019s house by telling the victim that he was bringing a woman for the intended victim, appellant and Serrano to have sex with, and that while Harmon and the victim were upstairs in the victim\u2019s house, appellant and Serrano would steal the VCR and search for money downstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">After they agreed to appellant\u2019s plan, the three of them proceeded to the house of Paulette Duncan, at which time appellant directed Serrano to retrieve a paper bag from the trunk of appellant\u2019s car. Harmon observed appellant remove a knife from the bag and place it under his jacket. After visiting a local bar, the three proceeded across the street to the home of the intended victim. The unsuspecting victim invited the three cohorts into the house and offered them each a beer. While the victim was in the kitchen, appellant told Serrano and Harmon not to take the beer or touch anything in the house because they would leave fingerprints. However, appellant, who was wearing gloves, accepted a beer and the four then smoked some marijuana. The victim then asked Harmon to join him upstairs to finish smoking the marijuana cigarette and, after a nudge from appellant, Harmon went to the front bedroom on the second floor with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Shortly thereafter, appellant and Serrano joined them upstairs. Once everyone was in position, Serrano grabbed the victim\u2019s arms and pulled them up over his head. At the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>time, appellant took the knife out from under his shirt and plunged it into the victim\u2019s chest. Harmon ran from the room and Serrano followed her downstairs, where he found her hiding behind the couch. While downstairs, Serrano and Harmon heard sounds of a struggle upstairs. Shortly thereafter, appellant came to the top of the steps, yelled for Serrano to come back upstairs and asked if Serrano had found one of his gloves, which he had lost in the house. When Serrano returned to the second floor, Harmon noticed blood dripping from the ceiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">When appellant came downstairs, he removed his blood-soaked jacket and replaced it with another apparently belonging to the victim. Appellant then placed the knife in a paper bag which he took from the house and the three departed. In the car, appellant joked that the deceased was a \u201ctough dinosaur\u201d who had to be stabbed repeatedly before he died. He also stated that the killing got his adrenaline flowing. The three returned to Duncan\u2019s house, where appellant retrieved two plastic bags into which he placed his bloody jacket, his one remaining glove and his knife before disposing of them in a dumpster.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Appellant drove Harmon home about thirty minutes later and he warned her that if she told anyone about the murder he would harm her family. He then gave her $200 and a substantial amount of marijuana. Serrano received a similar amount of money, although appellant stated that Serrano did not deserve any money because he had not taken the victim\u2019s VCR as planned.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Darcyne Brown, an acquaintance of appellant\u2019s, testified that she spoke to appellant two days later, on December 8, 1986, and that, at that time, he told her that he had murdered someone down the street from Paulette Duncan\u2019s house. Later that day, appellant again bragged about the murder while Brown drove with him to take Serrano to the airport. Appellant and Brown went to Duncan\u2019s house later that evening and, upon sighting the police at the victim\u2019s house, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>stated in Brown\u2019s presence, \u201cWhat, they\u2019re just finding the body?\u201d After making this remark, appellant told Brown not to tell Duncan, who was by then hysterical, that he had killed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Police arrived at the victim\u2019s residence because earlier that evening, Philadelphia Police Officer Patrick Doherty was stopped by two men who told him they believed their friend was dead and directed him to the victim\u2019s house. Officer Doherty found the front door unlocked and, upon entering the house, immediately noticed blood dripping from the ceiling in the living room. The officer proceeded to the second floor, where he observed the victim Tyler naked from the waist down lying in a pool of blood in the front bedroom. Officer Doherty also noticed a large gash behind the victim\u2019s right ear. When the body was later moved, a brown leather glove, identified at trial as belonging to appellant, was found underneath the body.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellant was arrested on August 7, 1987, after Harmon gave a statement to police on July 14, 1987, implicating appellant in the murders.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction for first degree murder where the Commonwealth establishes that the defendant acted with a specific intent to kill; that a human being was unlawfully killed; that the person accused did the killing; and that the killing was done with deliberation. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(d); <em>Commonwealth v. Mitchell, </em>528 Pa. 546, 550, 599 A.2d 624, 626 (1991). Specific intent to kill can be inferred by the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>body. <em>Commonwealth v. Butler, </em>446 Pa. 374, 378, 288 A.2d 800, 802 (1972). Here, ample trial evidence consisting of extensive eyewitness testimony and testimony regarding inculpatory statements appellant made to numerous parties demonstrated that appellant deliberately planned to murder the victim in order to steal certain of his possessions. He then successfully carried out his plan with the assistance of his two cohorts by stabbing the victim to death and stealing money and drugs from the victim\u2019s residence. Such evidence clearly established that appellant intentionally murdered the victim with the malice aforethought required for first degree murder. Therefore, no relief on this basis is warranted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">\n<em>COURT\u2019S REFUSAL TO GRANT A MOTION FOR A BENCH TRIAL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Appellant first argues that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant his request for a bench trial. Appellant has no absolute right to a bench trial. <em>Commonwealth v. Miller, </em>541 Pa. 531, 552-53, 664 A.2d 1310, 1321 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 116 S.Ct. 932, 133 L.Ed.2d 859 (1996). <em>See also, Singer v. United States, </em>380 U.S. 24, 34, 85 S.Ct. 783, 789-90, 13 L.Ed.2d 630 (1965) (no right to a bench trial under the United States Constitution). The decision of whether to grant a defendant\u2019s request for a bench trial is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Miller, supra; Commonwealth v. Sorrell, </em>500 Pa. 355, 362, 456 A.2d 1326, 1328-29 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">In the present case, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s request for a non-jury trial because the court had recently presided over appellant\u2019s prior murder trial and felt that as a result it could not be an impartial fact-finder. <em>Miller, supra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>(court should consider prior exposure to inadmissible evidence; court properly exercised discretion in denying motion for bench trial where court had determined that its partiality was potentially tainted by exposure to inadmissible evidence of other crimes); <em>Sorrell, supra </em>(court properly exercised discretion in denying motion for bench trial where court had determined that its partiality was potentially tainted by exposure to defendant\u2019s record in pretrial proceedings). Given the court\u2019s exposure to appellant\u2019s prior record and its knowledge that appellant had other first degree murder convictions, we find that it was a proper exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion to deny the request for a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\n<em>SPEEDY TRIAL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Next, appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion to dismiss under Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100. Rule 1100 provides that a trial must commence at most no later than 365 days from the date on which the criminal complaint is filed unless there is excusable delay caused by the defendant, his counsel or court congestion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The criminal complaint was filed against appellant on August 6, 1987, and appellant was arrested the following day. Therefore, the \u201cmechanical run\u201d date prior to consideration of any excludable time was August 5, 1988.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellant was not tried until October 18, 1988. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Because the trial commenced beyond August 5, 1988, we must determine the basis for delay and whether any such time was excludable so as to justify the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant appellant\u2019s Rule 1100 motion. Any delay caused by the need to reschedule a trial because of a continuance attributable to the defense constitutes excludable time, whether or not the defendant was prepared to go to trial at an earlier date. <em>Commonwealth v. Robinson, </em>498 Pa. 379, 386, 446 A.2d 895, 899 (1982). When the excludable time is taken into account, the Commonwealth had until November 11, 1988, to bring appellant to trial. Because appellant <em>was </em>tried before the adjusted run date of November 11, 1988, appellant\u2019s claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The docket in the record reflects the following activity affecting the trial date and the run date:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">1. 8/8/87\u2014Appellant filed a motion to quash which was disposed of by the court on 9/2/87 (13 days excludable time), resulting in an adjusted run date of 8/18/88.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">2. 9/2/87\u2014Case continued to 10/8/87 for pre-trial motions and discovery (no excludable time).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">3. 10/8/87\u2014Case continued to 11/16/87 for status listing (no excludable time).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">4. 11/16/87\u2014Appellant\u2019s attorney was permitted to withdraw and new counsel entered an appearance on 12/8/87 (22 days excludable time), resulting in an adjusted run date of 9/9/88.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>5. 12/8/87\u2014Case continued to 12/23/87 on Commonwealth motion to consolidate (no excludable time).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-5\">6. 12/23/87\u2014Case continued to 1/28/88 for status (no ex-cludable time).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">7. 1/28/88\u2014Case continued to 2/25/88 on defense motion (28 days excludable time), resulting in an adjusted run date of 10/7/88.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">8. 2/25/88\u2014Case placed in ready pool.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-8\">9. 2/29/88\u20143/4/88\u2014Appellant was unavailable because he was on trial for a prior homicide (5 days excludable time), resulting in an adjusted run date of 10/12/88.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">10. 9/12/88-9/23/88\u2014Appellant was unavailable because he was on trial for another prior homicide (11 days excludable time), resulting in an adjusted run date of 10/23/88.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-10\">11. 9/27/88\u2014Case continued to 9/29/88 for status (no ex-cludable time).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">12. 9/29/88\u2014Appellant himself requested a continuance, over counsel\u2019s objections, because he claimed he was not ready to proceed to trial. Case was continued to 10/11/88 (12 days excludable time), resulting in an adjusted run date of 11/4/88.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>13. 10/11/88\u2014Appellant filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 1100(g), which was denied on 10/18/88 (7 days excludable time), resulting in an adjusted run date of 11/11/88.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">14. 10/18/88\u2014Trial commenced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Jury selection began on October 18, 1988, more than three weeks before the adjusted run date.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Therefore, appellant was not entitled to a dismissal under Rule 1100.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\n<em>INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqIY\">Appellant\u2019s remaining claims all raise allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. When asserting ineffective assistance of counsel, appellant must demonstrate that: (1) the underlying claim is of arguable merit; (2) the particular course chosen by counsel did not have any reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests; and (3) counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness prejudiced appellant. <em>Commonwealth v. Edmiston, </em>535 Pa. 210, 237, 634 A.2d 1078, 1092 (1993), <em>citing, Commonwealth v. Pierce, </em>515 Pa. 153, 158, 527 A.2d 973, 975 (1987). Counsel is presumed to have acted in his clients\u2019s best interest; thus, it is appellant\u2019s burden to prove otherwise. <em>Commonwealth v. Hancharik, </em>534 Pa. 435, 633 A.2d 1074 (1993); <em>Commonwealth v. Miller, </em>494 Pa. 229, 233, 431 A.2d 233, 235 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">A. <em>Suppression of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">Appellant first contends that trial counsel and post-verdict motions counsel were ineffective for failing to preserve the issue post-trial of whether the trial court erred by excluding testimony of four defense witnesses that the victim had told them that he owed money to his drug supplier (a man by the name of \u201cHodges\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Appellant argues the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>trial court should have allowed this evidence because it would have supported his defense that someone else, possibly the drug supplier, had committed the crime.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">A trial court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is admissible. <em>Miller, supra </em>at 551, 664 A.2d at 1320; <em>Commonwealth v. Cargo, </em>498 Pa. 5, 15, 444 A.2d 639, 644 (1982). A trial court\u2019s ruling on an evidentiary issue will be reversed only if the court abuses its discretion. <em>Commonwealth v. Foy, </em>531 Pa. 322, 326, 612 A.2d 1349, 1351 (1992). In the present case, the alleged four witnesses\u2019 testimony failed to demonstrate (1) that \u201cHodges\u201d was owed money;<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> or (2) that any one particular person was owed money. Furthermore, several of the witnesses would have testified that the victim had told them he was paying back the debt, albeit to some unknown person rather than \u201cHodges.\u201d This proffered testimony, not supported by affidavits or a transcript of the alleged witnesses\u2019 actual testimony, only evidences that statements of the victim\u2019s indebtedness may have been made by the victim, that the victim was indebted to \u201csomeone,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>that he was apparently in the process of repaying this someone or \u201csomeones.\u201d Moreover, the victim\u2019s own statements that he was repaying this debt fails to demonstrate why \u201csomeone\u201d who was being paid back money owed would have a motive to kill the victim. Such speculative evidence has little or no probative value and was properly precluded. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the proffered evidence lacked sufficiently probative value to be admissible.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Furthermore, even if the evidence should have been admitted, appellant has failed to satisfy the prejudice prong necessary to support a claim of ineffectiveness. In order to show actual prejudice, appellant must demonstrate that the alleged ineffectiveness had an actual adverse effect on the proceedings. <em>Commonwealth v. Howard, </em>538 Pa. 86, 99, 645 A.2d 1300, 1307 (1994). Given the overwhelming evidence against appellant, including the eyewitness testimony of two co-conspirators and the testimony of two other witnesses, including the mother of his children, that he had bragged about committing the murder, the omission of speculative testimony that the victim owed a debt which he was repaying was harmless error at most. Therefore, we find that such omission by trial counsel could not have an actual adverse effect on the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">B. <em>Accomplice Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Appellant next alleges that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request (1) a jury instruction that the testimony of one accomplice could not be used to corroborate the testimony of another accomplice and (2) an instruction that the accomplices\u2019 guilty pleas could not be considered during deliberations to infer appellant\u2019s guilt by association. Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>lant further contends that post-verdict counsel was ineffective for not raising these issues in post-verdict motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">In support of his proposition that the testimony of one accomplice cannot be corroborated by that of another accomplice, appellant relies on <em>Commonwealth v. Bennett, </em>220 Pa.Super. 378, 283 A.2d 724 (1971), and <em>Commonwealth v. Pressel, </em>194 Pa.Super. 367, 168 A.2d 779 (1961), in which the Superior Court held that, where a defendant requests a jury instruction that the testimony of one accomplice can not be used to corroborate the testimony of another accomplice, it is reversible error to deny the request.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> However, because appellant never requested such a charge, the question at issue is whether counsel\u2019s failure to request such an instruction prejudiced appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Although appellant contends that he was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to request a <em>Pressel </em>charge, he does not support that contention with anything more than language from <em>Pressel </em>that failure to give such an instruction when requested is not harmless error, essentially arguing that failure to give the instruction was <em>per se </em>reversible error. However, the absence of a jury instruction that would not pass muster under a harmless error analysis does not necessarily give rise to prejudice which would render trial counsel ineffective. <em>Howard, supra </em>at 100, 645 A.2d at 1308 (appellant failed to establish prejudice from trial counsel failure to request \u201cno adverse inference\u201d jury instruction, although failure to give such an instruction if requested would not have been harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In the present case, the trial judge instructed the jury at length on the possibility of bias arising from the testimony of appellant\u2019s accomplices. N.T. 11/1/88 at 1402-08, 1414-18. Furthermore, both Darcene Harmon and Anna Serrano, the mother of appellant\u2019s children, testified at trial that appellant bragged to them on several occasions about how he committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>the murders. Therefore, the testimony of the two accomplices was corroborated by appellant\u2019s own words. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that appellant was entitled to a <em>Pressel </em>charge, the court\u2019s extensive instruction on the weight to be given to the accomplices\u2019 testimony and the corroboration provided by appellant\u2019s own admissions to his participation in the crime , negate appellant\u2019s claim of prejudice. Therefore, trial counsel was not ineffective for failure to request such a charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">With respect to appellant\u2019s contention that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request an instruction that the accomplices\u2019 guilty pleas could not be considered by the jury to find appellant \u201cguilty by association,\u201d appellant disregards the fact that he was charged with <em>conspiracy </em>to commit the crimes with which he was charged. Once the jury accepts evidence which establishes that a conspiracy exists, the jury may infer appellant\u2019s guilt by the actions of his co-conspirators. <em>Commonwealth v. Scudder, </em>490 Pa. 415, 419-20, 416 A.2d 1003, 1005 (1980) (an inference of guilt may be imputed to defendant if there is some evidence that the defendant concurred in the action taken; evidence of a conspiracy satisfies this requirement). Therefore, appellant was not entitled to an instruction that the jury could not infer his guilt based solely on his association with his co-conspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">As previously noted, appellant concedes in his brief that the trial court properly and extensively instructed the jury on how to weigh and evaluate the testimony of accomplices. Brief for Appellant at 33; N.T. 11/1/-88 at 1402-08, 1414-18. The trial court also instructed the jury on the possibility of bias arising from a plea bargain. <em>Id. </em>Because appellant was not entitled to the instruction he claims counsel should have requested and since the jury charge was proper, trial counsel was not ineffective. Because trial counsel was not ineffective, appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise this claim in post-verdict motions. This claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">C. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct in Penalty Phase</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">Finally, appellant asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to prosecutorial misconduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>during closing arguments in the penalty phase.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> It is well established that a prosecutor\u2019s comments are not evidence and the court clearly instructed the jury on this rule of law. N.T. 11/16/88 at 1569. <em>Commonwealth v. LaCava, </em>542 Pa. 160, 182, 666 A.2d 221, 231 (1995), <em>citing Commonwealth v. Green, </em>525 Pa. 424, 461, 581 A.2d 544, 562 (1990). The jury is presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions. <em>Commonwealth v. Steele, </em>522 Pa. 61, 78, 559 A.2d 904, 913 (1989). Moreover, comments by a prosecutor do not constitute reversible error unless the unavoidable effect of such comments would be to prejudice the jury, forming in their minds a fixed bias and a hostility toward the defendant such that they could not weigh the evidence objectively and render a true penalty determination. <em>Commonwealth v. Simmons, </em>541 Pa. 211, 246-47, 662 A.2d 621, 638 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 945, 133 L.Ed.2d 870 (1996). With these standards in mind, we find that the complained-of comment did not warrant a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Appellant contends that the prosecutor improperly invoked the Bible during closing arguments when he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-1\">Possibly, there is one part of the Bible that [appellant] did not read, and that is that there are ten Commandments, and the fifth is, \u201cThou shalt not kill.\u201d Maybe in Bible study, he went from the fourth to the sixth and never read the fifth, because certainly, his studies of the Bible never stopped him one iota from doing these horrible and vicious things.... Well, understanding the Bible and living it are two different things, and I think you are patently aware that [appellant] did not understand the difference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">N.T. 11/16/88 at 1587.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">The statement complained of by appellant was permissible comment to counter appellant\u2019s own injection of the Bible into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>the penalty phase through his own evidence and in his closing arguments in an attempt to portray himself as a religious, peaceful man beholden to the teachings of the Bible and unworthy of capital punishment despite his two previous murder convictions. Appellant presented testimony at the penalty phase that appellant, as a result of his involvement in Biblical studies in prison, no longer possessed the character of a killer and that therefore his life should be spared. Four \u201celders\u201d of his prison church community testified on his behalf that appellant had \u201cfound religion\u201d in prison and that they did not believe he was capable of killing again. His father also testified that appellant had been involved in religious studies for an extended period prior to the murders of Alvin Tyler and his two other murder victims. Moreover, defense counsel\u2019s summation focused in large part on appellant\u2019s religious character.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">When considered in the context of the entire eighteen-page summation, the statements made by the prosecutor are permissible comment in response to the evidence presented. <em>Commonwealth v. Thompson, </em>538 Pa. 297, 312, 648 A.2d 315, 322 (1994) (citations omitted). The challenged references to the Bible in the present ease were made in the following context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">[Appellant\u2019s father] testified that [appellant] was interested and sincere in Bible studies from the time he was a young man, that he continued on and seemed very sincere all that time up until he left the house. He went to Bible school, Bible studies, he talked about it in the house, and even after he left the house, he would discuss it with his mother. He discussed various things, Bible study and what not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">Why is that important? It shows, for 18 to 20 years, the man\u2019s understanding of the Bible and his concept of the Bible inside his head, just as these ministers or elders told you that he has now. But, that did not stop him from committing three horrible, vicious crimes. The proofs in the pudding. As I said earlier, he can state that the Bible [sic] and read it all night long and he can recite it for you verse by verse, being very intelligent about his knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>of the Bible, but it\u2019s like those people that go out and rob, steal and cheat, and then go to church on Sunday, somehow it makes it all better. They are religious people, but I ask you, aren\u2019t those people that live the Bible and live by the concepts of the Bible far different from those just just [sic] reciting it and understanding it? From the time he was very young, he had knowledge and knew the concepts, but it is patently obvious that [appellant] did not live the Bible. It is easy to read and easy to understand it, but it is a lot more difficult to live it. He lived it in a horrible, gruesome way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">So, they want to tell you that after six, seven months of Bible study\u2014he had it all his life\u2014somehow changes this man whom they didn\u2019t even know him [sic]. Possibly, there is one part of the Bible that [appellant] did not read, and that is that there are ten Commandments, and the fifth is, \u201cThou shalt not kill.\u201d Maybe in Bible study, he went from the fourth to the sixth and never read the fifth, because certainly, his studies of the Bible never stopped him one iota from doing these horrible and vicious things. So, I ask you not even to accept that as a mitigating circumstance, the fact that somehow, after being convicted once in March, he now studies the Bible at Graterford when it never changed his character for 20 some odd years. He is now awaiting sentence after trial, and he is now understanding the Bible. Well, understanding the Bible and living it are two different things, and I think you are patently aware that [appellant] did not understand the difference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">N.T. 11/16/88 at 1858-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Where the prosecutor merely argues matters in evidence, no new trial is warranted. <em>Commonwealth v. Lawson, </em>519 Pa. 175, 190, 546 A.2d 589, 596 (1988). The prosecutor may properly comment on the evidence and is permitted to do so with reasonable oratorical flair. <em>Commonwealth v. Marshall, </em>534 Pa. 488, 502, 633 A.2d 1100, 1107 (1993) (during the penalty hearing, the prosecutor is accorded reasonable latitude and may employ oratorical flair in arguing for a sentence of death). The prosecutor\u2019s comments here were logically related to testimony presented during the penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>phase and were therefore permissible comments on the evidence presented during the penalty phase of the trial and were fair response to the evidence presented in mitigation by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Appellant argues however, that the statements were <em>per se </em>reversible error, citing the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Chambers, </em>528 Pa. 558, 599 A.2d 630 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>504 U.S. 946, 112 S.Ct. 2290, 119 L.Ed.2d 214 (1992). In <em>Chambers, </em>this Court stated that \u201creliance upon the Bible or any other religious writing in support' of the imposition of the death penalty is reversible error <em>per se.\u201d Id. </em>at 568, 599 A.2d at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">At the outset, <em>Chambers </em>was not decided until three years after appellant\u2019s trial. Prior to <em>Chambers, </em>references to the Bible were characterized as \u201con the limits of oratorical flair\u201d and were strongly cautioned against, but not forbidden. <em>Id. </em>Trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to anticipate Court decisions which have yet to be handed down. <em>Commonwealth v. Fahy, </em>537 Pa. 533, 541, 645 A.2d 199, 203 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 115 S.Ct. 742, 130 L.Ed.2d 644 (1995). Because these statements were admissible at the time of appellant\u2019s trial, trial counsel was not ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Nevertheless, such comments were a fair response to the evidence presented by the defense and did not violate the <em>per se </em>rule of <em>Chambers. </em>As discussed above, the challenged reference to the Bible, when placed in proper context, was intended only to show that appellant\u2019s character was not affected by his religious studies prior to appellant\u2019s three murders, and therefore the jury should not accept that his Bible studies in prison had dramatically changed his character. This is quite different from the situation in <em>Chambers, </em>where the prosecutor stated: \u201cKarl Chambers has taken a life____ As the Bible says, \u2018and the murderer shall be put to death.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585, 599 A.2d at 643. The prosecutor in the present case did not rely on the Bible to support the death penalty, but made reference to it only to refute appellant\u2019s defense to the imposition of the death penalty based entirely on appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>lant\u2019s alleged religious character and his alleged Biblical ties. Therefore, even if the <em>per se </em>rule of <em>Chambers </em>had been in effect at the time of appellant\u2019s conviction, under the circumstances at hand, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to permissible comment on the evidence. Accordingly, a new sentencing hearing is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">\n<em>REVIEW OF SENTENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Finally, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3), this Court has a duty to affirm the sentence of death unless we determine that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-6\">(i) the sentence of death was the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-7\">(ii) the evidence fails to support the finding of at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALn\">(in) the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3). After reviewing the record below, we conclude that the sentence imposed was not the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor, but rather was the product of a proper weighing of the jury\u2019s finding of three aggravating circumstances against no mitigating circumstances. In such circumstances, where there are no mitigating circumstances found and at least one aggravating circumstance found, as a matter of law, the sentence of death must be imposed. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iv); <em>Commonwealth v. Saranchak, </em>544 Pa. 158, 675 A.2d 268 (1996) (where at least one aggravating circumstance found by the jury is supported by sufficient evidence and no mitigating circumstances are found by the jury, the death sentence is proper). Hence, appellant failed to prove his sentence was the product of the first factor under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">With respect to the second factor under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3), the evidence amply supports the finding of three aggravating circumstances specified in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>The first aggravating circumstance found by the jury was that appellant committed the Wiling while in the perpetration of a felony (robbery), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6). The evidence at trial established that appellant murdered the victim as part of a plan to steal a VCR, drugs and money from his home. Therefore, this aggravating circumstance was supported by sufficient evidence. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3701(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The jury also found two aggravating circumstances under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(10), that appellant had been convicted of two other Federal or State offenses committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue, for which sentences of life imprisonment or death were imposable, or appellant was undergoing a sentence of life imprisonment for any reason at the time of the commission of the offense. Evidence was presented that appellant had been convicted of first degree murder on March 4, 1988, for the November 22, 1985 murder of Stanley Williams, and convicted on September 23, 1988, of first degree murder for the November 26, 1986 murder of Israel Nuremberg. Thus, the evidence supported each of these aggravating circumstances. Indeed, appellant does not challenge these findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">With respect to the final factor we must consider under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3), in accordance with <em>Zettlemoyer, supra </em>at 63, 454 A.2d at 961, we have reviewed the sentencing data compiled by the Administrative Office of the Pennsylvania Courts (AOPC) pertaining to similar death penalty cases and conducted our own research and have concluded that the sentence of death imposed upon appellant is not excessive or disproportionate to the sentences imposed in similar cases. See <em>Commonwealth v. Frey, </em>504 Pa. 428, 443, 475 A.2d 700, 707-08, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 963, 105 S.Ct. 360, 83 L.Ed.2d 296 (1984). Indeed, in cases in which such aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances were found, the death penalty has been imposed in virtually every instance in accordance with 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(1)(iv). <em>Commonwealth v. Hill, </em>542 Pa. 291, 666 A.2d 642 (1995) (three aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances); <em>Simmons, supra </em>(three aggravating circumstances and no mitigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>circumstances); <em>Commonwealth v. Bond, </em>539 Pa. 299, 652 A.2d 308 (1995) (three aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the verdict of guilt and the sentence of death imposed upon appellant by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">FLAHERTY, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">MONTEMURO, J., who was sitting by designation, did not participate in the decision of this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b547-16\">. 42Pa.C.S.\u00a7 9711(h)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b547-17\">. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-18\">. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 903.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b548-7\">. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 907.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b548-8\">. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3701.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\">. The aggravated circumstances were that appellant committed the killing while in the perpetration of a felony (robbery), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6), and that appellant had been convicted of two other first degree murders committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue, for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable or appellant was undergoing a sentence of life imprisonment for any reason at the time of the commission of the offense, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(10).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\">. Both Harmon and Raul Serrano testified at trial regarding these events.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b551-6\">. Dr. Robert Catherman, a deputy medical examiner in Philadelphia, testified that the victim had been stabbed three times in the upper left chest, three times in the left flank, twice in the back of the head and once in the hand. The two most significant wounds consisted of a five and three-eighths inch wound to the chest which punctured the lung and a wound to the head which ruptured the right vertebral artery. The wound in the hand was a defensive wound. Dr. Catherman testified that the death had resulted from the combined effect of the eight stab wounds to the body and the loss of blood from the two most serious blows.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\">. Appellant\u2019s co-conspirators, Sondee Harmon and Raul Serrano, were also arrested and charged with the victim\u2019s murder. However, prior to trial both Harmon and Serrano entered open guilty pleas of third degree murder, conditional on their cooperation at appellant\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b552-10\">. In addition to the evidence previously discussed, evidence at trial also revealed that several months after the murder, Brown and appellant's common-law wife, Anna Serrano (who was also Raul Serrano\u2019s sister), were watching a karate movie with appellant when he commented that he had used one of the techniques in the movie on the victim. In addition, appellant\u2019s wife testified that several weeks prior to the murder, the victim had made sexual overtures to her and that appellant had casually responded by telling her \"not to worry.\" N.T. 11/2/88 at 983-96.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\">. Appellant was arrested on August 7, 1987, prior to the amendment of Rule 1100. Under the old rule, a defendant was entitled to have the charges against him dismissed if he was not brought to trial within 180 days of his arrest. However, the original run date of February 2, 1988, had not passed when the rule was amended effective December 31, 1987, and therefore the 365 day time limit applies. <em>Commonwealth v. Spence, </em>534 Pa. 233, 243 nn. 3-4, 627 A.2d 1176, 1181 nn. 3-4 (1993) (where 180 day run date had not expired when Rule 1100 was amended to provide for 365 day run date, 365 day run date applies to capital defendant, who is not entitled to bail).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\">. The mechanical run date is the date by which the trial must commence under Rule 1100. It is calculated by adding 365 days (the time for commencing trial under Rule 1100) to the date on which the criminal complaint is filed. As discussed herein, the mechanical run date can be modified or extended by adding to the date any periods of time in which delay is caused by the defendant. Once the mechanical run date is modified accordingly, it then becomes an adjusted run date.</p>\n<p id=\"As6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>All parties apparently proceeded under the mistaken belief that the 1987 amendments were inapplicable, and the Commonwealth petitioned for extensions under the old Rule 1100 before the run dates as calculated under that rule.

Although trial counsel sought a ruling pre-trial to allow the testimony, trial counsel failed to challenge post-trial the court\u2019s ruling disallowing such evidence.

Not one of the alleged witnesses stated that the victim said he owed \u201cHodges\u201d money.

The court ruled that the evidence, although hearsay, came within the hearsay exception for statements against pecuniary interest. <em>See </em>McCormick, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7 277 (3d ed. 1984) (a statement that the declarant is indebted is the clearest example of a statement against pecuniary interest). Although this Court has never addressed what is necessary for a statement of indebtedness to be so contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary interest as to come with that hearsay exception, we will not do so now as such a discussion is not necessary to the resolution of this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b559-7\">.
