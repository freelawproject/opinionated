The college denied the request for information and Brown appealed to common pleas court. The college filed a motion to quash the appeal asserting that it was not subject to the Right to Know Act. The common pleas court held that the college was not an agency within the meaning of the Right to Know Act, and, therefore, quashed the appeal. An appeal was taken to Commonwealth Court, which reversed, holding that the college was an agency for purposes of the Right to Know Act, and that it was, therefore, subject to the terms of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">We granted allocatur in order to consider whether the college is subject to the Right to Know Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Generally, the Right to Know Act opens public records to examination and inspection by any citizen, excepting papers the publication of which would disclose the institution, progress or result of an official investigation. The intent of the act was to clarify the right of examination and inspection of public records by all citizens. <em>Wiley v. Woods, </em>393 Pa. 341, 350, 141 A.2d 844 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The Right to Know Act applies to \u201cpublic records\u201d of \u201cpublic agencies.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The act defines an agency as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">Any department, board or commission of the executive branch of the Commonwealth, any political subdivision of the Commonwealth, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, or any State or municipal authority or similar organization created by or pursuant to a statute which declares in substance that <em>such organization performs or has for its purpose the performance of an essential governmental function.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 66.1(1) (emphasis added). Based on this definition of \u201cagency,\u201d the initial question becomes whether the college performs an essential governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Commonwealth Court reasoned that in creating community colleges, the General Assembly sought to supply publicly funded education in locations not adequately served and has, thereby, declared that community colleges perform an essential function.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">We disagree. In order to determine that community colleges perform an essential function, community colleges would have t\u00f3 be statutorily identified as providing essential services, or they would have to provide a service which is constitutionally mandated, or they would have to provide a service indisputably necessary to the continued existence of the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">First, there is no statutory identification of community colleges as providers of essential services. Second, as Commonwealth Court held in <em>Agostine v. School District of Philadelphia, </em>106 Pa.Cmwlth. 492, 527 A.2d 193, 195 (1987), there is no constitutional requirement that the legislature provide for public education beyond the primary and secondary level. Thus, there is no constitutional mandate for the services of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>community colleges. Finally, it is not clear that in the absence of the services performed by community colleges, the survival of the Commonwealth would be in jeopardy. In sum, while the community colleges of Pennsylvania perform important educational services, we know of no authority which holds that their services are \u201cessential.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">We hold, therefore, that community colleges are not subject to the Right to Know Act because they are not \u201cagencies\u201d as that term is defined in the act. Accord <em>Mooney v. Board of Trustees of Temple University, </em>448 Pa. 424, 292 A.2d 395 (1972) (Temple University is not an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of the Right to Know Act); <em>Roy v. Pennsylvania State University, </em>130 Pa.Cmwlth. 468, 568 A.2d 751 (1990) (Pennsylvania State University is not an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of the Right to Know Act, even though it, like Temple University, receives public funds).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Order of Commonwealth Court is reversed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">NEWMAN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-10\">. Although the college challenged the jurisdiction of Commonwealth Court to hear this appeal on the grounds that Brown failed to properly assert jurisdiction, the college requests that this court decide the substantive issues of the case. Brown does not object. In any event, Commonwealth Court was vested with jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 762(a)(4)(i)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-9\">. Because of our disposition of this case, we do not consider whether the records in question fall within the meaning of \"public records\u201d as defined by the act, \u00a7 66.1(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b214-10\">.
