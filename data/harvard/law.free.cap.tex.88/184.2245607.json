Justice Neill, of Court of Civil Appeals, did not sit in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-24\">The Anheuser-Busch Brewing Association, defendant in error, and plaintiff below, a foreign corporation domiciled at St. Louis, Mo., brought this suit in District Court of El Paso County, December 29, 1890, against A. L. Houck and J. P. Dieter, partners, under the name and style of Houck &amp; Dieter, appellees in this court, but defendants in the court below. The suit was to recover the sum of $156.9.38 bal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>anee due on two verified accounts for beer sold by the plaintiff to defendants, and money advanced. Of the amount sued for, $1047 was represented by defendants\u2019 two acceptances in favor of plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASL\">Defendants (appellees) on the 12th of May, 1892, filed their first amended original answer, wherein they pleaded: 1. General demurrer. 2. General denial. 3. A plea in reconvention, wherein they averred, that the beer for the value of which plaintiff sued was sold by plaintiff to defendants in accordance with an express contract by and between plaintiff and defendants, by the terms of which defendants were to have, for the year beginning April 28, 1890, the exclusive privilege of selling by wholesale in El Paso, in El Paso County, Texas, the keg beer manufactured by plaintiff, and that plaintiff had been guilty of a breach of this contract; that thereby defendants by such breach had been damaged in the sum of $21,000 for which they prayed judgment. 4. A plea in reconvention, wherein they set up identically the-same cause of action as that described in number 3, excepting only that the ' contract averred to have been broken was charged to be implied, and not express.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-6\">On February 2,1893, plaintiff replied by amended supplemental petition, wherein it demurred generally and specially, and further pleaded special matter of defense as against defendants\u2019 plea in reconvention, the substance of which was, that the contract pleaded in reconvention by defendants was in aid of a pool or trust formed by defendants and others to enable them to control the beer market in El Paso County, Texas, and hence was void, as being against public policy. On the same day, February 2, 1893, defendants- filed their first supplemental answer, wherein they denied the existence of the unlawful pool or trust asserted by plaintiff in its amended supplemental petition to have been formed by them, and further averred, that even if defendants were members of such a pool or trust\u2014which defendants denied\u2014plaintiff was aware of its existence, and. so knowing and intending to aid and assist said pool or trust to accomplish its unlawful purpose, sold to defendants the goods for the value of which it instituted this suit, and therefore, that plaintiff was not entitled to recover the value of such goods. On the same day, February 2,1893, the case came on for trial. Plaintiff\u2019s demurrers were presented and overruled; defendants admitted that plaintiff had a good cause of action as set forth in its pleadings, except so far as it might be defeated in whole or in part by the facts of their answer constituting a defense. Thereupon the court gave defendants the right to open and close. The case was then tried upon its merits before a jury, and resulted in a verdict for defendants on their plea in reconvention for the sum of $3458.50 over and above plaintiff\u2019s demand. Thereupon judgment was rendered in favor of defendants against plaintiff for $3458.50 and costs of suit. The plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-10\">This judgment was reversed on appeal, by the Court of Civil Appeals.

For the reasons given by the Court of Civil Appeals, we also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>agree with them in holding that the act is not in violation of the Constitution. It follows, that the trial court erred in not instructing the jury that the combination was unlawful, and that Houck &amp; Dieter could not recover of the plaintiff, on their cross-action, for a breach of a contract the performance of which would have aided them in carrying out the unlawful enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">It may be that the decisions of this court establish the proposition, that mere knowledge on the part of the seller that the goods sold are to be used for an unlawful purpose will not prevent his recovering their price. As we view the case before us, it is not necessary to decide that question. The contract between the brewing company and Houck <em>&amp; </em>Dieter bound the company to sell to the latter, and to sell to no other dealer in the city of El Paso. It is clear, we think, that these stipulations were well calculated to aid Houck &amp; Dieter and their associates in effecting the purpose of the unlawful combination. They gave the combination a monopoly of the sale in the city of El Paso of the product of the plaintiff\u2019s brewery, and materially assisted the parties to the illegal contract in carrying out their object of controlling the market for the sale of beer in bulk in that city. Therefore, in our opinion, the case of the plaintiff, if in fact its agent renewed its contract, knowing of the existence of the combination, is not that of a seller who merely knows that the subject of the sale may be used in the furtherance of an unlawful design; but it is that of one who sells under a contract which, by reasons of its special terms, is calculated materially to aid the purchasers in effecting that design. \u2022 We are therefore of the opinion, that should it be proved upon another trial that plaintiff, through its agent duly authorized for that purpose, renewed the contract with Houck <em>&amp; </em>Dieter, by which it bound itself to sell to them and to no other parties in El Paso, and that at the time such contract was renewed such agent knew of the existence of the unlawful combination between the defendants and their associates, Schloss and Howley, then we are of the opinion that the plaintiff should not recover. If, however, as claimed by the plaintiff, the agent had no authority to make such contract, and if after it was made, plaintiff, with a knowledge of the facts, did not ratify the act of its agent, then the plaintiff should recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">It is a question, whether the alleged contract between the plaintiff and defendant was not itself prohibited by the Act of March 30, 1889. The act denounces combinations in restraint of trade, and makes no distinction between restrictions which are reasonable and those which are unreasonable. If it should be held, that the contract constituted a combination within the terms of the statute, if the transaction had been one wholly within the State, then we would have the further question, whether, it being a transaction of interstate commerce, the act could affect it.
