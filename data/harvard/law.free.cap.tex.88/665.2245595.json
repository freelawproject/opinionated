It was a power of attorney irrevocable, authorizing the attorney to recover lands in Texas, and giving one-half interest therein. The contract bore date June 26, 1876. The land in controversy was sold for taxes, and in 1883 the constituents, through other agents, recovered the land at their own expense. Tayler did nothing under the power, and died in 1890. Suit was brought in 1892 by Tayler\u2019s widow, who is plaintiff in error, for one-half of a 640 acres tract which the constituents owned at date of the power.

And we farther authorize our said attorney to institute, prosecute, or defend any and all suits or other legal proceedings whatever, in law or equity, that we may think necessary in recovering the possession of or establishing our rights and titles to, or removing, clouds from title of such lands, real estate, land claims, or evidences of title or claims. to the same as we may be entitled by virtue of our said heirship, .save and except the lands in Montgomery County, as aforesaid; and further, to compromise, compound, or settle at his discretion any adverse or conflicting claim or claims to any such land, real estate, or land claims to which we are in any way interested in the manner aforesaid. \u25a0 And finally to do, execute, and perform any and all things that maybe necessary or proper in and about the premises as fully as we could do if we were, present and acting for ourselves in person.

Tayler died in 1890, and up to the filing of this suit, in 1892, neither said Tayler nor any one claiming under him took any steps \u201cto demand, sue for, recover, or enter into and take possession of said land,\u201d as authorized by said instrument, or did any other act in pursuance of same. In the meantime, the land having been sold for taxes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the makers of said instrument having appointed other agents, through such agents redeemed the land for taxes, in 1883, at a cost of $100, and thereafter, by various instruments, conveyed the land to defendants in error, who seem to have gone into possession and improved same before Tayler\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\">The. question, to be determined is, whether said instrument is an executed contract, whereby, upon its delivery, the. legal title to one-half the lands owned by the Wades, as heirs of Brown, vested in Tayler, <em>without any further action on his part, </em>as contended by plaintiff in error; or whether, as contended by defendants in error, it is an executory contract, not vesting in Tayler upon its delivery any title to any of said lands, but giving him the irrevocable right to acquire title to one-half of such of them as he might, in pursuance of the powers therein conferred, demand, sue for, recover, or reduce to possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">In Dull v. Blum, 68 Texas, 299, Justice Gaines delivering the opinion of the court, it was held, that an instrument in the form of a deed purporting to convey to the grantee 320 acres of the upper half of a large tract, to be taken in a rectangular shape out of any one of the four corners of the tract which the grantee might select, was an executory, contract, not vesting any title in the grantee, but conferring upon him \u201ca mere equitable right to make the selection and compel a conveyance of the tract so chosen by him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In Hazlett <em>&amp; </em>Dickey v. Harwood, 80 Texas, 508, Justice Henry delivering the opinion of the court, it was held, that an instrument in many respects similar to the one before us, \u201ccould not be treated as a deed for any particular land, because it described none,\u201d but \u201cthat it might be treated as a contract to convey the legal title to any land to which it can be held to apply, and upon proof of compliance by the grantees with their part of the agreement, it, in connection with such proof of compliance, would be evidence of an equitable title in them or their vendees to an undivided one-half interest in any lands to which such proof applies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In each of these cases, the application of the instrument to any particular land depended not upon the construction of the instrument by the court, but upon some future action by the grantee under and in pursuance of the same, bringing the land within its terms. The necessity of this future action was sufficient to render the contracts executory.</p>\n<p id=\"At1\">The granting clause in the instrument before us reads: \u201cTayler is to have and retain to himself and to his own use and benefit, and we hereby convey and deed to the said Tayler, one-half of all the lands, etc., described and contemplated in this power of attorney.\u201d The words \u201clands <em>described </em>in this power of attorney,\u201d if left standing alone, would have included all lands in. any part of Texas, except Montgomery County, owned by the Wades as heirs of James K. Brown, and would have required no further act on the part of Tayler to have brought them within the purview of the instrument. The words \u201clands <em>contemplated </em>in this power of attorney,\u201d have, however, a more restricted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>signification, and do not include any of the lands claimed or owned by the Wades as heirs of Brown, except such as the agent, Tayler, might, after the execution of the power of attorney, exercise the agency conferred by the instrument upon. We think this apparent from the entire instrument, for there does not appear to have been any reason for a conveyance by the Wades to Tayler of any lands, except such as, he might exercise such agency upon, the contemplated exercise of such agency being the sole consideration prompting the Wades to the execution of the instrument, and the words \u201cis to have,\u201d used in said granting clause, indicating that Tayler\u2019s title was to be a future acquisition, and the words \u201cretain to himself\u201d indicating that he should first acquire and then \u201cretain.\u201d Thus we have in said granting clause the two words \u201cconveyed\u201d and \u201ccontemplated;\u201d the first limiting the word \u201clands\u201d to all those situated in Texas, except Montgomery County, inherited by the Wades from Brown, and the second limiting them further to such of those lands as the agent might, after the execution of the power, exercise the agency upon. A proper construction of the instrument requires us to give effect to both of said words, and this limits the agent\u2019s rights to such of those lands as may have been by him subjected to his agency after the execution of such instrument. This brings the instrument within the principle of the two cases above cited, and determines it to be an executory contract. It being an executory contract, requiring the rendition of some service contemplated by the agency, in order to confer upon the agent any interest in any particular lands, and there being no evidence in this record that the agent, Tayler,- or any one acting for him, ever attempted to exercise the agency conferred by said instrument upon this particular land, we. are of opinion, that plaintiff in error has not shown that she was entitled to any interest therein.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b689-7\">Delivered November 25, 1895.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">The judgments of the trial court and Court of Civil Appeals, denying her a recovery, are therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
