Upon defendants\u2019 motion plaintiff has been compelled to state separately his causes of action, to wit, one a cause of action against the several directors for their negligence, and others causes of action against the several defendants for the different acts of misfeasance in directing the payment of dividends without authority. From this order the plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b702-5\">Argued before PARKER, P. J., and SMITH, CHASE, CHESTER, and HOUGHTON, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b702-6\">Swift, Fuller &amp; Cubley (Theo.- H.

Hun, of counsel), for respondents.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b702-8\">SMITH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYi\">This complaint is claimed by the plaintiff to state but one cause of action, and that in equity, for the reimbursement to the' bank of moneys lost through the wrongful acts of the directors. The defendants claim that several causes of action are stated, to wit, a cause of action for negligenc\u00e9 or nonfeasance, and several causes of action for misfeasance, claiming that a demand for reimbursement for dividends wrongfully paid in each of the several years constitutes a different cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Under the authorities we think the order was improperly granted. In O\u2019Brien v. Blaut, 5 App. Div. 223, 39 N. Y. Supp. 218, an action was brought by the receiver of a bank against several directors for nonfeasance and misfeasance, and an- order was made compelling the plaintiff to separately state and number the alleged causes of action. It was held :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-10\">\u201cThat the order was improper, in that the plaintiffs had been required to separate and' separately state and number the alleged different causes of action when their theory of the action was that the plaintiffs stated but a single cause of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-11\">\u201cThat the question whether the action be maintained upon the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of a single cause of action in equity was not involved in the motion, and was a question which could only be raised by demurrer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">Williams, J., in writing for the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-13\">\u201cWhether the action could be maintained upon plaintiffs\u2019 theory of a single cause of action was not involved in the motion, and need not be determined here. The proper method of raising and determining that question, if desired, before the trial, was by demurrer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-14\">This case has been followed in the case of Pope &amp; Case v. Kelly, 30 App. Div. 253, 51 N. Y. Supp. 557, where it is held in a somewhat similar, case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-15\">\u201cWhere it is fairly doubtful whether the complaint states more than one cause of action, and the plaintiff intends to state but a single one, a motion of this character should not be granted, but the defendants should be left to their remedy by demurrer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-16\">Plaintiff can hardly be compelled to divide what he claims to be a single cause of action. Defendants\u2019 rights are in no way prejudiced by a denial of the motion. If they here claim causes of action to be improperly united, the question can be raised by demurrer whether or not such causes of action be separately stated in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>complaint. It would seem to be the policy of the courts, under the authorities cited, to refuse to require the plaintiff to separate in parts what he claims to be a single cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The order should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
