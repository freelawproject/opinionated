The provisions of this law were substantially re-enacted by the consolidation act, and later by the charter of the greater city. It is as follows: \u201cThe lands heretofore taken or to be taken for storage reservoirs, or for other constructions necessary for the introduction and maintenance of a sufficient supply of water in the city, shall be assessed and taxed in the counties in which they are or may be located, in the manner prescribed by law at the value of the lands exclusive of the aqueduct and the constructions and works necessary for its purposes provided * * * that the assessed value of the said lands shall not exceed the assessed value of the said lands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>in the immediate neighborhood thereof.\u201d The law of 1901 amended this provision of the New York charter as follows: \u201cThe lands heretofore taken or to be taken for storage reservoirs or for other constructions necessary for the introduction and maintenance of a sufficient supply of water in the city, or for the purposes of preventing contamination or pollution, shall be assessed and taxed in the counties in which they are or may be located in the manner prescribed by law, exclusive of the aqueducts.\u201d By this amendment the exemption from taxation of the constructions and works for the purpose of the aqueduct was omitted. There is also omitted the clause which provided \u201cthat the assessed value of said lands shall not exceed the assessed value of lands in the immediate neighborhood thereof.\u201d It must be plain that by this amendment the Legislature intended to make liable to taxation in the counties in which they are situated, all the lands taken by the city of New York for the maintenance of its water supply, including all constructions and works thereon, and excluding the aqueduct only from such taxation. This construction accords with the policy of the state, as shown by the general tax law of 1896, by the provisions of which \u201call real property within the state and all personal property situated or owned within this state, is taxable unless exempt from taxation by law.\u201d In providing for exemptions, it declares that the-property \u201cof municipal corporations of the state, held for public use, is exempt from taxation, except the portion of such property not within the corporation.\u201d By the general tax law of 1896, as well as by the striking and potent amendment of 1901, it was evidently the intention of the Legislature to establish an equitable basis-for the taxation of. property acquired by a municipality outside its municipal limits, and to restore for the purposes of taxation such property to the towns or municipalities in which it is situated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1132-5\">Counsel to the corporation requests that the court set out a rule for the guidance of the assessors in the performance of their official duty. This is neither practicable nor necessary. The unique character of the property, to be assessed and its great value make the rule governing its assessment no different from that governing the assessment of other property. The assessors should, of course, assess each parcel, keeping in mind the extent and nature of the constructions upon it, its relation to the water system of New York City in its entirety, its situation, the uses to which it is put, the approximate cost of reproduction, and then put upon it such a conservative and just value as, in their judgment and conscience, it warrants, and which will be in keeping with the valuations of other property on the same assessment roll.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1132-6\">I will sign orders in each case accordingly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1132-7\">Argued before HIRSCHBERG, P.
