All the questions-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>which the appellant seeks to raise are presented by the appeal from the interlocutory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">We think the demurrer to the separate defense set up in paragraph 7 of the answer should have been sustained. That paragraph alleges, in substance, that in and by the agreement between the defendants and plaintiff\u2019s assignors the latter bound themselves to send defendants orders only from first-class firms, who would pay to defendants a commission of 1 per cent, per bushel on the' wheat sold by defendants for them, of which commissions the defendants agreed to credit plaintiff\u2019s assignors with three-eighths, and that the first-class firms were to pay all cable expenses. There is no breach of this agreement alleg\u00e9d, the only allegations in this respect being \u201cthat said first-class firms have refused to pay defendants any of said commissions or cable expenses.\u201d Why they refused, or what bearing their nonpayment has upon the agreement alleged, does not appear; and, taking all the allegations of the paragraph together, we do not find any defense stated, and for this reason the demurrer to it should, as already intimated, have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">As to the counterclaim, we think the allegations are sufficient, and therefore the demurrer to it was properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">It follows that the judgment appealed from should be modified by sustaining the demurrer to the separate defense, with leave as to this defense to answer over on payment of <em>costs; </em>and as so modified the interlocutory judgment should be affirmed, without costs to either party upon this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
