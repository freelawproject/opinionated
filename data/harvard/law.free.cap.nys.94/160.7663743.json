The defendants answered separately; the defendant Stanley denying the allegations of the complaint, and alleging that Heaton performed the contract; the defendant Patterson admitting the copartnership, but denying the other allegations of the complaint, and alleging that Heaton performed the contract with the plaintiff, and that the alleged written guaranty was an individual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>and several guaranty for the performance of the alleged contract between Heaton and the plaintiff, that this guaranty was signed by the defendant Stanley without the knowledge and consent of the defendant Patterson, and that neither partner was authorized to make such guaranty by virtue of the partnership agreement. Upon the trial the defendant Patterson, called as a witness\u00bbfor the plaintiff, testified that he was in partnership with the defendant Stanley. He was then shown a contract between plaintiff and Heaton, and testified that the defendant Stanley, his partner, signed the name of Stanley &amp; Patterson to the guaranty clause at the end of that agreement; that at the time that instrument was executed the witness was in Canada, and he'first heard of it a year and a half or two years afterwards. The contract between Heaton and the plaintiff was then introduced in evidence. It provided that Heaton was to furnish all the materials for the performance of the work according to the specification entitled \u201cSpecification for bell and speaking tube work in the 42nd street tenements at 42nd street and Tenth avenue, New York City.\" At-the bottom of that contract is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-3\">\u201cWe severally and individually guarantee the foregoing contract as called for in specification for Bell and Speaking Tube work, in the penal sum of One</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF_\">thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgF\">Stanley &amp; Patterson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">Upon this instrument being introduced in evidence, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint, and that motion was entertained upon the grounds that the guaranty was indefinite, and that it did not guaranty the plaintiff against loss upon the failure of Heaton to complete the contract, but simply guarantied the foregoing contract, as nothing appeared to show that it intended the performance of the\u2019 contract by the plaintiff or by Heaton. In answer to this suggestion counsel for the plaintiff said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\">\u201cIt seems to me that that could not possibly have but that one meaning;\" and we are further prepared to show that at the time this guaranty was written the contractor, Heaton, had signed, and the association, the owner, had not signed, and that is further evidence going to show what the meaning was.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">After some further discussion, counsel for the plaintiff said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">\u201cWe offer to prove the circumstances under which this guaranty was executed; that is, that the contractor took this guaranty to Messrs. Patterson and Stanley, and told them that, in order to get the contract executed, he would have to have it guarantied by them; that the plaintiff insisted upon that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6v\">* * * We will prove the inducement to the defendants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">Whereupon the court interposed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\">\u201cYou can offer a lot of proof, but you. cannot use that proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">The motion was then granted, to which plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">As the plaintiff was not allowed to introduce his evidence, if facts alleged in the complaint stated a cause of action based upon the written instrument supplemented by evidence of a verbal contract, the court should have allowed the testimony to be given, and it was error to dismiss the complaint. The allegations of the complaint are that on the 8th day of September, 1899, the plaintiff entered into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>a contract with Heaton, and that at the same time, and as an inducement to plaintiff to enter into said contract, defendants guarantied the performance of said contract by said Heaton in the sum of $1,000. The undertaking indorsed on the contract between Heaton and the plaintiff was signed by the defendant Stanley, and by it the defendants \u201cseverally and individually guaranty the foregoing contract as called for in specification for' bell and speaking tube work, in the penal sum of one thousand dollars.\u201d This, upon its face, was not a firm obligation, but a several and individual one. It is clear that no action against the partnership could be sustained. The plaintiff\u2019s evidence showed that Stanley had no authority to sign the instrument as agent for Patterson, and it is not alleged to be a copartnership agreement. The complaint, as to Patterson, was therefore properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The remaining question is whether the plaintiff, upon the allegations of the complaint, was entitled to prove a verbal guaranty, or a guaranty partly verbal and partly in writing, by which the defendant Stanley guarantied the performance of the contract by \u25a0Heaton. The complaint does not allege whether the contract of guaranty was in writing or verbal, and the statute of frauds was not pleaded as a defense. The plaintiff claimed that he could have supplemented the written instruments by testimony to show that Stanley did guaranty the performance of the contract by Heaton. While it is alleged in the complaint that the defendants were co-partners, the contract of guaranty is not alleged to have been executed by the defendants as copartners. Under this allegation, I think, the plaintiff should have been allowed to prove a verbal guaranty by Stanley. It is now settled in this state that the statute of frauds must be pleaded as a defense. Crane v. Powell, 139 N. Y. 379, 34 N. E. 911; Sanger v. French, 157 N. Y. 213, 51 N. E. 979; Matthews v. Matthews, 154 N. Y. 288, 48 N. E. 531. If the plaintiff therefore can prove a verbal undertaking by Stanley to guaranty the plaintiff against loss by the failure of Heaton to complete the contract, I can see no reason why, upon proof, or such a verbal agreement, supplemented by this individual promise of Stanley indorsed upon the contract, a cause of action against Stanley would not have been established against him. For this reason I think the judgment in favor of Stanley against the plaintiff must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">It follows, therefore, that the judgment in favor of Patterson must be affirmed, with costs; and the judgment in favor of Stanley must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur; PATTERSON, J., in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
