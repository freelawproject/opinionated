Y. 489, which was determined to constitute a conditional limitation of the term permitting the main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>tenance of \u00e1 summary proceeding for' holding over. There is no' force in the contention that the case is different because, in the' lease now under consideration, the language is that, in the contingency provided for, the tenant \u201cagrees to cancel said lease.\u201d This is equivalent to saying that the tenant \u201cagrees that the lease shall' be thereby canceled,\u201d and does not contemplate any act by the tenant to complete the cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The subtenant\u2019s rights are measured by those of his immediate landlord, the original tenant, and the cancellation of the lease, by its own terms, as to one, cancels it as to both.
