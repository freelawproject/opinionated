The papers upon which he has obtained an order for the examination of the defendant\u2019s vice president and treasurer before trial make out a fair case for the examination of. that officer as to some of the matters specified in the order, to enable the plaintiff to prove the damages which he has sustained; but the order goes too far in certain respects. While it seems to us proper that the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>fendant should be required to disclose the names of those persons or concerns to whom it gave work of the character referred to in the contract, and the quantity of such work given to each, we see no propriety or occasion for a disclosure of the prices at which such work was done. A knowledge of such prices is not essential or material to prove the loss sustained.by the plaintiff, assuming his theory as to the proper measure of damages to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The direction in the order for the production of the defendant\u2019s books was virtually amended upon the motion to vacate, so as to provide that the books should be produced only for the purpose of refreshing the recollection of the vice president and treasurer, who is to be examined. This amendment obviates the objection which would otherwise arise under the authority of Romer v. Kensico Cemetery, 79 App. Div. 100, 80 N. Y. Supp. 38, and the amended provision seems warranted by the decision in the Matter of Sands, 98 App. Div. 149, 90 N. Y. Supp. 749. Nevertheless, a corporation ought not to be required to produce its books, upon the examination of one of its officers before trial, to enable him to refresh his memory therefrom while on the stand, unless he requires their assistance in' order to testify concerning the matters in regard to- which he is to be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The motion to vacate the order of examination should not have been wholly denied with costs. The court at Special Term should have modified the order, without costs, (1) by striking out the requirement that the witness be examined as to the prices already mentioned, and (2) by inserting a provision that the books shall be produced, not for the inspection of the adverse party, but only for the use of the witness, upon the examination, in case he shall need their assistance to refresh his memory. The order appealed from must be reversed, and the motion granted to the extent of thus modifying the order of examination.'</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
