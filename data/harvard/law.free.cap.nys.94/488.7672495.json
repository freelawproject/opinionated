This affidavit was not relevant or material to any question at issue. The purpose of the plaintiff in offering it in evidence must have been to prejudice the jury unduly against the defendant. It may have had the desired effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-17\">The judgment will therefore be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
