The defendant thereafter defaulted, and the plaintiff, as was its right, foreclosed\u2014a right not taken from it by provision for sale under the power mentioned (Briggs v. Oliver, 68 N. Y. 336, 339), and it was not necessary that the mortgage should so declare (Bragelman v. Daue, 69 N. Y. 69, 74). Nor was it reversible fault that the plaintiff, a foreign corporation, failed to plead its compliance with our laws in regard to permission to do business' here, for the defendant, answering with a general denial, upon information and belief, even as to its own incorporation, waived its right to raise the question. C. R. Parmele Co. v. Haas, 171 N. Y. 579, 583, 64 N. E. 440. The judgment should therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-18\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
