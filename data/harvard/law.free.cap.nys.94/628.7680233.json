Empire Self-Lighting Oil Lamp Co., 24 Misc. Rep. 193, 195, 52 N. Y. Supp. 635, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-10\">\u201cThe statute in question was evidently enacted for the purpose of enabling stockholders of a stock corporation to inspect its stoekbook at its office in the state, or at the office of its transfer agent, if any, within the state, during business hours. If this view is well founded, then it is obvious jhat such book must be kept in the office referred to, that a stockholder has a right to insist upon there making an inspection of the book, and that he is not required to go elsewhere for that purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">Much less would he seem to be required to be satisfied with a factitious book which was i conceded to be not in conformity to statute, for information obtained therefrom would be of little value. Moreover, from the book that was produced he was not allowed to take extracts. This was his right, for \u201cthe right of inspection * * * carries with it the right to make such extracts from the book as will enable the shareholder to retain the information disclosed by the inspector.\u201d People ex rel. Lorge v. Consolidated Nat. Bank (decided by the Appellate Division of this Department in May, 1905) 94 N. Y. Supp. 173. Upon the facts proven and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>-admitted, the plaintiff was denied the inspection which was his right, and therefore the judgment for the penalty, imposed by statute therefor, rendered in his favor, must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
