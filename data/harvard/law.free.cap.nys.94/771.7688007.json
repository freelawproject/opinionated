The moving papers allege the effect of the provisions of the lease, but its provisions which it is alleged the tenant is violating should have been set forth. Moreover, the order is irregular, in that it does not contain a recital of the grounds upon which' it was granted, as required by the provisions of section 610 of the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-17\">It follows, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
