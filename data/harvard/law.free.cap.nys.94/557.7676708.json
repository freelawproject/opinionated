Special reference to the specific instances of error in the admission of evidence is hardly necessary, as counsel cannot fail to recognize many through a reference to a few. The following answers of George Hoppe: \u201cFor passengers per Patricia, February <em>21, </em>1903, we received no other baggage than that for which receipt was issued all according to the original baggage list in our possession.\u201d \u201cI attach, marked \u2018Exhibit A,\u2019 a true and complete list of all baggage checked for transportation by steamship Patricia, and received from passengers from the barracks and the city of Hamburg.\u201d \"From a passenger by the name of Joseph or Jassel Limansky we received in February, 1903, no baggage for transportation by the Patricia, or otherwise, to New York\u201d\u2014do not appear to have been other than statements of conclusions, and were therefore not competent.
