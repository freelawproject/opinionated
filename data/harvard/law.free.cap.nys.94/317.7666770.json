The plaintiffs sued for $5,003 upon a contract for pumping at $10 per diem. The number of days\u2019 work done was an issue, and finally was the sole issue submitted to the jury. One of the plaintiffs testified that they worked 500.3 days. At the close of his recross-examination he was permitted to read their timebook in evidence. Some time before, when cross-questioned as to whether he knew of any work done on a specified day, he answered: \u201cI have a timebook, which will give me the exact date and hours, and so forth, that I checked my bills from as I sent them in, week by week, to Mr. Carlin. I cannot tell now, sitting on the stand, whether J pumped on March 25th so many hours. It is all in my book. I don\u2019t carry those things for two or three years. I have too much to do.\u201d And later, during the colloquy incidental to the offer of the timebook, the court said: \u201cAs he said, as far as his verbal testimony is concerned, he could only answer from this book. He has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>told you that.\u201d Before the admission of the book the witness testified that their \u201ctimebooks\u201d were made up from time \u201cgiven in\u201d by timekeepers, and that the particular book thereafter admitted was made up by the timekeeper, under his supervision, from the bookkeeper\u2019s timebook, who \u201cgot his time from the men himself.\u201d He also testified that the men reported to himself from time to time, sometimes verbally, and sometimes he went \u201cto the job\u201d and asked \u201chow long they had been working\u2014keep track of them.\u201d Under such conditions the rule requires not only testimony from the maker of the entries that they conform to the reports made by the timekeepers or the workers, but also testimony from the timekeepers or the workers that their reports were true. When the maker of the entries can only testify that he acted upon information, and wrote in accord with it, it must be shown that the information conformed to the facts. In this case even the timebooks were not admissible without the testimony of the men who kept the time and reported it, or the men who did the work and reported their hours. Mayor v. Second Ave. R. Co., 102 N. Y. 572, 7 N. E. 905, 55 Am. Rep. 839. The learned counsel for the respondents contends that this book was admissible because the defendants examined the plaintiff \u201cdirectly from the book,\u201d and had \u201chim literally read its' contents into the record.\u201d The answer is that the defendants did not seek to establish their case by this writing, but to destroy or fi&gt; impair the writing as evidence for the plaintiffs, or to impair or limit testimony dependent on it. The witness testified as to the total of the days\u2019 work. It thereafter clearly appeared that he relied for the details and as to the specific days upon the timebooks or the timebook. After the history of the timebooks was elicited, the defendants thereupon moved that'\u201call evidence of performance of work which is based upon the entries\u201d therein be stricken out. Their motion was denied, and thereupon they began their recross-examination upon the specific entries. That I have correctly described the purpose of the defendants is indicated by the course of the examination, and made plain by the motion thereafter made \u201cthat the testimony of the witness be stricken out on every item excepting as to- these items which he says he knows of his own knowledge and belief, the entries being made from his own knowledge; that all other items excepting those be stricken out on the ground that it is hearsay.\u201d Inquiry as to the origin, competency, or evidential value of a writing more or less relied upon by an opponent, however minute, does not thereby make the contents evidence for the opponent.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">It is also contended that the timebook was admissible because the bookkeeper who. actually made the entries is dead. Referring to the bookkeeper, the plaintiff testifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201cQ. Where does he get his time? A. From the men himself, and every day I. look over it to see that it is correct. Q. Do the men report to you also? A. They report to me from time to time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Death accounts for the absence of the testimony of the bookkeeper, but not for the absence of the testimony of those who told him of the time kept by them, or as filled by them in work. The death of the bookkeeper does not dispense with the requirement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the testimony of those who reported the facts to him. In Cowen, Hill\u2019s &amp; Edwards\u2019 Notes to Phillipps on Evidence, star page 348, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-4\">\u201cBut however Lord Torrington\u2019s Case may have been considered by the English courts, it has generally been treated by our own according to its more obvious principle\u2014not only as letting in all books of account kept by a deceased clerk, but all other entries or memoranda made in the course of business or duty by any one who would at the time have been a competent witness to the fact which he registers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Burr Jones on Evidence, vol. 2, \u00a7 323, states the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201cIt has long been a settled rule of law both in England and in this country that a minute or memorandum in writing, made at the time when the fact it records took place by a person since deceased, in the ordinary course of his business, corroborated by other circumstances which render it probable that the fact occurred, is admissible in evidence.\u201d s</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The limitation is expressed in the leading case of Nicholls v. Webb, 8 Wheat. 326, 337, 5 L. Ed. 628, where the court, per Story, J., said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">\u201cWe think it a safe principle that memorandums made by a person, in the ordinary course of his business, of acts or matters which his duty in such business requires him to do for others, in case of his death, are admissible evidence of the acts and matters so done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">In other words, the production of the timebook, with the proof that the entries were made by the deceased bookkeeper, would have been sufficient to render the book competent, if coupled with the evidence of the timekeepers, or the workman, as heretofore indicated. The timebook was not admissible under the well-known doctrine of Vosburgh v. Thayer, 12 Johns. 461 (see Smith v. Smith, 163 N. Y. 168, 57 N. E. 300, 52 L. R. A. 545), because there was no proof of the prerequisites. The further contention as to admissibility is answered by the .authority of Mayor v. Second Avenue R. Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">I think that the ruling was reversible error. The timebook bore directly and cogently upon the sole issue submitted to the jury, and the learned court in its charge commented on this book, described its preparation, told the jury it was in evidence, and then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">\u201cIt Is for you to say how far that substantiates his statement\u2014whether it satisfies you as to the correctness of his story or not. I leave it to you to say whether the book is correct\u2014his statement of the time is correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">The judgment must be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
