The complaint proceeds upon the theory that the title was defective and does not pray for specific performance. The plaintiffs allege that fhey have no .adequate remedy at law, and pray judgment that they be decreed to have a vendee\u2019s lien upon the premises, and for a sale thereof to satisfy the lien. There is no allegation that the vendees were let into possession of the premises. The order canceling notice of pendency was granted upon the authority of Klim v. Sachs, 102 App. Div. 44, 92 N. Y. Supp. 107, wherein it was held that the vendee, not having taken possession, did not acquire a lien upon the premises for the amount of the down payment. If there be any doubt as to the right to file the notice, the merits should not be decided on a motion to cancel it. It cannot be said that the action is not brought to recover a judgment affecting the title, possession, use, or enjoyment of the premises against which the notice of pendency is filed, nor is it clear that the plaintiffs may not be able upon the trial to establish a lien as vendees. See Pomeroy on Eq. Jur. vol. 3, \u00a7 1263; also Chase v. Peck, 21 N. Y. 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">It follows, therefore, that the order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs.. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
