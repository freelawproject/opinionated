Cohen, 91 N. Y. Supp. 357. In that case neither party appeared, and the cause fell of its own weight. Here there was an appearance on behalf of both parties, and a^ dismissal because plaintiff was not prepared to go on. There is no reason why, in such a case, a plaintiff may not move in the Municipal Court, as he may in any other, to be relieved of his default.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-3\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
