McIntosh. $20 to be applied on rent of apartment * * * rent to be $1,300 for term ending September 30, 1904, tenant to have possession whenever he wishes.

Consequently he was without authority to bind the defendant by the signing of the instrument of August 15th. It does not appear that the defendant ever ratified his act, with knowledge of what he had done. The subsequent interview between the plaintiff and defendant resulted in a disagreement. I am thus led to the conclusion that there was no lease or agreement for leasing between the parties. There having been no agreement, there is nothing to justify the defendant in retaining the $20. Judgment, therefore, for the plaintiff for that amount.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1116-7\">Argued before FREEDMAN, P.
