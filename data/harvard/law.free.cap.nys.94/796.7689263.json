The plaintiff is a subcontractor, and sued to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien upon property of which the defendant Hollender was the owner, and as to which property Philip Goerlitz was the-contractor to do-certain work. At the trial of the cause a notice of lien was offered in evidence by the plaintiff, and marked as an exhibit, but it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>printed in the record as an exhibit. There was, however, annexed to the complaint, a copy <em>o\u00ed </em>the notice of lien which the plaintiff claimed was filed, and it was made a part of his complaint. In that notice it is stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-5\">\u201cThe labor performed and to be performed, and the materials furnished and to be furnished, consists of electrical apparatus, wiring and equipment and labor of Nos. 149 West 125th Street and 152 to 158 West 126th Street, Borough of Manhattan, New York City, and the agreed price and value thereof is Four thousand five hundred and ninety-four B\u00ab/ioo ($4,594.50).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case, the defendants\u2019 counsel moved To dismiss the complaint as to the defendant Hollender on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to prove his cause of action. Included in that cause of action to foreclose the lien was the element or factor of a proper and sufficient notice of lien having been \u25a0filed. That the notice was insufficient has been held by this court .and by the Court of Appeals.. N. J. S. &amp; I. Co. v. Robinson, 85 App. Div. 512, 83 N. Y. Supp. 450; Bossert v. Fox, 89 App. Div. 7, 85 N. Y. Supp. 308; Bradley &amp; Currier Co. v. Pacheteau, 175 N. Y. 492, 67 N. E. 1080.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">It is claimed by the respondent that, notwithstanding the insufficiency of the notice of lien, he was entitled to maintain the action against Hollender, the owner of the premises, and to recover, under section 3412 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a judgment for such sum as was due him, or which he might recover in an action on contract against any party to the action. But under the proof, as we read the record, the plaintiff has not brought himself within the provision of that section of the Code, for the reason that he failed to establish that there was anything due at any time, before \u25a0or after the notice of lien was filed, from the owner, Hollender, to the contractor, Goerlitz.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">The judgment must b\u201ee reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
