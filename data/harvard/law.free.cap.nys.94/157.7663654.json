Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 636. An affidavit of one of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys alleged upon information and belief that the defendant obtained by a forged draft the sum of $800 from the plaintiff in the city of Mexico; that the source of deponent\u2019s information was telegraphic communications from his partner, then in the city of Mexico, and from conversations with a representative of Pinkerton\u2019s Detective Agency. The communications from the deponent\u2019s partner in Mexico are not made a part of the affidavit, nor is it stated what the communications were. This affidavit, standing alone, was insufficient, but there was also presented an affidavit of an employe of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys, in which he swears that he was present when the defendant was arraigned before a police magistrate, and heard the defendant state to the magistrate, that he desired to plead guilty before a United States commissioner to the charge made by the plaintiff of having forged and cashed at its bank a draft for $800 purporting to be drawn by the cashier of the First National Bank of Chicago, payable to the defendant at the Hanover National Bank of New York, and that the draft the forgery of which defendant pleaded guilty to is the same draft upon which this action is based. This allegation corroborated the information received from one of the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys in Mexico, and the two affidavits together are sufficient to show that a cause of action in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">The motion to vacate the attachment was therefore properly denied, and the order appealed from is affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
