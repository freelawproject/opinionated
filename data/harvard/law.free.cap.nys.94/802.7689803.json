White, under which contract, plaintiffs were to do architectural ironwork. The following facts are undisputed: On May 8, 1899, plaintiffs and the said Henrietta K. White entered into a certain contract whereby the plaintiffs were to perform work and furnish materials for the architectural ironwork in the premises situate at the corner of Eightieth street and Columbus avenue for the sum of $5,281, payable at the times and in the manner following:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b823-5\">First payment when all the main stairway is finished complete, ex-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b823-6\">cept railings for the same....................................$1,500</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b823-7\">Second, when all elevator fronts are set and finished complete with</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b823-8\">fascias and saddles..........................................\u2022' 1,500</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b823-9\">Third, when all vaults, lights, and ironwork for store fronts, steps,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b823-10\">etc., for same are complete.................\u2019.................. 450</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b823-11\">Fourth, stairs for stores, area stairs, and ladder................. 300</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b823-12\">Fifth, area rail and servants\u2019 gate.............................. 275</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b823-13\">Sixth, fireplace bars, coal cover, shed doors, trapdoors, and saddles ........................................................ 275</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b823-14\">Seventh, sixty days after completion............................ 981</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b823-15\">Total ....................................................1. $5,281</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b823-16\">At about the same time an agreement was made between the plaintiffs and the defendant, under which plaintiffs have sought to hold the defendant liable.

The plaintiffs, who were aware of these arrangements, insisted, as a conditions of their entering into the contract with Mrs. White, that the defendant should execute his contract of guaranty mentioned for the purpose of protecting plaintiffs to the extent of $3,000. The plaintiffs, according to their testimony, finished the work which entitled them to the first two payments of $1,500 each. The defendant paid on account of his contract of guaranty $2,830 by six different checks, each made payable to Thomas R. White, who was the agent and husband of Henrietta K. White. White indorsed these checks to the plaintiffs, and plaintiffs drew the money upon each one. One of the checks was for $1,500, and it is admitted that it was delivered and received on account of the first payment. It is also admitted that another check for $500 was delivered and received on account of the second payment. Therefore the plaintiffs claim there is still due $1,000 to them, as the remaining checks, as they claim, were paid for extra work. It was proven upon the trial that the plaintiffs received $410.34 out of a certain mortgage, and the court held as a matter of law that, inasmuch as the other checks, amounting to $830, had been drawn by the defendant with the direction to Mr. White to deliver them to the plaintiffs as a payment upon the second payment due them, the defense of payment had been fully proven; and he therefore granted the motion to dismiss the complaint.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b823-22\">Argued before O\u2019BRIEN, P.

They had exacted from the defendant the guaranty of particular sums as the work progressed. When, therefore, moneys from the defendant were received, they were bound to apply such payments upon the contract which had been guarantied by the defendant. In each case the payment was made by the check of the defendant payable to White, and the plaintiffs, understanding the relation which existed between these parties, were bound also to take notice of the fact that it was a payment made \u2018by the defendant upon his contract of guaranty. It is doubtless true that the plaintiffs would have had the right to apply the money upon any indebtedness, as between them and Mrs. or Mr. White, in the absence of any knowledge or notice by them that the money was to be otherwise applied, even though it was received from a guarantor. Such was the rule announced in Harding v. Tifft, 75 N. Y. 461. That case, however, clearly recognizes that, where the person receiving the money has knowledge of the source from which it comes, and that it is a payment upon a particular contract, the party receiving has no discretion in making application of the same, but is bound to appropriate it to the purpose for which it was paid. Under such circumstances, the principle is not different from, that which obtains in the case of involuntary payments, as to which it is held that they must be applied in accordance with equitable principles. Orleans County Nat. Bank v. Moore, 112 N. Y. 543, 20 N. E. 357, 3 L. R. A. 302, 8 Am. St. Rep. 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">It is claimed, however, that the testimony in this case operates to remove it from the application of such rule. It was testified to by Scherbner, one of the plaintiffs, that after the execution of the guaranty by the defendant the latter stated to him that he was not feeling very well, and that the plaintiffs should have all their dealings with Mr. White; that what he would do would be satisfactory to the defendant, and not to bother him about it; and that Mr. White told him at the time of making the payment to apply it upon the extra work. Assuming, as we must, that this statement is true, I do not think it changes the result. It certainly did not operate to modify the contract of guaranty, nor was it so intended. It did not confer authority upon the plaintiffs to appropriate the moneys of the defendant to other purposes than that covered by the contract of guaranty. The plaintiffs had actual knowledge that the moneys paid by White, although in the form of a check, were the moneys contributed by the defendant in discharge of the obligation which the plaintiffs had exacted before entering upon the performance of the contract. All payments that had been made by defendant were made by check in this form. Consequently the plaintiffs were at all times advised as to the source of the moneys. The theory upon which a party receiving payment may make application of the same \u00e1s he determines, in the absence of a direction, rests upon the-basis that the debtor making the payment is the owner of the money. Such is the doctrine announced in the cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>above referred to. The basis of the rule in the present instance fails, for White concededly was not the owner of the money at the time when he made the payment, or at any other time. He was the mere agent of the defendant in making such payment, and such fact was known to the plaintiffs. The right of application at the will of the plaintiffs, therefore, failed in the only aspect which would invest them with such power. As there was no modification of the contract of guaranty, and as the moneys represented by the check belonged to the defendant, and as no authority was vested in the agent, White, to change the terms of the guaranty, it necessarily follows that the application of payment was required to be made upon equitable principles; and, so applying them, it discharged the debt of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The exceptions, therefore, should be overruled, and judgment directed for the defendant, dismissing the complaint, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">O\u2019BRIEN, P.
