Therefore the judgment for the defendant can be accounted for only upon the theory that the justice deemed that the judgment for defendant in the former action was a bar to this. The nature of that action and the issues triable therein are determined by the pleadings, which were written. Upon a reference to the complaint, it will be' seen that the action was solely upon an account stated. In such an action the plaintiff must stand or fall upon his allegation that an account was stated and agreed upon. Failing that, judgment must go against him, for he may not recover by proving the items of the account. Johnston v. Tyng, 1 App. Div. 610, 37 N. Y. Supp. 516. It was in consequence of this rule that it was held in Derleth v. De Graef, 51 N. Y. Super Ct. 369, that a judgment for defendant upon a cause of action founded upon an account stated is not a bar to an action for goods sold and de-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>livered, although such sale and delivery was the subject in reference to which it was claimed that there had been an account stated. This is the law applicable to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
