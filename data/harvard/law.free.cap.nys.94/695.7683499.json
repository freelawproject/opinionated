The defendant, on the day it bears date, executed and delivered to the plaintiff an option agreement reading as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b716-9\">\u201cNorwich, N. Y\u201e May 4, 1904.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b716-10\">\u201cIn consideration of $1.00 to me paid, I hereby agree to sell my house and lot on South Broad Street to S. A. Jones, for the sum of $3,000.00, this option</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A5FS\">to hold good until May 12, 1904.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOe\">Buell Barnes.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b716-11\">The defendant at that time was the owner of the premises mentioned in said agreement, subject to the inchoate right of dower of his wife therein. On May 11, 1904, the plaintiff tendered the sum of $3,000 to the defendant for a deed of such premises. The defendant refused to accept such tender and give such deed, and his wife refused to join in the execution of a deed thereof to the plaintiff. Upon such refusal, the plaintiff told the defendant he would deposit the money in the Chenango National Bank, and he could get it there by leaving the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b716-12\">The only disputed question of fact on the trial was as to the payment of the $1 mentioned in the option agreement. The plaintiff swore that he paid the dollar to the defendant, and the defendant denied it. The court found that the $1 was paid at the time of the delivery of the instrument. Upon the trial the plaintiff stipulated that be was willing to accept a deed of the premises in question executed by the defendant alone, subject to the inchoate right of dower of the defendant\u2019s wife, and to pay to the defendant $3,000 therefor. The court rendered a decision in favor of the plaintiff, and judgment decreeing specific, performance thereon was duly entered, from which judgment defendant appeals.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b716-13\">Argued before PARKER, P. J., and SMITH, CHASE, CHESTER, and HO\u00dcGHTON, JJ. . ' \u2022</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b716-14\">Hubert L. Brown, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b716-15\">Nelson P. Bonney, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b716-16\">CHESTER, J;</author>\n<p id=\"A50\">The finding that the consideration of $1 mentioned in the agreement was paid to the defendant by the plaintiff on the 4th day of May, 1904, is sustained by the evidence,, and by the preponderance thereof. The defendant, it is true, denied it, but the plaintiff testified to it; so, as between them, with nothing to discredit the statement of either, there was no preponderance of evidence one way or the other. But the plaintiff had, in addition to his testimony, the following recital in the agreement itself, signed by the defendant: \u201cIn consideration of $1.00 to me paid.\u201d This recital is an acknowledgment by the defendant that the amount was paid to him, and was sufficient, together with the plaintiff\u2019s testimony that he had in fact paid it, to make a preponderance of evidence in his favor and to support the finding of the cburt, notwithstanding, the denial of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-17\">The appellant insists that the trial court erred in finding that this contract is enforceable in equity, because, as he claims, it is without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>mutuality. It is undoubtedly the rule that, in order to justify a court of equity in decreeing specific performance, there must be a contract which in general is mutual in its \u2022 obligations and in its remedy. Mahaney v. Carr, 175 N. Y. 454-461, 67 N. E. 903; Stokes v. Stokes, 148 N. Y. 708-716, 43 N. E. 211. I do not think it is necessary to determine what the rule of law would be as applied' to the option agreement alone, for here the option had, within the time fixed therein, been accepted by the plaintiff. Even if there was no mutuality in the obligations of the agreement before acceptance by the plaintiff, yet, the moment he accepted the option given him the element of mutuality arose, and the defendant was bound to sell and the plaintiff was bound to buy. Johnston v. Trippe (C. C.) 33 Fed. 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">It is said in 21 Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. of Law, 929 (2d Ed.) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-6\">\u201cWhatever diversity of opinion may have existed as to the mutuality of obligation prior to the acceptance of the option, * * * the courts are unanimous in declaring that, after such acceptance of the terms by the holder of the option, the parties are mutually bound, and either one may compel specific performance by the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">In Wilcox v. Cline, 70 Mich. 517, 38 N. W. 555, it was held that the acceptance of a written offer to sell real estate within a limited time makes a complete and mutual contract, capable of enforcement in equity. In that case the acceptance, as well as the offer, was in writing. In the case at bar the acceptance was made by a tender of the amount named in the option as the purchase price of the premises, and bj- keeping that tender good, but, under the authorities, the fact that the acceptance was not in writing does not alter the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">In Pettibone v. Moore, 75 Hun, 461, 27 N. Y. Supp. 455, Merwin, J., says;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">\u201cA binding contract, enforceable in equity, may be constituted by the proposal of one party and the acceptance of the other. Fry on Specific Performance, \u00a7 166. If the proposal is in writing by the party to be charged, and contains all the terms of the proposed contract, so that a simple assent is only required of the other party, that assent or acceptance may be verbal, and the contract, as against the party signing, be good within the statute of frauds. Fry on Spec. Perf. \u00a7 181; 1 Chitty on Cont. 96; Pomeroy on Spec. Perf. \u00a7\u00a7 76, 93; Waterman on Spec. Perf. \u00a7 137.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-10\">The following cases are to the same effect: Worrall v. Munn, 5 N. Y. 229, 55 Am. Dec. 330; Clason v. Bailey, 14 Johns. 484; Old Colony Railroad Corporation v. Evans, 6 Gray, 25, 66 Am. Dec. 394; O\u2019Brien v. Boland, 166 Mass. 481, 44 N. E. 602; Houghwout v. Boisaubin, 18 N. J. Eq. 315; Guyer v. Warren, 175 Ill. 328, 51 N. E. 580; Cheney v. Cook, 7 Wis. 413; Rogers v. Saunders, 16 Me. 92, 33 Am. Dec. 635; Appeal of Smith, 69 Pa. 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-11\">The case then presents a situation where there is mutuality in the obligations of the parties, and it appears to be one which is properly excepted from the general rule as to mutuality of remedy. Pomeroy on Specific Performance (2d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 168, 169, and 170, and notes. The plaintiff, by his tender and by the commencement of this action, has estopped himself from claiming that he is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>bound by the agreement, and nothing appears on this branch of the case to stand in the way of his asking the court to decree specific performance against the defendant. Ross v. Parks (Ala.) 8 South. 368, 11 L. R. A. 148, 30 Am. St. Rep. 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">The plaintiff having consented to take subject to the inchoate right of dower of the defendant\u2019s wife, her refusal to join in the deed should not prevent such a decree. Dixon v. Rice, 16 Hun, 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The facts that the defendant is responsible and that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law for damages do not, under the authorities, preclude the latter from suing for a specific performance. This principle was stated by Chancellor Walworth in the early cases of Brown v. Hoff, 5 Paige, 234\u2014240, 28 Am. Dec. 425, and Phyfe v. Wardell, 5 Paige, 268-282, 28 Am. Dec. 430, and has been followed in many cases since. Crary v. Smith, 2 N. Y. 60; Stone v. Lord, 80 N. Y. 60; Baumann v. Pinckney, 118 N. Y. 604, 23 N. E. 916; Schroeppel v. Hopper, 40 Barb. 425; Losee v. Morey, 57 Barb. 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The defendant does not live upon the premises, but leases them, and the plaintiff\u2019s intention in purchasing the place was to occupy it as a home. These are facts which the court had a right to consider in determining whether it would exercise its discretion to compel specific performance. The right to the specific performance of a contract rests in judicial discretion, and may be granted or withheld upon a consideration of all the circumstances and in the exercise of a sound discretion (McPherson v. Schade, 149 N. Y. 16, 43 N. E. 527; Winne v. Winne, 166 N. Y. 263, 59 N. E. 832, 82 Am. St. Rep. 647), and we think the discretion was rightly exercised in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
