Healy, upon the express agreement that it should be held for her benefit and for the benefit of the plaintiff during their joint lives, and in the event that the daughter predeceased the plaintiff that the plaintiff should become the sole owner of the property; that in the year 1894 the said Eliza J. Healy contracted with the plaintiff, concerning said property, that if the plaintiff should continue to live with and care for her, and manage the property and interests of said Eliza J. Healy as long as she should live, the said Eliza J. Healy would give and leave the said real property to the plaintiff; that the plaintiff fully performed said several agreements on her part, and the said Eliza J. Healy died without conveying or leaving said real property to the plaintiff. The action is brought against the heirs' and administrator of said Eliza J. Healy for specific performance of the agreement; and for a decree directing her administrator to pay over the proceeds of the sale of one parcel of the property sold and conveyed by said decedent in her lifetime; and a receiver of the rents and an injunction pendente lite are demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-11\">Paragraph 6 of the complaint, which has been stricken out, alleges that the services rendered by the plaintiff to the decedent were of a peculiar nature, and of' such a character that they cannot be readily measured, and are not capable of exact ascertainment or value in money, but were of great value and benefit to the decedent, and were so appreciated and regarded by her. The allegations of paragraph 7 of the complaint, stricken out, are to the effect that the decedent left no relatives who had resided with her, or who were, dependent upon her, or to whom she owed any legal or moral duty to care or provide for, or who were in any manner entitled to r&gt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>claim upon her bounty, or lived on terms of intimacy or cordiality with her or with her father. The allegations of paragraph 10, stricken out, are to the effect that part of the proceeds of the sale of one of the parcels was by the mutual consent of both the decedent and plaintiff and by them both deposited in a vault of the Knickerbocker Trust Company, to which the decedent and the plaintiff each received and retained a key, and part were by them deposited in the Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank, and part was used and expended in the payment of certain charges against the properties in question and incidental expenses connected therewith, and part was expended by like consent as a gift for a church altar. It is to be borne in mind that this is a suit in equity, and one of the class where clear and satisfactory evidence is required to warrant a- decree for specific performance. It has often been held that in a suit in equity the pleader is not confined with the same degree of strictness to alleging the material facts only as in an action at law. First Presbyterian Church v. Kennedy, 72 App. Div. 82, 76 N. Y. Supp. 284. In the main the allegations stricken out are allegations of inducement, and are permissible in a complaint in equity. The defendants are not aggrieved by the allegations, and, on the contrary, it would seem that by disclosing the plaintiff\u2019s theory of the basis for the contract the defense would be benefited by being the better enabled to prepare to meet the plaintiff\u2019s proof. The suit being in equity, and it not appearing that the moving party was prejudiced by these allegations, they should not have been stricken out. Bogardus v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 62 App. Div. 376, 70 N. Y. Supp. 1094; Rockwell v. Day, 84 App. Div. 437, 82 N. Y. Supp. 993; Uggla v. Brokaw, 77 App. Div. 310, 79 N. Y. Supp. 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">It follows, therefore, that the order, in so far as it is appealed from, should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
