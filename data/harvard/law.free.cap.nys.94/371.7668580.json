The piano was taken in replevin by the vendor\u2019s assignee May 5, 1904. Judgment therein was deferred until after the beginning of the present action in the spring of <em>1905\u2014a </em>circumstance deemed immaterial here. Such an action given by statute, in effect as for money had and received, does not seem one which arises on a written contract of conditional sale of personal property, and therefore not maintainable in the Municipal Court. Section 139, c. 580, p. .1533, Laws 1902. But the plaintiff seems to have signed away, the right to this statutory and beneficial action by agreeing in writing \u201cthat if default be made in the promised payments or any of them, the Needham Piano and Organ Company may resume actual possession of said piano, and all payments thereon shall be in full for the use thereof.\u201d He was as competent to waive eventual resort to the provision made by statute for his benefit as he was to enter into the agreement at its inception.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
