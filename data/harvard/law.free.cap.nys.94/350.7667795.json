J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvW\">This was an action for personal injuries occasioned by the alleged negligence of the defendant. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the trial judge refused to submit the case to the jury, dismissed the complaint, and rendered judgment in favor of the defendant. The plaintiff boarded defendant\u2019s car at 129th street and 3d avenue, his destination being 148th street. After the car had left 147th street the plaintiff signaled the conductor, and the conductor pulled the bell rope, evidently signaling the motorman to stop at 148th street. At a point about 30 feet south of the corner of 148th street the plaintiff arose from his seat, grasped the stanchion on the side of the car, and placed his left foot on the running board. In the meantime the car had materially slacked its speed, and was moving very slow\u2014as the plaintiff says, \u201cwas barely moving.\u201d With the plaintiff in this position, the car suddenly shot forward with .a jerk, and the plaintiff was thrown violently to the street, receiving the injuries complained of. It is clear from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>testimony that the plaintiff intended to alight, not at the\u2019north side of 148th street, the regular stopping place of the car, but at a point south of 148th street, and before the car had reached an actual stop. Whether or not, under .these circumstances, the defendant was guilty of negligence in suddenly starting its car after having slowed down so as to be \u201cbarely moving\u201d at the point designated, apparently in response to the signal, and whether or not the plaintiff was guilty of negligence in preparing to alight at that point were questions of fact that should have been submitted to the jury, and the dismissal of the complaint was error. Crow v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 70 App. Div. 202, 75 N. Y. Supp. 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
