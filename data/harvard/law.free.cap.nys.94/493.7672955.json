The plaintiff further alleges that the defendant so negligently turned on the electric power while the press, dynamo, and motor were in his hands, and at the time when none of the plaintiff\u2019s employ\u00e9s were present, and so negligently conducted the work of installation, that it was damaged. The trial justice found the facts to be as alleged by the plaintiff, and accordingly rendered judgment in its favor, and was justified in so doing, for the electrician employed by the defendant, and called as witness by the plaintiff, testified that: '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-4\">\u201cThe plaintiff had supplied a new motor, and I had to wire it. * * * I connected the new motor to the press by a belt\u2014the same belt that was there .before. I started the press. * * * I then started it at the first speed: that is, the slowest. After I started it at slow speed, I looked over everything to see if it was running, while it was running. * * * When I saw everything running all right, I speeded it up to the next speed. Then L gradually increased the speed notch by notch, to see. That is what I did. I increased the speed until something broke in the press. * * * It was running at full speed. After the break occurred I left the building. I looked at the press and saw it was damaged. * * * I am not a professional pressman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">That he testified for the defendant that his attention was not called to the fact that the pulley on the new motor was a different sized pulley from that on the old motor would seem of no importance, notwithstanding another of defendant\u2019s witnesses testified, when asked if he could tell with reasonable certainty what might have caused this break, \u201cThe only thing that I can see or know of would be the increased size of the pulley, which increased the run of the press,\u201d for, when the defendant had installed the new motor, and made the connections so that it would actuate the press, and his electrician had started it up, and \u201csaw everything running all right,\u201d he had certainly done all that he agreed to do, and, not having furnished the new motor, was not called upon to test it, unless requested so to do\u2014particularly by one a self-confessed nonprofessional pressman.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">DUGRO, J., concurs. '</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b514-8\">SCOTT, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALz\">(dissenting). I am unable to find in the case any evidence that the damage to the press was caused by an act of negligence on the part of defendant\u2019s employ\u00e9. It seems to have been assumed by the learned court that the act of running the 'motor at full speed was the sole cause of the-wrecking of the press. All that is shown by the evidence was that the break was coincident with the increase of- speed,' and there is nothing to exclude the possibility that there was some defect in the press itself which led to the injury. The plaintiff\u2019s contention appears- to be that the mere fact of running the motor at speed was negligent. Of this there is no proof. The plaintiffs themselves furnished both the press, and the\u2019motdr;- 'All th\u00e9'defendant was employed to do Was to m\u00e1ke the connection. ' It was proper that defendant should test the connection in .order- to se\u00e9 .that it Worked properly. If the motor was' too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>strong for the press, or if there was danger in running it at speed, the plaintiffs should either have warned defendant\u2019s servant of-the danger, or should have left an expert pressman to superintend and oversee the testing of the connection. It did neither. It had no right to assume that defendant\u2019s employe would know that it was safe to run the motor at half or three:quarter speed, and dangerous to run it at full speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\">Judgment should be reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
