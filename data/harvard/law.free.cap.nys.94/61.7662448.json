She continued to teach under a temporary license issued by the city superintendent for the period of one year, at the expiration of which time it was successively renewed twice, the last renewal expiring June 30, 1902. She continued to teach, however, under a special license, up to January, 1903, when she was notified by the city superintendent that, owing to an unsatisfactory report upon her work, her license would not be renewed further. She now claims that bath because she was a teacher in the territory included in the greater city at the time of the consolidation, and because of the further fact that she has taught three years continuously under a temporary license twice renewed, she is entitled to a permanent license, and that, having retained her as a teacher under the special permit after the expiration of the three years of service, the city superintendent cannot now be heard to say that her work was not successful, but that the provision of section 1089 of the Revised Amended Charter (chapter 718, p. 1774, Laws 1901): \u201cAt the close of the third year of continuous, successful service, the city superintendent may make the license permanent,\u2019\u2019 is mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">The mere fact that the relator was a teacher at the time of the consolidation, and held a school commissioner\u2019s certificate, did not entitle her to become a member of the permanent teaching force of the greater city. The issuance to her of a first-grade school commissioner\u2019s certificate thereafter did not affect her status as a member of the teaching force of said city. To succeed, therefore, she must establish the proposition that the word \u201cmay,\u201d in the portion of the section quoted, means \u201cmust.\u201d After a teacher has become a member of the permanent force, she is protected by statute from removal except upon charges preferred and an opportunity to be heard, and it cannot be that it was ever designed by the statute to take away from the licensing power all discretion in the first instance. The fact that the teacher\u2019s tenure in office is so carefully guarded necessitates the greater care on the part of the superintendent in making temporary licenses permanent, and requires that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>his. discretion should not be interfered with. No reason is suggested why the permissive language of the statute should be construed as mandatory. It is unnecessary to consider the cases relied upon by the relator, because in each the teacher held a permanent certificate or its equivalent. The fact that the probationary term of three years was extended by the superintendent by special license cannot avail the relator, because the additional opportunity afforded her to demonstrate her fitness to receive a permanent license cannot be construed as a determination by the superintendent that she was entitled to one.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
