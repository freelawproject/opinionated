The complaint alleges that the injuries that the deceased received, and which caused his death, were caused through the negligence of the defendant, in its failure to supply the deceased with a suitable and proper place within which to do his work, and that the place where deceased was directed and obliged to do his work was dangerous, unprotected, unsafe, and unguarded, and, through its failure to supply said deceased with competent and suitable foremen to guide, guard, and direct deceased in his said work, by reason of which he was struck by an electric wire or current. These allegations are mere conclusions, and are most indefinite. It is manifestly impossible for the defendant to properly prepare for trial without some intimation as to the particular place at which the deceased was at work, and in what respect that place was dangerous, unprotected, unsafe, and unguarded, and also the name of the foreman alleged to be incompetent, or whether the neglect complained of was a failure to employ a foreman. To that extent the motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">It follows that the order appealed from should be reversed, and the motion granted, to the extent indicated, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
