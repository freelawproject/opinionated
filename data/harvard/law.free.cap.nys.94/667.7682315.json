Blood received a pension granted to him by the United States for military services. In 1888 he purchased a house and lot in Amsterdam, and paid therefor the sum of $1,200. It is claimed that the payment was made from the money received by him from said pension. On the 1st day of March, 1889, he died intestate, the owner in fee of said real property, leaving a widow and eight children, six of whom were minors. The property was then incumbered by a mortgage of $700. An administrator of his goods, chattels, and credits was thereafter appointed, but no personal property was found. On the petition of such administrator said property was sold for the payment of debts. The sale was at public auction, and the property was purchased by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>the defendant John M. Marshall for $1,075, from which was deducted the amount of said mortgage, and he paid the difference in cash. Said John M. Marshall did not have notice or knowledge that said property had been purchased with pension money, or that it was claimed that there were any errors, defects, or omissions in the proceedings to sell said property. Said widow and children remained in possession of said property until the 1st day of November, 1890, when said Marshall stated to them that he had purchased the house, and that they must pay rent or move out; and they moved out, and said Marshall went into possession of the property, and remained in possession thereof until February 22, 1897. He then sold said property to the defendant William H. Marshall, who purchased the same without notice or knowledge that it had been purchased by said Blood with pension money, and without notice or knowledge that it was claimed that there were any errors, defects, or omissions' in the proceedings for the sale thereof. He went into possession of said property, and remains in possession thereof. The plaintiff, who was one of the children of said William H. Blood, was at the time of his death about 13 years of age. In August, 1904\u2014more than 15 years after her father\u2019s death, and nearly 14 years after the sale of said property at auction under said proceeding\u2014she commenced this action to partition said property, making her mother and her brothers and sisters, and also the administrator of her father\u2019s estate, and the said Marshalls, and a subsequent bona fide mortgagee under the defendant John M. Marshall, parties defendant, asking that they be barred from all interest in said property, and for a division of the proceeds of the sale of said property among the widow and heirs at law of her father. It is conceded that the proceedings for the sale of said property were regular, and in every respect in accordance with the statutes in relation thereto, if the court obtained jurisdiction of the subject-matter and of the persons of said widow and heirs at law.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b688-5\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Blood, the defendant James E. Marshall, being a creditor of the deceased, presented to the Surrogate\u2019s Court a petition in the form prescribed by statute, asking that letters of administration be granted to him, and that a citation issue to all persons having a right to administration prior or equal to that of the petitioner. A citation was-issued accordingly, and duly served upon the widow and children of said deceased. On the return day of said citation there was filed in the Surrogate\u2019s Court, by a competent and responsible person, a written consent to appear as special guardian of said infants, and a decree was entered reciting the filing of the petition, the issuing of the citation, and that \u201con reading and filing proof of service thereof, A. B. Flansburgh appearing for the petitioner, J. W. Eighmy appearing for Sarah C. Blood, Ed. J. Perkins appearing as special guardian for Sarah, Annie, Harry, Nellie, and William, infants, and on reading and filing the bond executed by said petitioner,\u201d etc. The decree ordered that letters of administration be granted to said James E. Marshall, and letters were on that day issued accordingly. It does not appear upon whose application the special guardian was appointed, or that a formal order of appointment was filed in the Surrogate\u2019s Court. No personal property being found, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>administrator thereafter filed in the Surrogate\u2019s Court a petition praying for a decree directing the disposition by sale, mortgage, or lease of the real property of the decedent, or so much thereof as is necessary for the payment of his debts. Such petition contained all the facts required to be stated therein by section 2752 of the Code' \u2022of Civil Procedure. A citation was thereupon issued, which was directed to and duly served upon the widow and heirs at law of the intestate. None of the heirs at law who were under 21 years of age had a general guardian, and on the return day of said citation there was filed in the Surrogate\u2019s Court, by a competent and responsible person, a written consent to appear as special guardian for said infants. In the decree entered thereafter it was recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">\u201cSaid citation having been returned \u25a0* * * with proof of due service thereof on each of the persons therein named, and said surrogate having, by \u25a0order duly made and entered herein on the 2d day of August, 1890, appointed H. V. Borst, a counselor at law, special guardian for the minors, Nellie Blood, Sarah Blood, Harry Blood, Annie Blood, William Blood, Leonia Blood, for the protection of their interests herein, and the said James E. Marshall having appeared in person and by A. B. Elansburgh, his attorney and counsel, and Sarah O. Blood, widow of said decedent, having also appeared by <em>J. </em>W. Eighmy, her attorney and counsel, and the said guardian having appeared in person, and the proper proceedings in due form of law having been thereupon had, and no one appearing in opposition thereto and the surrogate having upon the return of the citation as aforesaid proceeded to hear the allegations and proof of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">And said decree further recited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">\u201cIt having been established to the satisfaction of said surrogate, first, that said petitioner has fully complied with all the requisite provisions of the statute concerning the disposition of decedent\u2019s real property for the payment of debts or funeral expenses, and that the proceedings herein have been in con-, formity to title 5 of chapter 18 of the Code of Civil Procedure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">It was decreed that said real property be sold for the payment of \u25a0debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">It does not appear upon whose application the special guardian was appointed, and, although it is recited that an order was made and filed, no such order appears in the record. It is shown that all the parties interested in said real property were duly cited by the \u25a0affidavits of service, and presumptively by the recital in the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">It is provided by section 2473 of the Code of Civil Procedure as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-11\">\u201cWhere the jurisdiction of a Surrogate\u2019s Court to make, in a case specified in the last section, a decree or other determination, is drawn in question collaterally and the necessary parties were duly cited or appeared, the jurisdiction is presumptively, and, in the absence of fraud or collusion, conclusively established, by an allegation of the jurisdictional facts, contained in a written petition or answer duly verified, used in the Surrogate\u2019s Court. The fact that the parties were duly cited is presumptively proved by a recital to that effect in the decree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">It is also provided by section 2474 of the Code of Civil Procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-13\">\u201cThe Surrogate\u2019s Court obtains jurisdiction in every case, by the existence \u25a0of the jurisdictional facts prescribed by statute, and by the citation or appearance of the necessary parties. An objection to a decree or other determination, founded upon an omission therein, or in the papers upon which it \u25a0was founded, of the recital or proof of any fact necessary to jurisdiction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>which actually existed, or the failure to take any intermediate proceeding, required by law to be taken, is available only upon appeal. But, for the better protection of any party, or other person interested, the Surrogate\u2019s Court may, in its discretion allow such a defect to be supplied by amendment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">It is also provided by section 2763 of the Code of Civil Procedure as amended by chapter 750, p. 1911, of the Laws of 1904, as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-6\">\u201cThe title of a purchaser in good faith at a sale pursuant to a decree made as prescribed in this title is not, nor is the validity of a mortgage or lease made as prescribed in this title, in any way affected where a petition was presented and the proper persons were duly cited and a decree authorizing a mortgage, lease or sale was made as prescribed in this title, by any omission, error, defect, or irregularity occurring between the return of the citation and the making of the decree, except so far as the same would affect the title of a purchaser at a sale made pursuant to the directions contained in a judgment rendered by the Supreme Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">See section 2784 of the Code of Civil Procedure prior to its repeal by said chapter 750, p. 1907, of the Laws of 1904.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">There is sufficient evidence before us to show that the Surrogate\u2019s Court had jurisdiction of the persons of the widow and heirs at law of the intestate for the purpose of appointing an administrator, and also for the purpose of making the decree directing the sale of said real property and to confirm the sale. No fraud or collusion has been shown in either proceeding, and the same cannot be attacked collaterally. Mott v. Fort Edward Water Works Co., 79 App. Div. 179, 79 N. Y. Supp. 1100; Van Gaasbeek v.

An omission to appoint a guardian ad litem in an action or proceeding where process has been duly served does not make a judgment or decree void, but voidable only. McMurray v. McMurray, 66 N. Y. 175; Fox v. Fee, 24 App. Div. 314, 49 N. Y. Supp. 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Appellant\u2019s counsel insists that he was not allowed to show in the trial court that the proceedings in the Surrogate\u2019s Court were fraudulent and void. He was \u25a0 counsel for the widow in the proceeding for the appointment of an administrator of the intestate, and also in the proceeding for the sale of his real estate for the payment of his debts, and made no objections to the proceedings or the decree that was granted in each proceeding. On the trial of this action he made a general offer to show that the proceedings in Surrogate\u2019s Court were fraudulent and void, to which general offer the court said, \u201cThe offer I do not entertain.\u201d He did not offer evidence in any way relating thereto. If he had done so, it is to be presumed that the court would have received it. . The widow was not at the time of the sale interested in the fee of the real property, and it is unnecessary in this case to pass upon any question relating to her dower or other rights in the property. The appellant\u2019s counsel, following the offer to show that the proceedings in the Surrogate\u2019s Court were fraudulent and void, made a further offer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>as follows: <em>\u201cI </em>offer to prove by each one of the heirs of Wm. H. Blood that they had no papers in these proceedings to sell the real estate served upon them; no notice, as required by section 2531 of the Code of Civil procedure; and that they never personally appeared in court.\u201d To which the court said: \u201cThat is a very broad offer. You might have something you could prove.\u201d The appellant\u2019s counsel replied, \u201cThey will -claim that the infants have waived.\u201d The respondents\u2019 counsel then said, \u201cWe do not claim that any of the heirs of Blood have waived anything.\u201d No further offer was made by the appellant\u2019s counsel, and no evidence was offered by appellant relating to her alleged claim. There is nothing before this court requiring our consideration of the questions about which the appellant\u2019s offers were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">It is further claimed by the appellant that the Surrogate\u2019s Court never had jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the proceedings for the sale of said real property, for the reason that the real property was purchased by the intestate with pension money, and that it is exempt from sale for the payment of intestate\u2019s debts by section 1393 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and that under section 2749 of.the Code of Civil Procedure no authority is given to the Surrogate\u2019s Court to entertain a proceeding for the sale of such real property for the _payment of intestate\u2019s debts. The real property of which a decedent died seised is subject to be disposed of for the payment of his debts and funeral expenses as prescribed in chapter 18, tit. 5, of the Code of Civil Procedure, \u201cexcept where it is devised expressly charged with the payment of debts or funeral expenses or is exempted from levy and sale by virtue of an execution as prescribed in title second of chapter thirteen of this act.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2749. The only express exemptions of real property from levy and sale by virtue of an execution prescribed by title 2 of chapter 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure are: First. A seat or pew occupied by the judgment debtor or the family in a place of public worship. Such interest, although in perpetuity, is a limited and usufructuary one, and is enumerated in the statute as personal property. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1390. Second. Lands set apart as a family or private burying ground, when designated as prescribed by law to exempt the same. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1395, 1396. Third. A lot of land, with one or more buildings thereon not exceeding in value $1,000, and designated by law as an exempt homestead. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1397, 1399. By section 1393 of the Code of Civil Procedure there is no express exemption of real property from levy and sale by virtue of an execution. That section of the Code in terms exempts a pension granted to a person in the military service of the United States and certain equipments. The federal government, by which the decedent\u2019s pension was granted, protects the pension money until it reaches the pensioner, or his family in case of his death. Its protecting care extends no further, and such money becomes general assets in the hands of the person or persons receiving it. Prior to the decision of the case of Yates County National Bank v. Carpenter, as reported in 119 N. Y. 550, 23 N. E. 1108, 7 L. R. A. 557, 16 Am. St. Rep. 855, it was quite uniformly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>held in this state that the exemptions from levy and sale by virtue of an execution as stated in section 1393 of the Code of Civil Procedure did not extend to property, real or personal, purchased by the pensioner with the pension money. By the decision in Yates County National Bank v. Carpenter, supra, it was held that, where pension-money can be directly traced to the purchase of property necessary or convenient for the support and maintenance of the pensioner and his family, such property is exempt. Apart from exemptions, property of which a person dies the owner is subject to the payment of his debts. Exemptions of property from levy and sale by virtue of an execution do not run with the property exempted, and are not incidents thereof, but are personal favors to the person exempted. The statutes provide what property shall be deemed assets of a decedent to be inventoried, and what .property shall be set apart to a widow and the infant children of a deceased person; and real property, unless devised, descends to the heirs at law of the deceased. That it was not the intention of the Legislature to extend the exemptions of property purchased by pension money beyond the life of the pensioner is reasonably certain from the fact that it is not so stated in the statute, and lor the further reason that no provision is made for protecting a bona fide purchaser of the property from a stale claim of such exemptions as in the case now under consideration. Express provision is made for a record in the office of the clerk or register of the county of lands set apart as a family or private burying ground, and for a record of exempt homesteads in a book kept for that purpose, and styled the \"Homestead Exemptions Book.\u201d By section 1400 of the Code of Civil Procedure it is also provided when the exemptions of a homestead shall' continue after the owner\u2019s death, and the extent thereof. \u2022 If we should hold that real property purchased with pension money remains exempt for the benefit of the widow and infant children after the death of the pensioner, what limit-shall be placed upon such exemptions? Would the exemptions cease at the death of the widow and on the children arriving at the age of 21 years ? If it is the intention of the Legislature to extend exemptions of real property purchased with pension money beyond the death of the pensioner, it should be so expressly stated, and provision should be made for giving notice thereof. We are of the opinion that the real property of the decedent in this case was not, at the time of the filing of the petition, exempt from levy and sale by virtue of an execution, and that the Surrogate\u2019s Court had jurisdiction of the subject-matter of the proceeding. Matter of Liddle, 35 Misc. Rep. 173, 71 N. Y. Supp. 474; Beecher v. Barber, 6 Dem. Sur. 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">We are also of the opinion that the heirs at law of the decedent should not now be allowed to assert the exemption even if said section 1393 is construed to include an exemption extending beyond the death of the pensioner. The exemption, in any event, is not specific and absolute, but dependent upon a determination that the real property was purchased with pension money. It is necessary to determine such fact in the proceeding. The jurisdiction of the Surrogate\u2019s Court is dependent upon ma'ny facts, such as the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>istence of unpaid debts against the decedent, which must be determined by the court. Farrington v. King, 1 Brad. Sur. 182. It is important for the protection of innocent purchasers and the security of titles to real property that, if exemptions may extend beyond the life of a pensioner, the fact upon which such exemption depends be determined at the earliest possible moment, and in the first proceeding relating thereto when such exemption can be asserted. It has been determined by a court having jurisdiction of the persons of the heirs at law of the decedent that the real property in question was subject to sale by virtue of title 5 of chapter 18 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The widow and heirs at law had an opportunity to assert the claimed exemption, and failed to do so, and an innocent purchaser at a public sale pursuant to a decree of the court has accepted and paid for a deed thereof, and fihe' parties to the proceeding should not now, in a collateral action, be allowed to deny his title.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
