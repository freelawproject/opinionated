J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhV\">It is not necessary to go further than the complaint to see that this judgment cannot stand. The sole allegations are that plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant, which is annexed to the complaint, and which provides for the acceptance by defendant of 100,000 pails at $35 per thousand, the entire lot to be taken within six months\u2019 time from first shipment, and in quantities of not less than 15,000 pails at any one time; that in accordance with said agreement plaintiff delivered to defendant 10,000 of said pails at the price agreed upon, but that defendant absolutely refused, and still refuses, to carry out the terms of his agreement, to the plaintiff\u2019s damage $1,000. Upon the very plainest principles of pleading this complaint was insufficient. The promise of the' defendant to accept and the agreement of plaintiff to deliver were concurrent and mutual, and neither party can recover without alleging and proving performance, or tender of performance on his own part. Pope v. Terre Haute Car &amp; Mfg. Co., 107 N. Y. 61, 13 N. E. 592. The plaintiff is not relieved from the obligation of al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>leging performance or tender on his own part by reason of the allegation of defendant\u2019s refusal to fulfill, because he does not show wherein that refusal consisted. It is not alleged that defendant refused to accept 90,000, or any other number, of pails, but merely that he refused to fulfill the contract which might have consisted in a refusal to pay for what had been delivered; and in any aspect the mere allegation that the defendant \u201crefuses to carry out the terms of his agreement\u201d is a legal conclusion, and not the statement of a fact. Van Schaick v. Winne, 16 Barb. 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
