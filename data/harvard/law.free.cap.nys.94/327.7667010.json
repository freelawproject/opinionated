O. D. to a person in Philadelphia. Receiving no return, as he testifies, he inquired of the agent and clerks at the local office \u00e1 couple of times, and then was referred to \"the claim man\u201d at the main office. There he went with his lawyer, and was told that it had been delivered, otherwise he would have been notified within three or- four days. It is claimed that a postal card was sent him from Philadelphia December 23d, with word that the parcel was refused because of the express charges, and each of two persons deposes separately on a commission, that he sent the card. If this be prima facie evidence of notice, it is contradicted by circumstances and by the testimony of the plaintiff, who says he opens all his mail, and never received the postal card.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">The defendant\u2019s chief reliance, however, is on his plea of the \u201cspecial contract\u201d in the bill of lading, to wit: \u201cIf any \u2018C. O. D.\u2019 is not paid within thirty days the shipper agrees that the express company may return the property and that he will pay the charges of transportation both ways.\u201d That agreement contemplated that the package be returned in good order. A little before the expira<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>tian of the 30 days the package was offered to the shipper who refused to receive it, because, as he says, it was brought back in very damaged condition, respecting which he is corroborated positively by two of his employ\u00e9s. Two employes of \u2022 the company testify positively it was in good condition. Evidence sufficient, if credited, to sustain the judgment was adduced, and so the judgment may stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">DUGRO, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b348-7\">SCOTT, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApZ\">(dissenting). It seems to me to be quite unimportant whether or not defendant notified plaintiff of the nonacceptance of the goods by the consignee. .The crucial fact in the case is that, within 30 days of the shipment the defendant tendered back the goods to the plaintiff, and he absolutely refused to receive them. There was some evidence that the package or wrapping paper containing the goods was torn and damaged, but this was no evidence of a total loss. On the contrary, the plaintiff\u2019s evidence showed very clearly that the loss was but partial. Under these circumstances the plaintiff was not justified in refusing absolutely to accept the goods, but should have received them, and sued for the loss, if any. Brand v. Weir, 27 Misc. Rep. 212, 57 N. Y. Supp. 731, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Judgment should be reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
