Section 162 (page 1233), as amended by Laws 1897, p. 619, c. 481, provides that, if any account is wholly rejected, the board shall make a certificate to that effect, and file the same in the office of the town clerk. A town board of auditors certified \u201cthat the following is a correct abstract of the names of all persons who have presented to said board accounts to be audited, the amounts claimed by each of said persons, and the amounts audited by them respectively.\u201d Appended to this certificate was an abstract giving the number of a claim, the name of the claimant, the nature of his claim, the amount claimed, and the amount allowed, or, if. nothing was allowed, stating that the claim was disallowed. <em>Held, </em>that such certificate and abstract, although filed with the town clerk, constituted the abstract required by section 170, and did not fulfill the requirements of section 162 with respect to wholly rejected claims.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b680-15\">2.

After taking such action upon the relator\u2019s claim, the defendants made and filed in the office of the town clerk of' that town a paper, of which the following is a copy:</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">We, the undersigned, Town Board of Auditors of the town of Lake Pleasant, pursuant to the Town Law, do hereby certify that the following is a correct abstract of the names of all persons who have presented to said board accounts to be audited, the amounts claimed by each of said persons and the amounts audited by them respectively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Af0\">Ho. o! Claim. Claimant. Nature o\u00ed Claim. Amt. Claimed. Amt. Allowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad95\">* * * * * <em>* </em>* * * * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFbL\">16 L. L. Boyce. Claim ior legal services. $1,630.35 Disallowed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4Z\">* # * * * * * * * * * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGub\">Dated Nov. 11th, 1904.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-11\">[Signed]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJ7\">Benajah Page, Chairman,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-12\">Fitch Buyce,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-13\">Frank B. Abrams,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-14\">Board o\u00ed Auditors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">The above paper is in form of the abstract required to be delivered annually, under section 170 of the town law (Laws 1890, p. 1235, c. 569), to the clerk of the board of supervisors, and is not the certificate required by section 162 of such law, as amended by chapter 481, p. 619, of Laws 1897. That section provides: \u201cIf any account is wholly rejected the board shall make a certificate to that effect, signed by at least a majority of them, and file the same in the office of the town clerk.\u201d While the paper as made by the defendants was filed in the office of the town clerk, it is not a certificate that the claim was wholly rejected, as required by that section. Indeed, the only facts certified to are that the abstract correctly states the names of the persons who presented to the board accounts to be audited, the amounts claimed by each of them, and the amounts audited by them, respectively. The fact that under the words \u201cAmt. Allowed,\u201d in the abstract, there is inserted on the line describing relator\u2019s claim the word \u201cDisallowed,\u201d does not add anything to the force of the certificate, which is that the abstract contains the \"amounts audited\u201d by the defendants. There was no amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>audited under this claim, and the certificate itself contains nothing to the effect that the relator\u2019s claim was wholly rejected by the board. The relator was entitled, if the board upon the audit of his claim, wholly rejected it, as is claimed by the defendants, to have a certificate to that effect made and filed by them, as required by section 162. People ex rel. Canton Bridge Co. v. Town Auditors, 42 Misc. Rep. 116, 85 N. Y. Supp. 1093, affirmed 95 App. Div. 620, 88 N. Y. Supp. 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">In People ex rel. Remmington v. Manning, 37 App. Div. 143, 55 N. Y. Supp. 781, Rollett, J., in referring to said section 162, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">\u201cIt is a wise statute, and should be strictly enforced; * * * and, if not complied with, it should be enforced by the courts upon the application of any citizen of the town, as well as upon the application of a person having an account against the town which is not audited in the manner provided by the section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The section required the defendants to make a record of their action upon the relator\u2019s claim, to be filed in the\" office of the town clerk. That section not having been complied with, a proper case is presented for a mandamus to compel the defendants to. perform the duty imposed upon them in that respect by the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and a peremptory writ of mandamus granted, with $50 costs and disbursements to the relator, requiring the defendants to reconvene, and to thereupon make, sign, and file in the office of the clerk of the town of Lake Pleasant a certificate of the rejection of the relator\u2019s claim, as required by section 162 of the town law. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
