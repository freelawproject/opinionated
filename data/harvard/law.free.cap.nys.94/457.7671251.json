D., on Saturday, November 19th, balanced the account, and found the employ\u00e9 should have $300.91, but, on examining the cash, found only $160.91, thus exhibiting an embezzlement of $140 by the employ\u00e9, to whom he-said it should be his duty to turn over to the president, but this the employ\u00e9 begged off; saying that he had taken the money, and with it paid life insurance premiums, and that he would make the money good. He did pay back $25. D. did nothing until on December 7th, receiving a telegram that the employ\u00e9 could not be back that afternoon, and discovering that $15 more were missing, he informed the plaintiff\u2019s president, who the same day notified the defendant in writing of the taking by the employ\u00e9 of $130, the sum for which this action was brought, and a judgment had, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The defendant appellant objects to the judgment, and asks that it be reversed, because of failure of the plaintiff to notify the defendant of the loss immediately after its occurrence had come to its knowledge, i. e., November 19th, and so to perform a' condition precedent to recovery. That objection is good and sufficient. The respondent, however, says the knowledge of the secretary is not the knowledge of the corporation. What is or should be knowledge of a corporation has not been exactly determined by the courts, which differentiate the knowledge learned by a director when not in function from that acquired by him when acting as such (Atlantic State Bank v. Savery, 82 N. Y. 307), and recognize as corporate information the possible observation of a piece of ice upon the sidewalk by a patrolman (always on duty). Leaving aside whether the discovery of D., a director, was that of the company, the knowledge of D., the secretary, was the knowledge of an officer usually competent to receive notices affecting the corporation (Eggleston v. Road Co., 82 N. Y. 282) ; and the information of D.,- the superintendent, bookkeeper, and acting cashier, was the knowledge of an agent intrusted with the management of its business, and in transactions conducted within the scope of his authority (Cragie v. Hadley, 99 N. Y. 134, 1 N. E. 537, 52 Am. Rep. 9). It was not necessary for the defendant to show that earlier notice might have helped to<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>wards the recovery of some of the loss, or affected its election as to canceling the bond, or aided in bringing the offending employ\u00e9 to justice. The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
