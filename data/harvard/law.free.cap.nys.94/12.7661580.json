The action is brought to recover damages for loss of the services of plaintiff\u2019s wife, and for expenses incurred in her medical treatment, resulting from injuries received by her by reason of falling into a coal hole located on the sidewalk in front of defendants\u2019 premises. The complaint, among other things, alleges, in paragraph 5 thereof, \u201cthat on or about the 21st day of July, 1904, defendants wrongfully and negligently permitted said coal hole to be and continue, and the same then and there was, so badly and insufficiently and defectively covered and protected that by means thereof plaintiff\u2019s said wife, who was then and there lawfully passing in and along said street, necessarily, and without fault or negligence on her part, fell into said hole.\u201d The learned trial court, at the opening of the case, said: \u201cLet it appear that the action is predicated on negligence in not properly keeping the coal hole securely fastened.\u201d To which counsel for plaintiff replied: \u201cWe make no such statement, may it please the court. We insist that paragraph 5 of the complaint alleges a cause of action in nuisance, and not mere negligence, and we desire to be governed by the said pleadings and what evidence may be adduced.\u201d The court proceeded thereafter upon the theory that the case was one in negligence. But the case at bar is clearly within the rule laid down in Clifford v. Dam, 81 N. Y., where Chief Justice Church (at page 52) said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-14\">\u201cThe public are entitled to an unobstructed passage upon the streets, including the sidewalks of the city, but a structure such as that proved in this case was an obstruction. It was sufficient for the plaintiff to prove that, in passing along the sidewalk, he was injured by this structure, which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>was appurtenant' to defendant\u2019s premises. It was not necessary to prove negligence. The action was not based upon negligence, biit on a wrongful act, for which the defendants were responsible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\"The latter case\" was also brought to-recover for damages sustained by falling through a coal hole, and the complaint therein contained a paragraph identical with paragraph 5 of the complaint in the case at bar. And in Clifford v. Dam it was further held that all that plaintiff was required to prove in such a case was that in passing along the sidewalk he fell into the coal hole and was injured thereby; he was1 not even required' to' prove want of contributory negligence; that thereupon it was incumbent on defendant to justify the act complained of. It w\u00e1s not necessary to specifically allege that the acts complained of constituted a nuisance. Campbell v. U. S. Foundry Co., 73 Hun, 576, <em>26 </em>N. Y. Supp. 165; Morris v. Barrisford, 9 Misc. Rep. 14, 29 N. Y. Supp. 17. If a permit had been issued by the city authorities for the maintenance of the coal hole in question, its effect would be to mitigate the act from an absolute nuisance to one involving care in its construction and maintenance (Clifford v. Dam, supra); but there was no such proof in this case,</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">There was no evidence that defendant Harry Content was the owner of the premises in question, but, on the contrary, it affirmatively appeared that defendant Ada Content was the actual owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The order appealed from should therefore be affirmed, with costs, as to the defendant Harry Content; and as to the defendant .Ada Content it should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
