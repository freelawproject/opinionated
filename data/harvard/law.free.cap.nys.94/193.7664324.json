The Comptroller imposed a license fee of $62,50, based upon the $50,000 only. Subsequently the corporation consolidated with another, and issued $30,-000 preferred stock for cash, and $300,000 common stock for the good will of the consolidating company. In readjusting the tax for the year ending October 31, 1901, the Comptroller appraised, the relator\u2019s common stock at 66^ per cent., as capital employed,'and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>imposed-a.' franchise, tax upon\" that \"basis. In fixing the license fee under section 181 of the tax law (Laws 1896, p. 856, c. 908), he computed if on the par value of $30,000, representing the increased preferred stock, and on the- $300,000 of increased common stock, as capital, notwithstanding the fact that he had appraised that stock at 66% per cent., and included as well the $200,000 of stock issued for good will, which he had omitted in imposing his license fee in 1895, presumably because the Court of Appeals meantime had decided that good will was an asset which might be included \"in the imposition of a franchise tax and license fee. All of the relator\u2019s capital, including its good will, Whatever \"might be its' value, was confessedly employed within this state.'</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">The relator insists that the Comptroller had no right to revise his own decision of 1895, and compel it t\u00f3 pay a license fee upon the $200',000 of capital which he then omitted, and, further, that he could not impose a license fee upon the increased issue of stock as capital at par, when his own assessment placed it at only 66% per cent. In both of these propositions we think it is right. This court has held in decisions handed down at this term that the Comptroller has no right to review his own decision by arbitrarily reassessing and readjusting a license fee imposed and paid (People ex rel. Spencerian Pen Co. v. Kelsey, as Comptroller [App. Div.] 93 N. Y. Supp. 971), and also that \u00e1 foreign corporation should be assessed upon the amount of capital employed by it within this state, and not upon the amount of its capitalization (People ex rel. Consolidated Ginseng Company v. Kelsey, as Comptroller [App. Div.] 93 N. Y. Supp. 369). The license fee should have been computed on the $30,000 of preferred stock, which was assessed as capital at par, and the $300j000 of increased stock appraised at 66% per cent., or on $230,000 at the rate of 1% mills, which would leave the license fee $287.50, instead of $725, as imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The relator also complains that its common stock was appraised as capital beyond its value.' The stock now pays a small dividend, and was issued for $500,000 of good will, and the Comptroller had the right to take into consideration the relator\u2019s own estimate of its value. People ex rel. Keochl Company v. Morgan, 96 App. Div. 110, 88 N. Y. Supp. 1066. We do not feel that his determination in this regard should be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The determination of the Comptroller should be modified by reducing the license fee to $287.50, and, as so modified, confirmed, with $50 costs and disbursements to relator. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
