The plaintiff claimed that prior to the execution of the lease, and as a consideration for it, the defendant orally agreed to make certain repairs to the premises before the commencement of the term. The repairs were not completed until over a month after the commencement of the term, by reason of which plaintiff claims to have been injured (the premises being rented .for the purpose of letting furnished rooms), and she brought this action in the City Court of the City of New York to recover the damages sustained. At the trial she was permitted, against defendant\u2019s objection and exception, to offer testimony to the effect that prior to the execution of the written agreement the landlord agreed that he would do certain repairs, and have them completed before the 1st of October, the time when the lease commenced, and that such repairs were not completed until something over a month thereafter. She was also permitted to offer proof, against like objections and exceptions, of the damages which she sustained by reason of the landlord\u2019s failure to have such repairs completed at the time agreed. She had a recovery for such damage, and on appeal to the Appellate Term the judgment of the City Court was affirmed, and by permission defendant has now appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">I am of the opinion that the determination of the Appellate Term and the judgment of the City Court should be reversed. The admission of the testimony which tended to establish the alleged oral agreement contradicted the terms of the written lease, and violated the well-settled rule that all oral negotiations made prior to or at the time a written agreement is executed are merged in it. Wilson v. Deen, 74 N. Y. <em>531; </em>Eighmie v. Taylor, 98 N. Y. 288. The written lease, it will be observed, appears upon its face to contain the entire agreement of the parties. Nothing seems to have been omitted. It is complete in every respect, and covers the entire subject-matter. The obligation of the respective parties and the extent to which each is bound is there set forth. A legal presumption prevails, therefore, which cannot be overcome by paroi evidence, that the lease contains the whole agreement between the parties. Van Derhoef v. Hartmann, 63 App. Div. 419, 71 N. Y. Supp. 552; Smith v. Smull, 69 App. Div. 452, 74 N. Y. Supp. 1061. Proof of a paroi collateral agreement cannot be received if it tends to contradict or vary the written agreement. It is only admissible when the written agreement is not complete upon its face, and such paroi proof does not vary or'contradict its terms. Thomas v. Scutt, 127 N. Y. 133, 27 N. E. 961. Any other view would not. only do violence to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>rule- prohibiting the reception of paroi proof to vary the terms of a written instrument, but would, in effect, destroy the purpose sought to be accomplished by a written contract, viz., prevent disputes as to what the parties had contracted to do. It is not claimed -that the written lease was not to take effect until the terms of the oral agreement had been complied with. Here the oral agreement was not only a part of the hiring, as appears from the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony, but is in conflict with the provisions of the lease. It must be held, therefore, that the oral agreement, if made, was merged in the written agreement, and that being upon-its face complete, and covering the whole subject-matter, paroi testimony is inadmissible to vary or contradict its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">It follows, therefore, that the determination of the Appellate Term and the judgment of the City Court must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
