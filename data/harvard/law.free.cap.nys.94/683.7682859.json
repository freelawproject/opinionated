The defendant\u2019s trustees were claimed to have been negligent in allowing the walk to become out of repair. . No actual notice was shown of the condition of the walk prior to the accident, but the want of repair for a considerable time is shown to have existed. The plaintiff recovered a verdict of $700. A motion for a new trial was made pursuant to section 999 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and denied. No order was entered upon this denial of defendant\u2019s motion, and the appeal here is simply from the judgment.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b703-16\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Ten Eyck v. Witbeck, 55 App. Div. 168, 66 N. Y. Supp. 931; Allen v. Corn Exchange Bank, 181 N. Y. 282, 73 N. E. 1026. In the case of McGrath v. Home Insurance Company, 88 App. Div. 153, 84 N. Y. Supp. 374, and also in the case of Shotwell v. Dixson, 163 N. Y. 43, 57 N. E. 178, the appeal to the Appellate Division was both from the judgment and from an order denying a motion for a new trial. In the 'McGrath Case the opinion, so far as it indicates that a review may be had of errors to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>which exceptions .were not taken upon an appeal from a judgment alone, is disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The defendant, having made no motion at the end of the case for a directed verdict, cannot be heard now, upon this appeal from the judgment, to claim that there was no evidence to submit to the jury. Hopkins v. Clark, 158 N. Y. 299, 53 N. E. 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The appellant\u2019s sole reliance, then, for the reversal of this judgment, must be upon exceptions taken to the reception of evidence. Two or three of those exceptions defendant\u2019s counsel has called to our attention, to one of which we will refer. Evidence was offered by a witness, Willis, to the effect that she tripped and fell shortly before this accident upon a loose plank in this same walk near the northwest corner of the Besaw House. This evidence as to the witness Willis was objected to on the ground that it appeared to be at a different place from where the plaintiff fell.\" An examination of the evidence, however, discloses that it is not entirely clear where plaintiff fell. Where witness fell was within a very short distance from where the plaintiff fell, if not at the precise point, and the jury were instructed by the court to give no effect to the evidence unless they found that the witness fell at the place where the plaintiff was injured. This exception presents, no error which calls for a reversal of this judgment. We have examined the other exceptions argued by appellant\u2019s counsel in his brief, and find no error which calls for a reversal of the conclusion reached at trial term.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
