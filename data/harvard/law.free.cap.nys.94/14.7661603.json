It may have been that the accident happened because the plaintiff\u2019s wife slipped on ice. It does not appear that she slipped through the negligence of the defendant, because it was not shown on the trial how long the ice had remained on the defendant\u2019s premises. We are therefore of the opinion that the order appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">The order appealed from is affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
