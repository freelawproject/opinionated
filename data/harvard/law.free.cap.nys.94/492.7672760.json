It appears that the defendant paving company was engaged in tearing up the street, preparatory to paving, pursuant to a contract with the city; that the stones forming the crosswalk had been loosened and\u2122 somewhat displaced; and that a hole 2feet in depth from the surface of the sidewalk had been formed in the gutter at or near the-place where the plaintiff fell. But it does not appear that the plaintiff\u2019s fall was occasioned either by her stepping into this hole or stumbling against the loosened stones. Both she and her husband, who was with her, testify that they did not know what caused her to fall. The record discloses a fall in close proximity to defects in the crosswalk, with the plaintiff in court and utterly failing to shed, any light on the cause of such fall. The fact that a defective condition of the street might have caused the accident is not sufficient. If the plaintiff could not account for it, certainly a jury should not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>he permitted to speculate, and, without some evidence showing more than a mere possibility, it was error to submit the case to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
