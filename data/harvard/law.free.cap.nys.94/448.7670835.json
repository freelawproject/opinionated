Later, asked why he changed his mind, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>said because he had to sue. He further testified that defendant paid the last $25 on account of $117.50, and that the difference between $39 and $89.50 is what the services are reasonably worth, while the summons, bill of particulars, and judgment specify $85.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">It seems, in view of the character of the plaintiff\u2019s feelings toward the defendant evinced in the voluntary, irrelevant statement to be found on the last page of the stenographer\u2019s minutes, plaintiff\u2019s interest, contradictory evidence, and the probabilities, that the judgment should be reversed, and that there should be a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the ev'ent, unless he stipulates that the judgment be reduced to $53.31, in which event the judgment, modified accordingly, will be affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
