The en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>gine, boiler, and team weighed slightly less than 8,000 pounds. The defendant does not claim the bridge was as safe as it reasonably should have been, but rests its defense upon the fact that the plaintiff\u2019s agent and servants knew of its unsafe condition, and voluntarily took the risk of crossing with the heavy load. Two other loads of considerable weight, connected with the mill, crossed first, and there is testimony that the bridge cracked with these loads and showed marked signs of unsoundness, and one of the drivers, having stopped when the cracking began, was warned to go ahead before the bridge broke under him. The plaintiff\u2019s agent testified that he examined the bridge as much as he could from its surface, without going underneath, and that it.appeared to be safe, and denies the incident of the cracking when the first loads went over, or that he was warned as to its unsafe condition, or that he admitted after the accident that he had been told the bridge was unsafe, and crossed because it was a town bridge, and the business of the town to keep it in sound condition, as testified to by several witnesses. We think, however, that the testimony was so overwhelming that plaintiff\u2019s agent had been warned and knew of the unsafe condition of the bridge, and took his chances in safely crossing with the heavy load, that the court should have granted the defendant\u2019s-motion for a new trial. Plaintiff\u2019s witness Ackerly says that Johnson, plaintiff\u2019s husband, was told in his presence by one Moe that the bridge was unsafe, unless he propped it up, to cross with his engine and boiler.. \u2018Moe, called as a witness for the plaintiff, denies that he said this in the presence of Ackerly, but admits that he told' Johnson that in his opinion, judging from the age of the bridge, it might not hold his load. Robinson, the driver of the team hauling the engine and boiler, says that Jerome Cross asked him how much his load weighed, and expressed doubt about the bridge standing the strain, and told him it might hold and it might not, which so disturbed him that he asked another party whom he met on the road about it, who said that the bridge was all right so far as he knew. In addition to the warning testified to by plaintiff\u2019s own witnesses, Ackerly and Moe, defendant\u2019s witnesses Porter and ICrum say they warned Johnson not to cross without propping the bridge, because it was unsafe; and defendant\u2019s witnesses Dean, George Cross, Aldridge, Dulaff, and Krum all testify that Johnson admitted to them that he knew the bridge was unsafe, and that he intended to prop it up, but that Robinson, the driver, drove on against his orders before he had done so. The team hauling the boiler and engine was not owned by the plaintiff, but had been hired to do the hauling, and Robinson was the servant of its owner. While not strictly the servant of the plaintiff, yet Robinson was under the direction and control of plaintiff\u2019s agent. If plaintiff, through her agent, knew or had reason to believe that the bridge was liable to collapse under a heavy load, and voluntarily and knowingly took the risk of crossing, she cannot recover against the defendant town.
