Upon the 11th it was agreed that it be further adjourned to the 21st, and a stipulation signed by the respective attorneys to that effect was mailed the clerk of the court the day following\u2014a Sunday. On the 21st both parties attended with their attorneys. Then it transpired that, the stipulation not having reached the clerk betimes, and no one appearing on the call of the calendar, the cause had been dismissed. The stipulation was produced by the clerk, the cause was restored, and its trial set for the 27th; the defendant opposing, according to the order entered, but consenting according to the return. On the 27th an inquest was taken, the defendant\u2019s attorney appearing only and specially to contend that jurisdiction had been lost by the dismissal. That contention was not available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>then and there, nor is it now and here. The learned justice did but, as he should, effectuate the stipulation. The agreement of the parties bound them and concluded the court in that proceeding, and the court was bound, as between the parties, to observe, enforce, and carry out the agreement. Matter of N. Y., L. &amp; W. R. Co., 98 N. Y. 447,452. Proof having been given upon the inquest sufficient to sustain the judgment, that judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AXz\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
