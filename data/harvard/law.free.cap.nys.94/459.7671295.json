The plaintiff rested upon the presumption arising from possession of. the note, its introduction in evidence, proof of partial payments thereon, and of the interest. The defendants, in turn, gave evidence of a deduction from the face value of the note, and of statements by the plaintiff\u2019s son, acting as agent'in the transaction. Respecting their controversy, the learned trial justice charged at length, and so explicitly that no exception was, or well could be, taken by either side. Then the defendants\u2019 counsel asked that the jury be charged as matter of law that, \u201cif the jury cannot make up their minds as to who to believe, the plaintiff has failed to make out his case, and defendants are entitled to a verdict.\u201d To which the court said, \u201cI charge so, because it is by a preponderance of the credible evidence that the plaintiff should prevail.\u201d This was not the law of the case. He that affirms of another an unlawful act is bound to affirmative proof of that which makes the act unlawful. Were the oral evidence eliminated by disbelief of both the plaintiff and the defendants, the verdict would needs have been for the plaintiff upon his prima facie case. \u25a0 After attention had been called to error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel saying, \u201cWe except to that, because in a defense of usury the burden of proof is upon the defendant, the justice further observed, \u201cThe validity of the note is presumed, but that is subject to rebuttal, and when the rebuttal testimony is put in, then the burden shifts again on the maker of the note, and he must establish that by a fair preponderance of the evidence.\u201d This not unfamiliar phrasing, arising from use of \u201cburden\u201d with diverse meanings, did not remedy the charge. \u201cThe presumption is, of course, that the law was not violated.\u201d Morrison v. Verdenal (Sup.) 5 N. Y. Supp. 607. The charge made on request of the defendants still standing, the expression about a shifting of the burden might be taken to imply possible relief of the defendants from their burden of satisfying the jury affirmatively of the truth of their allegation that the plaintiff took interest exceeding the legal rate and with corrupt intent\u2014a burden subsisting to the end.

The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
