Sulka &amp; Company.\u201d He further claims that, after making said contract to erect -said fire escape, and entering upon the prosecution of the work and incurring expense, defendants refused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>to allow him to complete the same. Plaintiff had judgment in the court below for $57.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">Upon the trial it appeared that while defendants were still using some old stationery marked \u201cA. Sulk\u00e1 &amp; Company,\u201d with the names <em>\u201cA. </em>Sulka\u201d and \u201cLeon Wormser\u201d printed thereupon, the two individuals named did not constitute a copartnership, but that \u201cA.. Sulka &amp; Company\u201d was in fact a domestic corporation, organized in the year preceding that in which the contract was alleged to have been made; and the witness Sulka, called on plaintiff\u2019s behalf, testified that he signed the letter, claimed by plaintiff to constitute an acceptance of plaintiff\u2019s offer to do the work in question, as president of the corporation. The court below admitted this letter, against defendants\u2019 objection, saying that the letter should be received in evidence, and then the defendants should disprove the partnership if they wanted to. Plaintiff had alleged a partnership of defendants, and the burden of proof was on him to establish it. He not only failed to do this, but affirmatively established the existence of a corporation instead as the other contracting party. Defendant Wormser has been in no way connected with the'transaction, nor had any knowledge been brought home to him of the acts complained of. The judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, \u25a0 with costs to appellants to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
