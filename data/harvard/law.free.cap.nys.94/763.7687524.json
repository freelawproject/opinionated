By notice dated June 20, 1904, and pursuant to section 1268 of the Code of Civil Procedure, they moved the court below for an order canceling and discharging of record a judgment entered there on May 28, 1895, in favor of the plaintiffs and against themselves, and by affidavit declared that said judgment was duly scheduled, and \u201cthat the said judgment was not, nor was the debt upon which the same was founded, excepted from the operation of such discharge.\u201d By the provisions of the section of the Code, above indicated, \u201cif it appears upon the hearing that he had been discharged from the payment of that judgment or the debt upon which such judgment was recovered an order must be made directing said judgment be cancelled and discharged of record.\u201d Thus far were the defendants entitled to an order of cancellation which was entered on June 27, 1904. Thereafter, upon an order to show cause, the order of June 27th was canceled, and the motion to cancel the judgment was denied. That determination was reversed by this court because of want of reason for short notice (45 Misc. Rep. 591, 91 N. Y. Supp. 76), without prejudice, however, to an application de nova for a reargument upon proper notice. The motion for reargument was made and granted, but the motion of the defendants for cancellation was denied. This the defendants now contend was improper, but the opposing affidavits of the plaintiffs clearly establish \u201cthat no notice or knowledge of the filing of the petition, oi of the adjudication in bankruptcy of the above-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>named defendants, or notice to creditors to prove claims, or of the application for the discharge, or the discharge in bankruptcy of the defendants herein, or of any of the bankruptcy proceedings of these defendants, has ever been had or received\u201d; and, further, by copy of the schedule, that the residence of the judgment creditors' was given as unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">It appearing by affidavit that the residence of these creditors was ascertainable by the exercise of ordinary diligence, and that such diligence was required (In re Dvorak, 107 Fed. 76, 6 Am. Bankr. Rep. 66), the court below properly held the schedule defective, and denied the motion to cancel the judgment. By this determination \u201cthe validity and effectiveness of the discharge in general are not questioned,\u201d only \u201cit does not extend to this particular claim.\u201d Sutherland v. Lasher, 41 Misc. Rep. 249, 251, 84 N. Y. Supp. 56, and affirmed in 87 App. Div. 633, 84 N. Y. Supp. 1148, without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Order affirmed, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
