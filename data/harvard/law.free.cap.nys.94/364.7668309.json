At the trial she was asked by her counsel,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-19\">\u201cQ. State what you felt\u2014have you pain any place, and, if so, indicate and state? A. It appeared on a certain contusion at that time. Must I state everything about this? By the Court: Anything you know, you must state. A. It appeared\u2014my menstruation. It lasted five weeks constantly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-20\">The defendant moved to strike this out as incompetent, but this motion was denied, and he excepted. Again she was asked, against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the objection of the defendant, if she felt any effects at this time from the injuries received, and, if so, to describe them; and, among other things, she said, \u201cI continue to have troubles with menstruation very much.\u201d Her physician was asked, \u201cCan you say with reasonable certainty that a shock of the kind which Mrs. Farnham has testified to, or that she received\u2014this fall\u2014r-would cause undue menstruation?\u201d And he answered, \u201cYes.\u201d This, too, was objected to upon the same ground, and because not pleaded, and asked to be stricken out, but was denied. The physician did not state, nor was he asked, that the shock did cause undue menstruation. The judgment should be reversed therefor. McNeill v. Interurban St. Ry. Co. (Sup.) 92 N. Y. Supp. 767. And under the decision in Clark v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 68 App. Div. 49, 54, 74 N. Y. Supp. 267, specific pleading would seem necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
