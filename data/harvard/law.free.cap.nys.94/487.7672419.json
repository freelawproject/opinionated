This, however, was positively denied by the other side, and as well by the juror as by counsel, even of the moving party. This, alone, was hardly enough to justify the action of the trial justice, and, even if true, being known before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>verdict was rendered, was not sufficient for a late application to set the verdict aside.
