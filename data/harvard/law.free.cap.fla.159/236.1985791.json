In consideration of the mutual covenants, promises and forebearances, the parties hereto further agree to resume their marital relation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">They thereupon resumed and continued their marital relations although Rafael was absent a good part of the time in Mexico and so continued up until the time of the death of Felicidad Guerra Ruesga, which occurred on August 9th 1945, at'which time she was testate, having theretofore made and executed a will on September 17th 1938, in which she disposed of all her property, real and personal, and in which she bequeathed in the third item of her will to her husband Rafael Ruesga the munificient sum of $1.00 in the following language :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">\u201cTHIRD: I give, devise and bequeath to my husband, Rafael Ruesga, the sum of One Dollar ($1.00).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">All the balance of her property was disposed of by other bequests. Her will was probated on August 14th 1945. An inventory of her estate was filed. Thereafter, on April 19, 1946, Rafael Ruesga filed claim in Probate Court, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aap\">\u201cNow comes Rafael Ruesga whose place of residence is 812 South Edison Avenue, Tampa, Florida, and whose Post Office Address is 812 South Edison Avenue, Tampa, Florida, and files his claim against the estate of Felicidad Guerra Ruesga, deceased, for the following items and in the following amounts, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>\u201cOne-half of cash in the First National Bank of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\">Tampa, Florida ............................................................$ 217.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-5\">One-half of Tampa Electric Company Dividend</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">Check No. L.

D., 1933, except that his claim to the diamond ear-rings is based upon his absolute ownership thereof and that his claim to the Buick Automobile is also based upon his ownership thereof, as well as upon his inheritance rights. That his claim to the homestead of the parties is based upon his inheritance rights as above and also upon its homestead character.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-21\">On May 10, 1946 F. R. Diaz, Sr. and May Guerra Diaz and the Exchange National Bank of Tampa, Florida, who were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>qualified Executors under the will, filed objections to the claim made by Rafael relying on the contract of May 15,1933. On June 27, 1946, Rafael filed his petition in the County Judge\u2019s Court praying a determination by the Court of his interest in the estate under the terms of the contract of May May 15, 1933, when considered in connection with the will of the deceased wife and averred in effect that the clause in the contract, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">\u201cIt is further understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that the above and foregoing agreement shall have no effect whatsoever upon any right of inheritance in case of the death of either party.\u201d \u2014 estopped and precluded Felicidad from making disposition by will of the property, title to which had been established in her by the contract of May 15, 1933. On October 21, 1946, pursuant to motion, the County Judge entered his order as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">\u201cThis cause coming on to be heard upon the Motion of the Executors to dismiss the Petition filed herein by Rafael Ruesga upon the ground that said petition and the agreement attached thereto and made a part thereof, shows upon its face that Felicidad Guerra Ruesga, deceased, was not prevented from making a will if she so desired, and disposing of her estate in any manner she saw fit, and same having been argued by counsel for the respective parties, and the Court being fully advised in the premises, it is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">\u201cORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the petitioner is not entitled to a distributive share of the estate of de'cedent, and that the Motion to Dismiss said Petition upon the ground above set forth be, and the same is hereby granted and said Petition be, and the same is hereby dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">From this Order appeal was taken to the Circuit Court and there on December 12, 1946, Hon. Harry Sandler, Circuit Judge, affirmed the judgment of the County Judge\u2019s Court in this regard and from that judgment appeal was taken to this Court and the matter is now here for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Our disposition here depends entirely upon the construction to be given in the clause in the contract, supra, which Rafael relies upon to defeat the provisions of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>We find no ambiguity in the language used. Our construction is that it was placed in the contract to make it clear that the respective relinquishments contained in the contract were not to be construed to apply to any claim of right that either party might have under the law of descent and distribution after death of the other party and in nowise affect the right of either party to dispose of any of the property described by sale, gift or assignment, or by will.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">The right of inheritance was not affected by the contract. The right of the husband to inherit from the wife was effective only by the action of the wife in making and executing a subsequent will. The right of inheritance remained just the same after the contract as it would have been with no contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">It has for a very long time been the law in this State that a wife had the power to make a will which would deprive her husband of any interest which he might have under the statute to inherit any part of her property at her death. See McDougald et al. v. Gilchrist, Executor, et al., 20 Fla. 573. It is true that the right of the husband to dispose of his property by will is subject to the right of the surviving wife to dissent from the will and take dower. .The legislature of Florida has not enacted into law the right of curtesy which corresponds in behalf of the husband to dower rights in behalf of the wife. This is a matter within the legislative domain and whether or not a lack of the law of curtesy creates an unfair inequality between the status of a widow and that of a widower is a matter with which the court may not without statute interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The language in the contract on which appellant bases his claim is clear and unambiguous and appears, as we have heretofore said, to have been included in the contract for the purpose of making it clear that each of the parties to that contract did not mean thereby to foreclose themselves against any right to claim property therein mentioned under the laws of inheritance in the event of the death of the other party.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">We find nothing in the record to indicate that the language was put in the contract for any other purpose or to have any other meaning. Therefore, it in no way limited or abridged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the right of either of the parties to dispose of the property by will.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The judgment of the Circuit Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b275-6\">THOMAS, C. J., ADAMS and BARNS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
