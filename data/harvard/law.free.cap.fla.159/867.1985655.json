These petitions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-15\">Section 72.21, 1945 Cumulative Supplement to Florida Statutes 1941 (sameF.S.A.) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-16\">\u201cProceedings to be as in Chancery. \u2014 All proceedings herein shall be as in Chancery and shall be governed by the same rules as in other chancery causes, except as may be herein expressly changed or modified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>We think it was error for the court to proceed to hearing on application for interlocutory order and to final hearing without proof of notice of such hearing having been given to the protesting father of the two children involved. See Fielding v. Highsmith, 152 Fla. 837, 13 So. (2nd) 208; In re: Whetstone v. Minor, 137 Fla. 712, 188 So. 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">The petition to set aside and vacate the interlocutory order and final decree of adoption should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">The order and decree appealed from are reversed with directions that the interlocutory order and the decree of adoption be set aside and vacated and that the cause do thence proceed after due notice to all interested parties, including the natural father of the two children involved in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">So ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b901-8\">THOMAS, C.
