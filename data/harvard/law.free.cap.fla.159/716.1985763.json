The parties intend, however, that the Lessees shall not be deemed in default as to the non-payment of rent until the rent shall have been past due ten (10) days or where the default consists in other than the non-payment of rent, until the Lessors shall have given the Lessees written notice, specifying the nature of such default and unless the Lessees shall not have remedied the said default or shall not have taken steps reasonably to cure the said default within ten (10) days after the receipt of such notice.\u201d (Italics ours).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Whether or not the rights of the appellee, as tenant under said lease, have come to an end, and whether or not the appellants-landlords are entitled to prevail in said unlawful detainer proceedings is a matter which the Civil Court of Record is competent to adjudicate. The civil court has jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>of the subject matter and the parties, and it was error to issue the peremptory writ of prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b750-5\">THOMAS, C.
