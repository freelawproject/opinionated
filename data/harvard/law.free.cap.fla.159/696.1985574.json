Bross, 123 Fla. 758, 167 So. 669, the Court is of the opinion that the rule in Shelley\u2019s case does not apply in this particular trust wherein the plaintiff has a life estate in the equitable interest, and the legal remainder\u2014 as distinguished from the equitable remainder \u2014 goes to her heirs. The situation would be- different had the plaintiff received the equitable interest for life, and then on her death, the equitable interest went to her heirs, for in such an instance the rule in Shelley\u2019s case would apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-11\">\u201cThereupon</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-12\">\u201cIT IS ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the bill be dismissed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>The learned Chancellor .ruled correctly in holding that under the terms of the will the rule in Shelley\u2019s case did not apply because the plaintiff took under the will an equitable life estate and the heirs had a legal remainder.
