Brannon did not do so promptly and Masters inquired further of Brannon on occasions and each time Bran-.non promised to go and see if it was his heifer. Doubtless it was Brannon\u2019s heifer.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-15\">There is substantial evidence showing that Masters on several occasions had the heifer put out of his pasture but that she would later be found to have returned to the pasture; that Masters sold the heifer but that Masters was not present when the buyer came and took her away.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-16\">Without further elaboration it appears to us that under the circumstances of this case there was no larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-17\">As the Ju4ge correctly charged the jury the offense of larceny has been defined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>\u201cLarceny is the stealing, taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to deprive the owner thereof of his property permanently, or to convert it to the taker\u2019s or some one else\u2019s use. And in order for a conviction to be had on the charge of larceny, there must have been a felonious intent, that is, a conscious purpose to steal that which did not belong to the taker, the felonious intent to steal and take, and there must have been a taking and there must have been a carrying away, some times referred to as asportation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Under other circumstances the selling of the heifer .of another might be larceny but here the possession of the heifer by Masters was not acquired by a felonious act. Had not the means by which Masters became possessed been established the sale might have established larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The evidence is sufficient to establish a wrongful conversion of the heifer but insufficient to establish an intent to <em>steal </em>as defined in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The judgment appealed is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b650-7\">TERRELL, Acting Chief Justice, BUFORD, and ADAMS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
