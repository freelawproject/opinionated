Section 561.34 (11) supra has no application to \u201cdry\u201d counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">The petition is granted, the writ of certiorari issued and, the order denying motion to dissolve injunction is quashed and ordered granted, and, likewise, the order denying motion to dismiss bill of complaint is quashed and ordered granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b648-11\">THOMAS, C.
