At most, they should have only been recited.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">We feel, it apropriate to warn the attorneys and the courts reporters and others who prepare records-on-appeal that it is imperative that records presented to this Court shall be governed by the rule to-wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-13\">\u201c. . . All pleadings, evidence and other matters not essential to the decision of said question shall be omitted. Formal parts of all exhibits and more than one copy of any document, shall be excluded. Documents shall be abridged by omitting all irrelevant and formal parts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-14\">(b) Penalty. Failure on the part of counsel or others to abbreviate the record on appeal as thus required will sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>ject them to the payment of such costs as this Court may deem proper to impose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Rules Supreme Court of Florida Rule 11, (2) (a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The rule is applicable to court reporters and clerks as well as attorneys and the purpose for which a record is made should govern the attorneys and the court reporter and others preparing the record. It is a simple matter for the attorney to advise the court reporter and for the court reporter or clerk of the court to inquire of the attorney for directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Petitioner complains that the chancellor erred in overruling his motion to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s bill because of a prior decision of the same controversy on the merits and adverse to the plaintiff. The bill did make reference to the prior controversy and the adverse decision but same was not pleaded with such sufficient particularity as to enable the issue of <em>res judicata </em>to be determined on a motion to dismiss and in this respect certiorari is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The prior suit is identified in plaintiffs bill but it is not made of part thereof and the chancellor in making his ruling doubtless confined his consideration solely to the contents of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Petitioner likewise complains that the chancellor erred in referring the cause to a master for a report on the ability of the husband to pay support money after defendant has filed his answer pleading <em>res judicata. </em>This is not essentially error, but it would have been appropriate to have determined the issues of prior adjudication first or else likewise have referred this, also, to the master. Certiorari on this is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Petitioner seems to have proceeded upon the hypothesis that the matter of res judicata has been determined against him by virtue of the chancellor\u2019s orders denying motion to dismiss and by his order of reference. We do not so conclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">The petitioner\u2019s pleading to plaintiff\u2019s bill was styled \u201cAnswer or Plea of Res Judicata.\u201d Pleas are abolished (see 63.33 F.S.A.) but the character of a pleading is to be determined by its contents and the title as contained in the cap-ton only goes to the form and in nowise controls. It is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>maxim that \u201cequity regards the substance rather than the form.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Certiorari denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b505-6\">THOMAS, C.
