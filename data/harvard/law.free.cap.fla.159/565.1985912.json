Thomas A. Cassara v. Olive Wofford Sec. 34, pages 41, 42.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The rights of a receiver by the landlord are dependent upon whether or not the tenant is in default. Plaintiff alleges by her bill that the tenant is in default but before appointing a receiver notice should be given unless excused under the circumstances stated in F.S. Section 63.73 \u2014 63.74 F.S.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The chancellor appointed a Receiver on application of the plaintiff without notice and the appellant-defendant now petitions this Court for a supersedeas of said order.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">It is not made to appear by the record that by the giving of the notice \u201cthe injury apprehended will be done if an immediate remedy is not afforded.\u201d (See F.S. Section 63.73 F.S.A.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The error appears so manifest that it is our conclusion that the writ should be granted and the order quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<judges id=\"b598-10\">THOMAS, C.
