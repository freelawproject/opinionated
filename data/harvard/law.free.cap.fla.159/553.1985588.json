The petitioners-defendants filed a \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d the bill and a \u201cmotion to strike\u201d pats of the bill. Both motions were overruled and denied which orders petitioners now seek review by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">The bill alleges that Boris Rivkind at a time when he had no place of business obtained a license for a bar and package store for the sale of liquor and transferred it to J-M Corp. and. that such transfer was a violation of Section 561.32 F.S.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">That the location of the bar and package store was without the \u201cprimary fire zone\u201d as defined by the City\u2019s ordinance and within a thousand feet of the St. Alban\u2019s Kindergarten Nursery School; and that City ordinance 1682 prohibits the issuance of such a liquor license for a place of business nearer than a thousand feet to any school when without the \u201cprimary fire zone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">Plaintiff-respondent also sought to justify his right to bring the bill by authority of 54.11 F.S.A. as an act to abate a nuisance, proceeding on the theory that any place to sell liquor is a nuisance as defined by 823.05 F.S.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">It is our conclusion that a kindergarten nursery is not a school within the intent of the ordinance and Chapter 561, F.S.A.; that a place of business where liquor is sold is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>nuisance <em>per se; </em>that plaintiff\u2019s bill failed to state facts sufficient to authorize him to bring a suit for injunction against the petitioners-def endants; and that the bill is without equity; and that the Chancellor was in error in denying the motion to dismiss the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Certiorari is granted and the order denying said motion to dismiss is quashed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b587-6\">TERRELL, BUFORD and ADAMS, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
