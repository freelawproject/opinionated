These vacancies necessarily exist in \u201cCounty Board Member Residence Districts\u201d numbers 4 and 5 respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">Under the provisions of sub-paragraph (2) of amended Section 230.09, Florida Statutes, the term of the member of the Board elected in 1948 for District No. 4 will be for four years and the term of the member elected for District No. 5 will be for two years. The vacancy, however, only ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>plies to the period existing between now and first Tuesday after the first Monday in January, 1949, and, therefore, your appointment and commission in each instance should be from the date of appointment to extend to the first Tuesday after the first Monday in January after the date of the next general election, which would be the first Tuesday after the first Monday in January, 1949. _ , \u201e</p>\n<p id=\"A2j\">_ , Respectfully yours,</p>\n<judges id=\"b500-5\">Elwyn Thomas Chief Justice</judges>\n<judges id=\"b500-6\">Glenn Terrell</judges>\n<judges id=\"b500-7\">Rivers Buford</judges>\n<judges id=\"b500-8\">Roy H.
