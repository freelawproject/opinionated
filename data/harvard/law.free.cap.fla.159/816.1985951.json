It is shown that convictions of two of the felonies occurred on the same day, viz: October 28th 1931. Therefore, one only of these two convictions could be counted in arriving at the number of convictions which had been had of the petitioner. See Joyner v. State,......Fla......., 30 So. (2nd) 304. So the petitioner at the time of the conviction under which he is now serving was not amenable to the charge of having been four times theretofore convicted of felonies. However, the record does show that he had twice theretofore been convicted of felonies and was amenable to punishment within the purview of Sec. 775.09 Fla. Statutes 1941, (same F.S.A.).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Therefore, we do not discharge the petitioner but, under the provisions of Sec. 924.34 Fla.
