It may be observed also that what purports to be an order allowing an appeal to this court, does not appear to have been made by the court below in term time. The case was tried on August 19th, and the memorandum concerning the judgment, which is hardly a judgment in form, seems to have been made on the same day. Afterward, on August 23d, an appeal was allowed. The record is fatally defective in not showing that the appeal was granted on one of the days of a term of the County Court.</p> <p id=\"b254-5\" pgmap=\"254\">The appeal is dismissed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
