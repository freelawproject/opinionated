On March 14th following, Tompkins sued appellants before a justice of the peace, for a balance alleged to be due him. On March 16th, appellants tendered him $51.36, being $41.86 for the balance, admitted by them to be due, and $9.50 for the costs which had been made up to the time of the tender. The justice of the peace rendered judgment in favor of Tompkins for $31.36, and ordered that appellants pay $9.50 of the costs, and that appellee pay the remainder. From this judgment Tompkins took an appeal to the Circuit Court, where the case was tried without a jury, and a judgment was rendered against appellants for $51.36 and costs of suit.</p> <p id=\"b321-4\" pgmap=\"321\">Appellants, having brought the case to this court for review, now urge a reversal of the judgment on the ground that their tender was sufficient, and that it was error for the Circuit Court to reader &amp; judgment against them for costs. This conclusion necessarily follows, if the premises on which it is based are sustained by the evidence. Where the court, in trying a case without a jury, hears evidence subject to objections, an exception to the ruling must fee preserved in some appropriate manner before this court can be called upon to review the decision. The People, for use, etc., v. McCoy, 132 Ill. 138. Ho exception was taken by appellants to any material ruling of the court, either in admitting evidence or in hearing the same subject to objections. Ho propositions of law were presented for the purpose of obtaining an expression of the views of the law entertained by the court. Eothing remains for us to do, therefore, but to inquire into the sufficiency of the evidence to support the finding and judgment.</p> <p id=\"b321-5\" pgmap=\"321(133) 322(343)\">What amount of timber was cut by appellants on the lands described in the lease l This is the only controverted question of fact in the case. The evidence on the part of appellants fixes the amount at 64,262 feet. Is there any evidence in the record on the part of Tompkins which tends to show a greater quantity so as to raise a conflict of the evidence on this question ? We have searched the record diligently and have found none. Samuel Palfreyman, railroad agent at Arrington station, whence the lumber was skipped, is the only witness who testified for appellee on the question, and at no point in his testimony did he undertake to make even an approximate estimate of the amount of lumber shipped. He presented a memorandum consisting of items taken from the railroad hooks, showing the number of car loads of lumber and the total weight thereof, but the memorandum itself was not admitted in evidence, and therefore could not have been considered by the court. It is true that appellee\u2019s additional abstract shows that while the court in the first instance refused to admit the memorandum in evidence, further examination of the witness and maturer consideration of the question resulted in a different ruling. The reverse of this is true. The record should not he read from right to left, like a Hebrew manuscript. As is shown by page 22 of the record, the witness, Palfreyman, said, \u201c I think this memorandum is taken from the books of the company, that is, the railroad company.\u201d Thereupon, appellants objected to the slip of paper,\u201d and the \u201c objection was overruled.\u201d But at the close of the examination of this witness, as appears from page 24 of the record, appellee offered the memorandum in evidence and appellants objected and the objection was sustained. There is nothing in the record which shows that this ruling was afterward reconsidered or modified. Appellee does not even call in question the correctness of the ruling by an assignment of cross-errors, which his exceptions duly preserved in the record would have enabled him to do. And so it appears that there is no evidence in the record which contradicts the evidence on the part of appellants as to the number of feet of timber cut by them on appellee\u2019s land. \"When the account is stated on this basis, the balance due appellee at the time of the tender was $32.33. But the amount tendered was $51.36. Under the admission of the parties the tender was \u201ckept good,\u201d and the costs sit tire time of the tender amounted to but $9.50. Thus it appears that the tender was sufficient, and that the judgment against appellants for $51.36, and for costs, was erroneous. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
