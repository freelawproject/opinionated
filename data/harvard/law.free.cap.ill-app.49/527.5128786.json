This was called theft bote, or compounding a felony. It made a man an accessory. 4 Blackstone\u2019s Com. 133.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-12\" pgmap=\"523(21) 524(32)\">Compounding a felony is the act of a party immediately aggrieved, who agrees with the thief, or other felon, that he will not prosecute him. on condition that he return to him the stolen goods, or who takes a reward not to prosecute.

It is contrary to public policy. The money for which the note was given may be actually due the payee, but.if the consideration for .the note is even in part, the abandonment or prevention of criminal proceedings, the instrument is illegal and void.

In fact, the only consideration of the note was the compounding of a felony. It is true, there were counter affidavits filed, showing that the consideration of the note was as security for David, the son of appellant Siliana, to secure his note, to which the forged names were attached.</p> <p id=\"b525-6\" pgmap=\"525\">But the court could not try such issue on affidavits. If the affidavit of the appellant showed a prima facie case of-a good defense, as here, it was the duty of the court to open up the judgment and allow such defense to be made, and the issue to be tried by a jury.</p> <p id=\"b525-7\" pgmap=\"525(104) 526(71)\">It is insisted that the affidavits failed to show a good defense, or that the consideration of the note was the compounding of a felony. But we think it does. It shows a state of facts, if true, that would void the note. Haltham v. Kuntz, 17 Brad. 434. This case is not like and is distinguished from, the one of Ford et al. v. Crotty, 52 Ill. 315. Here, as in the case of Haltham v. Kuntz, supra, the appellants were not the makers of the forged note. As said in the last cited case, the indebtedness of the principal in. the forged note \u201c would be a sufficient consideration to support a promise, in writing, by appellants to appellee, to pay tbe debt/ and in absence of proof to the contrary, the presumption would be that snob indebtedness was the real consideration for the promise; but here all parties agree that the promise was in consideration that the plaintiff would not \u201c prosecute the criminal charge against H. R. Bhmtz.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b526-5\" pgmap=\"526\">In the case at bar, the affidavit of appellants shows that the consideration for their signatui\u2019es- to the note in question was the agreement not to prosecute David Saindore for his crime of forgery, who was the son of the appellant Siliana by her former husband.</p> <p id=\"b526-6\" pgmap=\"526\">The court erred in not granting the motion and in not opening np the judgment and allowing the defense. The judgment of the court below is therefore reversed and the cause remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
