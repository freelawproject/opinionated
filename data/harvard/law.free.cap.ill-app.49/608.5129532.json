The clerk of the court has copied into the transcript of the record affidavits of appellant and his attorney, stating that the proceedings on November 25th Avere in violation of an agreement made by appellee; that appellant\u2019s attorney was sick and unable to attend on that \u00ablate, and that appellant could not reach the court house on account of the electric cars being stopped by bad weather; and also an affidavit of John II. Mueller, that he telephoned the fact of the attorney\u2019s illness to the clerk of the court. These affidavits were improperly copied into the transcript. Roberts v. Falls, 36 Ill. 268. If appellant intended to have the affidavits made a part of the record, he should have preserved them in the bill of exceptions. That is the only method by which it could be done. Phillips v. People, 88 Ill. 160; C. &amp; St. L. R. R. Co. v. Easterly, 89 Ill. 156; Earll v. People, 73 Ill. 329.</p> <p id=\"b605-5\" pgmap=\"605\">The affidavits copied into the transcript can have no influence in determining the case, and no reason appearing in the record why the action of the court was not right, the judgment will be affirmed. .</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
