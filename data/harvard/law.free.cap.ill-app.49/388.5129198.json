A distinction is made between an agreement to refer every matter in dispute to arbitration and one to pay such a sum as the damage shall be found by a third party to amount to, which latter operates to reduce the policy from a contract to pay the amount of damage absolutely, and to substitute the arbitrator for the jury to ascertain its amount.\u201d May on Insurance, Sec. 493.

The policy contained the following provisions s</summary><summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-7\" pgmap=\"389\">\u201c This company shall not be liable beyond the actual cash value of the property at the time any loss or damage occurs, and the loss or damage shall be ascertained or estimated according to such actual cash value with proper deduction for depreciation, however caused, and shall in no event exceed what it would then cost the insured to repair or replace the same with material of like kind and quality; such ascertainment or estimate shall be made by the insured and this company, or if they differ, then by appraisers as hereinafter provided. * * *</summary><summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b389-8\" pgmap=\"389(139) 390(79)\">In the event of a disagreement as to the amount of loss, the same shall, as above provided, be ascertained by two competent and disinterested appraisers, the insured and this company each selecting one, and the two so chosen shall first select a competent and disinterested umpire; the appraisers together shall then estimate and appraise the loss, stating separately sound value and damage, and failing to agree, shall submit their difference to the umpire, and the award in writing of any two shall determine the amount of such loss. * * * This company shall not be held to have waived any provision or condition of this policy or any forfeiture thereof, by any requirement, act or proceeding on its part, relating to the appraisal or any examination herein provided for; and the loss shall not become payable until sixty days after notice, ascertainment, estimate, and satisfactory proof of the loss herein required have been received by this company,- including an award by appraisers where appraisal has been required. * * * ISTo suit or action on this policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity until after full compliance by the insured with all the foregoing requirements nor unless commenced within twelve months after the fire.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\" pgmap=\"390\">The property was entirely consumed by fire on the 8th of February, 1892. Appellee at once notified the company\u2019s general agent and adjuster at Chicago, Mr. Hugh Martin, who visited the ruins, and with appellee endeavored to make an estimate of the loss. Considerable time was consumed by the parties in trying to effect a settlement, but they were unable to agree. Appellee then made proofs of loss and demanded the appointment of appraisers under the terms of the policy.</summary><summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\" pgmap=\"390\">On the 10th of June, 1892, appellant appointed one John H. Doulin, of Chicago, appraiser in its behalf and notified appellee. Appellee selected one, Smith Hoag, of Elgin, appraiser in his behalf. The appraisers, without first selecting an umpire, as the policy provided, visited the ground and began an estimate of cost of material and construction, They differed widely, and after a few days Doulin returned to Chicago without agreeing upon an estimate. After it became evident that the appraisers could not agree, the appointment of an umpire was discussed, but none was elected, for the reason that they would not agree upon the locality from which he should be selected.</summary><summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-7\" pgmap=\"390(89) 391(42)\">On the 10th of August, 1892, appellee brought suit upon the policy. In addition to other pleas, the company pleaded specially the inability of the parties to agree, the appointment of appraisers, and that the appraisal was still pending and undetermined. Appellee replied that the company had refused without good a,nd sufficient cause to complete the appraisal, and that none was pending. The case was tried by the court without a jury. The court found the issue for appellee, and returned judgment in his favor and against the company for $910.71. The company appealed, and now asks a reversal because of improper rulings upon questions of evidence, refusal to hold propositions of law asked, that the verdict is contrary to the law and evidence, and that the verdict is excessive.</summary> <opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <p id=\"b391-5\" pgmap=\"391\">Opinion of toe Court,</p> <author id=\"A4T\" pgmap=\"391\">Harker, P. J.</author> <p id=\"b391-6\" pgmap=\"391\">The main question involved in this controversy, is the one raised by the special pleas, that the action was commenced before the appraisal undertaken by appraisers appointed \u25a0was completed, and while such appraisal was pending, and the special replication that the completion of the appraisal was defeated by the delay and unfair action of the company and its refusal without sufficient cause to complete the same.</p> <p id=\"b391-7\" pgmap=\"391\">The appraisal clause in the contract of insurance provided that in the event of a disagreement as to the amount of loss between the insured and the insurer, the loss should be ascertained by two disinterested appraisers, the insured and the company each selecting one, who were to first select an umpire, with power to decide any difference between them. Another clause provided that no loss should become payable until sixty days after the making of the appraisers\u2019 award where an appraisal had been required. That such provisions are legal, and that a compliance therewith is a condition precedent to the bringing of suit, is held by a long and unbroken line of decisions in this country.

Co., 70 Cal. 198; Reed v. Washington Ins. Co., 138 Mich. 572; Wolf v. Liverpool &amp; L. G. Ins. Co., 50 N. J. 453; Davenport v. Ins. Co., 10 Daly 355.</p> <p id=\"b391-8\" pgmap=\"391(55) 392(19)\">We do not care to express any opinion as to the conduct of either appellee or the adjuster in their efforts to agree upon an estimate, a matter discussed with great freedom by counsel. \u25a0 It is sufficient to say they were unable to agree and that each selected an appraiser to make an estimate for them, and that the appraisers entered upon a discharge of the office to which they had been nominated.</p> <p id=\"b392-4\" pgmap=\"392\">As we view the case the only question of importance is, which of these appraisers is responsible for the suspension of their work and the failure to complete the appraisal ? When appointed they stood for the parties appointing them. Hoag for Bishop and Doulin for the company. If either improperly neglected his duty, the party appointing him was responsible for such neglect. If either insisted upon an unreasonable requirement which had the effect to defeat an appraisal his principal was responsible therefor. If either refused to go on with the work, or acted in such bad faith as to prevent the accomplishment of the appraisement within a reasonable time, the principal of the other appraiser was absolved from further compliance with that provision of the policy. In that case, it must be said, the proceedings for appraisal were not pending but had been abandoned.</p> <p id=\"b392-5\" pgmap=\"392\">It is, perhaps, unfortunate that Doulin and Hoag did not at the outset select an umpire. They labored for two days trying to make an estimate without, but were so widely apart on the different items of construction that no agreement was reached. Doulin then returned to his home, insisting that it would be necessary to call in a third man. Instead of returning to Elgin and making further effort toward an appraisement, he wrote to Hoag in a few days proposing payment of a certain sum for the loss, which Hoag declined as unreasonable and unjust. Hoag wrote asking him to return, expressing the opinion that they could, after going through the entire estimate, reach an agreement.</p> <p id=\"b392-6\" pgmap=\"392(92) 393(134)\">An umpire was not selected then because Hoag urged the appointment of a man from Elgin, or the county in which the ice-house was located, while Doulin urged the appointment of a man from Chicago, Bloomington, or elsewhere out of the county. Hoag objected to the men proposed by Doulin, because they were from a distance and he knew nothing of their fitness for the place. Doulin objected to the men proposed by Hoag, as they were local builders and Hoag knew them. One of them lived at Aurora, one at Elgin, one at Dundee and others at Elgin. We see nothing unreasonable in the contention of Hoag, that the umpire should be selected from Elgin or elsewhere in the county. It does not appear that either of the individuals proposed by him was an unfair man, or one over whom either he or Bishop had any undue influence. Indeed, it seems to us that a capable, honest and disinterested man residing in the county where the loss occurred, would, by reason of his acquaintance with the value of labor and material there, be preferable to one selected from a distance. Doulin made no objection to any man proposed by Hoag because of incompetency or unfairness. Under the circumstances, it would be unjust to allow the technical defense interposed to prevail.</p> <p id=\"b393-5\" pgmap=\"393\">We prefer, instead, to hold that the proceedings for appraisal were abandoned and that the abandonment was attributable to the conduct of appellant\u2019s appraiser.</p> <p id=\"b393-6\" pgmap=\"393\">The above views dispose of the contention that the court erred in overruling the motion made at the close of plaintiff\u2019s testimony to find in favor of the defendant.</p> <p id=\"b393-7\" pgmap=\"393\">We attach but little importance to the contention that the court admitted improper evidence for the plaintiff and excluded proper evidence offered by the defendant. The case was tried by the court, who, as is usually the case, received, matters offered in proof more freely than he would have done had the case been tried by a jury; but it does not appear that the defendant was prejudiced thereby. The price list of lumber offered was properly refused.</p> <p id=\"b393-8\" pgmap=\"393\">A careful examination of the evidence satisfies us that the damages allowed by the court were not excessive.</p> <p id=\"b393-9\" pgmap=\"393\">We do not care to enter upon a discussion of the propositions of law submitted and refused. Our views upon some of them sufficiently appear in the discussion of the main point of contention above set forth. Some of them were proper and could have been' given, but we are so clearly of the opinion that substantial justice has been done by the finding and judgment of the Circuit Court that we shall not reverse because propositions were refused that should have been given. Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
