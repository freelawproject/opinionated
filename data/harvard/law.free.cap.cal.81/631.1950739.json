A note payable on demand and \u201cafter date\u201d is a demand note on which suit may be brought immediately. <em>(Hitchings </em>v. <em>Edmands, </em>132 Mass. 338; <em>Fenno </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>146 Mass. 118.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b662-10\">Works, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbS\">Action on the following promissory note:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-11\">\u201c $12,000.

The action was commenced more than nine years after the date of the note. The only question in the case is as to the time when the note matured and the statute commenced to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-15\">The court below held that the action was barred, and rendered judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>The appellant concedes that if this is a note payable \u201con demand,\u201d the same matured immediately, and the statute had run. But it is contended that as the note was made payable \u201con demand <em>after date,\" </em>it could not have matured at once, and that therefore an actual demand was necessary to put the statute in motion. The general rule is, that a note payable on demand is due immediately, without an actual demand, and that the statute commences to run at once. <em>(Brummagim </em>v. <em>Tallant, </em>29 Cal. 506; 89 Am. Dec. 176; <em>Cousins </em>v. <em>Partridge, </em>79 Cal. 228; Story on Promissory Notes, sec. 29; Angel\u00ed on Limitations, sec. 59; Wood on Limitations, sec. 124.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The language used in the note under consideration does not take it out of this rule. In <em>Hitchings </em>v. <em>Edmands, </em>132 Mass. 338, the court said: \u201cThe words \u2018on demand after date\u2019 are more analogous to such an expression as \u2018with interest after date.\u2019 If a promissory note, payable on demand, with interest after date, is paid the next day after it is given, one day\u2019s interest is due and payable. In the case at bar the intention of the parties to the note was apparently that it should be-payable immediately, and no intention appears on the face of the note that the parties intended to stipulate for at least one day\u2019s time before the demand could be made.\u201d So it was held that the note was an \u201c ordinary demand note, payable at once on demand, on which an action could have been brought immediately after it was given.\u201d <em>(Fenno </em>v. <em>Gay, </em>146 Mass. 118.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">These views apply to the note we are considering, and meet with our approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">Patebson, J., and Fox, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
