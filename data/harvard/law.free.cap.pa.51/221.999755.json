J.) made this order: \u201c Rule made absolute, and <em>mandamus </em>decreed for the unpaid balance of orders attached to report;\u201d and the respondent removed the case to the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-13\"><em>Jenlcs, </em>for plaintiff in <em>error.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvV\">Mandamus is to be resorted to only when there is no remedy in the usual course of law: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Commissioners of Allegheny County, 16 S. &amp; R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>317; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Rosetter, 2 Binn. 362; Hester\u2019s Case, 2 W. &amp; S. 416; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Canal Commissioners, 2 Penna. R. 518 ; Drexel v. Mann, 6 W. &amp; S. 97.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-6\">The Act of April 15th 1834, \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 20, Purd. 211, provides for county treasurer\u2019s bond ; the Militia Act, April 21st 1858, \u00a7 3, Art. 6, applies it to military taxes ; and, by \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8, he-is to receive, pay out, &amp;c., moneys for military purposes: Purd. 719, pi. 16, 17, 18. If he refuse, one of the conditions of his bond is broken, and he could be sued.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-7\"><em>Mandamus </em>will not be granted to the county commissioners to draw an order on the treasury when there is no money in it: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Commissioners of Lancaster County, 6 Binn. 5. Act of April 8th 1862, Pamph. L. 314, appropriates the military fund to relief orders, which amounted to more than the fund.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-8\">The Militia Act, \u00a7 3, Art. 8, provides that no moneys shall be paid but upon orders of a board of officers, countersigned by the commandant of the brigade pr president of the board, and shall specify on its face the objects. All the orders fail in one or other of these requirements.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-9\">Reitz had no right to receive and disburse money; that is the duty of county treasurer, who gives bond.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b223-10\"><em>Gfordons, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALq\">Shannon\u2019s right to the orders is not denied in the replication. The orders appear to be properly signed, and Reitz was the treasurer of the company; the only object to be specified was that it was for military purposes, and that sufficiently appears. The evidence shows that the treasurer had enough money, for the relief fund had no longer an existence. The relator could have no action on the bond, because the treasurer gives a bond to the state and one to the county; which is to be sued on ? Supervisors can be compelled by <em>mandamus </em>to pay orders drawn upon them: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Johnson &amp; Felton, 2 Binn. 275. Where a ministerial act is to. be done, and there is no other specific remedy, a <em>mandamus </em>will lie : Griffith <em>v. </em>Cochran, 5 Binn. 103 ; Whar. Selwyn 1093, 1094. Citing also Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Mann, 5 W. &amp; S. 421, 422.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ADo\">January 15th 1866,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b223-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b223-12\">Thompson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akk\">The proceedings in this case were very irregular, ignoring altogether the Mandamus Act of 1836, and according almost as little with any practice in such cases anterior to the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">The relator filed a suggestion for a <em>mandamus </em>against the treasurer of Jefferson county, to compel him to pay. certain orders therein described, assumed to have been issued by certain military boards under the provisions of the Act of 21st April 1858. To this suggestion the treasurer answered \u2014 without any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>rule that we discover, except as it may be inferred from the language in the final decree \u2014 that he had no funds; that previously to the demand the military fund had been paid away on orders of the board of relief, pursuant to the Act of 8th April 1862, and that the orders were neither properly authenticated nor did they specify the objects for which they were drawn, as required by the 8th article of the 3d section of the Act of 1858.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">There was neither replication nor demurrer to this, although an issue of fact was obviously involved in it, but the court appointed an auditor to report the facts. This he did not do, but returned the testimony; thereupon the court entered on the record, \u201c Rule made absolute; <em>mandamus </em>decreed for the unpaid balance of orders attached to the report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">The Act of Assembly very plainly points the course to be pursued when a proper suggestion is filed. If it contain the substance of a case for a <em>mandamus, </em>the course is to issue an alternative writ, commanding the defendant to perform the act required, or return his reason for not doing it. Before this writ, the act provides that the court shall allow the persons suing or defending <em>\u201c </em>such convenient time to make return, plead, reply, rejoin or demur as shall be just and reasonable.\u201d If, after issue and trial, the return be adjudged insufficient, then a peremptory <em>mandamus </em>issues to compel the performance of the duty required. The act contemplates regular issues of fact and law, as in other cases: 8 Casey 218 ; 1 Wright 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">All this was neglected here ; and to the allegations of fact in the treasurer\u2019s return or answer to the suggestion, that there were no funds, there was neither a traverse nor demurrer tendered. If the fact be insisted on, as it is, the court had no power, either by themselves or their auditor, to dispose of it, unless by the consent or agreement of the parties on record; and, until disposed of in some regular way, no decree could be made against the treasurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The answer that the orders were not drawn as required by the act seems fully sustained, but it was overruled, under what plea does not appear. \u201cNo money,\u201d says the act, \u201c shall be paid from said fund by the county or city treasurer but upon orders of a board of officers, as provided in this act, countersigned by the commandant of the brigade or president of said board, and which order shall specify on its face the object for which said money was paid,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The first of these three orders was drawn payable to Peter Eike, and does state the services on account of which it was drawn, but was not countersigned by the president of the board or the commandant of the brigade. The second was in favour of one Reitz, is signed by the president, hut not by the board of officers, as required; and the third is signed in the same way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>as tbe second, and is deficient in not stating tbe services for which it was drawn. They are all fatally deficient in execution, and did not present the legal right which it is necessary for the relator to show in order to entitle him to the remedy he sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Had these orders been sufficient on their face, and the fact been established in an orderly way that there was money in the treasury applicable to them, we think the remedy by <em>mandamus </em>would have been proper; but, both in substance and in form, the proceedings and judgment were all wrong, and the judgment, is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
