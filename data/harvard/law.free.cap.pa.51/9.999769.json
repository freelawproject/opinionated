The act authorized and required the school directors to borrow such sums of money as would \u201c fully reimburse the Halifax Bounty Association for moneys advanced to free said township,\u201d &amp;c., and then authorized the school directors to levy and collect a tax to repay the sums borrowed, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-5\">The appellants filed the bill in this case, and after answer, replication, and argument, Pearson, P. J., delivered the following opinion and dismissed the bill:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b12-6\">\u201c The bill, answer and exhibits in this case, present substantially the following facts: When the President of the United States made his call for 700,000 men a society was formed,-called \u2018 The Bounty Association of Halifax Township,\u2019 the object of which was to raise money to free the members thereof from the draft, and <em>incidentally </em>to relieve the township; but it appears to have been part of the articles of association that, if any considerable number of those within the township, who were subject to the performance of military duty, should decline to subscribe the sum agreed on, the effort should not be made to free the township generally, but the fund raised should be applied to pay the commutation of $300 fixed by the Act of Congress. The association also raised a considerable amount, by subscription, from citizens not subject to military duty. Many volunteers were obtained, to whom bounty was paid. Eventually a sufficient number had not been put in, according to the computation made by the provost-marshal., and a few were drafted. They were relieved by the society paying -the commutation fixed by law. A second call was made by the President for 500,000 more soldiehs, and the number to be supplied by Halifax township was again fixed by the United States officers, and all raised according to the computation, by paying large bounties to volunteers. This was not finally effected until the 7th day of September 1864. Subsequently, on the 26th day of the same month, a new estimate was made by the government officers, and it was ascertained that this township had put into the service thirteen more men than filled its quota. The first announcement intimating a. liability on the part of Halifax township at large to repay the money advanced by the association was at the meeting on the 21st of July 1864, and the first clear and unequivocal resolution, declaring that it should be a debt of the township, was on the 28th day of the same month. Very much of the money now asked to be refunded had been expended by -the Bounty Association before that time. On the 25th day of August following, the act was passed which mainly gives rise to the present controversy. By that act the school directors of Halifax township are authorized and required to borrow so much money as will fully reimburse the Halifax Bounty Association <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the money advanced to free the said township from the draft of 700,000 men; also, such sum as will- be required to free said township from the present call for 500,000 men; and, in order to repay the money, they are authorized to levy and.collect a tax, or taxes, for the full amount, with interest, during the same year, or run the loan and collection through a period not exceeding five years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-6\">Many exceptions have been taken by the complainants to the validity of .this Act of Assembly, and to the action of the board of school directors under it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-7\">1st. It is said to have been obtained by fraud and false representations. That no such bounty association existed as is recited in the act. It was not formed to free the township of Halifax from the draft, but to free the members of the association; and the money was not intended to be advanced for the township, but was a free.gift of those contributing the fund. The sum of $800 is recited in the act to have been thus furnished, and some $8000 are now claimed under its provisions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-8\">2d. The law is unconstitutional \u2014 violates the seventh section of the eleventh article of the amendments of 1857, and also the general provisions of the constitution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-9\">3d. It is proposed to levy and collect a tax to pay for thirteen volunteers furnished, more than the full quota of the township, which is unjust, and not authorized by the Act of Assembly;</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-10\">4th. The tax assessed and proposed to be collected is illegal, as it imposes five and one-half cents on the dollar of the whole valuation of taxable property in the township, as well belonging to those exempt from the draft as of those subject to it; and,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-11\">5th. The law is void, and cannot be carried into effect, as it neither points out the property to be taxed, nor the method of'assessing and collecting it when imposed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-12\">The evidence of fraud relied on in the present case is to be found in the preamble to the Act of Assembly, which recites, <em>\u201c </em>that certain citizens of Halifax township had associated together under the title of \u2018 The Halifax Bounty Association,\u2019 for the purpose of freeing said township from the draft,\u201d and had advanced the sum of eight hundred dollars to fill the quota of said township ; and the enacting part of the law states the same in substance ; whilst the evidence exhibited in the articles of association proves that the object of the parties was to free <em>themselves </em>from the draft. Is this such a fraud as would vitiate the law, and require the court to declare it void, or of no binding effect ? Or is such a recital sufficient evidence, <em>fer </em>se, of a fraud practised upon the legislature ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-13\">It has been seriously questioned, in many courts, whether the 'judiciary possessed the power to declare an Act of Assembly void on the ground that it was obtained by fraud, and the power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>is expressly denied by the Chancellor of South Carolina, in the case of public acts. See 1 Nott &amp; McCord 400, in note. It is also questioned, and perhaps denied, except as to private acts, then only in a clear case in 10 Conn. Ri 588-40, <em>et seq. </em>It is said in 2 Black. Com. 346, that a private act \u201c may be relieved against when obtained on false suggestions,\u201d whilst the same learned writer appears to deny it as to public acts (see vol. 1, pp. 91,161) ; whilst his commentator, Mr. Christian, in his note, in terms declares that there is no power in the courts to disregard an Act of Parliament, although contrary to reason, and natural right and justice. I have little doubt as to the law under consideration being in the nature of a private act, although it affects all the people of a township, and enforces what may be considered a public duty. But what evidence has this court that the legislature has been imposed upon by a false representation ? The honesty and fairness of obtaining the law is sworn to in the answer, and all false representations denied. No petitions are produced on the hearing showing that any false statements whatever were made. It is not proved that any were made orally to any member of the legislative body. It is declared by the Supreme Court of Connecticut, in The Derby Turnpike Company <em>v. </em>Parks, 10 Conn. 540, \u201c fraud is not to be presumed ; and when this court is called upon in this collateral manner to declare void an Act of the General Assembly, upon the ground that it was fraudulently obtained, this fact should be <em>clearly proved \u201d </em>Prom aught that has been, shown, this recital in the preamble may be the language of the legislative body itself, not suggested by any member of the Halifax Bounty Association, or other person having an interest in th\u00e9 repayment of the money advanced. We are not satisfied from the whole case that this law was obtained by fraud, or the legislative mind deceived or misled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-3\">Is the averment false in any material or essential point, from which we can infer that the legislature was deceived ? It is stated in the preamble that this association was formed to free the township from the draft. The answer shows that it was composed of one hundred and sixty-one citizens of Halifax township, nearly all of whom were subject to the draft, and this must constitute almost the entire population of the toAvnship- coming Avithin that description. Suppose that there were ten or even twenty citizens outside of the association who Avere subject to military duty, was not the <em>substantial object </em>to free the township from the draft ? If all the military men are freed, the township is discharged. But it is'averred in the bill that there Avas no such association. The answer and documents produced prove that such an association existed in <em>substance, </em>and Avas so generally called, whilst the true designation was \u201c The'Bounty Association of Halifax Township.\u201d It was not an incorporated society, but Avas self-formed and self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>christened ; and a mistake in reciting the name in the statute will not vitiate the law, or prevent those who actually advanced the money from recovering it back, with the same efficacy as if designated hy the right name, provided we are satisfied that this was the society intended, and that there was none other in the township formed for any similar purpose. It has been held that no mere misnomer in the name of a person or corporation mentioned in an Act of Congress is fatal to its validity, if the person or corporation really intended can be collected from the terms of the statute : 3 Sumner 279. There can be no possible doubt but this was the society intended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-6\">It is said that this money was not <em>advanced, </em>but was a free gift. It is very true that the term <em>\u201c </em>advanced,\u201d as here used, carries with it an implication that those furnishing the money expected to have it refunded, whilst there is nothing in the original proceedings of this society which proves that such was the expectation, until after a large portion of the money had been paid in bounties, yet such may have been the hopes of those giving the fund, and if the legislature chose to authorize its repayment by the citizens of the township, and the township authorities accepted of that grant of power, we are unable to see why they should be restrained in their action by a court of equity. The tax-payers of the township have, to a great extent, had the benefit of that <em>advance, </em>and could, under the Act of the 25th of March 1864 \u2014 a law passed soon after this society was formed, and before its money was raised \u2014 have been obliged, by the imposition of taxes, to have paid the whole bounty-money. The fund furnished by the society really went in relief of the township to that extent. We shall advert to some other matters connected with this objection when examining the constitutionality of the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b15-7\">The preamble of this act recites that eight hundred dollars was expended by the society, and about eight thousand dollars is now claimed under the enacting clause, which requires the school directors to refund all the money expended by it in putting volunteers into the service to free the township from the draft. The answer of the respondents avers that there is a mistake in the preamble, that eight thousand dollars were claimed, and the bill was so prepared and passed both branches of the legislature, but a mistake was made by the clerk in transcribing. From the production of the original bill, as prepared by the member from-this county, it is very clear that a mistake was committed. If this were in the enacting clause the respondents would be without remedy; they would have to take the law as they found it on the statute book; but, fortunately for their position, the preamble of a statute is no part of it for purposes of this kind. It may be used to show the <em>motive </em>of the legislature and general <em>intent </em>in passing the law, but the enacting clause often goes beyond it, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>will control: Dwarris on the Stat. 503-4; also, 659 to 664. It rarely shows the full meaning of the legislature: Dwarris 504, 506-7. Can sometimes be called in aid where the construction is doubtful: Sedgwick 54, 55. But often has little weight, and none whatever against the plain expressions of the enacting clause: 1 Pick. 248.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-4\">It often misstates, or does not fully state, the whole object of the legislature: 7 Gill. &amp; John. 274-5.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-5\">It is no part of the law, and not binding: 3 Scammon 465, 4 S. &amp; R. 166, and other cases in this state to the same effect. As the law enacted covers this whole claim, it must control the preamble, and not be controlled by it. A court of equity would scarcely interfere to enforce a plain mistake ; it is rather its province to guard against it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-6\">2. Is this law constitutional ? Where no debt or duty is owing by a city, borough; or township to an individual or company, we think it transcends the power of the legislature to compel it to make payment. It might as well attempt to enforce .an individual to pay money to another where nothing was due, or take one man\u2019s property for the benefit of another. If a legal right exists the legislature may afford a remedy, or if the one party owes a moral duty <em>possibly </em>it may be enforced by a special law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aj\">The citizens of Halifax township owed military service to the United States, and the board of school directors, under the general law, was authorized to offer bounties to induce volunteers to enter the army and perform that service, and to assess a tax on the property of the township to pay those bounties. This association, came forward and paid the money and procured the soldiers. It was a voluntary payment, which could not be recovered, but the legislature gave a remedy by requiring the school directors, as representatives of the township, to refund the money and charge it on the general property. I am well satisfied that the legislature could not <em>require it; </em>that it transcended their power. But if the corporate authorities of the township choose to accept the loan and perform the duty, I know of no power in the citizens or the court to restrain them. The school board is, for this purpose, made the representative of the township, both by the general law on the subject of bounties and -the special act relating to this township ; and although created and elected for a different object, yet they, as well as any other corporate body, or set of township officers, may be designated to represent the municipality in this particular. When so appointed by law, the powers under the statute accepted and the tax laid, we cannot restrain its collection or prevent the money from being paid over according to the provisions of the Act of Assembly. There are very many matters to be found in the various bounty laws which transcend the power' of the legislature, such as those requiring bounties to be paid to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>men who had previously voluntarily entered the service without any contract to receive compensation, or had agreed to take a much less sum from the township than was afterwards fixed by law; yet if the township officers choose to accept the conditions, and resolve to make payment .as provided by the statute, we cannot restrain their action. . It may be an abuse of their discretion, but the law has conferred the right to judge on them, and not on the courts. ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-6\">A greater douht arises on the wording of the seventh section of the eleventh article of the constitution of this state, which, after declaring that the legislature shall not authorize any county, township, &amp;e., by virtue of a vote of its citizens, or otherwise, to become a stockholder in any company, association, &amp;c., says: \u2014 \u25a0 \u201c Or to obtain money from, or loan its credit to, any corporation, association, institution, or party.\u201d If this were clearly a debt due' by the township, as such, it most certainly would not-come within the inhibition of the constitution. It never was the intention of the people in framing that instrument to prohibit a municipality from -paying its honest debts or performing its moral or legal duties. It is denied that this was a debt or moral duty of the township. It was no <em>debt, </em>in legal acceptation, so far as concerns this bounty association; but if the money was advanced in\" relief of the township, which could have been lawfully collected off the property of the citizens, and this association voluntarily paid it, from selfish motives we may assume, would there not be a moral obligation on the part of the , citizens to refund ? If such is the case, it can in no sense be said that the law has authorized the township \u201c to <em>obtain money </em>for an association or party.\u201d In construing, these words we must-look at the evil which it was designed to guard against. Those municipalities had lent their credit to various railroad companies and other corporations to such an extent as seriously to burden and impair the value of the property situated within them. The state had also suffered in its own treasury from the same course of proceeding, and1 it was resolved that the evil should not again recur; and hence such laws were prohibited by these amendments to the constitution. This case does not come within the spirit or intention of the prohibition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-7\">3. It is proposed to pay, by a tax on the citizens, for thirteen volunteer soldiers put into the service more than was required for the full quota of Halifax township. This is to be regretted ; but it arose from a mistake, not of the township officers or the bounty association, but of those intrusted with the performance of the duties \u25a0 by the United States. It appears that several changes occurred, from time to time, as to the number of men required from this township. Every effort was made by the citizens to have the number reduced or the errors corrected. It was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>done, and a draft was apparently inevitable. The volunteers were then procured, and the bounty paid. Every man was put into the service and received his bounty by the 7th of September, and the error was not corrected until the 26th day of that month. When discovered the men could not be recalled, nor could the bounty be restored. It is one of those cases where the present respondents were in no default. The Act of Assembly, requiring the money to be refunded, or paid out in bounties, was passed on the 25th of August, and all then due was required to be paid to the association, and the draft about to be made provided against. Under such circumstances we are not prepared to say that the tax is illegal. If a loss is to be borne it is more fair to throw it on the township at large than upon individuals, or officers who are in no default. If the people are obliged to pay some additional tax on account of this error, they will\u2019 at least have the consolation of knowing that the men they procured are in the service of the country, and also that, in case of another draft, which now appears imminent, they will be entitled to a credit of thirteen men in the beginning.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A9\">4. This tax is said to be illegal from its excess. By the general law but two per centum per annum can be imposed on the property of the citizen to meet these payments of bounty; but this law, in terms, authorizes the school directors to borrow the money on five years\u2019 credit, and lay a tax to meet it.; or they \u201c may proceed <em>at once </em>to assess and collect the <em>full amount </em>of money required\u201d \u2014 such is the letter of the statute. It is left to the discretion of the school board, and although we may consider it an abuse of that discretion, and an impolitic and unjust, course towards the tax-payer, yet we have no control, and cannot forbid these gentlemen from pursuing and carrying out the law of the land. Eor aught we know, a large majority of the citizens may desire that course to be pursued, and prefer meeting the burden at once.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b18-6\">5. It is contended that this special act' is so imperfect that it cannot be carried into effect \u2014 no system of levying and collecting taxes has been devised, nor is'the property pointed out on which it is to be assessed. It rarely happens, under our system of legislation, that any one law is perfect in itself. We are generally obliged to refer to others for the details, and sometimes to resort to common law forms and principles to carry the statute into effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AXf\">If money were ordered to be raised by taxation, for the use of a county, to effect some new object not contemplated by former laws, the commissioners, or other constituted authority, would resort to the \u2018law regulating assessments for county rates, and impose the taxes on similar property, and at like valuation, unless the statute directed otherwise. The same rule will apply to school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>directors. When they are ordered to raise money by taxation, and nothing further is stated, it * clearly -means by the ordinary system of taxation in the state \u2014 the same by which they raise other moneys for the use of the township. Statutes <em>in pari mate-rid </em>should be taken into consideration in construing a law (8 Howard IJ. S. ft. 556), and must frequently be resorted to in carrying it into effect. So far as this act directs a change it must be observed, as in the capitation tax. It must be conceded that this statute is very imperfect, .and evinces hasty and inconsiderate legislation, but yet it may be carried out without serious difficulty. We cannot help seeing the injustice of relieving widows from the capitation tax, apparently because they are not subject to military duty, and yet -leaving spinsters, owning property, to bear the burden. Other particulars might be pointed out, and the general policy of the law, and all others of like character, is very questionable. The propriety of repaying the money voluntarily advanced by this bounty association is not readily perceived; yet, if thought to be expedient by the legislature and the township officers, the court cannot call it in question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b19-5\">It is very possible that more money is attempted to be raised under this bill than has been advanced, or can be legally claimed, yet no error has been pointed out. If any is committed in assessing the property of a citizen, he can have redress by an appeal to the Quarter Sessions under the Act of Assembly; but it would be improper and illegal for this court to tie up the hands of the school directors by an injunction, unless for error clearly defined. None such is perceived he.re, and, therefore, the bill must be dismissed at the costs of the complainants.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b19-6\"><em>J. Q.

There is no evidence that there was a hope in those giving, that the money would be refunded. It was not the object to free the township.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-7\">The object was to be attained by <em>assessing </em>$30 on each member, and soliciting <em>contributions </em>from those not liable. \u2018Money so raised, cannot be said to be loaned or \u201c advanced.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-8\">It may be doubted that the legislature can require school directors to borrow money to free a township from an impending draft-; but certainly it cannot require them to borrow money to pay an existing debt of a bounty association.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-9\">The language of the act 'is imperative; the directors have no discretion. But if they had discretion, all the directors but one being members of the association, they have determined to borrow money to refund to themselves money which they had no thought of receiving back when they paid it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b19-10\">Before the passage of the law, the township owed them nothing ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the act creates a debt in their favour, and gives them power to enforce its payment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-5\">It is claimed that the act authorizes the payment for more men than wore needed to fill the quota. This act, providing a mode of taxation out of the course of the ordinary laws of taxation, is to be strictly construed: Bennett <em>v. </em>The Borough of Birmingham, 7 Casey 15-17; Goepp <em>v. </em>Borough of Bethlehem, 4 Id. 255.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-6\">The wisdom and expediency of the act are not open to discussion. The naked question is, does the statute contravene the fundamental law as contained in the constitution? Dartmouth College <em>v. </em>Woodward, 4 Wheat. 696 ; People <em>v. </em>Manhattan Company, 9 Wend. 351. To overthrow the presumption in favour of the constitutionalty of a law, it must appear and be shown to violate the constitution: Ex parte McOullem, 1 Cowen 564; Morris <em>v. </em>The People, 3 Denio 338; Erie <em>v. </em>N. E. R. R. Co., 2 Casey 303.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-7\">The Constitution (Art. XI., \u00a7 7) prohibits a township from obtaining money for or loaning \u201c its credit to any corporation, association, institution, or party.\u201d Statutes such as the present had, before this provision in the constitution, been declared constitutional : Sharpless <em>v. </em>The Mayor of Philadelphia, 9 Harris 147; Commonwealth <em>ex rel. </em>Thomas <em>v. </em>Commissioners of Allegheny County, 8 Casey 218.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-8\">The evil of such laws became serious, and the constitution was amended by Article XI. This law is in the teeth of this explicit provision. The money was voluntarily advanced to escape a personal service, with no hope of repayment. It was no debt upon the township, and differs nothing from a subscription to a railroad company; one would be to a corporation, the other to a voluntary association. The act attempted to create a debt against the township, which would be a judicial act, decreeing a liability when none had been incurred. It was therefore unconstitutional: Mengel <em>v. </em>Dentler, 9 Casey 495 ; Sharpless <em>v. </em>Mayor of Philadeljohia, 9 Harris 169; Philadelphia Association <em>v. </em>Wood, 3 Wright 82 ; Soens <em>v. </em>City of Racine, 10 Wis. 279.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ABy\"><em>D.

Legislation of the same kind was had by numerous special laws. The action of the people at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>home, as well as of their representatives, shows that paying bounties was considered a duty which property-holders owed then to thetr country. This, then, being a debt or moral obligation, does not come AYithin the constitutional prohibition; the association lent its credit to the township. If this act is unconstitutional, all general and special bounty laws, since the commencement of the war, are unconstitutional. These laws, by the almost unanimous consent of the people, have been acquiesced in. This court will not disturb the act unless shown to be clearly unconstitutional.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ARz\">June 25th 1866,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b21-5\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b21-6\">Thompson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A04\">\u2014 The point which ay\u00edII engross our attention in this case is, whether the school directors of Halifax toAvnship are authorized, by the special act of the 25th August 1864, to levy and collect a tax to repay money borrowed to reimburse the \u201c Bounty Association of Halifax Township\u201d for money expended by it to procure volunteers to fill the quota of the township under the call of the President therein mentioned for troops. Other questions are incidentally discussed in argument; but the material point is this mentioned, and to it this opinion will be confined, without the expression of any opinion on the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-7\">The act mentioned \u201c authorizes and requires\u201d the school directors to borroAY money to reimburse the \u201c Halifax Bounty Association\u201d moneys advanced to free said toAvnship from the draft, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-8\">The first inquiry therefore is, were the moneys paid out by the association, advancements in aid of the township AYithin the meaning of the act, or only an appropriation by it of the v.oluntary contributions of its members to relieve themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-9\">The expression \u201c moneys advanced\u201d in its connection in the act must be understood in a business or commercial sense, and that is defined by Webster, to be \u201c giving beforehand, furnishing of something on contract, before an equivalent is received, as money or goods, towards a capital or stock, or on loan. A furnishing of money or goods for others in expectation of reimbursement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b21-10\">We are bound to regard the statute as an authority to reimburse what was intended by the association as advances made to the toAvnship, with the intent or understanding, to be reimbursed or-returned to those contributing. This was the light in which the learned judge beloAV regarded the terms used; and unless this appears in support of the present levy by the school directors, they are acting without authority. But the learned judge, if I properly comprehend his meaning, did not give sufficient importance to these terms, and hence I apprehend he fell into error. He does not seem to have considered it material whether the association paid its money voluntarily in aid of its own members, of expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>to aid the township in saving its people from a draft, with the understanding that it was advanced in the character of a loan, if the legislature chose to direct its repayment, and the school directors chose to act upon the authority conferred. This we cannot agree to. Such an enactment would not he legislation at all. It would be in the nature of judicial action it is true, but wanting the justice of notice to parties to be .affected by .the hearing, trial, and all that gives sanction and force to regular judicial proceedings; it would much more resemble an imperial rescript than constitutional legislation; first, in declaring an obligation where none was created or previously existed ; and next in decreeing payment by directing the money or property of the people to be sequestered to make the payment. The legislature can exercise no such despotic functions, and as it is not apparent in the act that they attempted to do so, we are not to presume they did. They evidently intended the <em>advancements </em>to be reimbursed, to be only such as were made on the faith that they were to be returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-4\">' Construing the' act in <em>pari materi\u00e1 </em>with the general act passed on the same day and on the same subject, \u2014 and we think we ought so to construe it, 1 Kent 63, \u2014 such reimbursements are required by. the first section of the act, Pamph. L. 1864, p. 185-6, to be made to parties making advancements .to the municipal districts therein mentioned under an understanding or agreement that they would be reimbursed. As already seen, this is the commercial meaning of the words to \u201c\u2018advance money,\u201d and is consistent with the other legislation on, the subject, and in <em>pari materi\u00e1. </em>Moreover, the legislation would not be unconstitutional, as it would be in the aspect above noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">Taking this for the meaning of the authority conferred, was the money expended by \u201c the bounty association,\u201d contributed by its members with, a view to aid the township to free itself from the draft, and with an understanding that it was to be reimbursed, or was it voluntary and to free themselves from the draft or liability to be drafted ? ,</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">This is a most material part of the defence to the bill, and the first member of the proposition is alleged in answer to the charge of the bill, but it is claimed that the last part alone is true ; does the proof sustain this answer ?</p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">After a-most careful examination of the proceedings of the association, nothing like an assurance of repayment to the members of it is to be found, excepting that at the last meeting,' \u00e1s I understand it to have been, held on the 28th of July 1864. On that occasion, as the minutes show, the president, after \u2018stating that the county commissioners had refused to levy a -tax for the payment of bounties under the call for 500,000 volunteers, expressed the opinion, it was ho more, for want of authority, that all payments to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the association and expended by it would be considered as loaned to the township, and the belief that the legislature \u201c would so amend the law as to enable us to throw'the expense on the township.\u201d This was not in shape an agreement, for the president neither so represented, nor had the authority to do so, nor was it anything from which an understanding to the effect that the parties paying would be reimbursed, nor is there a syllable to show that any one did contribute on the faith of it. The largest portion of the funds had been collected and expended before that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">\u2022 But to take a step backwards: does it appear in the proofs that the association was organized for the purpose of aiding the township to free itself of the draft, or was not the purpose of the association formed to free its own members from it ?</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The theatre of its action was exclusively the \u2019township of Halifax\u2014 its members were not liable to draft elsewhere. In protecting themselves from the draft they necessarily relieved the township to that extent. This fact does not prove that they were acting for the township. .In fact, that corporation was not at the time acting for itself or asking aid. The fact of contributing to the township, or rather advancing money to it with an understanding to be reimbursed by it, is a fact to be proved, and cannot rest in presumption. But is the fact proved ? Certainly I have seen no evidence to that effect. I think that it appears by the proceedings of the association in making their organization and afterwards, that the sole object of its care and effort was not the township, b]it its own members.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">The first of the preliminary resolutions, passed as introductory to the constitution and reported by the committee on organization, declares \u201c that we the citizens of Halifax township who are subject to military duty, do hereby form ourselves into a society whose object it shall be to raise money, offer bounties, procure voluteers for the United States service, and have them credited to our township against the draft.\u201d All this the association proposed to do themselves, and not to aid the township.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">But the third resolution is still clearer as to the object. It declares, \u201cthat in case many who are subject to duty, hang back, thinking <em>to allow the society to clear them, we will </em>then report to head-quarters every man who is not properly enrolled, allow the draft to take place, and use the funds of the society to pay the commutation of such of its members as may be drafted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b23-9\">Nothing is plainer than the intention here declared \u2014 that the society had in view the mutual protection of each member without reference to the township, further than its assigned <em>quota.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b23-10\">The constitution itself evinces fully the same purpose. In\u2019art. 6, it is provided that if the funds of the association are not sufficient, and a draft takes place, they are to be retained until after the draft, and then \u201c those of the members drafted are to be assisted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>to the extent of the last dollar in the treasury.\u201d Consistently with this object, at the meeting of the association on February 19th 1864, it was resolved that after the next meeting the \u201c doors of the society will be closed, and the whole care of the association directed towards securing its <em>own members from draft, </em>while outsiders must take care of themselves.\u201d Accordingly at the next meeting it appeares by the minutes, that the books were opened and membership solicited \u2014 whether ever opened afterwards for that purpose, we do not know ; it does not appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">This is the proof on these points and necessary to the defence, viz., that the money was advanced for the township on the understanding to be reimbursed. Had anything of the kind been in view of the association it would doubtless have appeared on the minutes, for they are exceedingly well kept, and' easily to be understood. There is no other testimony in the ease. We think the complainants have established their case, and that the terms of the act do not cover the case of mere voluntary payment of moneys, contributed as a mutual fund to save the contributors from draft. The legislature is not to he presumed to have attempted to exercise the power to compel the reimbursement of mere voluntary contributions, let the object he ever so beneficial, praiseworthy, or patriotic. We must therefore reverse the decree of the court below, and decree that ,the respondents be enjoined from collecting any portion of the sum of $23,500, assessed to. reimburse the Halifax Bounty Association for money paid out by it'to save the members of the association from the draft mentioned in the act set forth in complainants\u2019 bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The proof has failed to establish the fact that the money was advanced for the township; and of necessity no understanding or agreement that it should be reimbursed by the township could have existed. The case proved does not bring the action of the school directors within the terms of the act, and for that reason their action cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">Decree. \u2014 This cause came on to be heard at the May term of this court, for the Middle District, held at Harrisburg, and was argued by counsel. And now, June 25th 1866, it is considered, adjudged, and decreed, that the decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin county, made therein, dismissing the complainants\u2019 bill, be reversed, and the defendants, and every of them, their agents, officers, and all persons acting by their authority, and every of them, be and they and each of them are perpetually enjoined from levying and collecting, or collecting, being already levied, the sum or any portion of the sum of $23,500 assessed. by them upon the township of Halifax, in the county of Dauphin, under pretence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>reimbursing the \u201cBounty Association of Halifax Township,\u201d otherwise called in the Act of Assembly of the 27th of August 1864, the \u201c Halifax Bounty Association,\u201d for moneys alleged to have been advanced by said bounty association to the township of Halifax, and from paying over to said association any moneys which may have been collected under that pretence, and that the respondents pay the costs of the suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
