The court are requested to charge the jury that the instrument of 22d November 1849, is a testamentary paper in the nature of a will, revocable by the testator, and was so revoked by the will of the 26th day of February 1861. That the clause and this conveyance in no way to take effect until after the decease of the said John Scott, the grantor, \u201cis binding upon the parties to the instrument, and that to say that John Scott might not revoke the instrument in his lifetime, would be giving to the instrument some effect during his lifetime, in plain violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>that clause in the instrument which was plainly only intended to make provision for his son, in case he should die without any further disposition being made of his property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\">2. That if said clause were rejected altogether, and the instrument construed to be a deed of conveyance, a freehold cannot be created <em>in futuro </em>with only a life estate reserved to support it, instead of a life estate granted, but the instrument is wholly inoperative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-7\">The court (Derrickson, A. J.) charged the jury as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-8\">\u201c The plaintiffs claim the land in controversy by devise to them in the will of John Scott, made in 1861, and registered in 1864. The defendant, by a deed to him from the same person, executed and delivered in November 1849, and recorded in January 1850. The validity of this instrument, <em>as a </em>deed, is disputed by the plaintiffs, for the reasons that by words contained in it, it was \u2018 in no way to take effect till after the death of the grantor,\u2019 and that he was to have \u2018 the entire use and possession of the land during his natural life,\u2019 and contend, that it is only and nothing more than a will, and consequently liable to revocation. If this construction is to prevail, the plaintiffs must also prevail. Is it the correct one ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-9\">\u201c The instrument has most certainly none of the usual formulas, \u2022peculiarities or language of a will on its face or about it. It has parties to it, agreeing to contract with each other, and considerations which are legitimate in themselves, either one of which would suffice to rest a grant upon ; and if the one which binds the son to reside with and labour for his father is not executed, it is open to enforcement. Then again, the language used for the passing of the land is that of a grantor and not of a devisor, while that which creates the covenant of warranty is foreign to that of a will, though peculiar to grantors and deeds of conveyance. To say then that this is a will, is to confound all distinctions between words and language which serve to make one, and those which go to make a deed. The sentence, \u2018 and this conveyance in no way to take effect till after the decease of the grantor,\u2019 if taken according to its very letter, would go far towards making the deed inoperative ; while it would also force the conclusion that the parties to it were ignorant of what they were doing, or what they wished to accomplish. Ordinary charity for men\u2019s actions would not permit this, nor will the law presume it. The relations the parties held to each other, and the mutual covenants entered into by them, forbid a conclusion of this kind. The meaning to be given to this sentence, taken in connection with other parts of the deed, is that the deed and the grant it makes, are not to interfere, \u2018 <em>in any </em>way,\u2019 with the grantor\u2019s reserved or excepted life estate. Nothing more can be drawn from the sentence than this, and with this it must be satisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>\u201c There is nothing in common with a will and a deed, except that the object of either or both may be, as they generally are, to create and vest estates in others; but the language of one is diverse from that of the other, and while one is ever liable to change, alteration or revocation at the pleasure of its author, and never becomes active and operative till after his death, the other is the concentrated will of those who are the parties to it, and can no more be abrogated or destroyed by one than it could, in the first instance, be created by him alone ; and the estate it creates, if such is its purpose, is a present one, though its enjoyment may be made subject to contingencies and limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-6\">\u201c Admitting, however, that the paper in question is a deed, and not a will, its validity is again questioned by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, for the reason that it undertakes'to create a freehold estate <em>in </em>futuro, without a particular estate to support it. In the earlier periods of the common law, the objection here raised would have been fatal to the effectiveness of the grant, for the want of livery of seisin; but the Statute of Uses and our own recording acts have changed the law from its ancient teaching, and the deed before us, instead of being declared void for the objectionable feature on its surface, will be held and construed to be a bargain and sale by the grantor and that he will stand seised of the estate contemplated by it during his life, for the use of his grantee, to be enjoyed by him after the reserved life estate has expired.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-7\">\u201cThese instructions will suffice as answers to the points made by counsel, and to require a verdict for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-8\">The plaintiffs excepted to the charge, and the jury found for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-9\">In this court the plaintiffs assigned for error, that the court did not answer their points in the affirmative and directed a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-10\"><em>S. JE. </em>Woodruff, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMe\">The instrument under which defendant claims is a testamentary paper, being \u201c a disposition of property to take effect after the death of the person making it,\u201d 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 501. By this instrument, John Scott gives the property to his son after his death, and strengthens that by saying, \u201c <em>in no way </em>to take effect during my life.\u201d The con'siderations expressed are usual in a devise to a son, and the son took the instrument <em>cum onere, </em>that it was to have no effect in the father\u2019s life. To say that this instrument prevented the father from disposing of the land would give it a most important \u201c <em>effect during (his) life\u201d </em>A deed which in terms was not to operate until after the testator\u2019s death, has been held to be testamentary: Redfield on Wills, p. 170 ; Gage <em>v. </em>Gage, 12 N. H. 731; Ingram <em>v. </em>Porter, 4 McCord 198 ; Milledge <em>v. </em>Lamar, 4 Dessaus. 617, also Hilliard, \u00a7 8; Bartholomew <em>v. </em>Henly, 3 Phillimore 318; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Masterman <em>v. </em>Maberly, 2 Hagg. 247; Jackson <em>v. </em>Henderson, 1 Dessaus. 543; Redfield, p. 272; Habergham <em>v. </em>Vincent, 2 Ves. Jr. 204; Perry <em>v. </em>Scott, ante p. 119; Rose <em>v. </em>Quirk, 6 Casey 225.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-6\">If the instrument was a conveyance, could a freehold be created <em>in futuro </em>with a life estate reserved, and not <em>granted </em>to support it ? The obvious construction of the instrument is that no <em>present </em>interest passed, and if not, then no estate whatever passed. When it is intended to grant a freehold to be enjoyed in future, it is necessary to <em>create </em>a previous particular estate: 2 Bl. Com. p. 1.64.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-7\">A bargain and sale was nothing more than the sale of the use, the possession remaining in the bargainor. The Statute of Uses annexes the possession to the use, and thus completes the purchase: Shep. Touch. 221. John Scott inserted the clause that the \u201c conveyance should in no way take effect,\u201d &amp;c., to prevent either title or possession from passing from him. But if actual seisin were not necessary, still the remainder must commence, and pass out of the grantor at the creation of the particular estate: 2 Bl. Com. pp. 167-168.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-8\">The consideration is not such as will require the grantor to stand seised to the use of grantee. There is a wide difference between construing a deed as a covenant on part of grantor to stand seised to the use of grantee, and a covenant on part of grantee to stand seised for use of a third party: 2 Hare &amp; Wallace, notes to Amer. Lead. Cases, p. 391; Rowan\u2019s Appeal, 1 Casey 293.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b129-9\"><em>J. O. F. F. Marshall, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABP\">1. Was the instrument a testamentary paper, or a deed ? It has no features of a testamentary instrument: Hileman <em>v. </em>Bouslaugh, 1 Harris 344. It has all the requisites of a deed: a valuable consideration, the terms, grant, bargain, sell, &amp;c., <em>habendum </em>and covenant of warranty. John Scott intended to convey a fee, subject to his life-estate. The son understood he was to get such estate. The intention must govern.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-10\">2. The clear meaning of the parties to be found in the instrument is, that it conveyed to the son an estate in fee, reserving, a life estate to grantor. It was a conveyance subject to an encumbrance. Livery of seisin has nothing to do with it. By sec. 4 of Act of 28th May 1715,' deeds have the same effect to give seisin as deeds of feoffment with livery of seisin: McKee <em>v. </em>Pfout, 3 Dall. 489; Dunwoodie <em>v. </em>Reed, 3 S. &amp; R. 435; Sergt. Land Law 230, 242.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b129-11\">Recording is equal to livery of seisin. There is no difference in principle between a deed in fee reserving an estate for years, and reserving a life estate : putting on record, is notice to all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>world. The grantor and his heirs would be estopped. Hence in Pennsylvania a life estate <em>reserved </em>will perform the same functions as a life estate <em>granted.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-6\">3. Does not the deed take effect as a covenant to stand seised to the use of the grantee ? Equity does not regard the mode of conveyance so much as the intent of the parties ; and a deed of bargain and sale may he construed <em>a covenant to stand seised </em>Avhen both a money consideration and relation by blood appears in the deed: Sprague <em>v. </em>Wood, 4 W. &amp; S. 195; Fisher <em>v. </em>Strickland, 10 Barr 348.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-7\">\u201cLease and release\u201d was to avoid necessity of <em>actual entry: </em>4 Kent. Comm. 493.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-8\">Deeds acting under the Statute of Uses may give an estate of freehold to commence <em>in futuro : </em>2 Prest, on Convey. 127. A grant to A. merely, creates a life estate only ; but Avhen a party pays his money, and the <em>intention </em>is clear that a fee was to be conveyed, a use, AA'hich chancery Avould execute, is raised: Lynn <em>v. </em>Downs, 1 Yeates 520; McGirr <em>v. </em>Aaron, 1 Penn. Rep. 49. Wherever a deed of conveyance, &amp;c., is made, and the intention of the\" grantor, &amp;c., is clear, and a technical principle might defeat the intention, courts will declare the grantor a trustee, and the deed a covenant to stand seised for the use of the grantee: Martin <em>v. </em>McCord, 5 Watts 495; Allison <em>v. </em>Kurtz, 2 Id. 188; Wilt <em>v. </em>Franklin, 1 Binn. 519; Witman <em>v. </em>Lex, 17 S. &amp; R. 96. The Avords bargain and sell make a covenant to stand seised: 4 Cruise\u2019s Dig. tit. 32, ch. 10, \u00a7 2. A bargain and sale for a pecuniary consideration to commence <em>in futuro </em>will operate as a covenant to stand seised according to the intention, Avitho.ut technical Avords: Jackson <em>v. </em>Swart, 20 Johns. 85; Barrett <em>v. </em>French, 1 Conn. 354; Wallis <em>v. </em>Wallis, 4 Mass. 135. A deed to a son reserving a life estate to the grantor is a covenant to stand seised for grantee: French <em>v. </em>Frend, N. H. R. 258; Jackson <em>v. </em>McKinney, 3 Wend. 233; Jackson <em>v. </em>Sebring, 16 Johns. 515, 9 Wend. 641.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AgJ\">January 14th 1867,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b130-10\">Woodavard, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF8\">The great question in the case, and the only one we shall discuss, is, whether the indenture of 22d November 1849, by John Scott to his son John W. Scott, conveying the farm in dispute, was a deed or a will. Not Avhether the parties called it a deed, nor Avhether it contained the customary words of a deed ; but Avhether, according to the intentions expressed upon the face of the instrument, it can in law have the effect and operation of a deed. This is our question, and it is important to place before our minds, in a very distinct light, the instrument to he interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-11\">John Scott, an old man living on his farm, made, what is called, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>i{ This Indenture\u201d to his son John W. Scott, at the above-mentioned date, upon a consideration of natural love and affection, and \u201c also that the said John W. Scott hath this day agreed to live with the said John Scott, and labour for and assist him in working the land hereinafter described, and maintain Patience Scott the wife of the said John Scott, if she survives him, during her natural life,\u201d conveying the said farm by metes and bounds to him in fee simple \u201c excepting and reserving nevertheless, the entire use and possession of said premises unto the said John Scott and his assigns for and during the term of his natural life ; and this conveyance in no way to take effect until after the decease of the said John Scott the grantor.\u201d The <em>habendum </em>was to have and to hold the premises \u201c after the decease of said John Scott,\u201d to him the said John W. Scott, his heirs and assigns, &amp;.c.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">After the father and son commenced their joint possession under this deed they quarrelled, and the father turned the son out by an action of ejectment, and kept the sole possession in himself till he died, his wife Patience having died before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Before his death, to wit, on the 26th February 1861, he made a formal will in which'he revoked all former wills, \u201c and particularly a certain will and testament (in form as a deed) recorded in the recorder\u2019s office of said county of Erie, in deed-book U., p. 716, witnessed by Miron Hutchinson and George H. Cutler, and I hereby give and assign as the reason 'of revoking and making void said will, that my son John W. Scott and his wife have failed to treat me with filial affection, and to comply with the conditions upon which I made said will.\u201d He then goes on to devise the land in question to his daughters, Nancy Holliday, Anna Sanford, Parney P. Turner and his son Abner Scott, the plaintiffs in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">These devisees succeeded to the possession, but lost it by .an action of ejectment brought against them by John W. Scott, and this is a second ejectment brought by them to regain the possession. If the deed of 22d November 1849 vested the title in John W-. Scott, the subsequent will was inoperative of course, so far as concerned this land; but if the deed vested no present interest, and was intended to operate as a testament, it was very expressly revoked and repealed by the subsequent will, and plaintiff's as devisees under this will have the title.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">The testator called and treated the deed as a will, but not until after he had quarrelled with his son and turned him out of possession. When he made the instrument he called it an indenture, and permitted his son to record it as a deed. His treatment of it as a will therefore proves nothing. But what is the effect of the reservation clause above quoted ? Undoubtedly, a life estate was reserved to the grantor with the entire use and possession of the premises, and of course the instrument could not take effect as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u201c <em>conveyance\u201d </em>until after his death, and such was the declared intention. The learned judge construed the latter clause of the reservation as a protection of the life estate, but it needed no protection for it remained in the grantor, being excepted out of the grant as fully as it was capable of existing. Rut if these pregnant words were added with some such mistaken -notion of the parties, and it is quite possible they were, they are an emphatic declaration that no interest should be considered as presently conveyed to interfere with the life estate, whilst the <em>habendum </em>is equally express that the estate intended to be conveyed to John W. Scott should commence at the death of the grantor. Without straining or unduly emphasizing any of these words, it is impossible to doubt, that if any effect whatever is to be given to them, they limited the fee to take effect <em>in futuro. </em>At common law this can only be done when a particular estate, to take effect presently, is <em>granted, </em>not <em>reserved, </em>to support the fee. If the question was upon John W. Scott\u2019s title under the deed, without any subsequent will in the case, and we should be obliged to say that as an attempt to create a freehold <em>in futuro </em>without the grant of a particular estate to support it, the deed was-void, we might, perhaps, support it as a covenant to stand seised to his use. I say <em>perhaps, </em>because the case has not been fully considered in that aspect, and the reason why we do not so contemplate it is, that there being a subsequent will it becomes a mere question of interpretation, whether the former instrument was testamentary in its character or not. If it was testamentary, then it ought not to be construed as a covenant to stand seised, there being a later will. Had there been no later will, the deed though testamentary might perhaps have been supported as such a covenant. We come then to the real question, was the deed essentially a testamentary instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Swinburne defines a testament to be a \u201cjust sentence of our will touching that we would have done after our death. And because some there be who do censure this excellent definition to he defective, though unworthily,\u201d he makes a full exposition of the meaning of every word in the definition. The only distinction he makes between a testament and a will is the distinction between <em>justa sententia, </em>and <em>legitima dispositio. </em>But the essence of both is that it is a disposition to take effect after death, and this is adopted by Judge Redfield, the latest commentator, in his work on the Law of Wills, p. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">In the case of Habergham <em>v. </em>Vincent, 2 Ves. Jr. 204, the question was, whether two instruments, one in form a will and the other in form a deed, did not together constitute a will, and the case was greatly considered. It was first argued before Lord Thurlow, who took a long time to consider of it and then directed a case to he stated for the opinion of the Court of King\u2019s Bench. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>In consequence of too short a statement in sending this ease to law, the second instrument was there considered a deed, and the other questions were ruled accordingly. Afterwards when the case came before Lord Chancellor Loughborough, he said he felt so strongly that this instrument (the deed) was to be construed as testamentary, that he must have the assistance of two of the judges to sit with him at the argument; and accordingly Mr. Justice Buller and Mr. Justice Wilson, in accordance with a custom which sometimes is practised in the Pligh Court of Chancery, sat with the Chancellor and delivered separate, though concurring opinions. Mr. Justice Buller, in his opinion, said: \u201c When this case was argued in the King\u2019s Bench, no one of the cases quoted here by the attorney-general was mentioned or alluded to. I freely confess,\u201d he added, \u201cthey did not occur to me. But those cases have established that an instrument in any form, whether a deed-poll or indenture, if the obvious purpose is not to take place till after the death of the person making it, shall operate as a will. The cases for that are both at law and in equity, and in one of them there were express words of immediate grant and a consideration to support it as a grant, but as upon the whole the intention was that it should have a future operation after death, it was considered as a will.\u201d To the same effect were the other opinions in this case. The cases to which Justice Buller alluded as cited by the attorney-general (Sir John Scott) were West\u2019s Case, Moore 177, where it is laid down that if there is a letter expressing the disposition as to land, it is sufficient; Greene <em>v. </em>Proude, 1 Mod. 117, where, though the instrument was sealed and delivered as a deed, it was held to be a will; Metham <em>v. </em>The Duke of Devonshire, 1 P. Wms. 629, where a will directed the executors to pay 3000Z. as the testator should afterwards appoint. He afterwards made a deed of appointment, which was taken as part of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">I refer also to cases cited in note 9 of 1 Williams on Executors, p. 61; and Rowan\u2019s Appeal, 1 Casey 293. But it is supposed the covenant of general warranty in the deed estops the plaintiffs. Undoubtedly the covenant of warranty protects the consideration, and as that was in the form of services to be rendered, John W. Scott will be entitled to his action for damages, <em>if he rendered these services. </em>This question has not been investigated in the present action; but if the old man turned the son out of possession of the premises and took exclusive possession to himself, and died 'in such exclusive possession, it is not very likely that a breach of covenant will be enforced against his personal representatives, which was not thought worth asserting against the old man himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">However this may be, we see nothing in the covenant of warranty to change our construction of the operative words of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>grant. As these words were expressly limited to take effect only after the death of the grantor, they were necessarily revocable words. The doctrine of the cases is, that whatever the form of the instrument, if it vest no present interest but only appoints what is to be done after the death of the mak\u00e9r, it is a testamentary instrument. It signifies nothing that the parties meant to make a deed instead of a will. If they have used language which the law holds to he testamentary, their intention is to be gathered from the legal import of the words they have employed, for all parties must be judged by the legal meaning of their words.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The revocable words of the first instrument having been revoked by the subsequent will, the estate must go to the devisees; and John W. Scott, if entitled to any redress, must seek it by a personal action against the legal representatives of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The judgm\u00a7nt is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>is awarded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b134-8\">Agnew, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
