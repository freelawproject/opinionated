Parle, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_F\">There is nothing in the case to induce the belief that the defendants were to pay $1400 for machinery they never got. The testimony offered was part of <em>res gestae; </em>its rejection excluded part of a correspondence after another part had been admitted. Rejecting it prevented defendants from commenting on its effect. The letter of 'Hindle would have shown what was meant by the defendants taking the machinery at their own risk. One of the counts was for goods sold and delivered, and a witness testified to a delivery: the letter rejected would have contradicted that.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b516-13\">A\u2019 sale founded on misrepresentation is void, even if made through mistake or ignorance : Story on Cont. \u00a7 506. In questions of fraud, misrepresentation, &amp;c., great latitude of evidence is allowed: Gest <em>v. </em>McJunkin, 2 Rich. 154.

Everything was conclusively proved. There was no defect in title: the only risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>was obtaining possession. The defendant did obtain possession. The declarations of third persons, in the absence of the parties, cannot form res <em>gestee.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b517-6\"><em>JSarle, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASB\">The rejected evidence ought to have been admitted as throwing light on an executory contract, on which there has been a total failure of consideration, which will not be enforced either at law or in equity, and to which equitable defences will be let in. See Rockafellow <em>v. </em>Baker, 5 Wright 319; Nace <em>v. </em>Boyer, 6 Casey 99; Geigar <em>v. </em>Cook, 3 W. &amp; S. 266; 5 S. &amp; R. 427; 9 Id. 80; 3 Watts 32; Kent\u2019s Com., vol. 2, \u00a7 39, p. 468; Story on Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 188, 203, 420, 345. Both the claim and the evidence pretend that the contract was for the purchase of a right in machinery not in existence, and the evidence shows a failure of consideration on that point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b517-7\">It ought to have been admitted because it threw light on latent defects in title, and when there is a latent defect in the subject of sale, known to the vendor, and he resorts to any means or artifice to conceal that defect, this is a fraud that will avoid the contract, even although by the written terms of contract the' article is sold with all faults: Baglehole <em>v. </em>Waters, Lord Ellenborough, 3 Camp. 154; Schneider <em>v. </em>Heath, Cor. Mansfield, C. J., Id. 506; Pickering <em>v. </em>Dowson, 4 Taunt. 779; Jones <em>v. </em>Bowden, Id. 847; see 5 Johns. 441; note Starkie on Evidence (1634) 1633.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AF2\">March 6th 1866,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AgM1\">The opinion of the court'was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b517-9\">Thompson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahg1\">In all litigated cases the theory of each side, either in law or fact, is necessarily opposed to that of the other ; but each has a right to the testimony which will sustain his theory if, when established, it would maintain his part of the issue or destroy that of his opponent.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">The theory of the defendant\u2019s case here was that he purchased from the plaintiff certain coal machinery, built for the latter, and ready for delivery, for which oh completion of the bargain, he received an order calling for it deliverable on the day of its date ; that the order was presented to -the manufacturer for the machinery and refused, and that notice of this was given to the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s, theory was, that he did not sell specific machinery to the defendant, but only his chance of getting it from the manufacturers who had contracted to build it, and to \u2018 whom he had paid a portion, if not all, the contract price, and that the order given, as testified to by his witness, was to carry out this arrangement. These were the theories of the parties. The defendant, among other things to support his, offered to prove by one Hague that he was present when the defendant presented the plaintiff\u2019s order, and to which it was answered by the manu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>facturera\u2019 man, or agent, in the shop, that there was no such machinery of plaintiff\u2019s there, and that Hindle &amp; Sons then wrote a letter to the plaintiff, which it was proposed to prove was delivered to Him, in connection with the testimony of the witness to the same effect, refusing the order. The witness and the letter, were both objected to, and overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The defendant\u2019s theory was not without evidence, that it was the trae nature of the transaction,' and if it was, it does not admit of a doubt that he was entitled to the evidence. He could not get the machinery without an acceptance of the order. To prove it protested lay at the very foundation of his case. To say that the evidence was inadmissible, was to assume the plaintiff\u2019s theory to be true, and thus exclude the defendant\u2019s. But as the entire contract rested in parol, the positions of the parties and their claims, were for the jury, and could not be'peremptorily ruled by the court. We think there was error therefore, and that the judgment must be reversed. It is certain there is more than one discrepant circumstance in the defendant\u2019s way, if the plaintiff\u2019s testimony be true, beside the date of the written notice from Hindle &amp; Son to the plaintiff; but this may all be explainable, and the jury will dispose of the case when the evidence is all in. We see nothing in the other assignment; indeed it would be impossible to do so, as it is not stated that the question objected to was answered at all, or shown that the answer was injurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
