The court erred in confirming said report, for the reasons set forth in the exceptions, and for the further reason that the Act of Assembly does not contemplate the granting of a private road for the use of the inhabitants of one or more townships generally, but only for the use of specified individuals who otherwise have no access from their lands to a highway.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-17\"><em>G-ordon \u00a7\u2022 Bro., </em>for exceptors.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amg\">It must appear by the report of a private road, that it is necessary: Pocopson Road, 4 Harris 15.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-18\">The petition here is of twenty-seven persons applying for a <em>private </em>road from one highway to another, and not from \u201ctheir dwellings or plantations to a highway.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-19\"><em>W.

Courts should not be too astute in criticising the language of road reports: Speer\u2019s Road, 4 Binn. 176. Laying out a road is equivalent to declaring the road necessary: Road in Norriton, 4 Barr 337. Improvements may be shown by the draft: Road in Aston, 4 Yeates 372.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>January 8th 1866,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b96-5\">Woodward, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkH\">Under the 11th and 12th sections of the Road Law of 1886, Purd. 872, the Court of Quarter Sessions have power to lay out a private road from the dwellings or plantations of the petitioners to a highway or place of necessary public resort, or to some other private way that leads to a highway, but they have no power under these sections or any other to lay out private roads except between such termini. The object of the legislation was to enable petitioners to get access to established highways and to places of necessary resort, that they might not be shut out of the world ; but for a private road which like this starts from a turnpike and ends upon a creek, there is no authority in the statute. The court had no jurisdiction to establish a private road between such points : and besides the report of viewers was fatally defective in not setting forth that the road was necessary, as the 12th section requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">For these reasons the proceedings must be set aside. There was some attempt to treat this as a public road, but it was unsuccessful, for the viewers laid it out expressly for private use, and the court confirmed their report as they made it.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Let the proceedings be set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
