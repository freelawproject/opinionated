A provision in a coal-lease that the lessee \u201c shall carry on the digging of said coal in such a manner as to do no injury to the surface of said land, and not to spoil the coal itself, and in order to carry this condition into full effect, parties of the first part reserve the power and full right to themselves to send, from time to time, an expert into the coal-pit for the purpose of examining the manner in which said business is therein done, and. to get his approval thereto,\u201d is not a <em>condition, </em>for breach of which the lessors may enter, but a covenant, for breach of which the lessee is liable in damages.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b232-11\">2.

The lessors having entered on the lessee for breach of condition, and he having brought ejectment to recover the possession, the burden was upon the lessors to prove a forfeiture.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b232-14\">5. The lease required that the lessee should make sworn monthly returns of coal mined, and pay the rent monthly. There was no evidence of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>returns, and evidence of only three payments of rent. <em>Held, </em>that the law concluded that no returns were made, and that other rent was not paid.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b233-6\">6. The lessee agreed to mine 72,000 bushels each year, to pay a stipulated sum for each 100 bushels and to make monthly returns ; and, if he neglected to comply with the covenants for the payment of the rent, the lessors might determine the lease. The lessee having failed in these covenants, and the lessors having resumed possession, it should have been presumed that this had been done in pursuance of their right to terminate the lease, and it was error to submit to the jury whether the lessors had waived their right to terminate it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b233-7\">7. The court below charged: \u201c If the lessee did not pay for all the coal actually taken out from month to month, and the lessors let it stand over without saying or doing anything to enforce a compliance, or notice of an intention to do so, for more than two years, the lessee might conclude that they did not intend to insist on a forfeiture, and, if so, their remedy would be against him personally for rent in arrear.\u201d <em>Held,, </em>that this was error.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-8\">Error to the District Court of <em>Allegheny county, </em>in which this was an action of ejectment by Louis Kreutz against William.

There is no coal there, except in pillars, and they cannot be worked any more with safety. The water-entry which drains this coal, the pit worked by McCormick, and also the Ormsby coal is now in great danger of being blocked up by the pillars or walls giving way, where Kreutz has taken away the coal, leaving them insufficient.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-6\">On the 15th and 26th of July and 21st of September 1864, Kreutz paid rent, amounting in the whole to $43, and ceased working the pit in October of same year. There was no evidence that Kreutz furnished sworn monthly statements, or that he paid any more rent than that above stated.

Kreutz was with me once ; I went there at the request of Mr. Eurgwin; I was engaged as superintendent of Ormsby Coal Works for a number of years; Kreutz had told me before, that he was about leasing the coal works, or had leased them; he said I was to superintend the works. Witness looks at paper with affidavit dated Cctober 14th 1861, and says: I signed and swore to that paper, in connection with Mr. Sankey, and gave it to Mr. Burgwin.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-11\">Defendants offered the paper\u2018referred to by witness (the statement above mentioned).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-12\">The plaintiff objected that so far as it refers to Mr. Sankey, it is incompetent; and as to the witness, he is now on the stand, and competent to give evidence as to the facts therein contained, and while he may refresh his memory by the contents of the paper, it is incompetent as an independent piece of evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-13\">By the Court: \u201cWhether the paper would or would not be competent as secondary evidence in case of the death or absence of the witness, it is not necessary now to decide. I am of opinion, however, that the testimony of the witness in open court, as to the truth of the facts therein contained, after refreshing his memory, is the best evidence, and will tend more clearly to promote truth and justice than the statements it contains by itself could possibly do. The offer rejected.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>2.

This for the purpose of showing that the lessee had not complied with the condition that he was not to injure the surface of the land, and to show a right in the lessors to terminate the lease for breach of condition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-10\">4.

He paid money, however, for coal-rent, which was received as such without anything being said about the sworn returns; and if you believe the lessors intended, from this evidence, to waive their right to receive sworn returns, and did so waive their right, then they could not after-wards declare the contract dissolved, without giving notice to the lessee of their intention to do so.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-11\">11.

Purgwin, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2B\">Was the provision in the lease, that the lessee should not injure the surface or spoil the coal, a <em>condition </em>on which the lessee held the mining right ? The lease called it a \u201c condition,\u201d and it was eminently proper that there should be such a condition. The work was out of sight of the lessee, and the surface far more valuable than the coal, and it could not have been in the contemplation of the lessors if the land was .injured, that they should look for damages to an irresponsible party. Why employ an expert if they could not act on his report ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>To lay on the lessors to prove a breach as to monthly returns and payment of rent, would require them to prove a negative. If the lessors were plaintiffs, all that would be required of them would be to show the lease, and call on the lessee to show payment; much more ought this to be so when the lessee is the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-6\">When land is held on condition, on breach of condition the title is <em>ipso facto </em>void without entry or claim: Hamilton <em>v. </em>Elliott, 5 S. &amp; R. 375 ; Davis <em>v. </em>Moss, 2 Wright 246 ; Shaeffer <em>v. </em>Shaeffer, 1 Id. 525; Co. Litt. 214 b.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-7\">The lessee being in default, could not take advantage of it, nor set up the lessor\u2019s forbearance as a waiver. In the cases cited, long periods elapsed before any intention was shown to take advantage of the breach.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-8\">Waiver must he established by an unequivocal act. The lessors being in possession, no act -was necessary : Co. Litt. 218. But if there was a waiver for rent due up to October 1861, it is no waiver of forfeiture for that due afterwards: See Doe <em>v. </em>Bliss, 4 Taunt. 735 ; Blucher <em>v. </em>Smith, 13 Wend. 534; Jackson <em>v. </em>Allen, 3 Cow. 120; Kenrick <em>v. </em>Smith, 7 W. &amp; S. 41. On breach of condition a lease is <em>ipso facto </em>void, and a subsequent recognition cannot give it continuance: Co. Litt. 215 <em>a. </em>The cessation of mining for two and a half years is a forfeiture, not merely evidence \u00f3f it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b237-9\">The lessors being found in possession at the end of three years, and this being consistent with the provision terminating the lease when the coal was exhausted, the presumption is, the coal was exhausted; besides, the evidence went to show that it was so.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b237-10\"><em>Woods, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjC4\">(The Reporter received no paper-book of defendant in error.)</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AYL\">January 8th 1866,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b237-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b237-12\">Strong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atl\">A very large number of errors have been assigned in this case, most of which are without any substantial foundation. A considerable portion of them rest upon the assumption that the estate demised to the plaintiff below was upon condition that he should so exercise his right as not to injure or endanger the surface of the land, or obstruct the watercourse. In our opinion, however, the assumption is not well made. There is nothing in the words of the lease that can by any just construction be regarded as making the tenure of the lessee dependent upon his compliance with any other covenants than those which relate to the rent. The utmost that can be made of the stipulation that the lessee should dig coal in such a manner as to do no injury to the surface of the land, and not spoil the coal itself, is that it constitutes a covenant, the breach of which may subject the lessee to liability for damages, but not to forfeiture of his estate. Conditions that work forfeitures are not favourites of the law, and nothing less than a clear expres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>sion of intention that a provision shall be such, will make it a condition upon which the continuance of an estate granted depends. Here there is no such intention apparent. True, in providing a mode by which the stipulation might be enforced, the parties speak of it as a condition, but it is evident they used the word in a sense in which it is often used, that of understanding, agreement, or covenant. That it was not intended to be a cause of divestiture of the estate of the lessee, is plain from the fact that there is no declaration that doing injury to the surface or spoiling the coal should work a forfeiture, while in regard to breaches of other covenants there is such a declaration. Having expressed for what causes a forfeiture might be claimed, it is not to be inferred that there are any grounds of forfeiture not declared to be such. We hold then that the estate of the lessee was not made dependent for its continued existence upon his compliance with the requirement that the surface of the land should not be injured or endangered. Hence there was no error in refusing to affirm the defendants\u2019 first point, and none in rejecting the evidence described in the first, second and third bills of exceptions. The evidence offered was immaterial to the issue, if not inadmissible for other reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Nor can the fifth and twelfth assignments of error be sustained. The lease gave to the plaintiff below the right of possession primarily for four years. If by non-compliance with the conditions of the demise, he had forfeited the term after it had been vested in him, that was a fact to be proved by the lessors who asserted the forfeiture. The question as to the mode of proof of non-compliance, or as to what was sufficient proof of it, is a different matter. To that the maxim <em>\u201c de non apparentibus et non existentibus, eadem est ratio vel lex\u201d </em>may be applied. The court was, however, not asked to instruct the jury what was evidence of nonpayment of the rent, or what was evidence of failure to render sworn returns of the quantity of coal taken out each month. There seems to have been no evidence of any such returns, and therefore the law concludes none were made, nor was there evidence of any other payments of rent than those of July 15th, July 26th and September 21st 1861, and therefore no others were made. Nor could the jury, under the instructions of the court, have found any other, or that monthly statements were furnished, and we cannot presume that they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">But the court should have affirmed in substance the sixth, seventh and eighth points presented by the defendants. The lessee bound himself to dig and remove from the land, at least seventy-two thousand bushels per annum, that is, each year of the term, and to pay for the same at the rate of seventy-five cents, for every hundred bushels of coal taken out, and to render sworn monthly returns, by which the rent due might be determined. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>it was expressly stipulated that if he neglected or failed to com\u25a0ply with the covenants for payment for the coal, the lessors should he at liberty to determine the lease, and treat it as void. That he did not make such sworn statement, and that he did not annually take out and pay for seventy-two thousand bushels of coal, was conclusively established, and that the lessors had x-esumed possession was admitted by the ejectment. The possession of the lessors, in- absence of proof to the contrary, should have been presumed to have been in virtue of their right to retake the possession and terminate the lease, and there was error in submitting to the jux-y to find that there liad been a waiver of the right of the lessors to \u201c dissolve, terminate and annul the lease.\u201d Conceding that the receipt of money on account of rent in the months of July and September 1861, was a waiver of the right to insist upon sivorn statements of the quantity of coal removed, which is probably more than ought to be conceded, there was no evidence of any waiver of the right of the lessors to insist upon the payment for seventy-two thousand bushels per annum each year of the texun. Yet from 1861 to 1864, the lessee paid nothing. He mined no coal; he paid for none. The lessors had a right therefore to treat the lease as a nullity, and their resuming the possession was thus treating it. So the jury should have been instructed, and they should not have been pei\u2019mitted to find that the rights of the lessors to resume possession in default of such payment had been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">It is probable the attention of the court was directed mainly to the default of the lessee in furnishing the sworn statement required by the lease. That was but a part of his duty. Though he may have been relieved from that, he was not relieved from the obligation to pay for seventy-two thousand bushels annually, without which payment the lessors had the right to declare the lease void. This it must be presumed they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">These observations dispense with the necessity of noticing in detail the remaining assignments of error. The eleventh is sustained, and the instruction of the court to which exception is taken in the tenth, unless it was intended as applicable only to the fifteenth, for want of sworn statements requires qualifications. Under the evidence as it was presented the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
