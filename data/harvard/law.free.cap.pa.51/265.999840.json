On payment of principal and interest in full, Henlan was to receive a deed for the lot. Henlan, who had continued in possession until January 14th 1852, on that day assigned the article to his son William, without having paid any of the purchase-money, and left the county with his family, declaring that he did not expect to return. The property was left in charge of John Miller, who on January 15th leased it in his own name to one Barron for one year from April 1st 1852 for $35, payable quarterly. No money was paid to Thomas Miller on the articles, except $16, part of the rent received by John Miller.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-8\">On January 20th 1853, Thomas Miller brought ejectment for the lot against John Henlan; this was discontinued in 1859.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-9\">On December 16th 1853, Thomas Miller by articles sold the lot to Craig for $600, payable in instalments with interest, possession to be given on April 1st 1854, and the deed to be delivered when all the payments should be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-10\">\u2022 There was evidence on part of defendants that Henlan had abandoned the articles, and on part of Henlan that he adhered to them and desired to carry them into execution, but no part of the purchase-money or interest, except $16 before mentioned, was paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-11\">Craig entered into possession and made valuable improvements, and the property from other causes increased in value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-12\">William Henlan reassigned the articles to John Henlan, October 25th 1859.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-13\">On the trial defendants offered to prove by witnesses that Thomas Miller took possession after plaintiff left the property, after the expiration of the time limited for payment, and had not received any money on the agreement of sale ; that he sold again, and his vendee added valuable improvements to the place, and that the property has greatly enhanced in value since the plaintiff left it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-14\">The court admitted the evidence as to the improvements made by Craig as vendee, but rejected evidence of the enhanced value of the property otherwise than by the improvements.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-15\">To which ruling the defendants\u2019 counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b266-16\">Defendants submitted the following points, which were answered in the negative by Johnson, P.

The agreement is dated the 16th April 1850, and the price was $365, to be paid in two years with interest annually. Not a dollar of this amount ever was paid by Henlan, except $16 received from a tenant, which did not pay the first year\u2019s interest, and it is sought to recover it from the heirs of a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser for value, who placed upon it valuable improvements, and the property itself, from local causes, having greatly enhanced in value. If the present judgment stands, John Henlan gets for nothing a valuable property, made so, not by his exertions, but by the expenditure of others during the period of his abandonment of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">On the 14th January 1852, John Henlan, who had used the house as a residence, left it, moving into an adjoining county, never expecting to return; and on the 14th July assigned the agreement to his son William Henlan, living in Mercer county, who, on the 25th of October 1859, reassigned it to his father. There was no evidence of any money consideration for either transfer. On the 27th December 1853, Thomas Miller sold the property to William Oraig, whose heirs now own it, and are the defendants in this suit, which was commenced to February Term 1861, seven years after their father\u2019s purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">\u201c A party cannot call upon a court of equity for a specific performance, unless he has shown himself ready, desirous, prompt and eager:\u201d 3 White &amp; Tudor\u2019s Lead. Cas. in Equity 443. \u201c It would be dangerous to permit parties to lie by with a view to see whether the contract will prove a gaining or losing bargain, and according to the event, either to abandon it, or, considering time as nothing, to claim a specific performance, which is always the subject of discretion\u201d : Id. 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">If specific performance is sought by a purchaser, after he has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>permitted a long time to elapse without evincing a fixed intention to carry his contract into execution, especially if circumstances are altered, a court of equity will not decree it.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">If the party seeking performance is in <em>statu quo, </em>and sustains no loss by remaining so, and the circumstances are so altered as to the other party as to work great injustice to him and to purchasers from him, a court of equity will, in the exercise of its judicial discretion, utterly refuse to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">The plaintiff occupied the premises less than two years, and what was received did not pay the first year\u2019s interest; moves away, and disables himself, by a transfer, from claiming a specific performance for more than seven years, during which time the situation of the property has been entirely changed by money expended upon it by a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser, and a large increase in its actual value.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">It is not necessary to examine the charge in detail, or the exceptions to the rejection of evidence, for there is a cardinal error in putting such a ease to the jury without such instructions as must have produced a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
