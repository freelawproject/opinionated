Gourley, one on John Gourley and one on a man in the pines; don\u2019t recollect the name ; and he put a $5 bill and the notes in an envelope ; after he put them in he sealed it up and told me to give it to Tilda Linsenbigler, and said if he never came back he wanted her to get it, as he would rather she would get it than any other person; that he wanted her to have these notes, and would rather she would have them than any other person. He said to give it to her the first time I saw her, \u2014 the first time she would be in the village.

I forgot to put it in with the rest. I suppose he will think me very liberal, as he saw me put the bill in with the note. I would not let him see it, but could not help it. The store was full of people at the time, and I had to go back to his warehouse, and he went along with me ; but I do not care, as I trust I was leaving all with a true friend ; and if I do not get back, if you can get all I will be satisfied.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-12\">On the 6th of September he wrote to her from Washington: \u201c But I thought it more my duty to spend a few moments in conversing to you for this may be the last time; but I hope not.

Gourley, the decedent, to the plaintiff below, were <em>donationes mortis causd. </em>They were delivered by a soldier to the plaintiff or for her when he wa's going to the front, but months before his death and when he was neither in his last illness nor in <em>periculo mortis. </em>He said if he never came back he wanted her to get them, as he would rather she should get them than any one else. The gift is therefore not sustainable as a <em>donatio mortis causd, </em>and as there was no consideration can it be sustained on any other ground ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-7\">The ease most resembling this is <em>lie </em>Patterson Mitchell <em>v. </em>Smith, 33 Law Ins. Ch. 597, decided by the Lords Justices on the. 9th June 1864. The payee of three promissory notes executed the following endorsement, preceded by the delivery of them to the endorsee: \u201c I bequeath \u2014 pay the within contents to Simon Smith or his order at my death.\u201d There was a single witness to the payee\u2019s signature. In the act of the delivery of the notes the payee express\u00e9d an intention \u201c to be master of the notes as long as he lived.\u201d It was held that the transaction constituted aAestamentary gift and was as such void, there being only one witness. In Pennsylvania it would have been valid. \u201c It had occurred to me at one time,\u201d said Lord Justice Turner, \u201cthat the object of this form of endorsement might perhaps be, to enable the endorsee to hold the notes in trust, for the testator during his life and then for himself absolutely. But this construction would be inconsistent with the testator\u2019s expressed intention to remain master of the notes as long as he lived. \u201c The gift in my opinion was testamentary, and being incomplete is invalid. The right to negotiate a promissory note does not pass unless the requisite endorsement and delivery have been gone through.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-8\">These do not, therefore, appear to be testamentary gifts, nothing that can be construed into a will appearing in any part of the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-9\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded in both cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-10\">On the 6th of November 1865, a re-argument was ordered by the Supreme Court in both eases.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-11\"><em>Boggs </em>and <em>Purvianee, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABm\">\u2014 To constitute a <em>donatio mortis causd, </em>it must be in contemplation of death and the donor\u2019s supposed last illness: Hodge <em>v. </em>Hodge, 2 Vern. 615, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>2 Ves. 439, 442 ; Wells <em>v. </em>Tucker, 2 Binn. 370. A symbolical delivery is not sufficient. These notes required a transfer, and there was not a sufficient delivery: Miller <em>v. </em>Miller, 3 P. Wm. 357 ; 1 Story\u2019s Eq. \u00a7 607, c.; Bradley <em>v. </em>Hunt, 5 Gill &amp; Johns. 54; 1 Sharswood\u2019s Black. 514. Such gifts are against the policy of our laws: Wells <em>v. </em>Tucker, 3 Binn. 370; Priscilla E. Yarnall\u2019s Estate, 4 Rawle 62, 2 Johns. 502. Such gift is also subject to debts : 2 Ves. 115, 438 ; Drury <em>v. </em>Smith, 1 P. Wm. 406. The defendant as administrator had the right to receive the note, and what was left after payment of debts the plaintiff might receive in distribution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-6\"><em>Gbolden Neale, </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Anc\">\u2014 The gift was good as a will. Our Statute of Wills, \u00a7 8, Pamph. L., 250 Purd. 1017, provides that a mariner at sea, and a soldier in actual military service, may dispose of his movables as before the act: Hood on Executors 515.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-7\">Such wills require no formality: 1 Sharswood\u2019s Black. 417. The letters of deceased, particularly September 6th 1861, are a good military testament. He was in actual service ; letter written and signed by himself; words of gift unequivocal. This may he considered a gift <em>inter vivos ; </em>it was completely executed by a delivery of the gift in donor\u2019s life. His control over them depended upon a <em>condition subsequent: </em>Cross <em>v. </em>Cross, 8 Ad. &amp; E. N. S. 714; Redfield on Wills, Pt. 1, ch. 4, pp. 179, 180.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b348-8\">The actions are properly brought. Miss Linsenbigler could compel the administrator to allow the use of his name : Grover <em>v. </em>Grover, 24 Pick. 261.

F. Grourley, the decedent, but not endorsed by him, may be the subject of a <em>donatio mortis causd </em>according to the latest authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">A bond is a proper subject of a <em>donatio mortis causd: </em>Wells <em>v. </em>Tucker, 3 Binn. 370.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">So is a mortgage, also bills of exchange or promissory notes payable to order and unendorsed, and a policy of life assurance, and a banker\u2019s deposit note: Witt <em>v. </em>Amis, 1 B. &amp; S. 109 (101 E. C. L.) ; Amis <em>v. </em>Witt, 33 Beav. 619; Veal <em>v. </em>Veal, 27 Beav. 303; Rankin <em>v. </em>Weginlin, Id. 309; Sessions <em>v. </em>Mosely, 4 Cush. 87; 1 Story\u2019s Eq. 8th ed. 607. So giving an evidence of debt to a servant for the debtor, saying she wished the debt cancelled: Moore <em>v. </em>Darton, 7 Eng. L. &amp; Eq. 134. So a oheck on a banker: Boutts <em>v. </em>Ellis, 31 Eng. L. &amp; Eq. 174; see Harris <em>v. </em>Clark, 3 Comstock (N. Y.) 114. \u201c Besides formal legacies given by will, there is also permitted a death-bed disposition of property, called a <em>donatio mortis causd. </em>That is when a person in his sickness, apprehending his dissolution near, delivers or causes to be delivered any personal goods or chattels to another, or puts the physical means of dominion over them into his power, to keep them for himself, or for some one else in case of the donor\u2019s decease. The subject of the gift must be personal property in possession or in action. Bonds and mortgage-deeds so delivered, are effectual to pass the debt;' bills or checks drawn by the deceased on his banker, to pass the money. The delivery of a key has been deemed to amount to a delivery of the trunk and its contents. In the event of the donor recovering, the property reverts to him. If the donor die, the property belongs to the donee without the assent of the executor, though not as against creditors :\u201d 1 Spence\u2019s Equitable Jurisdiction 196. \u201c A claim to property on the ground of its having been a <em>donatio mortis causd </em>must fail, if it appear to be a transaction of present gift. A party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>making a <em>donatio mortis causd </em>does not part with the whole interest save only in a certain event; and it is of the essence of such a gift that it shall not otherwise take effect; hut words of absolute gift, if accompanied by expressions showing that the intention was, that the property should be enjoyed only in the event of the death of the donor, will be sufficient to constitute a <em>donatio mortis causd:\u201d </em>2 Id. 912. Judge Story in his Commentaries, vol. 1, \u00a7 607 a, says: \u201cWe have already seen that by our law there can be no valid donation <em>mortis </em>causd, 1st, unless the gift be with a view to the donor\u2019s death; 2d, unless it be conditioned to take effect only on the donor\u2019s death by his existing disorder, or in his existing illness:\u201d 3 Story\u2019s R. 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">It is evident that the language used by the authorities in speaking of \u2014 in contemplation of death \u2014 in expectation of death or in apprehension of death \u2014 applies to the cases of illness .ending in death, the last illness which makes it a death-bed disposition. If the donee dies before the donor, or the donor revokes the gift, there is no <em>donatio mortis causd.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">In Michener <em>v. </em>Dale, 11 Harris 59, the present chief justice gave a definition which I think accurate, and sustained by the authorities in England and America. \u201c <em>Donatio mortis causd </em>is a gift of a chattel, made by a person in his last illness, or in <em>periculo </em>mortis, subject to the implied conditions, that if the donor recover, or if the donee die first, the gift shall be void.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">To apply these authorities to the case before us, \u2014 B. E. G-ourley enlisted in the army in Captain Beck\u2019s company, on Saturday, 27th July 1861, and on the same day gave to Mr. Patterson two notes which are the subjects of the present suits, in an envelope directed to the plaintiff, \u201c and told him to give it to her, and said if he never came back he wanted her to get it, as he would rather she would get it than any other person, that he wanted her to have these notes, and would rather she should have them than any other person. He said to give it to her the first time I saw her, the first time she would be in the village. I got the envelope on Saturday and delivered it to her on the following Monday (29th July), sealed up just as I received it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">He said he would rather she should have them than anybody else. B. E. Gourley was in good health at the time of the delivery of the notes, joined the army, and remained in the service until he died of quinsy on Tuesday, 26th November 1861, four months after the gift.above stated. He was engaged to the plaintiff, and no doubt desired her to have these notes in case of his death; but it was not a <em>donatio mortis </em>causd, being made in full health and not in his last illness, or in <em>periculo </em>mortis, nor in contemplation or expectation or apprehension of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">Judgments in both cases reversed, and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded in both.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
