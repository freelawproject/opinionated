A. Husband </em>and <em>B. H. </em>Brewster, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azi\">The order to sell in the will did not work a present conversion. The power to sell is qualified by the authority \u201c to dispose of the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>estate for a term of years or otherwise,\u201d conveying no imperative order to sell, hut giving them power to <em>lease. \u25a0 </em>Every sentence and word must be considered in forming an opinion on a will: Turbett <em>v. </em>Turbett, 3 Yeates 187. The testatrix left room for other considerations, which might influence the executors after her death. The executors had an alternative, and there could be no present conversion: Nagle\u2019s Appeal, 1 Harris 262; Bleight <em>v. </em>The Bank, 10 Barr 131. But the conversion, if any, was afterwards defeated by the acts of the parties. They virtually elected to retain it as realty. The sale should have b.een in a reasonable time, but it remained unsold and in the enjoyment of the heirs, with the consent of the executors, for nearly six years. Joseph allowed his interest to be sold. The judgment against Joseph bound his fourth part of the realty, and all his interest passed to Brolasky.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b512-6\"><em>J. A. Qlay, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2k\">Allison\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Wilson\u2019s Executors, 13 S. &amp; R. 333, settled the law of equitable conversion in Pennsylvania. The party entitled to the propeeds has no estate in the land: Kramer <em>v. </em>Arthurs, 7 Barr 165; Morrow <em>v. </em>Brenizer, 2 Rawle 185. The discretion allowed to the executor which, according to Anewalt\u2019s Estate, 6 Wright 414, prevents conversion, is as to whether the land shall be sold or held as land. If there be a clear intention that the land shall be sold at all events, conversion takes place: Swann <em>v. </em>Fonnercan, 3 Ves. 47-50; Thornton <em>v. </em>Hawley, 10 Id. 129. Here the order is distinct, and the leading intention is that the land shall be turned into money. The power to lease cannot qualify the power to sell; that merely was granted to keep the property productive till sold.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-7\">The possession of the land by the heirs for six years will not raise an election to take as land. All must act: Miller <em>v. </em>Meetch, 8 Barr 417-425; Beatty <em>v. </em>Byers, 6 Harris 105; Fletcher <em>v. </em>Ashburner, 1 Bro. Ch. Ca. 497, 500, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b512-8\">The legacy of Joseph is contingent upon his surviving until the estate is settled; he is how dead; the settlement has been delayed by Brolasky.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"ArSO\">March 6th 1866,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b512-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b512-10\">Thompson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abe\">This is a clear case of a devise to executors to sell, and operated as a conversion of the realty into money from the moment of the decease of the testatrix, and thus was the descent broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">The words used are: \u201c And I order the same (the property real, personal and mixed) to be sold by my executrix and executor for its reasonable value, and the proceeds arising from the sale thereof shall be disposed of as hereinafter specified.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>There is no discretion left in the executors, and none is to be found within the four corners of the will. Indeed it is manifest that the intention of the testatrix could not be carried out by the executors without the sale, and this proves' with what intent the words were used. The intention of the testatrix in this as in other particulars is the governing rule. The clause following the words quoted do not modify their meaning, and this is evident from the whole will. They seem to have been used as directions to facilitate the power of the executors in making the sale, but they add nothing to their discretion. I incline to the argument of the defendant in error, that the words <em>\u201c </em>to dispose'of the real estate in fee simple, or for a term of years or otherwise,\u201d are intended to meet the case of a necessity which might exist, to postpone a sale to a time at which the property might be sold for its \u201c reasonable value.\u201d This would be very proper; but still the direction was to sell and distribute the proceeds. This was all that was necessary to work a conversion* The doctrine in' almost every conceivable aspect, seems well settled with us ; and amongst the many cases to be found are Allison\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Wilson\u2019s Executors, 13 S. &amp; R. 330, a case very much like this, in which the lien' was disallowed as here in the'court below; also Blight <em>v. </em>The Bank, 10 Barr 131; Parkinson\u2019s Appeal, 8 Casey 455; Anewalt\u2019s Appeal, 6 Wright 414; Chew <em>v. </em>Nicklin, 9 Id. 84. All these cases clearly show, and more might be cited, that a positive order or direction to sell in a will works a conversion of realty into money. That appears here, and nothing to contradict it. The court below were right, therefore, in holding that the appellant had no lien, and acquired no title to Joseph Gally\u2019s interest by the sale on execution to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">What was said about election by the heirs to take the realty, was outside of the case ; for not a single fact of which it was predicated, is to be found in the ease stated. This is our chart, and we follow it. _ I do not think it would have made any difference in the result if the facts had been stated, but it would be extra-judicial to express any very decided opinion about what is not before us. The case was rightly decided below, and the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
