On the 26th of September 1860, the viewers reported a road between the\u2019said points, which was read same day and so endorsed on the report. Nothing further was done until November 12th 1863, when a petition was presented reciting the laying out of the above road, and asking for the appointment of \u201c proper persons to review said road.\u201d Reviewers were appointed the same day, who reported a road. The report was filed January 8th 1864; and, after various proceedings in relation to it, the court, April 5th 1865, set aside the report of the viewers, confirmed the report of the reviewers and ordered the road to be opened forty feet wide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-9\">Part of the proceedings were \u201c a special plea\u201d to the petition for review and a \u201c demurrer\u201d to the plea, which are not referred to in the opinion of the Supreme Court, and are therefore not sot out here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-10\">Errors assigned are:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b296-11\">1.

That the reviewed road having been laid out over a private way, laid out by the owners of the soil, the court had no power to confirm said review, without the consent of the owners of the private way.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b296-13\"><em>White </em>and <em>Boyle, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXf8\">\u2014 The time fixed by the Act of Assembly for a review had long passed, and the report could not be acted on <em>nunc pro tunc: </em>Road in Reserve Township, 2 Grant 204; Baldwin and Snowden Road, 3 Id. 63; Chartiers Township Road, Pitts.

The Act of May 8th 1854 applies only to vacating private ways, and not to laying public roads over them.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A7K\">January 23d 1866,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b297-8\">Agnew, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acm7\">It is a fatal objection that the petition for a review in this case was not presented or acted upon until two years after filing of the original report. The 25th section of the General Road Law of 13th June 1836, directs a second view or review, \u201c provided that application therefor be made at or before the next term of the said court after the report upon the first view.\u201d This provision has always been looked upon as mandatory. There are good reasons founded in the necessity for speedy action, in order that the report upon the first view may be considered in due season, and while the parties are supposed to be in waiting to take care of their interests. Changes in the route of a road cannot be made unless by review until after confirmation of the report, and the road has been opened, in whole according to the Act of 1836, or in part under the Act of 3d May 1855; and certainly it is asking too much that the parties should be compelled to be in court for an indefinite length of time, to keep watch over the proceedings, and to see that the route originally viewed to their satisfaction, shall not be changed to their disadvantage by a review. The law has therefore fixed the next term after the report for the application for a review. Analogous principles were asserted in the cases of the Baldwin Road, 3 Grant 63, and the Heidelberg Road, 11 Wright 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">The petition for the review, and all the proceedings upon the same, are quashed and wholly set aside, and the order and decree setting aside the original report are quashed, and a <em>procedendo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
