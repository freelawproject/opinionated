Ch. Ca. 99. There are one or two cases, in Pennsylvania, apportioning annuities which, though in the current of authority, neither obstruct its uniformity or deflect its course.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b422-15\">Sweigart <em>v. </em>Frey, 8 S. &amp; R. 299. This case is relied on by the District Court, in Fisher <em>v. </em>Fisher, cited below, to authorize its decision. But an examination of the case will show that it was not a case of an annuity, but that the decision was based on its peculiar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>facts. Per Tilghman, C. J., page 305: The consideration of \u201c the bond (the interest on which was claimed to be apportionable) was a tract of land purchased by defendant, which had been devised to the widow for life, and, after her death, the land to be sold, and the proceeds of the sale divided. The widow and children came to an agreement to sell the land in her lifetime; and, in consideration of her joining in a deed to the defendant, she was to receive <em>the interest </em>of \u00bf61000 during her life, The objection is that the interest is payable <em>yearly, </em>but I apprehend that, in equity, in a <em>contract </em>like this, the <em>interest acames from, day to day. </em>Considering the <em>circumstances </em>and <em>family agreement </em>in in this case, to which <em>the defendant was a party, </em>it was a provision for the widow, for which she paid a valuable consideration.\u201d She conveyed (the land) to the defendant, and he enjoyed an estate -in the land during her life, for.which he agreed to pay the interest of \u00bf61000.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-6\">The next case is Gheen <em>v. </em>Osborn, 17 S. &amp; R. 171: <em>\u201c </em>The bequest was to my wife, the sum of $100, to be paid to her out of my estate, yearly, and every year during her life, in lieu of dower, and charged this annual sum on the plantation devised to his son, who was also his executor.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-7\">The whole reasoning of the opinion is predicated of the full identity between an annuity charged on land and dower.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-8\">Page 173: \u201c In case of intestacy, &amp;c., the widow\u2019s share is left in the lands and charged on them by law, and the interest to be paid annually,\u201d <em>\u201c </em>and is always payable up to the death of the widowand Huston, J., says it is settled by Sweigart <em>v. </em>Frey, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-9\">The next case is in the District Court, and ruled the case stated. It is reported in Am. Law Jour. Vol. IV., N. S., p. 539, as Fisher <em>v. </em>Fisher. Being their own decision, the court adhered to it \u201c until the Supreme Court reversed it.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-10\">The annuity was to be paid in <em>\u201c </em>equal quarterly payments, in each and every year, during her life, and to be paid out of the income of my real estate,\u201d and if the. real estate should be insufficient, then that a sufficient part of his personal estate should be invested <em>in securities </em>to make up any deficiency, so as to be paid without any abatement or deduction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-11\">After quoting Sweigart <em>v. </em>Frey and Gheen <em>v. </em>Osborn, the learned judge says, <em>11 after these cases, </em>the question can scarcely be considered an open one.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b423-12\"><em>John Cr. Johnson, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ayr\">Is an annuity, payable quarterly, given by a testator to his widow, in lieu of dower, apportionable, if she dies before the quarter-day ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b423-13\">Whilst the general principle in favour of a non-apportionment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>is beyond dispute, and needs no citations to sustain it, the above question has, by a host of decisions, been affirmatively decided. In favour of the presumed intention of the donor, courts of equity have established an exception in the case of gifts for <em>maintenance </em>of a wife, widow or child, now as strongly rooted as the rule, itself. Hay <em>v. </em>Palmer, 2 P. Wms. 501; Howell <em>v. </em>Hanforth, 2 W. Black. 1016; Webb <em>v. </em>Lord Shaftesbury, 11 Ves. 361; Regina <em>v. </em>Comms., 16 Ad. &amp; El. N. S. 357; Williams on Executors 747; Hill on Trustees 385.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-6\">The cases so copiously cited by plaintiff in error, from the textbooks \u2014 even Tracy <em>v. </em>Story, which at first seeqis otherwise \u2014 are all outside the favoured class, and do not therefore assist him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-7\">The greatest length to which the qualification in favour of <em>maintenance </em>has been extended is in Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Smithies, 16 Beav. 385, which decides that the income of a fund, having for its object the support, relief and maintenance of a master and five poor persons (strangers to the donor), is apportionable as between the executors of a deceased master and his successor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-8\">McKeen\u2019s Appeal, 6 Wright 484, recognises the exception in these words : \u201c There are a few cases to be found in which apportionment of an annuity, given for the <em>maintenance </em>of a widow, or for the separate maintenance of a wife, has been decreed. I know of none in which it has been decreed <em>against </em>such person.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-9\">In Fisher <em>v. </em>Fisher, 4 Am. Law Jour., N. S. 539, a testator bequeathed to his widow an annuity, \u201c to be paid to her in equal quarterly payments, in each and every year during her natural life.\u201d Apportionment was decreed in favour of her representatives.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-10\">So in Smith <em>v. </em>Wistar, 20 Leg Int. 68, where there was a devise of certain ground-rents, payable half yearly to testator\u2019s wife for life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-11\">In Sweigart <em>v. </em>Frey, 8 S. &amp; R. 299, Tilghman, C. J., after alluding to other qualifications of the strict common law, says : <em>\u201c </em>I apprehend the rule is the same where provision is made for a widow.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-12\">Gheen <em>v. </em>Osborn, 17 S. &amp; R. 171, is identical with the present case. The bequest was in these words: \u201c I do further bequeath to my said wife the sum of $100, to be paid to her out of my estate yearly, and every year during her natural life,\u201d * * * <em>\u201c </em>all which devises and bequests are given to my said wife in lieu of her dower.\u201d Testator died 16th May 1814; his wife died 22d March 1824, and her executor recovered the proportion from 16th May to 22d March.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b424-14\">Says Huston, J.,, <em>\u201c </em>Dower lasts during th\u00e9 life of the widow, and it would be strange if what is granted in place of it would not last as long. No testator ever desired <em>the last hours of his </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>widow should he dependent on charity. </em>It is in lieu of dower, and should last as long.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A9q\">January 20th 1866,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b425-5\">Woodward, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmS\">The annuity in this case was to a surviving widow, \u201c in lieu and full satisfaction of all dower,\u201d and was payable quarterly. She died in the midst of a quarter, and the question is, whether the annuity is apportionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The authorities so fully cited by the learned counsel of the plaintiff in error, prove the general rule of law to be that apportionment is not to be made of rents, dividends, annuities and other periodical payments becoming due at fixed intervals, but only of sums accruing <em>de die in diem. </em>But the same authorities establish an exception to the general rule in favour of dower and sums for the maintenance of a wife or child: Hill on Trustees 385; Gheen <em>v. </em>Osborne, 17 S. &amp; R. 171. And this case falls within the exception and not the rule. The annuity was in lieu of dower, and lasted as long as dower would have lasted, and dower runs to the last day of life. It is of no consequence that the widow was rich and could live without the annuity. Neither the rule nor its exception can be administered with a view to such circumstances. She was as well entitled to receive the equivalent for dower to the day of her death as if she had been dependent on it for her daily bread.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
