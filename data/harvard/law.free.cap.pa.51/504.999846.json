But it is my desire that the surplus income of my said real and personal estate that shall remain from time to time, after the appropriation of whatsoever part thereof she may require or expend for her own use, shall be divided by her among our children, share and share alike. It is my will that upon the decease of my said dear wife, all my real and personal estate (with the exception of the homestead place aforesaid, in Frank-ford, whereon I now reside) shall be valued and divided into as many parts, to be equal in value as near as may be, as I shall then have children living, the issue of any deceased child to represent their respective parent or parents; and each of such issue, if any, to be considered in the division as one part only; which valuation shall he made by three competent and disinterested persons, who shall be nominated and appointed by the surviving executors of this my will, hereinafter named, and the shares so divided shall be drawn for in the manner the persons making such division shall direct, so as to designate a particular share or part of my estate for each child, and for the issue of any deceased child to whom the same shall fall, upon each drawing.

The postponement is for a special purpose connected with the estate, not to suspend the vesting of the interests. The postponement of the division of the homestead was not intended to change the parties to take or their interests, for they take in the same manner as the other part of the residue. The expressions, \u201c as I shall have children living,\u201d and \u201c my said surviving children,\u201d import no other contingency than always exists as to the immediate remainder man; his outliving the particular tenant for the estate to vest in possession: Smith on Ex. Int., \u00a7\u00a7 180, 346, 517; Fearne, p. 241; Boraston\u2019s Case, 3 Rep. 19; Fortescue <em>v. </em>Abbott, Pollex. 479; Webb <em>v. </em>Hearing, Cro.

In McKee <em>v. </em>McKinley, 9 Id. 92, it Avas not suggested that the Ayords \u201c if any surviving\u201d made the remainder contingent. In Radcliff <em>v. </em>Bagshaw, 6 Term R. 512, the taking of the heirs after the life estate was made dependent on their ancestor outliving the life tenant. \u201c Issue\u201d is a word of limitation, unless there are expressions indicating that the testator-meant children: Smith on Ex. Int., \u00a7 514; 2 Jarvis on Wills, p. 246; George <em>v. </em>Morgan, 4 Harris 95. There is nothing here to indicate that issue was intended as anything but a word of limitation: Jones <em>v. </em>Morgan, 1 Bro. C. C. 216.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-6\">But if the words import a contingency, yet the plaintiffs are the heirs at laAV of the testator, and the fee descended on them till the contingency happens: Fearne 340; Smith, \u00a7 778; Bennett <em>v. </em>Morris, 5 Rawle 10.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-7\"><em>Charles E. Lex, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AyTc\">The words create a contingent remainder. The cases cited by the complainant are not analogous; a special person Avas named in whom the remainder was to vest. Radcliff <em>v. </em>Bagshaw, cited by complainant, is like this case. The parties to take cannot be determined until the death of the Avidow: Dunwoodie <em>v. </em>Reed, 3 S. &amp; R. 435, decides this case: Fearne on Con. Rem. 217, also p.8,\u00a7\u00a7 11,4; Smith <em>v. </em>Folwell, 1 Binn. 546. The point is positively decided in Harris <em>v. </em>McElroy, 9 Wright 216.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AZ0x\">March 6th 1866,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b507-9\">Thompson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoGW\">It is almost impossible to distinguish this case from Manderson <em>v. </em>Lukens, 11 Harris 31. The provision in the will there was, that upon the death or intermarriage' of the decedent\u2019s AvidoAV, his estate was to be equally divided between all his children \u201c Avhicli may then be alive, or who may have left legitimate heirs, share and share alike, &amp;c.\u201d The word \u201clegitimate heirs\u201d Avas construed \u201c issue,\u201d the Avord used in this case; thus making the resemblance very complete. It was held to be a vested remainder in the children of the testator, notwithstanding the division of the estate was not to take place until after the decease of the widoAV ; and there as here, the distribution or partition was to be to the heirs <em>then alive, </em>and to the issue of those who may have died. It was there held, on the authority of Kerlin <em>v. </em>Bull, 1 Dallas 175, and Frame <em>v. </em>Stewart, 5 Watts 433, to which might have been added many elementary citations, that the word \u201cwhen\u201d or \u201cAvhenever,\u201d referring to the time at which property is to be divided, will not be alloAved to make a devise to children contingent, for these Avords and their synonyms almost ahvays appear when a vested remainder is created. \u201c When\u201d and \u201c upon,\u201d referring to the time of performing an act, are substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>synonymous: Adams <em>v. </em>Williams, 2 W. &amp; S. 227. Passmore\u2019s Appeal, 11 Harris 381, seems also in point in this case. Mr. Eearne, p. 167, says, \u201c It sometimes happens that a remainder is limited in words which seem to import a contingency, though in fact they mean no more than would have been implied without them, or do not amount to a condition precedent, but only denote the time when the remainder is to vest in possession.\u201d This is exactly descriptive of the case in hand. The devise of the estate being to the widow for life, its division and enjoyment could not take place until after her estate was determined by death, and the reference to that as the period of division and enjoyment by the word <em>\u201c </em>upon,\u201d created no contingency of estate. A contingent remainder, is a remainder limited so as to depend on an event which may never happen or be performed, or which may not happen or be performed till after the preceding estate: Eearne, p. 3. The same author, at p. 217, observes: \u201c In short, upon a careful attention to the subject, we shall find that wherever the preceding estate is limited so as to determine on an event which certainly <em>must </em>happen, and the remainder is limited to a person <em>in esse, </em>that the preceding estate may by any means determine before the expiration of the estate limited in remainder, such remainder is vested.\u201d On the contrary, if the limitation is upon a condition which may never happen, or to a person not <em>in esse, </em>or so as to require the concurrence of some dubious uncertain event, independently of the determination of the preceding estate and the duration of the estate limited in remainder, to give it capacity of taking effect, there the remainder is contingent: Id. 217. Here the life or particular estate in the widow must certainly determine at no very remote period, and by no possibility could the remainders determine during the continuance of that estate, for they were to the several children, their heirs and assigns or issue, interchangeably, and each constituted a single unconditional estate in remainder. The devisees were all <em>in esse </em>and ascertained, and were the children of the devisor. It seems to us that there was nothing contingent in the interest devised, but only as to the time of enjoyment, and that would have no effect upon the character of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The first object of the testator\u2019s bounty was his widow, and the second his children ; and, in the event of death before partition, their issue. This designation of succession was nothing. It was what the law provides, and hence created no contingency of estate in his children. It is difficult to believe that the testator meant to do anything less than to divide his estate equally among his children at the times specified; and he directed, what the law would require, that the issue of any one of them having died, should represent his parent in the distribution, and of course in the succession. Were we to hold the estates devised to the children to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>contingent remainders, there being no trust of the estate created, the title would, on the death of the testator, descend to the children as the exact representatives of the ancestor, subject to the life estate, and thus, as was said in Manderson <em>v. </em>Lukens, <em>supra, </em>the children might have both a vested and contingent remainder, at least for a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The ground upon which these remainders are claimed to be contingent is the possibility of the decease of a child or children of the testator leaving issue, when partition was to be made, but who might be cut out by alienation before that time. The terms \u201cheir,\u201d \u201cissue,\u201d and the like, define the quantity of estate, and the heirs succeed to it on the death of the ancestor by law. In all such cases succession may be defeated by alienation of the ancestor. The reference to issue here, regarded the succession of the law, and created no contingency to prevent the estate devised to the children from being vested remainders. The law requires the construction to be made in doubtful cases in favour of vested in preference to contingent remainders, and indefeasible to defeasible estates. We hold that the remainders to the children in this case were vested, to be enjoyed <em>in futuro, </em>and that the deed of the widow and devisees for the property in question conveys a good title.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The decree at Nisi Prius must therefore be reversed, and a decree entered for complainants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
