As indemnity to Rowe, Goff delivered the tables to him at the time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-9\">There was evidence that whilst Rowe was removing the tables he was informed of the manner in which Goff held them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-10\">On the 7th March Sharp issued a replevin against Rowe for the tables; next day Goff executed a bill of sale of them and some.other articles to Rowe and one Fero, who was a creditor of Goff\u2019s, for the nominal price of $543, the consideration being Rowe\u2019s security and the debt to Fero, the amount of which did not appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-11\">The defendant claimed the property, and gave a claim property bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-12\">On the trial, the defendant submitted to the court the following points</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-13\">1. That the contract between plaintiff and O. A. Goff, offered in evidence, is a contract of sale of the tables in controversy by plaintiff to Goff \u2014 vesting the property in him, which he had a right to transfer, by sale or otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-14\">2. That if the jury find that the defendant held the tables as security for becoming bail for the appearance of Goff in the Court of Quarter Sessions of this county, and that he was liable to be damnified on account of being such bail, he has such a special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>property in. such tables as will prevent a recovery by plaintiff in this case. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-5\">The court (Derrickson, A. J.), charged the jury that, \u201cfrom an unsigned bill of purchase it would seem as if Goff had bought the billiard-tables in question of Sharp on 13th November 1863 for $750, on which there is a credit marked of .$200, but on the 16th following a written contract was executed by them, by which Sharp leased the tables to Goff for nine months at a rent of $550\u201d (stating the terms in detail). \u201c If the terms of the lease should be complied with, Sharp was to make out a bill of sale of the tables to Goff. They were taken by Goff to his house, but he made no payment as contemplated by the lease, and getting into \"some criminal difficulty, he pledged the tables to Rowe to indemnify him as bail for his appearance at court. Goff sold the articles, one-half to.Rowe and-the other half to Fero, a creditor of his, both of them having a knowledge of the lease of the property to Goff, and they were taken from Goff\u2019s to \u2022 some other place, probably the defendant\u2019s. If the facts were as thus stated, we should have to refuse an affirmative answer to the defendant\u2019s two propositions. The mere liability of Rowe as bail, and especially if not injured thereby, would not entitle him to hold the property from Sharp, if the terms of the lease had been violated by Goff, nor would his and Fero\u2019s subsequent purchase, with this knowledge of the manner in which the other held it, give them any additional or greater right to hold it from the lessee. * * * If the evidence is credited by the jury, the plaintiff is entitled to recover back his property.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">The defendant excepted to the charge of the court, and the jury having found for the plaintiff $561.46, the defendant brought the case into this court, and assigned the following errors:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-7\">1. The court erred in saying to the jury, \u201c Goff sold the articles, one-half to Rowe and the other half to Fero, a creditor of his, for $550, <em>loth of them having a knowledge of the lease of the property to Groff.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-8\">2. The court erred in not answering defendant\u2019s first point in the affirmative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-9\">3. The court erred in answering defendant\u2019s second point in the negative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-10\">3. The court erred in saying to the jury, \u201c the mere liability of Rowe as bail, and especially if not injured thereby, would not entitle him to hold the' property from Sharp if the terms of the lease had been violated by Goff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-11\">5. The court erred in charging the jury as follows: \u201cNor would his\u201d (Rowe\u2019s) \u201c and Fero\u2019s subsequent purchase with this knowledge of the manner the other held it, give them any additional or greater right to hold.it from the lessee.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number><em>Grant, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7k\">argued that there was no evidence that Rowe and Eero had any knowledge of the \u201c lease\u201d from Sharp to Goff, and that the court erred in positively asserting that there was such evidence that the bill of 13th November passed \u2018 the property to Goff, or at least that was for the jury ; that the agreement of November 16th did not change the property in the tables: Price <em>v. </em>McAllister, 3 Gr. 248 ; that Sharp left the tables with Goff at his own risk: Martin <em>v. </em>Mathiop, 14 S. &amp; R. 214 ; that it was an attempt on the part of Sharp to preserve a lien on .personal property severed from the possession, which is unlawful : Jenkins <em>v. </em>Eichelberger, 4 Watts 121; and that Goff had such an ownership as gave him a right to pledge them to Rowe, who therefore might retain them until he was indemnified.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b30-6\"><em>Pames O. </em>and <em>F.

But it is the character of the sale whieh must determine when the title vested. The bill of sale of the 13th November 1865 was not signed, and before Sharp, the manufacturer, parted with his possession, he had-.a right to dictate the terms of its transfer. He lived in the city of New York, and the tables were to be taken by Goff into Pennsylvania. The article of lease, as it is called, was the final act of the parties, executed, as its own provisions show, before Sharp had parted with his control. By its terms it is clearly a bailment for use (inaccurately termed a lease), with a provision for a sale in case the infice of the tables should be fully paid. The possession was delivered to Goff upon the express terms that he was to take the tables to his place of business in Pennsylvania, keep them, and not remove them without Sharp\u2019s written consent, and would surrender them at the end of nine months, or sooner, on Goff\u2019s failure to pay the instalments as they fell due ; and a title or bill of sale was only to be made on full payment of the price. The transaction is clearly a bailment of the possession, with an agreement for a future sale conditioned on the prepayment of the price. According to the authorities this is a valid contract, and can be enforced even against creditors: Myers <em>v. </em>Harvey, 2 Penna. R. 479; Clark <em>v. </em>Jack, 7 Watts 375. In the former, Gibson, C. J., says: \u201c As it appeared on the evidence the case seemed to be that of a bailment, with a superadded agreement to vest the title in the bailee' when he should pay a sum certain; and such an agreement is clearly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>sistent with public policy. No facility to fraudulent dealing is afforded by it that is not afforded in the same degree by a naked contract of bailment. Such a transaction includes two distinct but consistent contracts \u2014 the one taking effect if at all when the other is spent. The contract of bailment preserves the ownership of the bailor during the particular relation created by it, and the contract of sale which supersedes it transfers the title as soon as it is called into action by payment of the price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">In Clark <em>v. </em>Jack the contract was in writing, and in its governing features the exact counterpart of the case before us, while the conflict was with a creditor who had levied and sold the property' in the hands of the bailee as his property. Rose <em>v. </em>Story, 1 Barr 191, recognises these principles. fully, and to these we add as confirmatory Vandyke <em>v. </em>Christ, 7 W. &amp; S. 373; Henderson <em>v. </em>Lauck, 9 Harris 359 ; Linton <em>v. </em>Butz, 7 Barr 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Granting that a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser would be protected on the same footing as creditor, thpugh not within the express terms of the, statute of'13th Elizabeth, a position not now decided; in this case the plaintiff in error has but little to rest upon in the evidence. He took the tables only as a security, and while in the act of moving them he manifested his knowledge of the lease from Sharp to Goff, by inquiring whether it was good. Upon an examination of the charge as a whole, we do not discover that the fact of Bowe\u2019s knowledge was assumed or taken from the jury. The statement was manifestly hypothethical, for the judge adds: <em>\u201c </em>If the facts were as thus stated, we would have to refuse an affirmative answer to the defendant\u2019s two propositions ;\u201d and concludes by referring the evidence to the credence of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
