CROTTY, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">The five consolidated actions in this matter involve personal injury lawsuits against Defendant and Third-Party Plaintiff National Railroad Passenger Corp. (\u201cAmtrak\u201d), resulting from an accident at a work project inside the East River Tunnel in New York City. The issue before the Court is Amtrak\u2019s dispute over indemnification provisions in its contracts with Third-Party Defendants Crescent Contracting (\u201cCrescent\u201d), STV, Inc. (\u201cSTV\u201d), Hatch Mott MacDonald, Inc. (\u201cHMM\u201d), and STV/HMM, a joint venture of STV and HMM. Amtrak seeks indemnification from Crescent, STV, HMM, and STV/ HMM for the personal injury lawsuits filed by the employees of the Third-Party Defendants. Amtrak moves for partial summary judgment on this issue and HMM cross-moves for summary judgment seeking dismissal of Amtrak\u2019s claims for indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-14\">The Court assumes the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of the cases, also available in Magistrate Judge Gorenstein\u2019s Report and Recommendation (\u201cR &amp; R\u201d) at 404-20. In brief, Amtrak and the Third Party Defendants entered into contracts in 2001 and 2002 whereby Third Party Defendants would install interim dry fire standpipe systems inside the East River Tunnel and perform construction management services on the project (the \u201cStandpipe Project\u201d). (R&amp;R 404-06.) The contracts included indemnification clauses protecting Amtrak from liability to the Third-Party Defendants\u2019 employees. <em>(Id.) </em>On July 9, 2004, an Amtrak employee lost control of a crane on a separate project approximately one mile away from the Standpipe Project. The crane moved toward the Standpipe Project and ultimately collided with trucks at the Standpipe Project worksite, injuring employees of the Third Party Defendants. <em>(Id. </em>406-07.) The individual plaintiffs sued Amtrak for their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">The Court referred the general pretrial matters in these cases to Magistrate Judge Gorenstein on May 27, 2005.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Amtrak filed its motions for partial summary judgment on February 5, 2008, and HMM cross-moved for summary judgment on March 12, 2008. Magistrate Judge Goren-stein issued his R &amp; R on February 23, 2009, recommending that this Court grant Amtrak\u2019s motions and deny HMM\u2019s motions. The R&amp;R provided ten days for written objections, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1) and Rule 72(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The R&amp;R specifically advised that if a party failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>file timely objections, that party \u201cwill not be permitted to raise any objections to the Report and Recommendation on appeal.\u201d (R &amp; R 419-20.) No objections have been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u201cTo accept the report and recommendation of a magistrate, to which no timely objection has been made, a district court need only satisfy itself that there is no clear error on the face of the record.\u201d <em>Wilds v. United Parcel Serv., </em>262 F.Supp.2d 163, 169 (S.D.N.Y.2003). Upon review and analysis, the Court finds no clear error and agrees with Magistrate Judge Gorenstein\u2019s determinations that:</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">1) The term \u201carising out of\u2019 within the indemnification provision of the Crescent and Amtrak contract covers the circumstances of the injuries in this case and the language obligates Crescent to defend and indemnify Amtrak against the personal injury claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">2) The contract between STV/HMM and Amtrak unambiguously and without limitation states that it will indemnify and hold Amtrak harmless for any claims arising from injuries to STV/HMM employees, and Amtrak may enforce this provision against STV/HMM. The indemnification clause does not limit itself to services performed pursuant to the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">3) HMM must indemnify Amtrak for Plaintiff Cevasco\u2019s claims because Cevasco was an agent of the joint venture of STV/ HMM, and HMM is jointly responsible for STV/HMM\u2019s obligations under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">4)Amtrak did not materially breach the contract by failing to inform STV/HMM of other projects in the tunnels because: A) the contract did not require such information; and B) the failure to inform STV/ HMM did not substantially frustrate the purpose of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">Accordingly, the Court accepts and adopts the Report and Recommendation as its opinion. Amtrak\u2019s motions for partial summary judgment are GRANTED, and HMM\u2019s motions for summary judgment are DISMISSED. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the motions at Docket # 220 in 04 Civ. 5760; Docket # 133 in 05 Civ. 7419; Docket # 87 in 06 Civ. 6195; Docket # 91 in 06 Civ. 6196; Docket # 75 in 06 Civ. 6956; Docket #248 in 04 Civ. 5760; and Docket # 158 in 05 Civ. 7419.

GORENSTEIN, United States Magistrate Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b444-15\">In five consolidated actions, defendant and third-party plaintiff National Railroad Passenger Corp. (\u201cAmtrak\u201d) moves for partial summary judgment against third-party defendants Crescent Contracting (\u201cCrescent\u201d), STV, Inc. (\u201cSTV\u201d), Hatch Mott MacDonald, Inc. (\u201cHMM\u201d), and STV/ HMM, a joint venture of HMM and STV (\u201cSTV/HMM\u201d), based on contractual indemnification provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> HMM has cross-moved for summary judgment dismissing Amtrak\u2019s indemnification claims against it. For the reasons stated below, Amtrak\u2019s motion for partial summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>judgment should be granted, and HMM\u2019s cross-motion should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">A. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">On November 7, 2002, Amtrak entered into a contract with Crescent to install interim manual dry fire standpipe systems inside the East River Tunnel in New York City (the \u201cStandpipe Project\u201d). <em>See </em>Construction Contract (\u201cCrescent Contract\u201d) (annexed as Ex. A to Declaration of Ronald E. Joseph in Support of Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment (\u201cJoseph Deck\u201d), filed Feb. 5, 2008 (Docket #221)), \u00b61. Paragraph 68 of the Crescent Contract addressed indemnification, stating in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">68.0 <em>INDEMNIFICATION</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">68.1 Contractor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Amtrak ... irrespective of any negligence or fault on their part, from and against any and all losses and liabilities, penalties, fines, forfeitures, demands, claims, causes of action, suits, costs, and expenses incidental thereto (including costs of defense and attorneys\u2019 fees), which any or all of them may hereafter incur, be responsible for or pay as a result of injury or death of any person ... arising out of or in any degree directly or indirectly caused by or resulting from materials, products or equipment supplied by, or from activities of, or Work performed by Contractor ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">68.2 Contractor shall be responsible for all damages and expenses on account of injuries (including death) to any of its employees, agents or subcontractors while on the premises of Amtrak and shall indemnify, defend, and hold Amtrak harmless from all claims or damage suits which may arise in consequence of such injuries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">Crescent Contract, General Provisions (\u201cCrescent Contract Gen.\u201d), \u00b6 68. The contract further provided that Crescent would be \u201csolely responsible for providing a safe place for the performance of the Work,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 61.1; that it would be \u201csolely responsible for initiating, maintaining and supervising all safety precautions and programs in connection with the Work,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that it \u201cshall take all precautions necessary for the safety of, and shall provide all protection necessary to prevent damage, injury or loss to ... [a]ll employees involved in the Work,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 61.2. It also stated that \u201cAmtrak assumes no responsibility or liability for the physical condition or safety of the work site or any improvements located thereon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00b6 61.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">On December 11, 2001, Amtrak entered into a contract with the joint venture STV/ HMM to perform construction management services in relation to the Standpipe Project. <em>See </em>Services Contract (annexed as Ex. H to Joseph Deck) (\u201cSTV/HMM Contract\u201d). Paragraph 35 of the STV/ HMM Contract addressed indemnification, stating in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-13\">35. INDEMNIFICATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-14\">A. Contractor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Amtrak ... from and against any and all losses and liabilities, penalties, fines, forfeitures, demands, claims, causes of action, suits, costs and expenses incidental thereto, (including costs of defense and attorneys\u2019 fees), which any or all of them may hereafter incur, be responsible for or pay as a result of injury or death of any person ... to the extent arising from the negligent acts, negligent omissions, or willful misconduct in the Services performed by Contractor ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-15\">B.

In a separate Joint Venture Agreement, dated the same day as the STV/HMM Contract with Amtrak, STV and HMM together created the joint venture STV/HMM, and agreed that they would be jointly and severally liable to Amtrak. <em>See </em>Joint Venture Agreement (annexed as Ex. I to Joseph Decl.), \u00b6\u00b6 2.1,15.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">On the night of July 9, 2004, at least two separate work groups were scheduled to work projects in the East River Tunnel: (1) Crescent employees, an STV safety engineer, HMM engineers, and Amtrak pilots working on the Standpipe Project at the east portal of Tunnel Line 1, <em>see </em>Deposition of Howard Carter, Jr. (\u201cCarter Dep.\u201d) (annexed as Ex. A to Affidavit in Opposition (\u201cKalman Aff.\u201d), filed Mar. 12, 2008 (Docket # 243)), at 40-41; Deposition of Louis Cevasco (\u201cCevasco Dep.\u201d) (annexed as Ex. E to Kalman Aff. and as Ex. B to Joseph Decl.), at 45-47; and (2) Amtrak employees replacing a \u201cbuss breaker\u201d approximately 1 mile east of the Standpipe Project, <em>see </em>Carter Dep. at 40, 42-43; Deposition of David Zwolinski (annexed as Ex. J to Kalman Aff.), at 25-26. Plaintiffs were part of the group working on the Standpipe Project.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The work group that was replacing the breaker was using a Terex crane. <em>See </em>Deposition of Brian Earp (annexed as Ex. M to Joseph Decl. and as Ex. K to Kalman Aff.), at 21. At about 3:40 a.m. on July 10, 2004, an Amtrak employee lost control of the crane, which began moving west toward the Standpipe Project work site. <em>See id. </em>at 42, 56-57; Deposition of David Rollins (\u201cRollins Dep.\u201d) (annexed as Ex. G to Kalman Aff. and as Ex. 0 to Joseph Decl.), at 71, 75-78, 84. The crane operator, believing the crane was going to derail at the next switch, jumped off. <em>See </em>Rollins Dep. at 78-81, 99-100. The crane continued on the tracks, however, and ultimately collided with the Crescent trucks at the Standpipe Project work site, where plaintiffs were working. <em>See </em>Deposition of Girolamo Vitale (annexed as Ex. A to Crescent Mem.), at 143-45; Deposition of Edley Gayle (annexed as Ex. F to Crescent Mem.), at 130-33; Cevasco Dep. at 84, 87; Deposition of Jugal Sood (annexed as Ex. K to Crescent Mem.), at 259-61; Rollins Dep. at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">B. <em>Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXB\">Plaintiffs brought separate actions against Amtrak for personal injuries allegedly sustained in the collision. <em>See </em>Cevasco Fourth Am. Compl., filed Apr. 19, 2007 (Docket # 159); Sood Second Am. Compl., filed Apr. 19, 2007 (05 Civ. 7419, Docket # 80); Adornetti First Am. Compl., filed Apr. 19, 2007 (06 Civ. 6195, Docket # 44); Vitale Compl.; Gayle Compl. Amtrak filed a third-party complaint against Crescent, STV, HMM, and STV/HMM, as well as others. <em>See </em>Third Am. Third-Party Complaint, filed Jan. 7, 2008 (Docket # 213) (\u201cAmtrak Compl.\u201d), \u00b6\u00b6 112-193. Crescent, STV, HMM, and STV/HMM filed counter-claims against Amtrak. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Crescent\u2019s Answer to Third Am. Complaint, filed Mar. 12, 2008 (Docket # 242);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> HMM\u2019s Answer to Third Am. Third-Party Complaint, filed Mar. 24, 2008 (Docket #256), \u00b6\u00b6 278-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Amtrak filed the instant motion for partial summary judgment on February 5, 2008.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In its motion, Amtrak asserts that Crescent is contractually obligated to defend and indemnify it against the claims of all plaintiffs in these actions, <em>see </em>Amtrak Mem. at 1-2, 15; Amtrak Reply Mem. at 6-12, and that STV, HMM, and STV/HMM are obligated to defend and indemnify it against the claims of Cevasco and Sood, the two plaintiffs employed by STV and HMM, <em>see </em>Amtrak Mem. at 2, 15-16; Amtrak Reply Mem. at 12-17. Crescent, HMM, and STV, together with the joint venture STV/HMM, have submitted papers opposing the motions, raising various overlapping arguments, all of which are disposed of in the course of our discussion below. For the sake of clarity, we refer to the arguments made in the brief jointly filed by STV and the joint venture STV/ HMM as the arguments of STV.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Additionally, HMM filed a cross-motion for summary judgment against Amtrak, seeking dismissal of Amtrak\u2019s contractual indemnification claims on the same grounds it opposes Amtrak\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While HMM did not seek summary judgment against STV, STV has asserted in response to HMM\u2019s cross-motion that, if it is found to have any indemnification obligation, that obligation must be shared between STV and HMM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>pursuant to the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement. <em>See </em>STV Reply Mem. at 7-10. While we address all of HMM\u2019s arguments with respect to Amtrak below, we do not address the question of sharing the indemnification obligation inasmuch as neither HMM nor STV has moved for summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">11. <em>APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">A. <em>Law Governing Motions for Summary Judgment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). A genuine issue of material fact \u201cmay reasonably be resolved in favor of either party\u201d and thus should be left to the finder of fact. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, courts must resolve all ambiguities and draw all factual inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>at 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (citing <em>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co., </em>398 U.S. 144, 158-59, 90 5.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970)). Nevertheless, once the moving party has shown that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law, the non-moving party \u201cmust come forward with \u2018specific facts showing there is a <em>genuine issue for trial,\u2019 \u201d Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)) (emphasis in original), and \u201cmay not rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated speculation,\u201d <em>Jeffreys v. City of New York, </em>426 F.3d 549, 554 (2d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Fujitsu Ltd. v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>247 F.3d 423, 428 (2d Cir.2001)). In sum, the nonmovant must offer \u201cconcrete evidence from which a reasonable juror could return a verdict in his favor.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">B. <em>Choice of Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">Both the Crescent Contract and the STV/HMM Contract provide that they shall be \u201cgoverned by and construed in accordance with the laws of the District of Columbia without regard to choice of law considerations.\u201d Crescent Contract Gen. \u00b6 81.1; STV/HMM Contract Gen. \u00b623. \u201cAbsent fraud or violation of public policy, a court is to apply the law selected in the contract as long as the state selected has sufficient contacts with the transaction.\u201d <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Orient Overseas Containers Lines (UK) Ltd., </em>230 F.3d 549, 556 (2d Cir.2000) (citing <em>Int\u2019l Minerals &amp; Res., S.A. v. Pappas, </em>96 F.3d 586, 592 (2d Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">Here, Amtrak is incorporated and has its principal place of business in the District of Columbia. <em>See </em>Declaration of Marvin D. Smith, dated Feb. 1, 2008 (annexed as Ex. Q to Joseph Deck), \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Moreover, the parties do not dispute that the law of the District of Columbia governs the contracts, and they have relied upon that law in their arguments. <em>See </em>Amtrak Mem. at 11-13; Crescent Mem. at 9-10; STV Mem. at 22-24, 27-28; HMM Mem. at 6-7, 11-18. Accordingly, the Court will apply the substantive law of the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>C. <em>Construction of a Contract Containing an Indemnification Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has summarized a court\u2019s role in interpreting a contract as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aag\">\u201cFundamentally, when interpreting a contract, \u2018the court should look to the intent of the parties entering into the agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Dodek v. CF 16 Corp., </em>537 A.2d 1086, 1093 (D.C.1988) ] (quoting <em>Intercounty Constr. Corp. v. District of Columbia, </em>443 A.2d 29, 32 (D.C. 1982)[) ] (citation omitted). The question of intent is resolved by an objective inquiry, and \u201c[t]he first step\u201d is therefore to determine \u201cwhat a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought the disputed language meant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Intercounty Constr. Corp., </em>443 A.2d at 32). Contractual provisions are interpreted taking into account the contract as a whole, so as to give effect, if possible, to all of the provisions in the contract. <em>See [Akassy v. William Penn Apts., Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>891 A.2d 291, 303 (D.C.2006) ] (noting that \u201c[w]e construe the contract as a whole, giving effect to each of its provisions, where possible\u201d) (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\"><em>Steele Foundations, Inc. v. Clark Constr. Group, Inc., </em>937 A.2d 148, 154 (D.C.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">With respect to the use of extrinsic evidence to interpret a contract, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">\u201cThe meaning of an integrated contract is an issue for the finder of fact only if the contractual language is ambiguous, ..., <em>i.e., </em>where its interpretation depends upon the credibility of extrinsic evidence or upon a choice of reasonable inferences from such evidence.\u201d <em>Dodek v. CF 16 Corp., </em>537 A.2d 1086, 1092 (D.C.1988) (citing <em>Int\u2019l Bhd. of Painters &amp; Allied Trades v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>388 A.2d 36, 43 (D.C.1978)). Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law for the court to determine, reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 1092; <em>Akassy v. William Penn Apts., Ltd. P\u2019ship., </em>891 A.2d 291, 299 (D.C.2006). In determining whether a contract is ambiguous, the court must consider that \u201ccontracts are not rendered ambiguous by the mere fact that the parties do not agree upon their proper construction.\u201d <em>Dodek, </em>537 A.2d at 1093 (quoting <em>Holland v.

Crescent does not cite any authority for this proposition and the Court is unaware of any bar under District of Columbia law that would prevent a party from seeking summary judgment as to an indemnity obligation where, as here, there is a broad indemnification clause that includes a duty to defend, a lawsuit has actually been filed against the indemnitee, and the indemnitee\u2019s claim is being brought as a third party action. <em>See generally Harris v. Rivera, </em>921 F.Supp. 1058, 1062 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (permitting such a suit under New York law). In the absence of the citation of a single case from the District of Columbia (or any other jurisdiction) stating otherwise, Amtrak\u2019s claim cannot be dismissed on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">It appears that Crescent\u2019s real argument is that there may be circumstances under which it would have no indemnification obligation under the Amtrak contract. Specifically, Crescent asserts that it should not be liable if punitive damages were awarded based on Amtrak\u2019s gross negligence or \u201cwanton, reckless and willful disregard for the safety of the plaintiffs and the general public.\u201d <em>See </em>Crescent Mem. at 10, 23-24. HMM makes a similar argument, asserting that indemnity cannot cover \u201creckless, wanton or willful misconduct.\u201d HMM Mem. at 15-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">In response, Amtrak has stated that it seeks a ruling only regarding the parties\u2019 duty to defend and Amtrak\u2019s right to indemnification against any \u201ccompensatory damage claims.\u201d <em>See </em>Amtrak Reply Mem. at 21 &amp; n. 10. Thus, we take Amtrak\u2019s response to mean that is seeking partial summary judgment on the question of whether Crescent, STV, HMM, and STV/ HMM are obligated to defend Amtrak and whether they are obligated to indemnify Amtrak against claims arising out of Amtrak\u2019s ordinary negligence. Accordingly, Amtrak\u2019s summary judgment motion is construed as a motion for \u201cpartial\u201d summary judgment with respect to its claim of indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">B. <em>Indemnification Under the Crescent Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">Paragraph 68.1 of the Crescent Contract provides that Crescent must indemnify Amtrak for any personal injury claims \u201carising out of or in any degree directly or indirectly caused by or resulting from\u201d the \u201cactivities of, or Work performed by\u201d Crescent. Crescent Contract Gen. \u00b6 68.1. Crescent does not dispute that all five plaintiffs were working on the Standpipe Project, which was the \u201cWork performed by\u201d Crescent under the contract. <em>See </em>Crescent Mem. at 2-3; Defendant/Third-Party Plaintiffs 56.1 Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, filed Feb. 5, 2008 (Docket # 222), \u00b6\u00b6 10, 31, 35, 43, 44, 47; Defendant/Third-Party Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>dant Crescent Contracting, Inc.\u2019s Statement of Material Facts, filed Mar. 12, 2008 (Docket # 253), \u00b6\u00b6 10, 31, 35, 43, 44, 47. Rather, Crescent argues that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims do not \u201caris[e] out of\u2019 Crescent\u2019s work on the Standpipe Project because their injuries were caused by an instrumentality that originated on another, unrelated project: that is, the crane from the breaker project that collided with the Crescent trucks at the Standpipe Project. <em>See </em>Crescent Mem. 10-11; 13-21. Crescent argues that it has no liability because \u201c[tjhere was no causal connection between the crane and Crescent\u2019s work beyond the mere presence of the plaintiffs on Crescent\u2019s trucks when the free wheeling crane hit it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11. Crescent notes that the \u201ccrane was in no way associated with Crescent\u2019s work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In other words, Crescent reads the words \u201carising out of ... the .. Work performed by [Crescent]\u201d as limited to injuries that were actually caused by an incident originating from the Crescent site. In Crescent\u2019s view, because the original cause of the injuries was the release of the crane at the breaker project site, the injuries the crane caused at the Standpipe Project work site do not come within the indemnification clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The Court rejects this reading of the clause as inconsistent with its plain and unambiguous meaning. The term \u201carising out of\u2019 is \u201cbroad and sweeping.\u201d <em>See W.M. Schlosser Co., </em>673 A.2d at 653; <em>accord id. </em>at 654 (\u201carising out of\u2019 characterized as \u201call-embracing\u201d) (citation omitted). The injuries to the various individuals at the Crescent site \u201carose out of\u2019 their work there, even though the cause of the injuries emanated from a spatially distant source.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">The parties have not cited to a District of Columbia case on point. Nonetheless, the case of <em>Mead v. National Railroad Passenger Corp., </em>676 F.Supp. 92 (D.Md. 1987), is instructive. In <em>Mead, </em>an Amtrak train passing by a work site struck a contractor\u2019s automatic welder on the site, pieces of which then struck an employee. 676 F.Supp. at 95-96. Applying District of Columbia law, <em>Mead </em>concluded that the employee\u2019s injuries occurred \u201cas a result of\u2019 the work performed by the contractor. <em>Id. </em>at 96.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If anything, the term \u201cas a result of\u2019 is less encompassing than the term \u201carises out of.\u201d Nonetheless, <em>Mead </em>found the injuries to have occurred \u201cas a result of\u2019 the contractor\u2019s work because \u201c[b]ut for the presence of this welder, with which [the contractor] was performing work for Amtrak, [the] injuries would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">Numerous cases in other jurisdictions have interpreted the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 or \u201carises out of\u2019 to apply to situations where some external cause generated the injuries at issue. Thus, in <em>Vitty v. D.C.P. Corp., </em>268 N.J.Super. 447, 633 A.2d 1040 (App.Div.1993), an employee of a towing contractor was seated in a parked tow truck in a designated area when the tow truck was struck by another vehicle that was forced off the road by a drunk driver. 268 N.J.Super. at 450-51, 633 A.2d 1040. Noting that \u201cthe words \u2018arising out of should be construed in accordance with their common and ordinary meaning as referring to a claim \u2018growing out of or having its \u2018origin in\u2019 the subject matter of the towing agreement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 453, 633 A.2d 1040, the Court concluded that, because the employee was \u201con duty and acting in the performance of his employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>responsibilities,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 451, 633 A.2d 1040, his injuries arose out of the performance of the contract, <em>id. </em>at 453, 633 A.2d 1040, even if the injuries \u201cresulted from a freak accident that perhaps could not have been envisioned by the parties,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">In <em>Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. E.E. Cruz &amp; Co., </em>475 F.Supp.2d 400 (S.D.N.Y.2007), property that had been left on a work site by a city contractor was damaged when the city connected a nearby sewer pipe prematurely. 475 F.Supp.2d at 403. Although the contractor was not actively working at the time, and \u201cthe cause of the occurrence was allegedly unrelated to ... work under the Contract,\u201d these circumstances \u201cd[id] not preclude the claim from \u2018aris[ing] out of [the contractor\u2019s] \u2018ongoing operations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411. The Court gave a broad construction to the term \u201carising out of,\u201d noting that \u201c[t]he New York Court of Appeals has held that the phrases \u2018based on\u2019 and \u2018arising out of ... are unambiguous and legally indistinguishable, and that both call for the application of a \u2018but-for\u2019 causation test in order to determine coverage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409 (citation and some quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Case law is replete with similar fact patterns \u2014 that is, situations where an injury or claim was held to \u201carise out of\u2019 work at a location even though the actual cause of the injury originated from matters remote from the work at the site itself. <em>See, e.g., Hoffman Constr. Co. of Alaska v. U.S. Fabrication &amp; Erection, Inc., </em>32 P.3d 346, 357 (Alaska 2001) (injuries held to \u201carise out of\u2019 steel work where the wind blew scraps of asbestos onto the work site) (\u201cthe phrase \u2018arising out of [the indemnitor\u2019s] performance\u2019 is very broad and includes claims for any injuries sustained by the indemnitor\u2019s employees while on the job\u201d); <em>Perkins v. Rubicon, Inc., </em>563 So.2d 258, 259 (La.1990) (where employee was injured at the contractor\u2019s work site because plant owner accidentally released toxic gas at an unrelated work site, employee\u2019s injuries were held to be \u201carising out of\u2019 the performance of the contract inasmuch as the employee \u201cwould not have been present at the site to be injured but for the performance of work under the contract\u201d); <em>Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>203 A.D.2d 83, 83, 610 NY.S.2d 219 (1st Dep\u2019t 1994) (where subcontractor\u2019s employee was injured by steam valve, employee\u2019s injuries arose out of his work because the term \u201carising out of [the contractor\u2019s] operations ... focuses not upon the precise cause of the accident ... but upon the general nature of the operation in the course of which the injury was sustained\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Courts construing the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 in the context of indemnity agreements have recognized that it refers to \u201cthe scope of the employment of the person injured and the site of the occurrence,\u201d <em>George A. Fuller Co. v. Fischbach &amp; Moore, Inc., </em>7 A.D.2d 33, 35, 180 N.Y.S.2d 589 (1st Dep\u2019t 1958), <em>lv. denied, </em>6 N.Y.2d 705, 187 N.Y.S.2d 1025, 159 N.E.2d 355 (1959) \u2014 that is, not to the original cause of the injury. <em>See also Wallace v. Sherwood Constr. Co., </em>877 P.2d 632, 634 (Okla.App. 1994) (because the injured employee \u201cwas on the job site as [the subcontractor\u2019s] agent, performing duties required ... under the subcontract,\u201d and \u201c[b]ut for this performance of the subcontract, [he] would not have been injured,\u201d the injuries arose out of the performance of the subcontract).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">In arguing that the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 requires something more than the \u201cmere presence of the injured parties on the work site,\u201d Crescent relies primarily on <em>Bland v. L\u2019Enfant Plaza North, </em>473 F.2d 156 (D.C.Cir.1972), and <em>National Union Fire Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh v. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, </em>261 A.D.2d 259, 690 N.Y.S.2d 260 (1st Dep\u2019t), <em>lv. denied, </em>94 N.Y.2d 754, 701 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>N.Y.S.2d 340, 723 N.E.2d 89 (1999). <em>See </em>Crescent Mem. at 15-16. <em>Bland v. L'Enfant Plaza North, </em>however, is irrelevant to this case. <em>Bland </em>held only that a broad indemnification clause does not exclude losses caused by the indemnitee\u2019s own negligence. 473 F.2d at 157. Indeed, a party in <em>Bland </em>attempted to argue, as Crescent does here, that the mere presence of the employees on the work site when they were injured was insufficient to establish that the injuries \u201carose out of\u2019 the work, and the Court characterized this argument as \u201cseekfing] to have us split hairs.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><em>National Union Fire Insurance Co. </em>did not involve a workplace injury but rather a provision in a hotel\u2019s lease agreement requiring the lessor to indemnify the landowner for any injuries arising out of the \u201cuse or occupancy\u201d of the hotel premises. 261 A.D.2d at 259-60, 690 N.Y.S.2d 260. The court held that injuries in the hotel resulting from the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center did not come within this clause. <em>Id. </em>at 260, 690 N.Y.S.2d 260. In support of this conclusion, the court cited to only one other case, <em>Sea Insurance Co. v. Westchester Fire Insurance Co., </em>849 F.Supp. 221, 226 (S.D.N.Y.1994), <em>aff'd, </em>51 F.3d 22 (2d Cir.1995), which was construing an insurance policy\u2019s exclusion of coverage for injuries arising out of \u201cany premises owned or rented to any insured\u201d where the premises was \u201cnot an insured location.\u201d 849 F.Supp. at 224. <em>Sea Insurance Co. </em>found that this clause did not exclude coverage for injuries caused by an automobile driven by a person employed at the location merely because she was on the way to the location, and not at the location, at the time the accident occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 226. It is difficult to see how <em>Sea Insurance Co. </em>supports the conclusion of the Court in <em>National Union Fire Insurance Co., </em>which involved injuries to persons actually in the covered premises. In any event, the fact that <em>National Union Fire Insurance Co. </em>was not construing whether an injury arose out of work at a work site; that application of its rule here would be inconsistent with other New York cases, such as <em>Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>203 A.D.2d 83, 83, 610 N.Y.S.2d 219 (1st Dep\u2019t 1994); and that such application is also inconsistent with the broad interpretation given to the term \u201carising out of\u2019 by the District of Columbia courts, it does not alter our conclusion as to the plain meaning of the contract language in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Crescent also relies on <em>Rivers &amp; Bryan, Inc. v. HBE Corp., </em>628 A.2d 631 (D.C. 1993). <em>See </em>Crescent Mem. at 14. But that case involved a contract in which indemnification was limited to losses \u201cresulting from subcontractor\u2019s failure\u201d to \u201ccomply with all federal, state and local statutes and/or ordinances relating to the performance of this subcontract.\u201d 628 A.2d at 634. Here, there was no limitation at all as to the cause of the damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Crescent further argues that the word \u201carise\u201d includes \u201can expression of causation flowing from the work, not to the workers or the worksite.\u201d Crescent Mem. at 17. It is not clear what Crescent means by this argument. What is clear, however, is that the definitions supplied by Crescent of the term \u201carise\u201d \u2014 including \u201cto originate from a source\u201d and \u201cto come into being or to attention\u201d \u2014 contain no element of causation. As previously discussed, Crescent does not contend that the plaintiffs were injured at their homes, on their way to work, or at some other work site. Rather, it concedes that they were injured at the Standpipe Project itself in the course of their performance of the work called for by the contract to take place at that work site. As a result, the workers\u2019 injuries \u201coriginated from\u201d that work site and \u201ccame into being\u201d' because of their work at that site, even if the chain of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>causation that led to the injuries began at another location.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Crescent\u2019s argument is perhaps best exemplified by its contention that an indemnification clause that called for indemnification for harm arising out of \u201cwork performed under the contract\u201d would have been sufficiently broad to require indemnification but that the one here \u2014 calling for indemnification for harm arising out of \u201cwork performed by Contractor\u201d\u2014 is not. Crescent Mem. at 14-15. The Court sees no distinction between these two terms. The work performed by Crescent is the very work that was being performed under the contract. The injuries here arose from that work.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Because Crescent obligated itself to defend and indemnify Amtrak for any injuries arising out of work at the Standpipe Project, it must defend and indemnify Amtrak against the claims of the plaintiffs here.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">C. <em>Indemnification Under the STV/ HMM Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Paragraph 35(B) of the STV/HMM Contract similarly contains an extremely broad indemnity clause. That paragraph provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-10\">Contractor [STV/HMM] shall be responsible for all damages and expenses on account of injuries (including death) to any of its employees, agents or subcontractors while on the premises of Amtrak and shall indemnify, defend, and hold Amtrak harmless from all claims or damage suits which may arise in consequence of such injuries irrespective of any negligence or fault of Amtrak.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">STV/HMM Contract Gen. \u00b6 35(B). This paragraph\u2019s requirement that STV/HMM \u201cshall indemnify, defend and hold Amtrak harmless\u201d is without limitation. It applies to any claims that arise from any injuries of STV/HMM\u2019s employees, agents or subcontractors \u201cwhile on the premises of Amtrak.\u201d It further provides that this obligation to indemnify exists \u201cirrespective of any negligence or fault of Amtrak.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">In the face of this broad indemnification clause, STV and/or HMM make a number of arguments in an effort to avoid the paragraph\u2019s enforcement, none of which is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>1. <em>Connection Between the Indemnity Provision and, the Work Under the Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">HMM argues that Paragraph 35(B), when read separately from the surrounding paragraphs, is \u201cvague, ambiguous, and fails to pas[s] the \u2018reasonableness\u2019 test required in <em>Patterson v. District of Columbia, </em>795 A.2d 681 (D.C.Ct.App. 2002)\u201d because it does not require a \u201creasonable connection to the services intended by the ... underlying agreement.\u201d HMM Mem. at 11; <em>see Patterson, </em>795 A.2d at 683 (\u201cin deciding whether the contract language is susceptible of clear meaning, we look to the contract language itself, and ask ourselves generally what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought the disputed language meant\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). HMM argues that the indemnity language \u201cdoes not even attempt to apply the indemnity to the construction management services contemplated in the agreement,\u201d HMM Mem. at 11, and that the language \u201cignores the underlying services to be rendered by the indemnitor,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">The problem with HMM\u2019s argument is that it forces an artificial narrowing on the scope of the indemnity language contained in the contract. The indemnity provision here applies to \u201call\u201d claims that arise \u201cin consequence of\u2019 any injuries of STV/ HMM\u2019s employees, agents or subcontractors \u201cwhile on the premises of Amtrak.\u201d STV/HMM Contract Gen. \u00b6 35(B). It is difficult to imagine a more broadly-worded clause. By arguing that the language \u201cignores the underlying services to be rendered by the indemnitor,\u201d HMM Mem. at 12, or fails to \u201cspecifically incorporate the agreed upon services,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, HMM essentially faults it for being too broad and encompassing. Apparently, HMM would require that the clause repeat what is obvious from the agreement itself: that the indemnity obligation is included in a contract in which the indemnitor was required to provide specific services to Amtrak\u2014 that is, construction management services for the Standpipe Project. A clause in a contract, is not rendered ambiguous simply because the contract does not repeatedly advert to the context in which the clause was written. Paragraph 35(B) could only have created an indemnity obligation relating to the services called for under the contract \u2014 not one relating to some other work that STV/HMM might have been performing. Indeed, as HMM concedes, <em>see </em>HMM Mem. at 3, the contract governs the very work that was underway when it was interrupted by the runaway \u25a0 crane.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">It appears that HMM\u2019s real point is that the accident here arose \u201cnot because of the services to be rendered pursuant to the terms of the agreement but due to external forces involving a crane operator losing control of a crane in an independent work project\u201d \u2014 that is, the breaker installation project. <em>Id. </em>at 12. HMM notes that the indemnitor had no control over the breaker installation project, that it did not even know about it, and thus that the breaker project could not have been \u201cforeseen or intended at the time ... the agreement was signed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>HMM goes on to note that the agreement was \u201cspecifically written to provide construction management services during the installation of standpipe,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 12-13, and even noted that the rail lines involved in the accident were to be closed, <em>id. </em>at 13. HMM reasons that the agreement thus could not have \u201cintended\u201d that the indemnity clause would cover the particular accident that incurred here. STV similarly argues that the indemnification clause cannot cover injuries that were caused by an event originating at the breaker project because STV/HMM had no obligations under the contract with respect to the performance of the breaker project, that the breaker project was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>sole responsibility of Amtrak, and that STV/HMM was responsible only for the Standpipe Project. STV Mem. at 10-13, 24-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">None of these facts, however, can change the clear meaning of the indemnification clause, which requires indemnity for \u201call\u201d damages incurred by STV/HMM, its employees or agents. The clause does not limit claims to those that were caused by an act or omission at the particular job site. It does not limit indemnification to potential threats- known to STV/HMM or controlled by STV/HMM. Nor does the clause suggest that the origin of the causal force that generates the \u201cclaims\u201d or \u201cinjuries\u201d must emanate from a point within the physical area of the work site. Contrary to STV\u2019s suggestion, this reading does not mean that STV/HMM is being given \u201cobligations and responsibilities to other projects such as the Buss Breaker Project.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. It is responsible for no injuries at that site.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The Court also rejects HMM and STV\u2019s argument that because they had no reason to know about the breaker project, they could not have agreed to indemnify for any injuries that derived from acts or omissions at the breaker project. STV Mem. at 7, 22-23; HMM Mem. at 12. As STV puts it, \u201c[i]t defies logic '.,. that STV and/or STV/HMM would agree to defend and/or indemnify Amtrak with respect to the Buss Breaker Project when STV and STV/HMM was not aware of the Buss Breaker Project until after the accident.\u201d STV Mem. at 23. In essence, STV is arguing that the clause does not cover the accident because, when the parties drafted the agreement, STV could not have contemplated the sort of accident that occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">However, the intent of the parties is judged by the particular language they use. <em>See Tillery v. D.C. Contract Appeals Bd., </em>912 A.2d 1169, 1176 (D.C.2006) (\u201cthe written language embodying the terms of an agreement will govern the rights and liabilities of the parties, regardless of the intent of the parties at the time they entered into the contract, unless the written language is not susceptible of a clear and definite undertaking\u201d) (citations and internal bracketing omitted); <em>see also Segal Wholesale, Inc. v. United Drug Serv., </em>933 A.2d 780, 784 (D.C.2007) (\u201cwhere a document is facially unambiguous, its language should be relied upon as providing the best objective manifestation of the parties\u2019 intent\u201d) (citing <em>Hercules &amp; Co. v. Shama Rest. Corp., </em>613 A.2d 916, 927 (D.C.1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Where the parties write a broad clause, such as the one agreed upon here, it will necessarily cover any events that come within its language, even if it could later be shown that the parties did not foresee all possible events that might be encompassed by the language agreed on. Thus, the fact that a particular event was not eontemplat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>ed does not mean that the parties did not \u201cintend\u201d that the event be covered by the broad language of the indemnity clause.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">2. <em>Indemnification with Respect to Cevasco\u2019s Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">HMM asserts that it is not obligated to indemnify Amtrak for Cevasco\u2019s claims because Cevasco was an employee of STV. <em>See </em>HMM Mem. at 2-3; <em>accord id. </em>at 5-9. STV has not made a parallel argument with respect to Sood, who was an employee of HMM.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">To support this argument, HMM notes that the Joint Venture Agreement between STV and HMM relating to the Standpipe Project has provisions stating that (1) the joint venture \u201cshall not have employees of its own, but shall perform the services with the employees of each party,\u201d Joint Venture Agreement \u00b6 7.5; (2) that \u201c[i]t is not the purpose or intent of the parties ... to constitute either party as a partner, agent, or representative of the other party,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00b6 1.5; and (3) that each party had to obtain its own worker\u2019s compensation insurance, <em>id. </em>\u00b6 14.1. <em>See </em>HMM Mem. at 5; HMM Reply Mem. at 3-10.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">HMM then points to the indemnity clause in the STV/HMM Contract, which states that the \u201cContractor\u201d \u2014 that is, the STV/HMM joint venture \u2014 shall be responsible for damages resulting from injuries \u201cto any of its employees, agents or subeontractors\u201d \u2014 and that the joint venture must indemnify Amtrak for any claims arising from such injuries. <em>See </em>HMM Mem. at 6; HMM Reply Mem. at 3-5. HMM concludes that the indemnity provision with respect to Cevasco\u2019s claims \u201ccan never be applied to either HMM, individually, or to the STV/HMM joint venture\u201d on the ground that neither of these entities employed Cevasco. HMM Mem. at 6. Instead, HMM argues that paragraph 35(B) means that each of the two joint-venture entities is responsible exclusively for its own employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">HMM\u2019s argument fails, however, because it misreads the word \u201cits\u201d in the indemnity clause. \u201cIts\u201d precedes \u201cemployees, agent or subcontractor\u201d and thus identifying who \u201cit\u201d is tells us whose employees, agents or subcontractors would have to be the subject of indemnification. HMM\u2019s argument seems to assume that the \u201cits\u201d in paragraph 35(B) refers <em>either </em>to HMM or to STV \u2014 apparently depending on whose employee has been injured. In fact, the \u201cits\u201d in this clause refers not to either entity separately but rather to the \u201cContractor.\u201d The \u201cContractor\u201d is defined as \u201cthe party performing construction management services under this contract.\u201d STV/HMM Contract Gen. \u00b6 1. The \u201cparty performing construction management services\u201d is in turn defined as \u201cSTV/HMM; a joint venture of STV Incorporated ... and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Hatch Mott MacDonald.\u201d STV/HMM Contract at 1. In other words, the joint venture STV/HMM is made responsible by-paragraph 35(B) to provide indemnification to Amtrak. And, under this paragraph, STV/HMM is responsible for claims by the \u201cemployees, agents or subcontractors\u201d of the joint venture STV/HMM. Thus, the only question to be decided is whether Cevasco is an \u201cemployee, agent, or subcontractor\u201d of the joint venture STV/HMM.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">We accept <em>arguendo </em>HMM\u2019s assertion that the joint venture has no employees and that neither STV nor HMM is the agent of the other. But this does not address whether STV and HMM or their employees were agents of the joint venture STV/HMM. HMM does not dispute that a separate provision of the contract required that STV and HMM be jointly responsible for the joint venture\u2019s obligations to perform the Amtrak contract.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, STV/ HMM\u2019s responsibilities to perform the Amtrak contract were assumed by both HMM and STV. As a consequence, the contract could only have been performed by individuals operating under the auspices of HMM or STV \u2014 that is, their employees. Indeed, as HMM notes, the Joint Venture Agreement provides that the joint venture \u201cshall not have employees of its own, <em>but shall perform the services [required under the Amtrak contract] with the employees of each party.\u201d </em>Joint Venture Agreement \u00b6 7.5 (emphasis added). Thus, any worker on the project employed by either HMM or STV was acting as the agent of the joint venture STV/HMM. Because Cevasco was an employee of STV, he was acting as an agent of the joint venture STV/HMM and thus comes within the indemnity clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">In sum, the indemnity obligation unequivocally requires the joint venture STV/ HMM to indemnify Amtrak for any claims by any persons acting as agents of STV/ HMM. These agents include both STV, HMM, and their employees. It thus does not matter whose particular employee is injured for purposes of enforcing the indemnity obligation as long as that person is acting as the agent of the joint venture STV/HMM in its performance of the contract. Both Cevasco and Sood were acting as agents of the joint venture in doing their work on the project and thus any harm to them comes within the indemnity clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">3. <em>Material Breach</em></p>\n<p id=\"A30\">STV argues that the indemnification clauses are unenforceable because Amtrak breached a material provision of the contract, allegedly requiring Amtrak to inform STV/HMM of \u201cany other Amtrak/LIRR involvement that may have any impact on the contract.\u201d STV Mem. at 16 (quoting STV/HMM Contract \u00b6 3.2.5(A)(3)). STV cites no case law in support of this argument and thus it is questionable whether even STV takes the argument seriously. In any event, it is rejected. A material breach is one that \u201cgoes to the \u2018essence\u2019 and frustrates substantially the purpose for which the contract was agreed to.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Bricks, Blocks &amp; Concrete Co. v. Frontier Ins. Co., </em>2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 24451, at *12 (D.D.C. Apr. 23, 2001) (citing <em>Keefe Co. v. Americable Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>755 A.2d 469, 475 (D.C.2000)); <em>see also Greyhound Lines, Inc. v. Bender, </em>595 F.Supp. 1209, 1224 (D.D.C.1984) (listing factors of material breach); <em>Fowler v. A &amp; A Co., </em>262 A.2d 344, 347 (D.C.1970) (material breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>exists where a party is \u201creceiving something substantially less or different from that for which he bargained\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The District of Columbia Court of Appeals has cited with approval case law holding that \u201c[f]or a breach to be material, it must be so serious to destroy the essential object of the agreement.\u201d <em>3511 13th Street Tenants\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. 3511 13th Street, N.W. Residences, LLC, 922 </em>A.2d 489, 445 (D.C. 2007) (quoting <em>Ranes v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co., 219 </em>Wis.2d 49, 57, 580 N.W.2d 197 (1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The provision STV points to is one that requires STV/HMM to hold a pre-construction conference with Amtrak and other personnel \u2014 one that would have occurred years before the accident here. The contract states that the conference is intended to \u201censure that all parties have a clear understanding of the contract requirements and any other Amtrak/LIRR involvement that may have any impact on the contract.\u201d <em>See </em>STV Mem. at 16 (quoting STV/HMM Contract \u00b6 3.2.5). While STV asserts that Amtrak\u2019s failure to inform it of the other projects in the tunnels constituted a material breach of the STV/ HMM Contract, the language of the contract does not specifically require that Amtrak inform STV/HMM of all other projects in the tunnels. Even if it could be so construed, STV has not shown that any such requirement would go to the \u201cessence\u201d or the purpose of the contract and that the failure to do so \u201cdestroy[ed] the essential object of the agreement.\u201d <em>3511 13th Street Tenants\u2019 Ass\u2019n, 922 </em>A.2d at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">4. <em>Ficrther Discovery</em></p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">STV asserts that Amtrak\u2019s motion for summary judgment should be denied because it cannot oppose it without further discovery responses that Amtrak has not yet provided. <em>See </em>STV Mem. at 17-22. It asserts it needs to depose a Marvin Smith on the issue of the parties\u2019 intent regarding the indemnification clause, <em>see id. </em>at 17-18; that it needs documents from the \u201ccontract file\u201d that might bear on the parties\u2019 intent, <em>id. </em>at 18, 21; and that it requires documents regarding the breaker project to show that STV/HMM had no involvement with that project, <em>see id. </em>at 18, 21-22. The issues for which the discovery is sought, however, are not relevant to the resolution of Amtrak\u2019s motion. First, we assume that STV/HMM had no obligations or responsibilities with respect to the breaker project. Second, the intent of the parties may not be established from extrinsic evidence where the contract is not ambiguous. <em>See Steele Foundations, Inc., </em>937 A.2d at 153; <em>accord N.P.P. Contractors, Inc. v. John Canning &amp; Co., </em>715 A.2d 139, 142 (D.C.1998) (\u201cBecause the contract language is unambiguous, we do not consider the testimony of N.P.P.\u2019s president ... concerning his subjective intent as to the scope of the indemnification clause.\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Dodek, </em>537 A.2d at 1092 (\u2018Where a contract is unambiguous ... \u2018summary judgment is appropriate ... since, absent such ambiguity, a written contract duly signed and executed speaks for itself and binds the parties without the necessity of extrinsic evidence.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Holland v. Hannan, </em>456 A.2d 807, 815 (D.C.1983)). As already discussed, the indemnification clause is unambiguous with respect to the obligations of STV/HMM.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">IV. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"AJy\">For the foregoing reasons, Amtrak\u2019s motions for partial summary judgment (consisting of Docket #220 in 04 Civ. 5760; Docket # 133 in 05 Civ. 7419; Docket # 87 in 06 Civ. 6195; Docket # 91 in 06 Civ. 6196; and Docket # 75 in 06 Civ. 6956) should be granted.

In a separate part of its analysis, <em>Mead </em>also noted that the indemnification provision in a different clause required indemnification for injuries \"to any of the employees of AMTRAK while on the premises of AMTRAK in connection with operations performed or to be performed under the contract.\u201d 676 F.Supp. at 96-97.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\">. Crescent argues that a separate indemnity provision, Paragraph 68.2, does not unambiguously obligate Crescent to indemnify Amtrak for Amtrak's own negligent acts. <em>See </em>Crescent Mem. at 11, 21-23. Given the scope of Paragraph 68.1, it is not necessary to reach this question. In any event, Paragraph 68.2 obligates Crescent to \"indemnify, defend, and hold Amtrak harmless from <em>all </em>claims or damage suits which may arise in consequence of [injuries (including death) to any of Crescent's employees, agents or subcontractors while on the premises of Amtrak].\" Crescent Contract Gen. \u00b6 68.2 (emphasis added). The language in this paragraph includes no limitations regarding acts or omissions of either party. The language is not susceptible to any interpretation that would obviate the indemnity obligation in the event Crescent could show that the claim was caused by Amtrak's negligence. <em>See Bland, </em>473 F.2d at 157 (indemnification language \u201cmust necessarily\" cover the negligence of the contractor, who was the \"only other significant party besides the subcontractor in a position to cause any losses arising out of ... this contract\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>Moses-Ecco Co., </em>320 F.2d at 688 (\"Since the parties specified that 'all' losses on 'any' claims included those of [sub-contractor]'s employees, we think further specification would be superfluous and ritualistic. Moreover, it would appear that no valid claim by an employee of [sub-contractor] could arise against [contractor] except through [contractor]^ own negligence.\u201d). Thus, even if Crescent were not already obligated to defend and indemnify Amtrak under Paragraph 68.1, Crescent would be obligated by Paragraph 68.2 to defend and indemnify Amtrak against the claims of Crescent employees Adornetti and Vitale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b456-6\">. STV's reliance on <em>Zamierowski </em>v. <em>National Railroad Passenger Corp., </em>2006 WL 1816377 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2006), <em>see </em>STV Mem. at 29-30, for this point is unavailing as it is irrelevant. <em>Zamierowski </em>refused to enforce an indemnity obligation only because the Court found that the obligation was contingent on the indemnitee\u2019s completion of certain work that was the subject of the contract. 2006 WL 1816377, at *6-7. Also of no relevance is STV's assertion that \"Pliability may not be imposed upon a party who merely furnishes the occasion for the occurrence of the event but is not one of its causes.\u201d STV Mem. at 30. The cases cited in support of this provision involve the standards of causation in tort suits arising out of motor vehicle accidents. They have nothing to do with obligations that parties may undertake by contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b456-11\">.

STV Mem. at 13-14. There is nothing in Paragraph 35(A), however, that purports to give meaning to Paragraph 35(B).
