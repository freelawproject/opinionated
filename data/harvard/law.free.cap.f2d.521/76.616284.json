He approached a teller who was sitting behind a bulletproof glass mounted on a counter and pointed a pistol into the customer exchange slot on the surface of the counter. He said something inaudible while motioning toward the door of the teller\u2019s area as if to indicate that he wished to enter. The teller asked, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d and sounded the alarm, whereupon the would-be robber turned and started out the front door. He was observed driving away in a white Ford Fairlane, middle 60\u2019s model, with an Arkansas license plate numbered AJC-840.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Approximately one month later, the teller observed Thurston Williams, a customer of the bank, wearing a sweater identical to that worn during the attempted robbery. She knew that Thur-ston Williams was not the robber. A few months later, she observed appellant Thomas and his brother outside the bank. Thomas fit the description of the man who had attempted to rob the bank, and she noticed that he shook his head in a negative manner and waited outside while his brother entered the bank to transact some business.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">A 1967 white Ford Fairlane bearing the Arkansas license number AJC-840 was found abandoned in a field approximately five miles from the bank on March 12, 1974. Two FBI agents, who had received information that appellant had been seen near the vehicle, contacted Thomas and asked him to consent to their taking his fingerprints for elimination purposes, which he did. One of the latent fingerprints lifted by the FBI from the car matched Thomas\u2019 left middle fingerprint.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">Because Thomas appeared very nervous during the fingerprinting process, he was detained for further interrogation by the FBI. The agents read Thomas his constitutional rights and, stating that he understood those rights, Thomas signed the \u201cWarning of Rights and Waiver Form\u201d which had been read to him. He then admitted that he had stolen the getaway car from a service station where it was parked,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> borrowed the burgundy turtleneck sweater from Thur-ston Williams, driven to the bank and attempted to rob it. Thereafter, Thomas accompanied the agents to Williams\u2019 home where they recovered the sweater. The agents then arrested Thomas and put his statements into writing. Thomas signed and dated the transcribed confession and initialed \u201cWT\u201d in the various places where corrections had been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">Thomas then accompanied the agents to a trailer behind his mother\u2019s home where, in the presence of his mother and several relatives, the .22 calibre pistol used in the attempted robbery was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>trieved from an air conditioning duct.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon his mother\u2019s inquiry, Thomas acknowledged that he had committed the attempted bank robbery. He was thereafter charged with putting in jeopardy the life of the teller, Jennie Lou Hanner, while attempting to rob the Palestine branch bank, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d). A jury found him guilty of committing the offense charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">I. <em>THE CONFESSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The District Court<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> conducted a hearing on the voluntariness of the confession out of the hearing of the jury, <em>see Jackson v. Denno, </em>378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964), at which Thomas testified. According to his version of the circumstances surrounding his confession, he was not advised of his constitutional rights until after the recovery of the sweater and pistol, when the FBI agents began putting his alleged confession into writing. Thomas claimed at the pre-trial hearing on the confession that, once warned, he remained uncertain as to the meaning of his constitutional rights, though he admitted knowing that he was entitled to remain silent and to consult an attorney. He testified that although he asked to see an attorney, he was not permitted to do so but was told that he would see an attorney \u201cin time.\u201d He claimed that he had signed the statement only because the FBI agents had threatened to charge him with other crimes. He asserted that he had not voluntarily signed the statement and that he had not initialled the pages of the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The conflict between appellant\u2019s version of the circumstances surrounding his confession and that of the government presented a question of credibility for the trier of fact. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>483 F.2d 448, 449 (5th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1160, 94 S.Ct. 920, 39 L.Ed.2d 112 (1974); <em>United States v. Crovedi, </em>467 F.2d 1032, 1036 (7th Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U.S. 990, 93 S.Ct. 1510, 36 L.Ed.2d 189 (1973). At the close of the pre-trial hearing, Judge Eisele resolved this conflict in favor of the government, stating \u201cI am convinced by the proof that the statement is voluntary and was given by the defendant with full knowledge and awareness of his rights \u2014 that is, after he had been advised of his rights.\u201d He further found that the fingerprints were furnished voluntarily, as were the sweater and the gun and overruled the motion to suppress. Such findings are not clearly erroneous, and we perceive no error of law in the admission of the sweater, the pistol, and the confession. <em>Mullins v. United States, </em>487 F.2d 581, 583 (8th Cir. 1973); <em>United States v. McNally, </em>485 F.2d 398, 406 (8th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 978, 94 S.Ct. 1566, 39 L.Ed.2d 874 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-13\">II. <em>\u201cPUTTING IN JEOPARDY\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">The teller testified at trial that she had been afraid and concerned for her safety during the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">The offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> is defined as including all of the elements of attempted bank robbery by means of intimidation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), plus the additional element of placing in jeopardy the life of a person by means of a dangerous weapon or device. It is often referred to as aggravated bank robbery and carries a maximum punishment of twenty-five years imprisonment compared with twenty years for a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>In his charge to the jury, Judge Eisele defined \u201cdangerous weapon or device\u201d and \u201cto put in jeopardy the life of a person,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\">[A] \u2018dangerous weapon or device\u2019 includes anything capable of being readily operated, manipulated, wielded, or otherwise used by one or more persons to inflict severe bodily harm or injury upon another person. So, an operable firearm, such as a pistol, revolver, or other gun, capable of firing a bullet or other ammunition, may be found to be a dangerous weapon or device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">To \u2018put in jeopardy the life\u2019 of a person \u2018by the use of a dangerous weapon or device\u2019 means, then, to expose such person to a risk of death, or to the fear of death, by the use of such dangerous weapon or device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">You may find that the defendant put in jeopardy the life of another person even though the defendant did not have actual ability to inflict severe bodily harm or injury. It is sufficient if the defendant created in the mind of a reasonable person the apprehension of death or serious bodily harm or injury by the use of an apparently dangerous weapon or device.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Appellant objects to the giving of the instruction because he contends there was insufficient evidence of putting in jeopardy to submit the aggravated offense to the jury. He asserts that, since there was no evidence that the pistol used in the robbery was loaded, at most the lesser included offense of attempted robbery by intimidation, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-13\">While objection at trial to the first two paragraphs of the quoted instruction can be found, if at all, only in Thomas\u2019 general objection on sufficiency grounds, he did specifically object to the third paragraph of the quoted instruction on the ground that it permitted \u201cjeopardy\u201d to be established without objective evidence that at the time of the robbery he possessed the ability to inflict severe bodily harm or injury. The latter objection was well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-14\">The instructions on putting in jeopardy, especially the third quoted paragraph, conflict with our holding in <em>Morrow v. United States, </em>408 F.2d 1390, 1391 (8th Cir. 1969), in which we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-15\">The test of whether a victim\u2019s life has been placed in danger is an objective one; \u201cnot whether the employee was put in fear but whether his life <em>was </em>put in danger by the use of a dangerous weapon.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>United States v. Donovan, </em>242 F.2d 61, 63 (2d Cir. 1957), rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom. <em>Andrews v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 334, 83 S.Ct. 1236, 10 L.Ed.2d 383 (1963).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>In satisfying the objective test, however, express proof that the gun used in a bank robbery was loaded is not required. The jury may infer this fact from the circumstance itself. <em>United States v. Cady, </em>495 F.2d 742, 746 n. 7 (8th Cir. 1974); <em>Morrow v. United States, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">The jurors were not so instructed, however, because the third quoted paragraph permitted them to find that defendant had placed the teller\u2019s life in jeopardy if she reasonably feared for her life because the weapon was \u201capparently dangerous.\u201d While the fact that a gun was loaded and therefore dangerous may be inferred from the circumstances, the fact of jeopardy cannot be found simply because the weapon \u201cappeared\u201d to be dangerous to the victim, however reasonable her fears. From the former may be found jeopardy; from the latter may be found merely intimidation, the lesser included offense. Unless placing in jeopardy can be said to mean more than placing in fear, then nothing has been added to \u00a7 2113(d) over \u00a7 2113(a) to explain or justify the enhanced punishment which subdivision (d) permits. <em>United States v. Marshall, </em>427 F.2d 434, 437-38 (2d Cir. 1970); <em>see United States v. Marchbanks, </em>469 F.2d 72, 74 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">We dealt with the first two paragraphs of the quoted instruction given by Judge Eisele in <em>United States v. Cady, supra. </em>We held in that case that permitting evidence of \u201cfear of death,\u201d instead of requiring the jury to find that the victim\u2019s life was in fact placed in danger by means of a weapon capable of causing harm, was at most harmless error since there was undisputed evidence in the case that at least one gun was loaded. In this case no such undisputed facts are present to render the instructions harmless. The instructions as given authorized the jury to convict under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) upon minimum findings which would be sufficient only to convict under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), the lesser included offense. We cannot say with fair assurance that the jury would have found defendant guilty of the aggravated offense notwithstanding the erroneous instruction. <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). The third quoted paragraph is clearly contrary to our holding in <em>Morrow</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and its use must be discontinued along with the \u201cor to the fear of death\u201d clause (in the second quoted paragraph) which spawned it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-15\">III. <em>THE EXHIBITS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-16\">Appellant contends the trial judge committed prejudicial error when he sent all of the exhibits, including the gun, to the jury room following the jury\u2019s request to see the signed confession which had been received in evidence as a government exhibit. The manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>ment of exhibits lies in the sound discretion of the trial judge, and an appellate court will not interfere unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Parker, </em>491 F.2d 517, 521 (8th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 989, 94 S.Ct. 2396, 40 L.Ed.2d 767 (1974). We think Judge Eisele acted wisely, since sending the confession alone to the jury might have caused undue emphasis to be placed upon one exhibit in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">IV. <em>INCONSISTENT VERDICTS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">When the jury returned following its deliberations, it presented two verdict forms showing a verdict of guilty both of the major offense charged in the indictment and of the lesser included offense of attempted bank robbery which did not put in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon. Judge Eisele, after conferring with counsel, reserved ruling on defense counsel\u2019s motion for mistrial based upon inconsistent verdicts and ordered the jury to return for further deliberations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Judge Eisele instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">The point I think I need to make at this juncture is that if you find the defendant guilty of the crime included in the indictment, which is of attempting to rob the bank and putting the life of the teller in jeopardy, then that is the only form that needs to be filled out. If you do not find that to be the case, but find that he is guilty of attempting to rob the bank without putting her life in jeopardy, then only one of them needs to be signed; and that is the lesser included offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Thereafter the jury returned with a single verdict form finding defendant guilty of the offense charged in the indictment. At request of defense counsel, the jury was polled and each juror concurred in the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">The procedure followed by Judge Ei-sele was exactly the procedure which we recommended in <em>United States v. Howard, </em>507 F.2d 559, 562 (8th Cir. 1974), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">We * * * suggest that, in future cases where a verdict not in proper form or arguably unclear is rendered, the jury be returned to their room for further deliberations to correct the problem.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-12\"><em>See also United States </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>456 F.2d 1037, 1039 (5th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Wolford, </em>144 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 444 F.2d 876, 887 (1971); <em>United States v. Henson, </em>365 F.2d 282, 284 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 974, 87 S.Ct. 513, 17 L.Ed.2d 437 (1966); <em>Helms v. United States, </em>310 F.2d 236, 240 (5th Cir. 1962). This contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-13\">V. <em>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</em></p>\n<p id=\"b150-14\">We have no doubt that the evidence presented was sufficient, if believed, to support a conviction for violation of the aggravated offense of \u00a7 2113(d) and necessarily the lesser included offense of \u00a7 2113(a). When a challenge is made to the sufficiency of the evidence, it must be viewed in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Swanson, </em>509 F.2d 1205, 1210 (8th Cir. 1975); <em>United States v. Hutchinson, </em>488 F.2d 484, 489 (8th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>417 U.S. 915, 94 S.Ct. 2616, 41 L.Ed.2d 219 (1974). The testimony of eyewitnesses, together with appellant\u2019s own confession<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the physical evidence admitted at trial, formed convincing evidence from which a jury might reasonably find beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant attempted to rob the bank and while doing so placed the life of the teller in jeopardy by the use of a dangerous and deadly weapon. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Whether, in view of the bulletproof glass which protected'the teller and the nature of the exchange slot on the surface of the counter, the appellant was capable of placing the teller\u2019s life in jeopardy was an issue of fact to be determined by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Thus the error in this case was not in the sufficiency of the evidence, but rather in permitting the jury, under the instructions as given, to return a verdict of guilty under the major offense \u201ceven though the defendant did not have the actual ability to inflict severe bodily harm or injury.\u201d This instruction permitted a finding of guilty of the aggravated offense upon findings which would, for reasons stated above, be sufficient only to convict on the lesser offense of attempted robbery by intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Our disapproval of the instruction does not, under the circumstances of this case, require reversal and a new trial. The issue of defendant\u2019s guilt under the lesser included offense was properly submitted to the jury and, in fact, the jury originally returned a verdict of guilty on both the major and lesser offenses. It will be sufficient in this case to vacate the sentence imposed under \u00a7 2113(d) and to remand for resentencing under \u00a7 2113(a). <em>See Scruggs v. United States, </em>450 F.2d 359 (8th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 1071, 92 S.Ct. 1521, 31 L.Ed.2d 804 (1972); <em>United States v. Marshall, supra. </em>The trial court had all of the facts before it at time of sentencing. Appellant was sentenced to four years imprisonment, well within the maximum limits of both \u00a7 2113(a) and \u00a7 2113(d). While a motion to reduce sentence would lie under Rule 35, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, we prefer to vacate the original sentence in order that the trial judge may exercise his discretion anew under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b146-8\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Whoever, in committing, or in attempting to commit, any offense defined in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, assaults any person, or puts in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty-five years, or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b146-14\">.

It has been rejected by the Sixth Circuit in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Beasley, </em>438 F.2d 1279 (6th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>404 U.S. 866, 92 S.Ct. 124, 30 L.Ed.2d 110 (1971). <em>But see United States v. Thomas, </em>455 F.2d 320 (6th Cir. 1972). The Fifth Circuit has found that in the highly charged atmosphere of a bank robbery by robbers bearing drawn guns, persons are placed in jeopardy as a matter of law. <em>Baker v. United States, </em>412 F.2d 1069, 1071-72 (5th Cir. 1969), <em>cert, denied, </em>396 U.S. 1018, 90 S.Ct. 583, 24 L.Ed.2d 509 (1970); <em>accord, United States v.

The Seventh Circuit goes directly to a permissible finding of \u201cin jeopardy\u201d when a gun \u201cis visible and where its display backs up [the robber\u2019s] demands.\u201d <em>United States v. Roustio, </em>455 F.2d 366, 371 (7th Cir. 1972). <em>See also United States v. Shelton, </em>465 F.2d 361 (4th Cir. 1972). The Second, Ninth and Tenth Circuits have focused, as have we, upon the permissible inference which a jury may draw that a gun displayed during a bank robbery was loaded and therefore objectively capable of causing harm. <em>United States v. Marshall, </em>427 F.2d 434 (2d Cir. 1970); <em>Wagner v. United States, </em>264 F.2d 524, 530 (9th Cir.), cert, <em>denied, </em>380 U.S. 936, 79 S.Ct. 1459, 3 L.Ed.2d 1548 (1959); <em>Lewis v.
