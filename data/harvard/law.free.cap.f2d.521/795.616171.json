Plaintiffs claimed the investment firms, defendants in the action, entered into a conspiracy to fix the interest rates to be charged on municipal bonds sold at public auction by the City of Pine Bluff, and that as taxpayers, they suffered damages which they are entitled to recover under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">The district court, upon consideration of the pleadings and an uncontroverted affidavit filed on behalf of defendants, granted defendants\u2019 motion for a summary judgment and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 third amended complaint with prejudice. Plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">Our evaluation of the record in light of the applicable case law, convinces us that the district court correctly ruled the motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, we affirm on the basis of the district court\u2019s soundly reasoned opinion, reported at 388 F.Supp. 1184 (E.D.Ark. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
