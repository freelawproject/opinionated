The action stemmed from a charge of racial discrimination which had been filed with the EEOC in 1971. The District Court granted summary judgment for the Employer, holding that \u00a7 706(f)(1) of Title VII, -42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 5(f)(1), precludes the EEOC from filing suit more than 180 days after an employment discrimination charge has been filed with it. We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-18\">In <em>Hazel Tuft v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>No. 74-1890, 517 F.2d 1301 (8th Cir. 1975), another panel of this Court concluded that \u00a7 706(f)(1) is not a bar to EEOC enforcement action after 180 days.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1307. We adhere to that conclusion, which is in accord with the holdings of all four Courts of Appeals which have examined the issue. <em>See Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. E. I. duPont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>516 F.2d 1297 at 1298 (3rd Cir. 1975); <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., </em>511 F.2d 1352, 1356-1357 (6th Cir. 1975); <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co., </em>505 F.2d 610, 612 (5th Cir. 1974); <em>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Cleveland Mills Co., </em>502 F.2d 153, 159 (4th Cir. 1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>420 U.S. 946, 95 S.Ct. 1328, 43 L.Ed.2d 425 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1433-19\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Hazel Tuft v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., supra, </em>also answers the Employer\u2019s alternate contention that summary judgment should be upheld because the EEOC has never issued a \u201cright to sue\u201d letter to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>the complainant, despite the passage of more than 180 days. We held there that the EEOC was not required to issue the right to sue letter at the expiration of the 180-day period.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That decision rejected the Employer\u2019s argument that the EEOC must not be permitted to manipulate the time limits of the Act and retain jurisdiction beyond the 180 days by not notifying the charging party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1434-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1433-16\">. The Employer asserts that this Court\u2019s conclusion on the 180-day issue in <em>Tuft </em>was dictum, and ought to be reexamined here. We cannot agree that the conclusion was dictum. As the Court noted, the question of whether the EEOC was required to issue the right to sue letter at the expiration of 180 days was directly linked to the question of whether the EEOC had power to commence a suit after that period. <em>Hazel Tuft v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>No. 74-1890, 517 F.2d 1301, at 1306 (8th Cir. 1975). In any event, we are satisfied with the correctness of the conclusion, and find support in the cases cited in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1434-13\">.
