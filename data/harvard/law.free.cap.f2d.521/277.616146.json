Decedent died in 1969, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>survived by her daughter, the appellant. After making certain specific bequests, the will establishes a trust of the residue with appellant as the life beneficiary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Upon appellant\u2019s death, the trust is to terminate and the remainder is to be divided into shares, one share going to each child of appellant or its surviving descendants per stirpes and one additional share to be distributed among the then living descendants of decedent\u2019s niece. However, if any of these initial beneficiaries are under age 30 at appellant\u2019s death, that share is to be held in further trust until the beneficiary reaches 30. In the event an initial beneficiary dies before reaching age 30, the trust property is to be distributed to his descendants per stirpes. If any of these substituted beneficiaries is under age 21, his share is placed in further trust until he reaches 21. In the event a substituted beneficiary dies before age 21, his share of the trust corpus is to be distributed to his estate. Finally the will contains a perpetuities saving clause which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">Thirteenth: If any trust created hereunder shall violate any applicable rule against perpetuities, accumulations or any similar rule or law, my Trustee is hereby directed to terminate such trust on the date limited by such rule or law and thereupon the property held in such trust shall be distributed to the persons then entitled to share the income therefrom in the proportions in which they are then entitled to share such income, notwithstanding any provision of this will to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">There is no question and no party contests the fact that in the will as written, absent the saving clause, both the 30 year trusts and the 21 year trusts violate the common law Rule against Perpetuiti-es and D.C.Code \u00a7 45-102.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court elected to solve the problem by striking the provision for the 30 year trusts from the will.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The resulting scheme provides that the initial beneficiaries take outright unless under age 21. If any of these beneficiaries is under 21, his share is placed in further trust until he reaches 21. In case of death before age 21, the share is distributed to the beneficiary\u2019s estate. The court\u2019s scheme clearly complies.with the Rule and is not an irrational method of disposing of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-13\">However, the district court\u2019s solution materially alters the decedent\u2019s disposi-tive scheme in two ways. First, the time of taking by an initial beneficiary has been accelerated under certain circumstances. One example will suffice to show the effect of the district court\u2019s alterations. If a beneficiary is age 10 at the death of the life tenant, the will originally provided that he would receive the trust corpus at age 30, i. <em>e., </em>20 years after the death of the measuring life in being. Under the will as modified by the district court, this beneficiary will receive the corpus at age 21, only 11 years after the death of the life tenant. Each disposition falls within the period allowed by the Rule, but there are significant variations in the duration of the trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-14\">The second variation caused by the district court\u2019s modification of the will involves the disposition to be made of the corpus in the event an initial beneficiary dies before achieving the required age (30 in the original will, 21 in the will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>as modified). Under the original will, exclusive of Item Thirteenth, the share of an initial beneficiary who dies before reaching age 30 is distributed to his then living descendants, or if none, to the other initial beneficiaries. Even if under Item Thirteenth a termination is necessary to avoid an infraction of the Rule, the share of such a beneficiary would \u201cbe distributed to the persons then entitled to share the income therefrom . .\u201d Under the will as modified, the share of a beneficiary who dies before age 21 is distributed to such beneficiary\u2019s executor or administrator, who, in carrying out a testate or intestate distribution, might be forced to distribute the trust property to persons or interests other than the family members who were the beneficiaries under the will as originally drawn. In other words, the instant will originally would have distributed the trust portion of this beneficiary\u2019s estate to other blood relatives of the decedent, whereas the modification proposed by the trial court permits distribution outside this class.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The above discussion has demonstrated that the district court\u2019s action creates possibilities that trust property could pass out of decedent\u2019s family or that a beneficiary could gain either absolute ownership or control over the disposition of the trust property earlier than was intended by decedent. By striking out a portion of the will, the district court has thus materially altered the disposition directed by decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Had the action been necessary to avoid a violation of the Rule against Perpetu-ities, we would find no fault with the district court\u2019s decision. However, it appears that when all the will provisions are construed together, a valid disposi-tive scheme is produced with no need to strike out any language in the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Item Thirteenth provides that all trusts created by the will are to terminate on the date limited by the applicable Rule against Perpetuities or any similar rule or law (e. <em>g. </em>D.C.Code \u00a7 45-102) and any remaining corpus is to be distributed to those persons then entitled to receive income from the trust. The relevant measuring life in this case is unquestionably that of appellant, the life tenant. Thus Item Thirteenth places a maximum time limit on each trust; it must terminate 21 years from the death of the life tenant if it has not previously been terminated by the other provisions of the will. In effect then, the will provides that the trusts for initial beneficiaries terminate: \u201cwhen the beneficiary reaches age 30 or 21 years from the death of the life tenant, whichever occurs earlier.\u201d Similarly, the trusts for substituted beneficiaries terminate: \u201cwhen the beneficiary reaches age 21 or 21 years from the death of the life tenant, whichever occurs earlier.\u201d <em>A trust with such provisions is clearly unaffected by the Rule or its statutory counterpart. </em>Its validity is established upon the death of the testatrix and no further terms or facts are required before the trust can be administered properly. Thus it is apparent that the will as originally drawn never violated the Rule against Perpetu-ities or D.C.Code \u00a7 45-102 and the district court acted unnecessarily in striking a paragraph from the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">The approach outlined above is consistent with the well established principle that all provisions of a will are to be construed together in determining the correct disposition if such construction is reasonable. <em>Hall v. Killingsworth, </em>102 U.S.App.D.C. 307, 253 F.2d 43 (1958); <em>Pace v. Bradley, </em>84 U.S.App.D.C. 212, 171 F.2d 350 (1948); <em>Walker v. Thomas, </em>64 App.D.C. 148, 150, 75 F.2d 667, 669 (1935). The resulting disposition of the estate is a rational scheme which most nearly reflects the intent of the decedent. It is apparent that the decedent intended the trusts to continue for the maximum period allowed by law in the event of a youthful beneficiary. This intent is accurately reflected when all provisions of the will are construed together whereas the district court\u2019s action could lead to serious discrepancies between the intended and the actual disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">We accordingly hold that the portion of the district court\u2019s order which struck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>out the last paragraph of Clause Ninth (B) of the will should be vacated and the case should be remanded with directions to construe the will in the manner set forth above. Such action is necessary to carry out the <em>entire </em>intent expressed by the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-4\">. The portions of the will establishing the trusts are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">\u201cNINTH: I give, devise and bequeath all the rest, residue, and remainder of my property, both real and personal, wherever situated, whether owned by me at this time or hereafter acquired by me and all property over which I may have power of appointment and can dispose of by will to the Trustee hereinafter named, IN TRUST, for the uses and purposes hereinafter set forth:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">A.

The district court struck out the italicized portion of the will.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b347-9\">.
