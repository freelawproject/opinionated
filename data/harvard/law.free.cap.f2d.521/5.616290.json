See <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-16\">Franklin E. Bond, plaintiff below, had been employed as an over-the-road driver by Red Arrow Transportation Company, which was party to a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 823, of which Bond was a member. In July 1968, Red Arrow ceased operations and filed a petition in bankruptcy. Bond thereafter went to work for Tri-State Motor Freight, Inc. During the course of Red Arrow\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings, Yellow Freight System, Inc., defendant below, purchased the operating rights of Red Arrow, subject to the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Following the granting of such approval by the I.C.C., Yellow \u201ctacked on\u201d Red Arrow\u2019s permits to its own at their common points. Yellow also hired several new employees not previously associated with Red Arrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-17\">After the \u201ctack on,\u201d Bond approached Kitts, the President and Business Representative of Local 823, concerning employment at Yellow. When the union persuaded Yellow to employ Bond and four other drivers from Red Arrow, Bond was hired at the bottom of Yellow\u2019s seniority list, below those new employees hired after the \u201ctack on.\u201d Bond thereupon attempted to present a grievance through Local 823, claiming a right to greater seniority under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement between Yellow and Local 823. The union, however, in accordance with its established procedures, elected to pursue the issue on behalf of Fred Renier, another employee similarly situated, and did not submit Bond\u2019s grievance to the Grievance Committee. The Grievance Committee denied Renier\u2019s grievance following a hearing to which Bond had not been invited. When no further appeals of that decision were processed, Bond filed his own grievance in which he sought the fringe benefits to which he felt entitled by virtue of his claimed se<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>niority. He was never given an opportunity to appear before the Grievance Committee; his claim was denied and he was told that the decision could not be appealed. Bond then initiated this action pursuant to \u00a7 301 of the National Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">In the first count of his complaint, Bond sought compensatory damages against Yellow for breach of contract and against the union for failure to represent him fairly in connection with his grievance. In the second, he named Yellow and the union as members of a conspiracy and sought damages from both for the resulting deprivation of seniority benefits. The third count of the complaint asked for the recovery of punitive damages from both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Following a jury trial, the District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> directed a verdict in favor of both defendants on the conspiracy count. The other counts were submitted to the jury, which awarded Bond $10,500 in actual and $22,500 in punitive damages against the union; the jury assessed the same amounts against Yellow. Following post-trial motions by both defendants, Judge Becker entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of Yellow on the issue of punitive damages, but he let stand the other portions of the jury\u2019s award.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The union has taken this appeal, challenging the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury, the submission of the issue of fair representation to the jury, the award of punitive damages, and the trial judge\u2019s restriction of Kitts\u2019 testimony. With the exception of the assessment of punitive damages against the union, for which we find inadequate factual support in the record, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-14\">I. THE INSTRUCTION ON THE CONTRACT PROVISIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b75-15\">The collective bargaining agreement between Yellow and Local 823 contained, in addition to a general clause recognizing the seniority rights of employees,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> specific seniority provisions designed to aPPly \u201cP]n the event that the Employer absorbs the business of another private, contract or common carrier, or is a party to a merger of lines\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-16\">(2) If, in the type of transaction described above, one of the Companies is insolvent at the time of the transaction, then the employees of the insolvent Company will go to the bottom of the Master Seniority List. The test of whether a Company is solvent or insolvent is governed entirely by whether bankruptcy, receivership, composition for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, or similar proceedings are pending in the state or federal court. If such proceedings are pending, the Company is considered insolvent for the purpose of this rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-17\">(3) If the transaction involved constitutes merely a purchase of permits or rights by one Carrier from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>another Carrier, without the purchase <em>or </em>acquisition of equipment, terminals, or business, the employees of the Company selling the permits shall have no seniority rights at all, but shall be offered opportunity for employment at the bottom of the seniority list of the Company purchasing the permits. If such employees are hired they shall be given seniority credit for fringe benefits only.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-4\">******</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Throughout this litigation, it has been the defendants\u2019 position that these contract provisions were inapplicable since Yellow had not absorbed Red Arrow\u2019s business but had, instead, simply purchased its operating licenses following the total cessation of Red Arrow\u2019s operations and the ensuing bankruptcy proceedings. The issue was as important to the union\u2019s case as it was to Yellow\u2019s because, but for the underlying breach of the collective bargaining agreement by Yellow, the question of unfair representation would not have arisen.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In this appeal, the union contends that the jury was erroneously charged on the application of the contract provisions. The challenged instruction explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">[the] agreements provided in material parts that if Yellow Freight System, Inc., a solvent carrier, absorbed the business of a bankrupt carrier, Yellow Freight System, Inc., was obligated to grant seniority to the former employees of Red Arrow Transportation Company, Inc., at the bottom of the existing Yellow Freight Master Seniority List. And this agreement is applicable even though only the operating rights of Red Arrow Transportation Company, Inc., were purchased by Yellow Freight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-8\">Therefore, if you find that Yellow Freight System, Inc., in 1969, absorbed the business of Red Arrow Transportation Company, Inc., by purchase and exercise of the operating rights of Red Arrow Transportation Company, Inc., from the trustee in bankruptcy, and you further find that Yellow Freight System, Inc., failed to grant plaintiff seniority at the bottom of its pre-exist-ing Master Seniority List, when it absorbed the business of Red Arrow Transportation Co., Inc., then you shall find the agreements aforesaid breached. And if you find such a breach and that the plaintiff suffered monetary loss as a direct result thereof, you may find that the plaintiff was damaged within the meaning of these instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">We find no error in the instruction, for the question of absorption, stressed by appellant, was properly left to the jury to decide as an issue of fact. Thus, the instruction was carefully worded to inform the jury that the special seniority provisions were to apply <em>only if </em>the jury first found that Yellow had absorbed Red Arrow\u2019s business. Contrary to appellant\u2019s contentions, the contract was not ambiguous and Judge Becker correctly interpreted it for the jury. <em>See Butler v. Teamsters Local 823, </em>514 F.2d 442, 452 (8th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">Appellant\u2019s alternative contention that Judge Becker gave Bond the benefit of both the \u201cinsolvency\u201d rule (subsection (2) quoted <em>supra) </em>and the \u201cpurchase of permits\u201d rule (subsection (8) quoted <em>supra) </em>likewise lacks merit. Both provisions unequivoc'ally require that, following absorption, the employees of the affected company be placed at the bottom of Yellow\u2019s existing seniority list. The instruction fairly tracks the relevant provisions of the collective bargaining agreement and we discern no error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">II. DUTY OF FAIR REPRESENTATION</p>\n<p id=\"b76-13\">Appellant asserts that there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law to submit to the jury the alleged breach of its duty of fair representation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>and that instruction to the jury on that duty did not accurately reflect the law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">The duty of a union to represent fairly the employees for whom it is the exclusive bargaining agent is a duty imposed by federal law. Vaca <em>v. Sipes, supra, </em>386 U.S. at 177, 87 S.Ct. at 909-10; <em>see </em>Feller, <em>A General Theory of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, </em>61 Calif.L.Rev. 663, 702 (1973). \u201cUnder [the fair representation] doctrine, the exclusive agent\u2019s statutory authority to represent all members of a designated unit includes a statutory obligation to serve the interests of all members without hostility or discrimination toward any, to exercise its discretion with complete good faith and honesty, and to avoid arbitrary conduct.\u201d Vaca <em>v. Sipes, supra, </em>386 U.S. at 177, 87 S.Ct. at 910. Thus, a breach of that duty \u201coccurs only when a union\u2019s conduct toward a member of the collective bargaining unit is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith.\u201d Vaca v. <em>Sipes, supra, </em>386 U.S. at 190, 87 S.Ct. at 916; <em>see Butler v. Teamsters Local 823, supra, </em>514 F.2d at 453\u201454; <em>Augspurger v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, </em>510 F.2d 853, 859 (8th Cir. 1975); <em>Richardson v. Communications Workers of America, </em>443 F.2d 974, 980\u201481 (8th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The District Court defined the union\u2019s legal duty as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-6\">The duty of the union fairly to represent the plaintiff in the processing of plaintiff\u2019s grievance requires the union to process a meritorious grievance in good faith, earnestly and not perfunctorily, without arbitrariness or unreasonable discrimination. While a reasonable range of discretion is allowed the union as an exclusive bargaining agent in serving the plaintiff in processing of his grievance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">And in that connection I want to give you this further instruction:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-8\">The Court instructs the jury that under the laws of the United States, Local Union No. 823 was in 1969 the exclusive bargaining agent for the employees of Yellow Freight Systems, Inc., and as such bargaining agent Local Union No. 823 had a legal duty fairly to represent the plaintiff as an employee in the processing of his complaint and grievance mentioned in evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-12\">This language represents an accurate statement of the duty defined in Vaca v. <em>Sipes, supra. </em>Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, we think the instruction imparted to the jury in a clear and adequate fashion the duty of the union, within a \u201creasonable range of discretion\u201d to act without arbitrariness and to do so in good faith.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">Measured against these standards, there was ample evidence adduced at trial to submit the fair representation question to the jury. The record is clear that Kitts had informed Bond and another former Red Arrow employee that it was the union, not Yellow, which was blocking their efforts to secure jobs following Red Arrow\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. There was also evidence in the record that Bond had been \u201cguaranteed\u201d by the union that Yellow would not hire him. It is undisputed that Bond\u2019s own grievance was not pressed by the union; moreover, Bond was given neither notice nor an opportunity to be present at the hearing on Renier\u2019s grievance, the so-called \u201ctest case\u201d for similarly situated union members. Finally, there was substantial evidence, despite Judge Becker\u2019s instructions to the jury to disregard such testimony, that Kitts had been opposed to the grievants\u2019 case from the start. The plaintiff made a submissible case on the alleged breach by the union of its statutory duty of fair representation. <em>See Butler v. Teamsters Local 823, supra, </em>514 F.2d at 453-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">III. PUNITIVE DAMAGES</p>\n<p id=\"b77-15\">Appellant contends that, as a matter of law, punitive damages cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>be awarded for breach of the duty of fair representation and that, in any event, the facts of this case do not support such an award. Recognizing that there is authority supporting an award of punitive damages against <em>a </em>union which has breached its duty of fair representation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we conclude that there is insufficient evidence in the record before us to warrant such relief. As we observed in a recent case based on similar facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-4\">The Local\u2019s conduct was not the type of outrageous or extraordinary conduct for which extraordinary remedies are needed; rather, it amounted to the commonly encountered policy of favoring one group of members over another, which lies in the mainstream of unfair representation litigation. Butler was not subjected to threats of violence, harassment, physical abuse, or the scorn and ridicule of his coworkers, and there was no showing that the Local acted with any malice directed specifically at him. <em>Compare Richardson v. Communications Workers of America, 443 </em>F.2d 974, 983 n.12 (8th Cir. 1971). The federal courts should fashion remedies under the labor statutes which are necessary to achieving the goal of industrial peace. <em>Textile Workers of America v. Lincoln Mills, </em>353 U.S. 448, 454-455, 77 S.Ct. 912, 1 L.Ed.2d 972 (1957). The plaintiff did not establish that punitive damages were needed to deter future misconduct or to prevent industrial strife.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-5\"><em>Butler v. Teamsters Local 823, supra, </em>514 F.2d at 454 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The award of punitive damages against the union must therefore be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">IV. RESTRICTION OF KITTS\u2019 TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Appellant assigns prejudicial error to rulings by the trial court restricting the testimony of Kitts, the President and Business Representative of Local 823. Counsel for the union had questioned Kitts regarding his conversation with the former Red Arrow employees seeking jobs at Yellow. As Kitts began to state his interpretation of the relevant provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, Judge Becker called counsel to chambers, where he explained that the construction of an unambiguous contract was solely in the court\u2019s province and that any evidence that Kitts had read the contract in a manner adverse to the employees\u2019 position could demonstrate the union\u2019s bad faith as a matter of law. It has been the union\u2019s position, both in Judge Becker\u2019s chambers and in this appeal, that Kitts\u2019 view of the employees\u2019 rights under the contract was critical to the union\u2019s effort to establish that it had acted in good faith. In other words, appellant argues that if it had been permitted to prove <em>why </em>it had not pressed Bond\u2019s grievance, the jury would not have been able to find the element of bad faith necessary for the verdict entered below.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">We discern no reversible error here. In this circuit, the admissibility or exclusion of evidence lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>See Lowry v. Black Hills Agency, Inc., </em>509 F.2d 1311, 1313-14 (8th Cir. 1975). We need not decide whether the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>abused that discretion, however, because he made it clear to counsel in chambers that he would permit such testimony if defense counsel persisted, notwithstanding the court\u2019s view that Kitts\u2019 interpretation was erroneous, saying, \u201cBut if that is what happened he is entitled to tell it.\u201d The District Judge then told counsel he intended to inform the jury of the proper interpretation of the contract. Alter telling counsel \u201cI conclude that it is admissible,\u201d the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\">The Court: So let\u2019s go ahead and you present the case like you want to, and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">Mr. Leary: Judge, I appreciate your telling me. I shall no longer go into that area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Upon resuming trial, this line of questioning was abandoned and there was no subsequent offer of proof. Neither was any exception taken at trial to the manner in which the court ordered a chambers conference. Such issues were waived at trial. <em>See Armour &amp; Co. v. Nard, </em>463 F.2d 8, 12 (8th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">Accordingly, the judgment is modified by deleting any reference to punitive damages; in all other respects the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\">. The Honorable William H. Becker, Chief Judge, United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b75-8\">.

We note, too, that appellant neither objected to the language of the instruction nor tendered to the judge a proposed instruction on this point, thus failing to preserve this assignment of error for appellate review. Fed.R.Civ.P. 51; <em>see Griggs v. Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>513 F.2d 851, 857 (8th Cir. 1975); <em>Otten v. Stonewall Ins. Co., </em>511 F.2d 143 (8th Cir. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b78-6\">. <em>See Butler v.

I. D. Packing Co., </em>308 F.Supp. 821, 824 (S.D.Iowa 1969) (court \u201cunwilling to say * * * that exemplary damages can never be recovered in a Section 301 action\u201d); <em>cf. Richardson v.

Sindicato de Trabajadores Packinghouse, </em>425 F.2d 281, 287 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>400 U.S. 877, 91 S.Ct. 117, 27 L.Ed.2d 114 (1970) (breach of union\u2019s duty of fair representation sounds in tort); <em>Tippett v. Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co., </em>316 F.Supp. 292, 298 (M.D.N.C.1970) (unfair representation suits are in nature of tort actions). The principal argument advanced for permitting punitive damages against a union in a proper case is that the claim does not arise out of the contract itself, but is founded upon the tortious breach of a statutory duty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
