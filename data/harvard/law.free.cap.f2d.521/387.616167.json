Essentially, the plaintiffs charge that aircraft, in taking off and landing at Mitchell Field, fly over their property at low altitudes, causing noise, vibrations, fumes, and the dropping of dust and noxious substances on their property. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants have thereby deprived them of their property without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. In addition, the plaintiffs charge that the defendants have violated \u00a7 114.04 of the Wisconsin Statutes and have created a nuisance. Finally, the plaintiffs allege, somewhat vaguely, that the County has violated 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1711 <em>et seq. </em>[previously 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq.] and has failed to conform with certain federal regulations. There is, however, no allegation that the defendant airlines have ever violated the federal regulations governing their operations. Jurisdiction is based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1337.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">As relief, the plaintiffs seek actual and punitive damages, a mandatory injunction directing the County to initiate condemnation proceedings against their property, and a promulgation, by the district court, of rules and regulations to govern the aircraft and airport operations at Mitchell Field.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\n<em>I. Fifth Amendment.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The district court properly held that no cause of action is stated against the defendants under the Fifth Amendment since that amendment applies only to a taking by the federal Government, and not to actions by state agencies or private parties. <em>Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, </em>164 U.S. 112, 158, 17 S.Ct. 56, 41 L.Ed. 369 (1896).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\"><em>II. Fourteenth Amendment </em>\u2014 Airlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">We also agree with the district court that no cause of action has been stated against the airlines under the Fourteenth Amendment. In <em>Griggs v. Allegheny County, </em>369 U.S. 84, 82 S.Ct. 531, 7 L.Ed.2d 585 (1962), the Supreme Court held that when a person\u2019s property has been \u201ctaken,\u201d in a constitutional sense, by low-altitude aircraft flights over his property, the \u201ctaking\u201d is attributable to the state instrumentality which owns and operates the airport. The Court expressly rejected the contention that the airlines, whose flights were in accord with the federal regulations, should be held liable for such \u201ctaking\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-12\">\u201cIt is argued that though there was a \u2018taking,\u2019 someone other than [Allegheny County] was the taker \u2014 the airlines or the C.A.A. acting as an authorized representative of the United States. We think, however, that [the County], which was the promoter, owner, and lessor of the airport, was in these circumstances the one who took the air easement in the constitutional sense.\u201d 369 U.S. at 89, 82 S.Ct. at 533. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">See also, <em>City of Boston v. Massachusetts Port Authority, </em>320 F.Supp. 1317, 1319-20 (D.Mass.171), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>444 F.2d 167 (1st Cir. 1971); <em>Town of East Haven v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., </em>331 F.Supp. 16, 34 (D.Conn.1971), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>470 F.2d 148 (2d Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 965, 93 S.Ct. 2144, 36 L.Ed.2d 685 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">In the present case, as in <em>Griggs, </em>there is no allegation that the airlines were violating any federal regulations in their flights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs, if there has been a \u201ctaking\u201d of their property, must look to the County, as the owner and operator of the airport, for compensation. See <em>Yearsley v. Ross Construction Co., </em>309 U.S. 18, 22, 60 S.Ct. 413, 84 L.Ed. 554 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>III. Fourteenth Amendment </em>\u2014 County.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The complaint, as the district court recognized, did state a Fourteenth Amendment claim for damages against the County under the <em>Griggs </em>doctrine. The district court, however, dismissed this claim on the ground that the plaintiffs had already instituted an inverse condemnation proceeding in the state court and could recover monetary damages in that action. See Wis.Stat. \u00a7 32.-10.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">We agree with the district court that, under the circumstances, the lower court could properly decline to exercise its jurisdiction to avoid interfering with a pending state proceeding which involved a predominantly local matter. \u201cNot only is municipal eminent domain ordinary a local matter, but it is difficult to imagine a situation where more confusion would arise than would be the case if the parties here were allowed to simultaneously pursue both this action and the state condemnation proceeding.\u201d <em>Creel v. City of Atlanta, </em>399 F.2d 777, 779 (5th Cir. 1968). In fact, at oral argument, counsel for the plaintiffs conceded that the district court could properly abstain on this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The plaintiffs argue, however, that the district court should have retained jurisdiction, although abstaining from exercising it, rather than dismissing the complaint. We think the plaintiffs\u2019 point is well taken. The Supreme Court has noted that where, as in the present case, a federal constitutional claim has been raised, \u201cit is better practice ... to retain jurisdiction, rather than to dismiss.\u201d <em>Zwickler v. Koota, </em>389 U.S. 241, 244 n. 4, 88 S.Ct. 391, 393, 19 L.Ed.2d 444 (1967). Accord, <em>American Trial Lawyers Ass\u2019n v. New Jersey Supreme Court, </em>409 U.S. 467, 469, 93 S.Ct. 627, 34 L.Ed.2d 651 (1973);. <em>Moore v. Kusper, </em>465 F.2d 253 (7th Cir. 1972). See <em>Creel, supra </em>at 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">The district court\u2019s judgment insofar as it dismissed the Fourteenth Amendment claim for damages against the County is vacated and this claim is remanded to the district court with directions that the court abstain from deciding the merits but retain jurisdiction pending a determination in the state inverse condemnation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">\n<em>IV. Injunctive Relief.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-13\">The district court properly held that relief in the form of judicially-made rules and regulations to govern the airport and airline operations at Mitchell Field was not available to the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>City of Burbank v. Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc., </em>411 U.S. 624, 93 S.Ct. 1854, 36 L.Ed.2d 547 (1973), the Supreme Court held that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), \u201chas full control over aircraft noise, pre-empting state and local control.\u201d 411 U.S. at 633, 93 S.Ct. at 1859. \u201c[T]he pervasive control vested in EPA and in FAA under the [Noise Control Act of 1972] leave[s] no room for local curfews or other local controls.\u201d 411 U.S. at 638, 93 S.Ct. at 1862. The Court has similarly noted that in the area of aircraft emissions, Congress \u201chas also pre-empted the field.\u201d <em>Washington v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number><em>General Motors Corp., </em>406 U.S. 109, 114, 92 S.Ct. 1396, 31 L.Ed.2d 727 (1972).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Virginians for Dulles v. Volpe, </em>344 F.Supp. 573, 579 (E.D.Va.1972). As the court below recognized, it is irrelevant that the plaintiffs here are asking a federal district court, rather than a state body, to promulgate the rules governing Mitchell Field. The rules and regulations which the plaintiffs seek would, nonetheless, result in the type of local control which the Supreme Court in <em>Burbank </em>found to be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">\n<em>V. Violation of Federal Regulations.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The plaintiffs also charge, without much specificity, that the County has violated 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1711 <em>et seq. </em>[previously 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 <em>et </em>seq.] and certain federal regulations issued thereunder.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The district court correctly noted that although the plaintiffs may qualify as intended beneficiaries of the statutes and regulations and, thereby, have standing to enforce them, <em>City of Inglewood v. City of Los Angeles, </em>451 F.2d 948, 955\u201456 (9th Cir. 1972), the plaintiffs should first exhaust their administrative remedies. <em>Id. </em>The regulations of the FAA provide that \u201c[a]ny person who knows of a violation of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, or of any regulation or order issued under it, may report it to appropriate personnel of an FAA regional or district office,\u201d and that each such report \u201cis investigated by FAA personnel.\u201d The results of the investigation \u201care the basis for determining the enforcement action that the FAA will take.\u201d 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 13.1. The plaintiffs have failed to indicate why, if the County is violating provisions of the Federal Aviation Act or any regulations issued thereunder, adequate relief is not available through the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">\n<em>VI. Nuisance, Negligence, Violation of State Law.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">The remainder of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims charge both defendants with common law nuisance and negligence and violation of \u00a7 114.04 of the Wisconsin Statutes, which makes it unlawful, <em>inter alia, </em>for an aircraft to fly \u201cat such a low altitude as to interfere with the then existing use to which the land or water, or the space over the land or water, is put by the owner.\u201d These claims are apparently based on pendent jurisdiction. The district court held that even if it were to consider these allegations, see <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 725-26, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966), the plaintiffs\u2019 action on these counts could not be maintained. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">Since the federal laws and regulations have preempted local control of aircraft flights, <em>Burbank, supra, </em>the defendants may not, to the extent they comply with such federal laws and regulations, be charged with negligence or creating a nuisance. Similarly, \u00a7 114.04 of the Wisconsin Statutes cannot be invoked to make unlawful flights which are in accordance with federal laws and regulations. If, as the plaintiffs allege, the aircraft flights have resulted in the \u201ctaking\u201d of their property, the plaintiffs have actions at law to recover just compensation from the County. <em>Griggs, supra; </em>Section III, <em>supra. </em>To the extent that the County may be violating the federal laws or regulations, the plaintiffs should, as explained in Section V, supra, exhaust their administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint is affirmed in all respects except in regard to the plaintiffs\u2019 Fourteenth Amendment claim for damages against the County. With respect to that claim, the matter is remanded to the district court with directions that the court retain jurisdiction pending the outcome of the state inverse condemnation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Affirmed in part; judgment vacated and remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b457-8\">. <em>Luedtke v. County of Milwaukee, </em>371 F.Supp. 1040 (E.D.Wis.1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b457-15\">. See footnote 6, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b458-7\">. Since the plaintiffs have already instituted inverse condemnation proceedings, the plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for an injunction directing the County to initiate condemnation proceedings was properly denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b458-8\">. The plaintiffs sought, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">\u201cThat an injunction and order be issued establishing and promulgating reasonable rules, regulations and controls directing the defendants to establish flight pattern and air traffic corridors,, noise control standards, noxious substance standards, and other rules governing the emission and dropping of unexpended fuel and particulate matter at or near General Mitchell Field together with restrictions on the volume of jet aircraft, the hours of operation and usage of the airport for takeoffs and landings during night time hours and establishing minimal altitudes at which jet aircraft must fly within the immediate vicinity of the airport and while overflying or flying by the plaintiffs\u2019 property described in paragraph (10) herein, together with appropriate penalties to [be] imposed for violation of such rules and regulations as thus promulgated.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b459-7\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1857\u00cd-11 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">\u201cNo State or political subdivision thereof may adopt or attempt to enforce any standard respecting emissions of any air pollutant from any aircraft or engine thereof unless such standard is identical to a standard applicable to such aircraft under this part.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b459-9\">. There was no allegation in the complaint that the defendant airlines had violated any federal regulation. The plaintiffs suggest, on appeal, that we should infer a violation of the regulations by the airlines from the plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that the aircraft flew at \u201cunreasonably low altitudes.\u201d We find this contention unpersuasive. Not only did the plaintiffs fail to allege a violation of the federal regulations by the airlines, the complaint itself states that \u201csuch use of General Mitchell Field by the [defendant airlines] was governed by various provisions of Federal law and has been regulated by the rules and regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration.\u201d The plaintiffs, moreover, never asked leave to replead.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
