The district court rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants, concluding that the plaintiffs could not prevail as a matter of law because the report was not a \u201cconsumer report\u201d within the meaning of FCRA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Since, in our view, the report was a \u201cconsumer report\u201d covered by FCRA we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">The case turns on FCRA\u2019s definition of \u201cconsumer report.\u201d In pertinent part, \u00a7 1681a(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1149-7\">(d) The term \u201cconsumer report\u201d means any written, oral, or other communication of any information by a consumer reporting agency bearing on a consumer\u2019s Credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living which is used or expected to be used or collected in whole or in part for the purpose of serving as a factor in establishing the consumer\u2019s eligibility for (1) credit or insurance to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) employment purposes, or (3) other purposes authorized under section 1681b of this title. . . . <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1149-12\">A consumer report, therefore, is virtually any information communicated by a \u201cconsumer reporting agency\u201d for any one of the purposes enumerated in 1681a and 1681b, including but not limited to, \u201cemployment purposes\u201d (\u00a7 1681a(d) and \u00a7 1681b(3)(B)) and eligibility for a government license or benefit (\u00a7 1681b(3)(D)). Since there can be no question but that Retail Credit is a consumer reporting agency within the terms of the FCRA,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we must decide whether the allegedly inaccurate information was furnished by Retail Credit for one or more of the purposes specified in \u00a7\u00a7 1681a and 1681b.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-15\">We consider first if the furnishing of the report was for \u201cemployment purposes\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7 1681a(d) and 1681b(3)(B).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-16\">The purpose of the Texas licensing procedure is to assess and certify Dr. Hoke\u2019s fitness and eligibility to practice medicine within the state of Texas. Although the terminology customarily used with regard to the employment of persons engaged in ordinary commercial activities is sometimes ill-suited to a description of the practice of a learned profession, in the context of FCRA the practice of medicine necessarily takes the form of some type of \u201cemployment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>A physician may accept full or part-time employment as a physician by a hospital, clinic, medical school, or professional association. In those instances he is an employee, albeit a professional one. If he concludes to practice his profession as a single practitioner or as a member of a medical partnership, we still consider him as \u201cemployed,\u201d either self-employed or employed by the patients who pay him fees for the medical services that he provides.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And since the <em>sine qua non </em>to the practice of medicine in Texas, and elsewhere, is a license to practice medicine, and since the information furnished by Retail Credit related to the question of whether the license would be granted, we have no hesitancy in concluding that the information was furnished for \u201cemployment purposes\u201d in the broad generic sense of the words.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">The statutory definition of employment purposes within the Act is (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(h)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1150-5\">The term \u201cemployment purposes\u201d when used in connection with a consumer report means a report used for the purpose of evaluating a consumer for employment, promotion, reassignment or retention as an employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">The statutory definition adopts the generic meaning of the words defined. We note, of course, the concluding words of this definition \u2014 \u201cas an employee.\u201d It might be argued that the term \u201cemployment purposes\u201d is restricted to the situation in which information is sought by an actual or prospective employer, e. g., if the Texas Licensing Board were to hire Dr. Hoke itself. But we think not. Such an argument assumes that the phrase \u201cas an employee\u201d modifies both \u201cretention\u201d <em>and </em>the words preceding it \u2014 \u201cemployment, promotion, reassignment.\u201d We think it modifies only \u201cretention.\u201d The words \u201cemployment, promotion, [and] reassignment,\u201d having specific meanings in the area of activities for the production of income, need no modifier. By contrast, \u201cretention,\u201d a word of varied meanings in varied contexts, does. Hence, we conclude that the statutory and generic definitions of the operative words are congruent and that furnishing information in the present circumstances brought Retail Credit under the terms of FCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-10\">The report involved here is also a consumer report under \u00a7\u00a7 1681a(d)(3) and 1681b(3)(D). We reach this conclusion from the actual language of \u00a7\u00a7 1681a(d) and 1681b(3)(D) and from the presence of \u00a7 1681f, its legislative history, and its place in the overall statutory scheme. Section 1681b(3)(D) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1150-11\">A consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1150-12\">(3) To a person which it has reason to believe\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1150-13\">(D) intends to use the information in connection with a determination of the consumer\u2019s eligibility for a license or other benefit granted by a governmental instrumentality <em>required by law to consider an applicant\u2019s financial responsibility or status . . . . </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1151-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>Retail Credit asserts that the report involved here is not a \u201cconsumer report\u201d, under those sections. Its argument is that \u00a7 1681a(d) incorporates all of the language contained in \u00a7 1681b(3)(D), including the requirement that the governmental agency to which the report is furnished be \u201crequired by law to consider an applicant\u2019s financial responsibility or status.\u201d Since the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, under the evidence adduced on the motion, is not required by law to be concerned with plaintiff\u2019s financial responsibility or status, so the argument runs, the information furnished could not constitute a \u201cconsumer report.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\">While \u00a7 1681a is a purely definitional section, \u00a7 1681b is, as its title states, a list of the \u201c[p]ermissible purposes of consumer reports.\u201d Only secondarily does \u00a7 1681b(3)(D) supplement \u00a7 1681a\u2019s definition of what is a \u201cconsumer report,\u201d and then only according to the language in the latter and not because of an additional specific definition in \u00a7 1681b.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">What is most significant is that \u00a7 1681a(d), in listing the purposes which render the furnishing of information a \u201cconsumer report\u201d speaks in terms of \u201celigibility for . [the] purposes authorized under section 1681b . . . .\u201d Translated to the facts of this ease, \u00a7 1681a(d)(3) may be read to mean that the furnishing of information about an individual to serve as a factor for a determination of plaintiff\u2019s eligibility for a license to practice medicine renders the report a \u201cconsumer report,\u201d irrespective of the actual authority of the Texas licensing board to consider financial responsibility or status, or Retail Credit\u2019s reasonable belief as to the board\u2019s authority. The matter of the board\u2019s authority to consider financial responsibility or status, or Retail Credit\u2019s reasonable belief as to the board\u2019s authority in that respect, is significant only to Retail Credit\u2019s statutory right to furnish the information, not as to whether the information furnished is a \u201cconsumer report.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We so read it. It is not necessary to read \u00a7 1681a(d)(3) as incorporating all of the minutiae of \u00a7 1681b(3)(D), only the general subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-12\">There is a compelling reason to read \u00a7 1681a(d)(3) as incorporating only the general subject matter (but not all specific detail) of \u00a7 1681b(3)(D). A reading which separates restrictive and definitional aspects of \u00a7 1681b(3)(D) is necessary to give meaning and effect to \u00a7 1681f, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1151-13\">Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1681b of this title, a consumer reporting agency may furnish identifying information respecting any consumer, limited to his name, address, former addresses, places of employment, or former places of employment, to a governmental agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1151-14\">If \u00a7 1681a(d)(3), the definitional provision, is read to incorporate all of the restrictive detail of \u00a7 1681b(3)(D), \u00a7 1681f would be rendered superfluous, because a consumer reporting agency (Retail Credit) could report the information authorized by \u00a7 1681f, and more, with impunity, if it could establish that the governmental agency to which it reported was not required by law to consider an applicant\u2019s financial responsibility or status and, hence, that the information reported was not a \u201cconsumer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>report\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1681a(d). Section 1681b(3)(D) would, in effect, restrict the coverage of FCRA rather than the activities of consumer reporting agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-4\">The legislative history belies this result. The Senate committee report explained the relationship between the two sections in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-5\">The disclosure of information to governmental agencies is limited to identifying type information . . . unless the governmental agency has obtained a court order or is a bona fide creditor, insurer, employer, or li-censor.\u201d Report of the Committee on Banking and Currency, Fair Credit Reporting, Sen.Rep.No.91 \u2014 517, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. at 6 (1969).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\"><em>See also United States v. Puntieri, </em>379 F.Supp. 332 (D.N.Y.1974); <em>FTC v. Manager, Retail Credit Co., Miami Branch Office, </em>357 F.Supp. 347 (D.D.C.1973), rev\u2019d on other grounds, U.S.App.D.C., 515 F.2d 988 (1975). If Retail Credit\u2019s view of FCRA were adopted, a consumer reporting agency would have greater latitude in providing information to a government agency that was not a \u201cbona fide creditor, insurer, employer, or licensor\u201d than in reporting to one that was. This was clearly not the result intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">Since the information furnished by Retail Credit was a \u201cconsumer report\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1681a(d) both because it was to be used for \u201cemployment purposes,\u201d as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 1681a(h) and 1681b(3)(B), and for determination of plaintiff\u2019s eligibility for a license to practice medicine within the meaning of \u00a7 1681b(3)(D) as partially incorporated into \u00a7 1681a(d), plaintiff must be afforded the opportunity to prove his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1148-10\">. The action was specifically based on 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681n and 1681o which create causes of action in favor of consumers against consumer reporting agencies if the reporting agency has either negligently or willfully failed to comply with <em>\u201cany </em>requirement\u201d (emphasis added) of FCRA. The requirement specifically at issue here is \u00a7 1681e(b) which provides that a consumer reporting agency must \u201cfollow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of the information\u201d contained in a consumer report; Dr. Hoke alleges that Retail Credit did not do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-11\">Jurisdiction is based on 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681p which gives jurisdiction to enforce any liability created by the Act, without regard to amount in controversy, to \u201cany appropriate United States district court\u201d or \u201cany other court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1148-19\">. Neither \u00a7 168In nor \u00a7 1681o creates a cause of action against the individual employees of a consumer reporting agency. Although the district court noted this omission, it did not decide if employees could be sued under FCRA since it concluded that FCRA was not allegedly violated. We do not decide the issue either. The district court will undoubtedly reach it on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">. The district court concluded that subject matter jurisdiction was lacking, although its summary judgment, under Rule 56 F.R.Civ.P., was a final adjudication on the merits. Under \u00a7 1681p, the district court had subject matter jurisdiction because this was an \u201caction to enforce any liability created\u201d by FCRA. We therefore construe the judgment as an adjudication, on the merits, that the report involved here was not a \u201cconsumer report\u201d and thus that this \u201caction to enforce\u201d the liabilities created by FCRA could not be maintained as a matter of law. <em>See generally </em>10 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 2712 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1149-9\">. The remainder of \u00a7 1681a describes three types of reports which are excluded from the statutory definition, none of which is relevant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1149-17\">. Section 1681a(f) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-18\">The term \u201cconsumer reporting agency\u201d means any person which, for monetary fees, dues, or on a cooperative nonprofit basis, regularly engages in whole or in part in the practice of assembling or evaluating consumer credit information or other information on consumers for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties, and which uses any means or facility of interstate commerce for the purpose of preparing or furnishing consumer reports.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1149-19\">. The \u201cemployment purposes\u201d language of \u00a7 1681a(d) has been quoted in the text. Section 1681b(3)(B) is no more specific. It merely provides that a consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report to a person which it has reason to believe \u201cintends to use the information for employment purposes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">. If we were to apply the common-law concept of employee, we would undoubtedly conclude that a physician who practiced his profession as a sole practitioner or as a member of a medical partnership was an independent contractor, and not an employee, because of the absence of control over the manner in which he afforded expert medical services. But in construing FCRA, we are cognizant of its broad remedial purposes, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681, and we are not constrained to limit its application by the common-law concept of master and servant. <em>N. L. R. B. v. Hearst Publications, </em>322 U.S. 120, 64 S.Ct. 851, 88 L.Ed. 1170 (1944); <em>Brennan v. Gilles &amp; Cotting, Inc., </em>504 F.2d 1255 (4 Cir. 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1151-7\">. A defect in Retail Credit\u2019s argument, but not the one on which we pitch our decision, is that it overlooks the provision of \u00a7 1681b(3)(D) that the furnisher of information \u201chas reason to believe\u201d that the licensing body to which a report is made be required by law to investigate financial responsibility or status. The actual authority of the Texas Board may be irrelevant if Retail Credit had a good faith belief that the Board had a statutory duty to investigate financial responsibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1151-17\">. All of the details of \u00a7 1681b(3)(D) are necessarily relevant to authority to issue the report by virtue of the opening language of that section: \u201cunder the following circumstances and no other . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1152-10\">. The report quoted has reference to the original version of the Bill, S. 823. Although certain amendments on other points were incorporated into the version which was finally passed, there were no amendments to the provisions concerning communication of consumer information to government agencies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
