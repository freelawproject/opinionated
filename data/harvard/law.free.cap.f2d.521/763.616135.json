The district court denied the motion and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-15\">The background facts may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b832-16\">The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on August 17, 1974 alleging that the defendants in their offering and sale to the plaintiffs of limited partnership interests in a real estate investment project violated the federal and Pennsylvania securities laws and further engaged in common law fraud and misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-17\">The defendants before making answer to the amended complaint filed their motion to disqualify plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. The motion asserted that \u201c[t]he defendants in this case never had any contact with the plaintiff, Leon Kroungold\u201d;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201call dealings relative to the limited partnership and the investment therein were made through Sheldon M. Bonovitz, Esquire,\u201d a partner in the law firm representing the plaintiffs; and \u201cdefendants intend to call Sheldon M. Bonovitz, Esquire, as a witness for the defendants and when Sheldon Bonovitz is so called, or deposes, he and his law firm will be in violation of Disciplinary Rule 5-102(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b832-18\">The plaintiffs, in their \u201cMemorandum Contra Defendants\u2019 Motion to Disqualify Counsel\u201d below, stated in relevant part that they did not intend to call Bonovitz as a witness \u201csince his very minor involvement on behalf of Mr. Kroungold has no relationship to the factual or legal issues in this litigation,\u201d and \u201c[i]f the Defendants choose to call Mr. Bonovitz as a witness, that fact does not require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>Duane, Morris &amp; Heckscher to withdraw as counsel for Plaintiffs,\u201d under Disciplinary Rule 5 \u2014 102(B), because \u201cthere is nothing known to Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel or in the record of this litigation which would in any way indicate that if Defendants choose to call Mr. Bonovitz as a witness, that his testimony is or may be prejudicial to the interests of Mr. Kroun-gold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The district court in its \u201cMemorandum and Order\u201d stated in relevant part that \u201cthe Court concludes that no cogent reason exists to disqualify the law firm of Duane, Morris &amp; Heckscher as counsel for the plaintiffs . . . under the facts of the instant case,\u201d and \u201c[accordingly, defendants\u2019 motion will be denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">The issue presented is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the defendants\u2019 motion to disqualify the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. <em>Autowest, Inc. </em>v. <em>Peugeot, Inc., </em>434 F.2d 556, 567 (2d Cir. 1970).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">Our discussion must be prefaced by notation of the fact that an order denying a motion to disqualify counsel is appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1970). <em>American Roller Company v. Budinger, </em>513 F.2d 982, 983 (3d Cir. 1975); <em>Richardson v. Hamilton International Corporation, </em>469 F.2d 1382, 1383 n. 1 (3d Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 986, 93 S.Ct. 2271, 36 L.Ed.2d 964 (1973); <em>Greene v. The Singer Company, </em>509 F.2d 750 (3d Cir. 1971). <em>See, too, Silver Chrysler Plymouth, Inc. v. Chrysler Motors, Corp., </em>496 F.2d 800, 804-06 (2d Cir. 1974) (en banc); <em>United States v. Hankish, </em>462 F.2d 316, 318 (4th Cir. 1972); <em>Yablonski v. United Mine Workers of America, </em>147 U.S.App.D.C. 193, 454 F.2d 1036, 1038 (1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>406 U.S. 906, 92 S.Ct. 1609, 31 L.Ed.2d 816 (1972); <em>Uniweld Products, Inc. v. Union Carbide Corp., </em>385 F.2d 992, 994 (5th Cir. 1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U.S. 921, 88 S.Ct. 853, 19 L.Ed.2d 980 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">What has been said brings us to the question whether the district court abused its discretion in its disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">The parties agree that the defendants\u2019 motion to disqualify required the district court to test it by standards imposed by Canon 5.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They do not agree, however, as to the impact, if any, of the Disciplinary Rules (hereinafter D.R.) promulgated under Canon 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">The defendants contend that D.R. 5-102(A) and D.R. 5 \u2014 102(B) required granting of their disqualification motion. The plaintiffs urge that the motion had to be tested only by the requirements of D.R. 5 \u2014 102(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-16\">The cited Rules provide in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-17\"><em>D.R. 5 </em>\u2014 <em>102(A) </em>\u2014 If, after undertaking employment in contemplated or pending litigation, <em>a lawyer learns or it is obvious that he or a lawyer in his firm ought to be called as a witness on be</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number><em>half of his client, he shall withdraw from the conduct of the trial and his firm, if any, shall not continue representation in the trial, </em>except that he may continue the representation and he or a lawyer in his firm may testify in [circumstances not relevant herein], (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-5\"><em>D.R. 5 </em>\u2014 <em>102(B) </em>\u2014 If, after undertaking employment in contemplated or pending litigation, <em>a lawyer learns or it is obvious that he or a lawyer in his firm may be called as a witness other than on behalf of his client, he may continue the representation until it is apparent that his testimony is or may be prejudicial to his client, </em>(emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">D.R. 5 \u2014 102(A) provides in essence that an attorney <em>\"shall withdraw\u201d </em>from a case when he \u201clearns or it is obvious that he or a lawyer in his firm <em>ought to be called as a witness on behalf of his client.\u201d </em>It is without impact in the instant case in light of the fact that counsel for the plaintiffs expressly stated below that <em>\u201c[pjlaintiffs have no intention of calling Mr. Bonovitz as a witness, since his very minor involvement as counsel for Mr. Kroungold has no relationship to the factual and legal issues in this </em>litigation\"<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">The defendants fail to perceive the sweep of D.R. 5 \u2014 102(A) when they contend that it is called into play by the circumstance that <em>they </em>\u201cintend to call\u201d Bonovitz <em>\u201cas a witness for the defendants.\u201d </em><footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-8\">The question remains as to the impact, if any, on D.R. 5 \u2014 102(B), by reason of the defendants\u2019 announced intention to call Bonovitz \u201cas a witness for the defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">This Rule provides in essence that when an attorney learns that he or a member of his firm \u201cmay be called as a witness <em>other than on behalf of his client, </em>he <em>may </em>continue the representation <em>until it is apparent that his testimony is or may be prejudicial to his client.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">The defendants did not contend below, nor do they do so here, that Mr. Bonovitz\u2019 testimony, should they call him, will be prejudicial to the plaintiffs. They only <em>suggest </em>that <em>if </em>they call upon him to testify \u201chis answers <em>may </em>prejudice his client,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and in doing so, they do not specify in what respect Bonovitz\u2019 testimony \u201cmay prejudice his client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b834-14\">The plaintiffs on the other hand, have, as earlier noted, specifically stated that <em>\u201cthere is nothing . . . which would in any way indicate\u201d </em>that Bonovitz, if called by the defendants, would give testimony <em>\u201cprejudicial\u2019 </em>to them, (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-16\">It is pertinent to note at this juncture that the Special Committee for the Evaluation of Ethical Standards which drafted the Canons and the Disciplinary Rules, stated in its Comment on D.R. 5 \u2014 102(B) that it \u201cwas not designed to permit a lawyer to call opposing counsel as a witness and thereby disqualify him as counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-17\">The cases and American and New York Bar Association Opinions cited by the defendants afford no nourishment to their position.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-18\">For the reasons stated we cannot say that the district court abused its permissible discretion when it denied the defendants\u2019 disqualification motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-19\">The Order of the district court denying the defendants\u2019 \u201cMotion to Disqualify Counsel\u201d will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-19\">. Defendants do not challenge the law firm\u2019s representation of co-plaintiff, Bochey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b833-9\">. We applied the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard in reviewing district court dispositions of motions to disqualify counsel grounded on Canon 4 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which relates to the fiduciary relationship existing between lawyer and client, in <em>Richardson v. Hamilton International Corporation, </em>469 F.2d 1382, 1386 (3d Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 986, 93 S.Ct. 2271, 36 L.Ed.2d 964 (1973); <em>Greene v. The Singer Company, </em>461 F.2d 242, 243 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 848, 93 S.Ct. 54, 34 L.Ed.2d 89 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">We have, however, in a Canon 4 situation, recently expressed \u201cserious reservations . whether our scope of review is limited to finding an abuse of discretion in disqualification cases such as this [where] it appears that in issue ... is the purely legal question whether two allegedly adverse representations are so intertwined that it can be said that in the former representation the attorney \u2018might have acquired\u2019 material \u2018substantially related\u2019 to the subject matter of the second representation,\u201d and the \u201c[d]etermination of that question leaves little leeway for the exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>American Roller Company v. Bu-dinger, </em>513 F.2d 982, 985 n. 3 (3d Cir. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b833-19\">.
