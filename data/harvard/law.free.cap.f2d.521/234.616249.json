Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., </em>5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b303-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Appellant, Fagan Dickson, brought suit as a taxpayer, challenging the constitutionality of the Emergency Security Assistance Act of 1973, Pub.Law. 93--199.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dickson\u2019s complaint alleged that the State of Israel \u201cwas created by and is an instrument of the larger entity known as the \u2018Jewish People\u2019 \u201d, and, hence, grants of foreign assistance by the United States to Israel are prohibited by the Establishment of Religion Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-10\">A three-judge court, convened pursuant to Title 28, U.S.C., Sections 2282, 2284, dismissed the complaint on two grounds: (i) Dickson failed to meet the standing requirements enunciated in <em>Flast v. Cohen, </em>1968, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947, as a taxpayer to maintain the action, and (ii) the cause presented a non justiciable \u201cpolitical question\u201d. <em>Dickson v. Nixon, </em>W.D.Tex. 1974, 379 F.Supp. 1345. Direct appeal of the order of dismissal was taken to the United States Supreme Court, pursuant to Title 28, U.S.C., Section 1253. The Supreme Court on the basis of its holding in <em>Gonzalez v. Automatic Employees Credit Union, </em>1974, 419 U.S. 90, 95 S.Ct. 289, 42 L.Ed.2d 249, vacated the order of the three-judge court, and remanded the case to the district court to enter a \u201cfresh order\u201d. <em>Dickson v. Ford, </em>1974, 419 U.S. 1085, 95 S.Ct. 672, 42 L.Ed.2d 677. On remand the three-judge court reiterated its determination that a non-justiciable issue was presented, dissolved itself, and remanded the case to the convening judge for further proceedings. The convening judge granted Dickson\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint to include a challenge to Sections 18 and 45(a)(7) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1974, Pub.Law 93-559, 88 Stat. 1795,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> so as to avoid any question of mootness, and entered an order of dismissal, adopting the reasoning in the opinion of the three-judge court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">We affirm the dismissal of the action, agreeing with the district court that this cause clearly presents a nonjusticiable political question beyond the jurisdictional limitations imposed upon federal courts by Art. Ill of the Constitution. We decline to reach the issue of whether as a taxpayer Dickson has satisfied the standing requirements of <em>Flast v. Cohen, </em>supra, to challenge these Congressional appropriations.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">The nonjusticiability of political questions is founded on the doctrine of separation of powers, whether a matter has been committed to another branch of government by the Constitution. <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>1962, 369 U.S. 186, 210, 82 S.Ct. 691, 706, 7 L.Ed.2d 663, 682. The dominant considerations in reaching a determination that a question falls into the category of political questions have been held to be \u201cthe appropriateness under our system of government of attributing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>finality to the action of the political departments and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination . . <em>Coleman v. Miller, </em>1939, 307 U.S. 433, 454-455, 59 S.Ct. 972, 982, 83 L.Ed. 1385, 1397;. <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>supra at 210, 82 S.Ct. at 706, 7 L.Ed.2d at 682. Among the areas which the courts have traditionally deemed to involve political questions is the conduct of foreign relations, which \u201cis committed by the Constitution to the executive and legislative \u2014 \u2018the political\u2019 \u2014 departments of the government . . .\u201d <em>Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., </em>1918, 246 U.S. 297, 302, 38 S.Ct. 309, 311, 62 L.Ed. 726, 732. While not every case which concerns foreign relations is beyond judicial determination, a \u201cdiscriminating analysis\u201d of the particular issues presented in a given controversy is called for. <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>supra, at 211-212, 82 S.Ct. at 707, 7 L.Ed.2d at 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Appellant\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of the Congressional Acts in question is a challenge to the power of the President and Congress to conduct the foreign affairs of the United States. Both the Congress and the President have determined that military and economic assistance to the State of Israel is necessary at this time to \u201cmaintain a balance of forces in the Middle East and [to] maintain Israel\u2019s self-defense capacity, in accordance with long-standing national policy of the United States\u201d. S.Rep.No.93-657, 93d Cong. 1st Session 3 (1973); 9 Weekly Compilation of Presidential Documents 1291 (Oct. 29, 1973). We hold that a determination of whether foreign aid to Israel is necessary at this particular time is a \u201cquestion uniquely demandpng] single-voiced statement of the Government\u2019s views\u201d, <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>supra, at 211, 82 S.Ct. at 707, 7 L.Ed.2d at 682, and a decision \u201cof a kind for which the Judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities nor responsibility . . . .\u201d <em>Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corporation, </em>1948, 333 U.S. 103, 111, 68 S.Ct. 431, 436, 92 L.Ed. 568, 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">Our reluctance to affirm the decision of the district court on the ground that appellant has failed to satisfy the second leg of the test enunciated in <em>Flast </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>supra, is caused by the recent decisions of the Supreme Court in <em>Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War, </em>1974, 418 U.S. 208, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706, and <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>1974, 418 U.S. 166, 94 S.Ct. 2940, 41 L.Ed.2d 678, and by the apparent failure of the court below to distinguish between the Establishment Clause and the Freedom of Religion Clause of the First Amendment. Since we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the cause on the alternative ground in that court\u2019s opinion that a non justiciable political question is presented, we express no view as to the correctness of the district court\u2019s opinion on the issue of taxpayer standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-11\">.
