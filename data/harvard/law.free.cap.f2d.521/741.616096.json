The United States also contends in this appeal that the action of the bankruptcy court is prohibited by the Declaratory Judgment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Harry Bostwick and Steva Bostwick filed voluntary petitions in bankruptcy on February 15, 1973, in which the United States was listed as a creditor in the amount of $68,400. This sum represented unpaid taxes for the years 1963 through 1967. The United States did not file proofs of claim in either proceeding. Orders of discharge were entered by the referee on May 2, 1973. The bankrupts, on May 3, 1973, filed applications to determine the dischargeability of debts owed to the United States. The United States, on June 26, 1973, filed a motion to dismiss the applications on grounds that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to grant the bankrupts\u2019 applications. On July 10, 1973, the bankrupts sought an order enjoining the United States from collecting back taxes from the bankrupts until the dis-chargeability of the debts was determined by the bankruptcy court. On that same date, the bankruptcy court held that it had jurisdiction to determine the dischargeability of the debts owed the United States and, thereupon, enjoined the United States from instituting any proceedings against the bankrupts to collect any taxes for 1968 or prior years until the question of the dischargeability of the tax debts was determined by the bankruptcy court. Upon a petition for review filed by the United States, the District Court affirmed and the United States appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">JURISDICTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT TO DETERMINE THE DISCHARGEABILITY OF A TAX DEBT WHERE THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT FILED A PROOF OF CLAIM.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">The dispute as to whether the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to determine the dischargeability of the bankrupts\u2019 tax debt where the United States has not filed a proof of claim or otherwise participated in or otherwise voluntarily consented to the proceedings turns on the proper interpretation of \u00a7 2(a) of the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute provides that courts of bankruptcy have jurisdiction to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-12\">Hear and determine, or cause to be heard and determined, any question arising as to the amount or legality of any unpaid tax, whether or not previously assessed, which has not prior to bankruptcy been contested before and adjudicated by a judicial or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">The government contends, despite the plain language of the statute, that Congress did not intend to waive the sovereign immunity of the United States. In support of its position, the government cites a report of the majority of the Senate Finance Committee<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> wherein it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-14\">* * * This committee understands that this amendment makes no change in present law under which a bankruptcy court cannot adjudicate the merits of any claim, including a Federal tax claim, which has not been as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>serted in the bankruptcy proceeding by the filing of a proof of claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The precise issue before us was considered by Judge Mahon of the Northern District of Texas in a well reasoned and exhaustively researched opinion. Judge Mahon concluded that the government\u2019s reliance on the majority report of the Senate Finance Committee was misplaced and that a thorough examination of the legislative history supported a determination that the amendment was intended to grant jurisdiction to the bankruptcy court in factual situations of the type presented here. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-6\">A review of the legislative history relative to \u00a7 2a(2A) and its companion amendments reveals that the statement of the Senate Finance Committee that is herein given emphasis by the Government appears in the closing paragraph of the last section of the majority views of Senate Report No. 999. The statement is made under the concluding general topic, \u201cComments on Other Provisions of the Bill,\u201d not under the more specific section captioned \u201cDischarge of Taxes\u201d wherein H.R. 3438 (encompassing the \u00a7 2a(2A) amendment) was addressed. In fact, the Senate Finance Committee\u2019s recommendations on H.R. 3438 appeared in Senate Report 998, not Senate Report No. 999, * * * and though the Finance Committee discussed its recommendations on both H.R. 3438 and H.R. 136 in Senate Report No. 999, its views relative to H.R. 3438 were not adopted and its recommendations relative thereto were expressly rejected. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-13\"><em>In re Durensky, </em>377 F.Supp. 798, 801 (N.D.Tex.1974) (Footnotes omitted.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-14\">Judge Mahon, in addition, relied upon the observations of two bankruptcy experts<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> who agree that the statement in the report of the Senate Finance Committee is not determinative in interpreting the amendment. First, they note that the bill to amend the Bankruptcy Act originated in the House and that the House never considered the construction placed on the amendment by the majority report of the Senate Finance Committee. Second, the bill, after passage in the House, was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee which in turn referred the bill to the Senate Finance Committee for consideration of the tax aspects. Third, the majority of the Finance Committee, at the request of the Treasury Department, proposed a number of changes in the bill and included these recommendations, along with the statement under consideration here, in the majority report. Fourth, the Judiciary Committee rejected the proposals made by the Finance Committee, adopted the minority views opposing the changes and recommended passage of the House Bill without change. The Senate accepted the recommendation of its Judiciary Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-15\">In the light of such legislative history, the self-serving statement in the majority report of the Finance Committee \u2014 inserted at the behest of the Treasury Department \u2014 cannot be accorded consideration in construing the amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>We are in complete agreement with Judge Mahon\u2019s analysis. It is evident to us that the Congress, as a whole, rejected the viewpoint stated in the majority report of the Senate Finance Committee and intended the plain meaning of the amendment to have effect. The amendment provides that the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to \u201chear and determine * * * <em>any question </em>arising as to the amount or legality of any unpaid tax, whether or not previously assessed * * (Emphasis supplied.) We find no reason to avoid the plain meaning or to strain the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">Further, we are in agreement with Judge Mahon\u2019s conclusion that the subsequent amendments to the Bankruptcy Act and the Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> do not support the government\u2019s position. Rather, such amendments and rules support and are consistent with the conclusion that the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction in the instant case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Had Congress wished to create the exception urged by the government, it had the opportunity to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">JURISDICTION OF THE BANKRUPTCY COURT TO ENJOIN THE DISTRICT DIRECTOR FROM COLLECTING FEDERAL TAXES.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">The United States contends that suits to enjoin the assessment and/or collection of taxes are prohibited by the \u201canti-injunction\u201d statute and hence that the bankruptcy court was without jurisdiction to issue an injunction in this case. Section 7421(a) of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">Except as provided in sections 6212(a) and (c), 6213(a), and 7426(a)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-14\">and (b)(1), no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-15\">The United States argues that none of the statutory exemptions are applicable to the present case and that the narrow judicial exception as announced in <em>En-ochs v. Williams Packing Co., </em>370 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 1125, 8 L.Ed.2d 292 (1962)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and reaffirmed in <em>Bob Jones University v. Simon, </em>416 U.S. 725, 94 S.Ct. 2038, 40 L.Ed.2d 496 (1974) and <em>Alexander v. \u201cAmericans United\u201d, Inc., </em>416 U.S. 752, 94 S.Ct. 2053, 40 L.Ed.2d 518 (1974), is equally inapplicable. We agree. However, we do not believe that the \u201canti-injunction statute\u201d is relevant to the present case inasmuch as Congress has evidenced an intention to enact a complete scheme governing bankruptcy which overrides the general policy represented by the \u201canti-injunction\u201d act.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-16\">We stated above that, in our opinion, Congress has given the bankruptcy court jurisdiction under Section 2a(2A) of the Bankruptcy Act, <em>supra, </em>to determine the dischargeability of a tax debt where the United States had not filed a proof of claim or otherwise participated in or consented to the proceedings. We believe that the overriding policy of the Bankruptcy Act is the rehabilitation of the debtor and we are convinced that the Bankruptcy Court must have the power to enjoin the assessment and/or collection of taxes in order to protect its jurisdiction, administer the bankrupt\u2019s estate in an orderly and efficient manner, and fulfill the ultimate policy of the Bankruptcy Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>Section 17(c) of the Bankruptcy Act<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">(1) The bankrupt or any creditor may file an application with the court for the determination of dischargeability of any debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">(3) After hearing upon notice, the court shall determine the dischargea-bility of any debt for which an application for such determination has been filed, shall make such orders as are necessary to protect or effectuate a determination that any debt is dis-chargeable and, if any debt is determined to be nondischargeable, shall determine the remaining issues, render judgment, and make all orders necessary for the enforcement thereof. A creditor who files such application does not submit himself to the jurisdiction of the court for any purposes other than those specified in this subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">(4) The provisions of this subdivision shall apply whether or not an action on a debt is then pending in another court and any part may be enjoined from instituting or continuing such action prior to or during the pendency of a proceling to determine its dis-chargeaHity under this subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"akb-dedup-0\">We note first, that Congress, in subsection (ej), has given the bankruptcy court juriliction to determine the \u201cdis-chargeabby of any debt\u201d at the request of either he bankrupt or any creditor. Second, iisubsection (c)(3), the Congress has giverthe court the power to \u201cmake such orde as are necessary to protect or effectite a determination that any debt is cbhargeable.\u201d Third, the Congress, in absection (c)(4), has given the court jusdiction to enjoin actions in other cofts pending its determination. In our onion, Congress here evidences a comple scheme of regulation and procedures i be followed in determining the disclrgeability of debts. We think that th\u00e9hrase in subsection (c)(3) em-powerinjthe bankruptcy court to make the nectary orders to protect or effectuate it determination means exactly what it ates and that the court has the power tenjoin the enforcement and/or collectic of taxes. Furthermore, we think tt the provision in subsection (c)(4), ahorizing the issuance of injunctions, clrly evidences an intent by Congress tt the orderly administration of the Bsruptcy Act take precedence over tl general policy stated in the \u201canti-iinction\u201d act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>This is a case of first impresbn in our Court and neither the United ;ates nor the bankrupts nor our own resarch has disclosed previous controlling decisions on this issue. The United Stes contends that each year there are lousands of bankruptcies and that our hding will force the government to eithe litigate the dischargeability or forego ai chance of recovery. It points out thatn many cases, there are no assets of an significance and it would be economilly unsound to enter into the case anlitigate the issues. The only time it is .onomi-cally feasible to contest the diaargea-bility of the tax debt is after th debtor has rehabilitated himself and hi after-acquired assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">While we recognize that t United States has a strong interestn protecting the revenue and that ourolding will place a burden on the government, we nevertheless are constrained to follow the plain meaning of the statute as enacted by Congress. We think that Congress intended that the bankrupt have the opportunity for a full and final determination of the dischargeability of his tax debts in order that he might avoid having a sword of Damocles hanging over his head. The purpose of the Bankruptcy Act is to rehabilitate the debtor in order that the debtor might be motivated to lead a full and productive economic life.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Taxes very often represent one of the largest \u2014 if not the largest- \u2014 debts of the bankruptcy debtor. Congress specifically changed the law so that certain of the tax debts might be discharged.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We cannot believe, in light of the statute, that the Congress nevertheless intended that the debtor be left in a state of uncertainty, subject at any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>time to the whim of the Revenue Service determination that it should now step in. Such a reading of the statute would surely damage the morale of the debtor and defeat the Act\u2019s rehabilitative policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">APPLICABILITY OF THE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">The United States contends on appeal that the bankrupt\u2019s applications to determine dischargeability of a debt (federal taxes for the years 1963 \u2014 1967) are expressly prohibited by the \u201cdeclaratory judgment\u201d statute (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-8\">In a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, except with respect to Federal taxes, any court of the United States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought. Any such declaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and shall be reviewable as such.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">We think that it is manifestly clear that the \u201capplications\u201d are not requests for declaratory judgments in the sense that the statute is intended to prohibit. The \u201capplications\u201d are concerned with taxes allegedly due and owing for the years 1963 \u2014 1967. The requests for discharge were not concerned with the consequences of a future course of conduct from which tax liabilities may arise. Moreover, we believe that the same logic applies here as was discussed <em>supra </em>with regard to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court to issue an injunction in such situations as the instant case. We cannot believe that Congress gave the bankruptcy court jurisdiction to determine the dischargeability of tax debts where the United States has not filed a proof of claim, as we have held, and then intended that the determinations should be prohibited by the Declaratory Judgment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"AGoW\">Affirmed,</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\"><em>(\u00a3 </em>| KEYNUMBERSYSTEM^</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">.

However, the subsection of the sov-ers to the injunctive power of the court, wt would not otherwise be materially ch;ed, does not confer on the bankruptcy cos any power <em>(unless section 17c is pnrly invoked) </em>to go beyond collection, adiistration and distribution of the estate ano determine issues of personal liability been the debtor and his creditors.

The fundamental policy of the Banptcy Act is to provide a means for (1) thffec-tive rehabilitation of the bankrupt 1 (2) the equitable distribution of his \u00a1sets among his creditors. These basic coiera-tions are involved in the problem tchich this bill is addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">Under existing law debts for taxes not affected by a discharge in bankruptcsec. 17a(l) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 3.C. 35(a)(1)). Similarly, taxes are entitko a priority of payment, in advance of thayment of any dividend to general crors, which is unlimited as to time (sec. 64e 11 U.S.C. 104(a)(4)). This applies to all taxes whether due to Federal, State, or local governments. Although taxes have enjoyed this special status for many years, the enormous increase in the tax burden during recent years and the consequent impact on both the distribution of a bankrupt\u2019s estate and his financial rehabilitation, require a modification of that status.</p>\n<p id=\"azq-dedup-0\">There are two aspects to the problem. The first of these involves the nondischarge-ability of taxes under section 17a(l) of the present law. Frequently, this prevents an honest but financially unfortunate debtor from making a fresh start unburdened by what may be an overwhelming liability for accumulated taxes. The large proportion of individual and commercial income now consumed by various taxes makes the problem especially acute. Furthermore, the nondis-chargeability feature of the law operates in a manner which is unfairly discriminatory against the private individual or the unincorporated small businessman. Although a corporate bankrupt is theoretically not discharged, the corporation normally ceases to exist upon bankruptcy and unsatisfied tax claims, as well as all other unsatisfied claims, are without further recourse even though the enterprise may continue in a new corporate form.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab1\">S.Rep.No.1158, 89th Cong., 2d Sess.
