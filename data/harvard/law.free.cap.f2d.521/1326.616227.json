The other, Myrtle Hurst, testified that while in Canada she had given Salter $250 in Canadian currency for the same purpose. The women turned up at Salter\u2019s home in Buffalo, New York, on the afternoon of Sunday, July 29, 1973, although there is some confusion over the details as to just how they got there.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is undisputed that their entry into the United States was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1395-20\">Around 9:00 P.M. Salter escorted the two women to the Greyhound Bus Terminal where they purchased one-way tickets to New York City. Border Patrol Agents Fern\u00e1n and Chandler had conducted what they termed a routine \u201cimmigration check\u201d of persons boarding the bus.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the agents thought that all passengers had been checked, they saw the two women, still escorted by Salter, about to enter the bus. The agents returned and, after showing their credentials, asked Salter and the women to state their citizenship and where they were born. All answered \u201cBuffalo\u201d but the women did this \u201cwith a heavy accent\u201d sounding, Agent Fern\u00e1n testified, like \u201cBoofalo.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Agent Fern\u00e1n thereupon asked Salter to come into the baggage room, while Agent Chandler took the two women across the terminal to the agents\u2019 car. After giving Salter \u201ca quick frisk,\u201d Agent Fern\u00e1n asked for identification. Salter pulled a thick wallet from his pocket and opened it to get out a driver\u2019s license. The agent observed a large quantity of currency, some of it red and apparently Canadian \u2014 an observation confirmed when at Agent Fernan\u2019s request Salter counted the money.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Shortly after this, Agent Chandler entered the baggage room and announced \u201cWell, the girls broke. He did bring them in. They stated it.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Salter was then placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>The defendant does not assert that the routine interrogation by Border Patrol Agents of passengers boarding a bus in Buffalo bound for New York City was invalid, and we accordingly express no opinion on that point.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> His argument is rather that the testimony as to the contents of the wallet should have been excluded as being the fruit of unlawful conduct by the agents after that initial contact. We find nothing unlawful. To a trained border patrol agent at Buffalo, only two miles from the nearest bridge from Canada, the assertions of two women with \u201cheavy accents\u201d that they had been born in \u201cBoofalo\u201d was enough to warrant further investigation, although not to justify an arrest. In contrast to the situation in California and many other states where the number of Mexicans who have been legally admitted or have become American citizens renders Mexican accent or appearance insufficient as an indicator of illegal entry, see <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975); <em>United States v. Mallides, </em>473 F.2d 859 (9 Cir. 1973), the agents could rely on their experience that few people born in Buffalo have a Jamaican accent. <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 884-87, 95 S.Ct. 2585. Although Salter did not have a foreign accent, his close involvement in helping the women get on the bus, combined with his silence when they said they were born in \u201cBoofalo,\u201d was sufficient to raise a reasonable suspicion that he was a participant in violating the law. That suspicion serves to authorize a brief interrogation, as the Supreme Court held in <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 146, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1396-7\">A brief stop of a suspicious individual, in order to determine his identity or to maintain the status quo momentarily while obtaining more information, may be most reasonable in light of the facts known to the officer at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ayz-dedup-0\"><em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, supra, </em>422 U.S. at 881-83, 95 S.Ct. 2574, has now settled that such an investigation, based on reasonable suspicion, may be used to enforce the immigration laws.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We likewise see nothing wrong in Agent Fernan\u2019s asking Salter to step into the baggage room, a place more convenient for interrogation than an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>open platform; in any event this had no causal relation to what transpired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-4\">The remaining question, if there be one, is whether the agent had the right to demand identification rather than simply asking for Salter\u2019s name and address. Once a lawful stop for investigative purposes is under way, it is mere routine for an officer to ask for identification, see <em>United States v. Lincoln, </em>494 F.2d 833, 838 (9 Cir. 1974). <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>in the language just quoted, appears to sanction this. We have previously done so, <em>United States v. Santana, </em>485 F.2d 365, 368 (2 Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 931, 94 S.Ct. 1444, 39 L.Ed.2d 490 (1974), as have other courts, <em>Dell </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>468 F.2d 324, 326 (5 Cir. 1972), <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 938, 93 S.Ct. 1904, <em>cert. denied, </em>411 U.S. 938, 93 S.Ct. 1904, 36 L.Ed.2d 400 (1973). Such a request is relatively non-intrusive, and there are important reasons why an officer needs to obtain a correct identification. In this case, Agent Fern\u00e1n might have wished to telephone Border Patrol Headquarters to see whether Salter had a record of smuggling aliens from Canada. To imagine an even simpler case, an officer may need to know a person\u2019s identity so as to be able to contact him at a later date. See ALI, Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, Commentary, 270 (Proposed Official Draft April 15, 1975). Naturally, there is a possibility of harassment in even routine requests for identification, but there are too many legitimate uses not to allow it once an otherwise lawful stop has taken place. LaFave, <em>\u201cStreet Encounters\u201d and the Constitution: </em>Terry, Sibron, Peters, <em>and Beyond, </em>67 Mich.L.Rev. 39, 61-62 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-6\">When Salter responded to this request for identification by exposing his wallet, the large amounts of currency came into plain view and were lawful evidence. <em>Harris v. United States, </em>390 U.S. 234, 236, 88 S.Ct. 992, 19 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1968); cf. <em>United States v. Riggs, </em>474 F.2d 699, 704 (2 Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 820, 94 S.Ct. 115, 38 L.Ed.2d 53 (1973). We need not debate whether the plain view exception also covers the slightly more detailed testimony of what Agent Fern\u00e1n observed after Salter counted the money. If it did not, which we do not decide, any additional impact of this testimony was so minimal that the doctrine of harmless error would apply-</p>\n<p id=\"b1397-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1395-12\">. The jury was unable to agree on two other counts charging Salter with unlawfully bringing the women into the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1395-13\">. This confusion doubtless accounts for the jury\u2019s disagreement on the counts for unlawful transportation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1395-14\">. According to Agent Fern\u00e1n this consisted of asking all passengers to identify themselves, to state their citizenship and, if they were aliens, to show what identification they had.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1395-21\">. This was <em>the testimony </em>at trial. At the suppression hearing Agent Fern\u00e1n spoke in terms of a \u201cJamaican accent\u201d or a \u201chigh English accent\u201d which he had heard before, presumably from persons born in Jamaica.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1395-22\">. The court refused to allow testimony as to the amount revealed \u2014 $900, including some $500 in Canadian bills.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1395-23\">. The judge instructed the jury not to take into account what the agent said the women said.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1396-4\">. The recent Supreme Court decisions in <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>422 U.S. 891, 95 S.Ct. 2585, 45 L.Ed.2d 623 (1975) and <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975), provide no firm resolution as to the validity of checkpoint stops made for the purpose of routinely inquiring into citizenship status, where no search is made. <em>Compare </em>the comments of Justice Rehnquist, concurring in <em>Ortiz, </em>422 U.S. at 898, 95 S.Ct. 2585, <em>with </em>the comments of Justices White and Blackmun, concurring in <em>Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. at 914, 95 S.Ct. 2574. In addition to possible considerations of waiver, we would not want to resolve this troublesome issue in a case where there was an inadequate record below, and the point was not briefed by either side on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1396-5\">The question might stand differently if <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barbera, </em>514 F.2d 294 (2 Cir. 1975) were conclusive on the issue here presented, but it is not. In <em>Barbera </em>this court affirmed the suppression of evidence taken from the defendant as a result of a citizenship interrogation in a bus depot in Malone, New York. The reasoning of the case, however, depended on the characterization of that encounter as a \u201csearch\u201d carried out by a \u201croving patrol\u201d while not at a \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of the border, and thus impermissible under <em>Aimeida-Sanchez v. United States, </em>413 U.S. 266, 93 S.Ct. 2535, 37 L.Ed.2d 596 (1973). Given the paucity of the record below, and in light of the Supreme Court decisions subsequent to <em>Barbera, </em>we do not think that the record here requires us to characterize the interrogation of the two women in a similar manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1396-9\">. The American Law Institute\u2019s Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure \u00a7 110.2(l)(a) (Proposed Official Draft, April 15, 1975) would limit the stop authority to cases where there is a reasonable suspicion of the past or imminent commission of a crime \u201cinvolving danger of forcible injury to persons or of appropriation of or damage to property.\u201d This was implicitly rejected as a constitutional limitation in <em>Adams v. Williams, </em>407 U.S. 143, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972), since, although it had been reported that Williams was carrying a gun, this itself was not a crime under Connecticut law, Conn.Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 29-35, 29-38. The suspected crime was the possession of narcotics.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
