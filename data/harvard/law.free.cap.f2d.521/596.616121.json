Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., </em>303 U.S. 41, 58 S.Ct. 459, 82 L.Ed. 638 (1938); <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Schauffler, et al., </em>303 U.S. 54, 58 S.Ct. 466, 82 L.Ed. 646 (1938); <em>Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., Inc., </em>415 U.S. 1, 94 S.Ct. 1028, 39 L.Ed.2d 123 (1974); <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. NLRB, </em>433 F.2d 210 (6th Cir. 1970); and</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Further believing that <em>Leedom v. Kyne, </em>358 U.S. 184, 79 S.Ct. 180, 3 L.Ed.2d 210 (1958), relied upon by the District Court is clearly inapplicable to the current litigation, and that plaintiff\u2019s relief concerning the procedural issues it desires to present is plainly a petition for review to be filed in the appropriate United States Court of Appeals under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e)(f) (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Now, therefore, said motion for summary reversal is hereby granted because this court concludes that clear error requires reversal and vacation of the judgment and order of the District Court herein complained of.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
