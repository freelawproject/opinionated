Nabors testified that he arranged for, and then witnessed, a sale between defendant and one Glenn \u201cBub-ba\u201d Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-21\">Nabors, the record discloses, was a professional informant. He has, he testified, \u201cworked throughout the State of Michigan,\u201d in Canada, in New York, and in Ohio. He met with police officers and narcotics agents in Chicago in answer to \u201ca flier out from the State of Iowa, requesting an undercover, and we was answering the flier.\u201d After a conference concerning working in Iowa he proceeded, with agents and his \u201cgirl friend\u201d to Waterloo, Iowa. There he was shown pictures of suspects and it was suggested to him that defendant might be one of them. His assigned duties were to become known in black and white neighborhoods, \u201cdevelop information and, if possible, make purchases, make buys of hard drugs, which is known as heroin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-22\">His compensation did not depend upon the cases he \u201cmade\u201d but covered his living expenses, \u201cfood, rent, [and] so forth,\u201d including those of his female companion, the total amounting to some twelve hundred dollars in this case, plus \u201chelp\u201d on occasion with the expenses of a car he had obtained. What his local employment arrangements were, besides his un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>dercover work, are not clear from the record, since objection to a question as to the details of Agent (not to be confused with defendant) Johnson\u2019s conceded \u201cdealings\u201d with the informant\u2019s employer was sustained. In addition the informant had opportunity, of which he availed himself, of making a little money on the side. Thus he received $200, unreported to his superiors, for introducing \u201cpeople [who] wanted to buy some heroin\u201d to \u201ca guy that was in this line of business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\">The principal issue before us concerns his attempted impeachment. He testified that immediately prior to his coming to Iowa he had worked in Muskegon, Michigan, and that his <em>modus operandi, </em>save as to the quantity of heroin bought, there was basically as in Iowa. In Muskegon, he testified, he had made a \u201cbuy\u201d from one Matt Durda, Jr., and had so informed the authorities. After more foundational questions defendant then made an offer of proof, set forth <em>in extenso </em>in the margin hereof.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> What he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>offered to prove in substance was that the Muskegon case was a \u201cframe-up\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by this informant-witness and that the Muskegon County Attorney had accordingly moved the court for dismissal of the charges.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The offer of proof was rejected by the trial court on the ground that it was immaterial, and a collateral matter, concerning which extrinsic testimony was not admissible. The defendant argues that, under these unique facts, the foreclosure of his defense as to the alleged mendacity of the informant went far beyond mere \u201cerror\u201d as to the introduction of evidence but was so gross and decisive as to amount to a deprivation of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We here consider, then, the unique problems presented by the testimony of the paid informer. His employment has been the subject of extensive commentary, little or none of it approbative.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">That his motivation may well be to make good in his employment by producing violators is commonly known. As we stated in <em>United States v. Barnes, </em>486 F.2d 776, 780 (8th Cir. 1973):<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-18\">The practice of the Government in employing agent-informers in narcotics cases is well known. We also know that such agents are usually not trained officers \u2014 often they are themselves addicts or former addicts. The Government must know that an eager informer is exposed to temptations to produce as many accuseds as possible at the risk of trapping not merely an unwary criminal but sometimes an unwary innocent as well. One could hardly expect such informants always to stay on the proper side of the line which separates those two cases. And since the Government chooses to utilize such agents, with the attendant risk of entrapment, it is fair to require the Government which uses this inherently dangerous procedure to take appropriate precautions to insure that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>innocent man should be punished. [Footnote omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">These motivations have their origins in the considerations which impel a man who is essentially \u201canti-social, or at best anti-police<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to give the authorities his cooperation. Such have been described by agents experienced in this field, as, among others,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\"><em>The fear motive. </em>* * * [W]e might expect an emotional reaction favorable to our investigative objective, if we have a prospective informer who is afraid of something. This could be fear of any one of many things, or several of them. Our informer might be in fear of the law. This, again, might represent one of many possible conditions. Let us say that he is under arrest, possibly under indictment and facing charges. It is one of the practical facts of law enforcement that under such conditions the accused, looking for sympathy, extenuation, mitigation, or whatever he thinks might improve his lot, is often disposed to give a full account or at least some account of his crimes or those committed by others within his knowledge. He thereby may furnish us with direct evidence against other criminals or show us how such evidence might be obtained. Where such disclosures involve higher-ups or implicate numerous other defendants, this sort of development is very much to the advantage of law enforcement and organized society. It is almost the universal practice of the police, prosecutors and courts to recognize the valuable assistance to law enforcement in this attitude of the informer. This recognition is usually translated in a practical manner as a recommendation for a lesser sentence, a more favorable consideration for parole or probation, the acceptance of a plea to a lesser account in the indictment or through some other favorable action within the discretion of the prosecution.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">That such motivations tend to probity and credibility rather than \u201cto produce as many accuseds as possible\u201d is a highly debatable conclusion. Particularly is this true in view of the circumstances, again relying upon Harney and Cross, as well as our own judicial experience, that \u201cMany of them [informers] are unsavory characters. Some might even be termed despicable * * *.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Judge Waterman, concurring in part and dissenting in part in <em>United States v. Cimino, </em>321 F.2d 509, 514 (2nd Cir. 1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 967, 84 S.Ct. 486, 11 L.Ed.2d 416 (1964), recognized this problem in a perceptive comment to the effect that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-12\">Seldom can government informers be expected to be pillars of stability in their communities. If the common understanding is to be credited they are often narcotic addicts or petty criminals whose cooperation with law enforcement officials is not entirely voluntary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">If, then, as we so often hear in argument, and as is argued in this case, \u201cunsavory characters\u201d are hired because of sheer necessity, the corollary is clear: that as the <em>mala tides </em>of the government\u2019s agent increase, the care with which he is used, his surveillance by responsible personnel, and his corroboration, become increasingly necessary, lest he pay his way with the coin of conviction by whatever means obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">The offer here made was thus to show that the informant before the court and jury was completely insensitive to the obligations of his oath and that from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>motivations the origin of which we can only surmise, but nevertheless apparently existent, he had, as demonstrated in a parallel case, neither compunction nor scruple against \u201cframing\u201d a man. We have difficulty in envisioning a situation responding more completely to the orthodox test of bias, the quality of emotional partiality.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The only ease we have found on reasonably parallel facts, involving alleged false testimony by an undercover agent is the case of <em>Hutchings </em>v. <em>State, </em>518 P.2d 767 (Alaska 1974). In this case undercover agent Clements testified that he was introduced to defendant Hutch-ings by another undercover agent, Hof-hines, and that Hutchings sold him, Clements, the drug. Hofhines, however, at the trial, denied that Hutchings was the man she introduced to Clements. The defendant then sought to show upon cross-examination that Clements was a discharged policeman who was motivated by a desire to be reinstated to the force and was seeking to demonstrate both his effectiveness and his help to the prosecution. Objection as to immateriality was sustained. The Supreme Court of Alaska reversed on the ground that undue restriction of investigation of bias was an abuse of discretion which required retrial. The court held that Clements\u2019 hope for reinstatement to the police force could serve as a powerful motive to shade his testimony, either unconsciously or intentionally. The court went on:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">There are no special rules of \u201cproper impeachment\u201d for bias. The credibility of witnesses is .always a material issue, so the only question of materiality or relevance when evidence is offered to impeach for bias is whether the evidence tends in reason to demonstrate the existence of some fact, state of mind or condition that a reasonable person would take into account in assessing the credibility of the witness under attack. As we pointed out above, the balance must be weighed in favor of admissibility where impeachment for bias is the object.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">518 P.2d at 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">A recent examination by the United States Supreme Court of the permissible showing of bias is found in <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974), a case involving the possible bias of a prosecuting witness deriving from his probationary status as a juvenile delinquent. The Court held that the jury may be afforded \u201ca basis to infer that the witness\u2019 character is such that he would be less likely than the average trustworthy citizen to be truthful in his testimony\u201d and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">A more particular attack on the witness\u2019 credibility is effected by means of cross-examination directed toward revealing possible biases, prejudices, or ulterior motives of the witness as they may relate directly to issues or personalities in the case at hand. The partiality of a witness is subject to exploration at trial, and is \u201calways relevant as discrediting the witness and affecting the weight of his testimony.\u201d 3A J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 940, p. 775 (Chadbourn rev. 1970). We have recognized that the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination [citation omitted].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS0\">415 U.S. at 316-317, 94 S.Ct. at 1110.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">Of particular applicability to the matter before us, involving allegedly perjured testimony at a former trial, is the Court\u2019s observation to the effect that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avs-dedup-0\">\u201c[A] <em>partiality </em>of mind at some <em>former time </em>may be used as the basis of an argument to the same state at the time of testifying; though the ultimate object is to establish partiality at the time of testifying.\u201d 3A J. Wig-more, Evidence, \u00a7 940, p. 776 (Chadb-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>oum rev. 1970). (Emphasis in original; footnotes omitted.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">415 U.S. at 817 n. 5, 94 S.Ct. at 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">We recognize, of course, that the <em>Davis </em>case involved cross-examination whereas the question before us concerns impeachment of matters asserted upon cross. But so far as being \u201ccollateral,\u201d or provable by extrinsic testimony, is concerned, it is the universal holding of the authorities that as to bias the cross-examiner is not bound by the answer.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We are not disposed to forge a new rule upon these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-13\">The exclusion of the testimony proffered as to the attempt by the informant-witness, the only witness to the alleged crime, to frame another defendant in a precisely parallel case went beyond a mere error<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> in the introduction of evidence. What is actually asserted is governmental conduct which, if true, is both inexplicable,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and violative of due process.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>The essential point is that the jury must be given an opportunity to assess the Michigan incident in whatever manner it wishes. It may, indeed, hurt the defendant, if the jury believes that the informant would be more, rather than less, careful and truthful after being compromised in Michigan. But more importantly, the truth shall never be known if one of the two knowledgeable parties to the alleged sale is immune from reasonable scrutiny of his possible relationship with the government. A jury could reasonably find <em>inter alia </em>several different forms of bias existent in this case, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">a. The Michigan prosecutor would never rely on Nabors again. He needed work, which means he needed to produce for his new government employer, which may have tempted him to engage in a quick frame to demonstrate his utility.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">b. In view of his Michigan experience, Nabors may have feared not only that he would no longer be used by any government as an informant, but also that he might be subject to extensive surveillance. To avoid this, he might do <em>anything </em>to remain in the good graces of some state government (a source of protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">c. Any informant who would set-up a totally innocent man for conviction of a criminal offense may be so prejudiced against anyone <em>suspected </em>of narcotics dealings that a frame would never seem unjustified to such an informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-13\">d. Since Nabors indicated that he used the same <em>modus operandi </em>in Michigan as in Iowa, it may be that he has the same financial interest in a frame in Iowa as in Michigan. In other words, in Michigan he tried to divert the funds provided him for the purchase of narcotics to his girlfriend. To do this, he apparently used a frame to cover the diversion. He might have done the same thing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-16\">e. A witness who deliberately lies about commission of criminal acts against the government that pays him must assume that lies are an acceptable means to reach the ends for which he is paid, i. <em>e., </em>convictions, and that he may believe that getting caught in a lie, not lying, was his mistake. The next time he may be harder to catch.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-17\">It must be recognized that bias, like almost every other human emotional or mental condition or attitude, is rarely provable beyond all doubt. In <em>Davis v. Alaska, supra, </em>the Supreme Court did not say the witness was biased; it said he might be. This is also the case with <em>Hutchings v. State, supra. </em>But it is equally true that it is generally impossible to be certain whether a witness is 1) truthful, and 2) if truthful, accurate. To assess truthfulness and accuracy, it is necessary at times to sift a witness\u2019 testimony by means of certain legal devices, such as impeachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-18\">In holding that in a case like this where a government prosecutor confesses in open court that the key prosecution witness has deliberately lied, where this same witness uses an identical <em>modus op-erandi </em>to become the key government witness in another case, where the informant is a career informant dependent on a continuing relationship with the government, where several different forms of bias may exist and may exist simultaneously, the State has an obligation to permit an inquiry into the initial deliberate lie, we do not fear that we strike even a modest blow against reasonable state rules of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-19\">We stress a caveat: We do not, of course, purport to pass upon the truth or falsity of those matters set forth in the offer of proof. But they are not \u201cimmaterial,\u201d they are not \u201ccollateral,\u201d and the defendant is entitled to put them before the jury. If true, the circumstances of the presentation of this witness to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>court and jury will, we are satisfied, receive searching inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The judgment of conviction is vacated. The case is reversed and remanded to the district court with directions to issue the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>discharging petitioner, subject to the right of the State, if it wishes to do so, to try him on the indictment here involved within 90 days of the time the mandate of this court reaches the district court.

THE COURT: All right. But I guess then the record has been made that you wanted to make. And you would consider this as foundation for your right to call Mr. Zeckzer. And I think the import of all of this is that Mr. Zeckzer lives in Michigan; that the Court has indicated that he would not permit Mr. Zeckzer to testify because of the ruling he\u2019s made. I think it would be appropriate at this time that you indicate that if you were permitted to call Mr. Zeckzer what his testimony would be, in order that you have completed an offer of proof regarding that.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">* * * # sH *</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">MR. FRERICHS: Your Honor, at this time I would recite to the Court a statement made by the Muskegon County Attorney for the District Court, Southern Division, his recitation of the facts in connection with Mr. Durda and what Mr. Zeckzer could testify to as by way of an offer of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">THE COURT: Well, but what you\u2019re really saying is that if Mr. Zeckzer were called as a witness in this case, you believe his testimony would be substantially as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">MR. FRERICHS: Substantially as set out by the prosecution attorney there.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">THE COURT: All right.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">MR. FRERICHS: Okay. We have the case of Matt Durda. The case has not come to the preliminary examination stage. It is scheduled to be June 22. In this case \u2014 I will read from it \u2014 \u201cIn this case the police \u2014 \u201d page 5 of my statement \u2014 \u201cthe police claim they had searched Mr. Nabors for a controlled buy, drove him out to Durda\u2019s Auto Parts to make a buy from Matt Durda, Jr. Durda\u2019s Auto Parts establishment\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">THE COURT: Well, now, just a moment, I think the only thing you really ought to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">MR. FRERICHS: Mr. Zeckzer will testify to all this along with the police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">THE COURT: How can he? That isn\u2019t what Mr. Zeckzer knows anything about.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">MR. FRERICHS: Well, Your Honor, I would say that I would call the police officers additionally and they would set forth their testimony as set out here.</p>\n<p id=\"atq-dedup-0\">THE COURT: You may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"afk-dedup-1\">MR. FRERICHS: \u201cDurda\u2019s Auto Parts establishment, like any junk dealer type of place, affords him opportunity to hide narcotics. The police report indicated that they saw Matt Durda come out the front door, go around the building with Mr. Nabors, and that Mr. Nabors came back with one tinfoil of narcotics and no money. Since the issuance of the warrant and the arrest of Matt Durda we have checked with the policeman and he admits that the man he saw come out was not Matt Durda. I believe Matt Durda is here. Furthermore, the report indicated that two other officers were inside the premises keeping a surveillance. While inside the premises the two officers say they saw Mr. Nabors come up and talk to a party inside the place who they thought was Matt Durda. Since the arrest of Mr. Durda, they have seen Mr. Durda. They admit that this was not Mr. Durda. That is, the two officers at the place. After the arrest of Mr. Durda, Mr. Durda was arrested, he was taken to the county jail and he was confronted with Mr. Nabors. And Mr. Nabors identified him as the man he purchased from. But the police did find out \u2014 now, there were two officers who were in the place, and they identified the man they saw Mr. Nabors talk to inside the place as being a person named Darrel Zeckzer, whom in this surveillance it is confirmed that Mr. Zeckzer and Mr. Na-bors were running around together. Mr. Darrel Zeckzer has since been questioned. He admits he was inside the premises at that time. Mr. Nabors did come up to him and talk to him and ask for a cigarette. The police officers did see Mr. Nabors come up to Mr. Zeckzer and ask for a cigarette and he got a cigarette. But what Mr. Zeckzer states is that Mr. Nabors asked him how much should he pay for the portion of narcotics. Mr. Nabors said he was going to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>a hundred and ten dollars, which was the sum of money given to him to make the purchase by the police. Mr. Zeckzer further goes on to say that Mr. Nabors gave him one hundred and ten dollars and told him to go back to where Mr. Nabors lived and give the money to his girl friend. We know that Mr. Nabors, while he was here, had a girl friend. Mr. Zeckzer is prepared to testify to this. And he appears to be reliable. His reliability is vouched for, and I should not mention this here, as I asked the press not to say, because he admits having used heroin.\u201d Further, the testimony, I mean the statement by the prosecuting attorney indicates that Mr. Zeckzer states that they went to Detroit with Mr. Nabors and while there Mr. Nabors purchased narcotics. And we would submit, Your Honor, if Mr. Zeckzer were called from the State of Michigan, and the three police officers who were doing their surveillance at this particular time, they would substantially set forth the facts as recited to by the Muskegon County Prosecutor in his statement to the Court on June 1, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"ACVC\">THE COURT: Would you get the jury back, please.</p>\n<p id=\"aqb-dedup-0\">MR. FRERICHS: That I assume is accepted as an offer of proof, Your Honor?</p>\n<p id=\"A3S\">THE COURT: If that\u2019s the way it was made, that\u2019s the way the record so shows.</p>\n<p id=\"A9i\">MR. FRERICHS: Okay. Well, without the necessity of calling these witnesses down?</p>\n<p id=\"abq-dedup-0\">THE COURT: Yes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b627-19\">.

I share the majority concern about the low type of persons used by the government as informers. However, the use of this type of witness has been repeatedly sanctioned. The credibility of any witness is to be determined by the jury, not by this court. Although the government\u2019s evidence in this case is not strong, it is sufficient if believed to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The critical issue on this appeal is whether the refusal of the state trial court to permit petitioner to offer the extrinsic evidence pointed out in the majority opinion relating to the witness-informer Nabors\u2019 conduct violates any constitutional right of the defendant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-8\">[FJederal courts possess only limited authority to consider state court evi-dentiary rulings in a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding by a state prisoner. <em>Cunha v. Brewer, </em>511 F.2d 894, 898 (8th Cir. 1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-9\"><em>See Cage v. Auger, </em>514 F.2d 1231, 1232 (8th Cir. 1975); <em>Donnelly v. DeChristofo-ro, </em>416 U.S. 637, 642-643, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974). The scope of our inquiry is limited to an examination of whether federally guaranteed constitutional rights have been withheld. \u201cThe wisdom of evidentiary rulings will not be reviewed in <em>habeas corpus </em>unless they rise to [a] due process standard.\u201d <em>Cage v. Auger, supra </em>at 1232.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">The Iowa Supreme Court affirmed Johnson\u2019s conviction. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>219 N.W.2d 690 (Iowa 1974). In so doing the court held that under the circumstances of this case Iowa law precluded the admission of extrinsic evidence of misconduct to impeach a witness and specifically found no constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">Chief Judge McManus, before whom this <em>habeas corpus </em>case was tried, in a well-reasoned unreported opinion, likewise held no constitutional error was established and dismissed the petition. Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b), effective July 1, 1975, provides in pertinent part: \u201cSpecific instances of the conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting his credibility, other than conviction of crime as provided in Rule 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence.\u201d The foregoing rule re-states the pre-existing law. <em>See United States v. Burch, </em>490 F.2d 1300, 1302 (8th Cir. 1974); <em>United States v. Whiting, </em>311 F.2d 191, 196 (4th Cir. 1962); <em>United States v. Masino, </em>275 F.2d 129, 133 (2d Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-13\">The majority states <em>Hutchings v. State, </em>518 P.2d 767 (Alaska 1974), is the only case found containing reasonably parallel facts and cites it as supporting a reversal. <em>Hutchings </em>is clearly distinguishable from the case before us. In that case the reversal was based on the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit cross-examination of a witness on the bias issue. <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974), bases a reversal on unduly restricted cross-examination of a witness which was held to violate the right to confrontation. Neither of the two cases just cited deal with the right to offer extrinsic evidence to impeach a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-14\">As stated by Chief Judge McManus in his opinion, petitioner was given a wide latitude in cross-examining Nabors. No error or abuse of discretion was committed with respect to the scope of Nabors\u2019 cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-15\">For the reasons stated in the opinion of the Iowa Supreme Court and in Chief Judge McManus\u2019 memorandum, I would hold that the petitioner has failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>demonstrate any violation of a constitutional right and would affirm the dismissal of the <em>habeas corpus </em>petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
