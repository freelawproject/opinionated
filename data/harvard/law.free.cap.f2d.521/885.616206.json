SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b956-11\">We are required by this case to review once again the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s \u201cright to control\u201d test for determining whether a union has engaged in secondary activity proscribed by Section 8(b)(4)(B) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(4)(B) (1970).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board found that the petitioner union, Enterprise Association, had violated Section 8(b)(4)(B) by directing member steamfitters to refuse to comply with their employer\u2019s instruction to install prefabricated climate control units. Although the Board specifically determined that the refusal \u201cwas for the purpose of preserving work [the steamfitters] had traditionally performed,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Board nevertheless held it to be secondary activity because the steamfitters\u2019 employer did not have the legal right to control assignment of the work which the union was attempting to preserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-20\">We have held in two previous decisions, <em>Local 742, Carpenters v. NLRB, </em>144 U.S.App.D.C. 20, 444 F.2d 895, <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 986, 92 S.Ct. 447, 30 L.Ed.2d 371 (1971), and <em>Local 636, Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters v. NLRB, </em>139 U.S.App.D.C. 165, 430 F.2d 906 (1970), that the right to control test misconstrues Section 8(b)(4)(B) as interpreted by the Supreme Court in <em>National Woodwork Manufacturers Assn. v. NLRB, </em>386 U.S. 612, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 18 L.Ed.2d 357 (1967). Despite the fact that at least four of our sister circuits have similarly rejected the Board\u2019s position,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Board has nevertheless stead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>fastly persisted in applying its test. The Board\u2019s recent attempt to provide an acceptable rationale for its approach and to explain how the disputed test is consistent with the analysis of <em>National Woodwork, supra, </em>has now been approved by the Fourth Circuit in <em>George Koch Sons, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>490 F.2d 323 (1973). We have reconsidered the right to control test in light of the Board\u2019s rationalization in <em>Koch</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but we continue to adhere to our previous holdings that the test impermissibly expands the congressionally intended scope of Section 8(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">Petitioner Enterprise Association, a plumbing and pipefitting union, has for many years negotiated a collective bargaining agreement with Hudik-Ross Company, a firm engaged in the business of heating, ventilating, and air conditioning contracting. The agreement which was. effective during the period of the union\u2019s allegedly secondary activity contained a provision, Rule IX, which obligated Hudik-Ross to have its employees \u201ccut and thread internal piping in climate control units\u201d which Hudik-Ross contracted to install.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This cutting and threading was work traditionally performed by employees in the bargaining unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">The Austin Company is the general contractor and engineer for construction of the Norwegian Home for the Aged in Brooklyn, New York. In January 1972, as a result of competitive bidding, Hu-dik-Ross was awarded a subcontract to provide the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning work for the Norwegian Home construction. This subcontract incorporated Austin\u2019s specifications that certain heating and air conditioning units manufactured by Slant/Fin Corporation would be installed in the Norwegian Home. The specifications clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>indicated that the internal piping for these units was to be cut, threaded, and installed at the Slant/Fin factory, and the Board accepted the trial examiner\u2019s finding that \u201cHudik was aware of the specifications prior to making its bid and at the time it executed the subcontract\u201d with Austin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is not disputed that this cutting, threading, and installation was the type of work which, under Rule IX of its collective bargaining agreement with the union, Hudik-Ross was obligated to have performed on the jobsite by its employees. However, there is no indication in the record, and the Board made no finding, that Hudik-Ross ever attempted to extricate itself from the pinch of two inconsistent contractual commitments by initiating bargaining with the union concerning a possible relaxation of Rule IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Shortly after the Slant/Fin units arrived at the Norwegian Home jobsite, a business agent for the union informed Hudik-Ross that the steamfitters represented by the union would not install the units because their internal piping had been completed at the factory in violation of Rule IX. The refusal to install the Slant/Fin units having delayed completion of the Norwegian Home, Austin filed a complaint with the Board charging that the union was violating Section 8(b)(4)(B) by encouraging individuals employed by Hudik-Ross to refuse to perform certain services with an object of forcing or requiring Austin and Hudik-Ross to cease using the products of Slant/Fin. Both the administrative law judge (ALJ) and the Board sustained Austin\u2019s charge, despite the fact that there was no evidence indicating that the union or its affiliates had ever attempted to organize Slant/Fin or that the union was even aware of the organizational status or working conditions of the Slant/Fin employees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, the Board concluded that the union\u2019s refusal to let Hudik-Ross employees install the units \u201cwas for the purpose of preserving work they had traditionally performed.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, applying its right to control doctrine,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the Board found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>that the union\u2019s actions constituted impermissible secondary pressure against Hudik-Ross because Hudik-Ross, not having the legal power to determine who would perform the internal piping for heating and cooling units in the Norwegian Home, was a neutral in that dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Our two earlier opinions rejecting the Board\u2019s right to control test were guided by the teaching of the Supreme Court in <em>National Woodwork, supra. </em>Affirming the Board, the <em>National Woodwork </em>Court held that a work preservation clause in a collective bargaining agreement does not violate Section 8(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(e) (1970),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and that a carpentry union\u2019s refusal to install prefabricated doors pursuant to such a clause is primary activity that does not violate Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>tion 8(b)(4)(B) when the union\u2019s sole objective is preservation of work which its member employees had traditionally performed. The Court traced the evolution of Sections 8(b)(4)(B) and 8(e) and determined that the sweeping language of these sections had to be qualified by the congressional intent, now expressed in the proviso to Section 8(b)(4)(B), to permit coercive union activity which had traditionally been considered primary rather than secondary.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Recognizing that the critical distinction between secondary and primary activity would often be a subtle and difficult one to make, the Court concluded that the determination whether the carpentry union\u2019s refusal to install the premachined doors was protected primary activity would turn on an \u201cinquiry into whether, under <em>all the surrounding circumstances, </em>the Union\u2019s objective was preservation of work for [the struck employer\u2019s] employees, or whether the agreements and boycott were tactically calculated to satisfy union objectives elsewhere. * * * <em>The touchstone is whether the agreement or its maintenance is addressed to the labor relations of the contracting [struck] employer vis-a-vis his own </em>employees.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Supreme Court found that the Board had appropriately applied this test for distinguishing primary from secondary activity since the Board had ascertained on the basis of substantial evidence that the carpentry union\u2019s refusal to install the prefabricated doors \u201crelated solely to the preservation of the traditional tasks of the jobsite carpenters.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">As we recognized in <em>Local 742, supra, </em>and <em>Local 636, supra, </em>the <em>National Woodwork </em>Court explicitly noted that it was not presented with the question of the propriety of the Board\u2019s right to control doctrine since the struck employer in that case was a general contractor who had the legal power to determine who performed the work the union desired to preserve.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We nevertheless held, as have all but one of our sister circuits that have faced the issue,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that the rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>soning underlying the <em>National Woodwork </em>decision compels the conclusion that an employer\u2019s lack of legal control over the work the union seeks to preserve for its members cannot alone be decisive of the legality of the union\u2019s objectives.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Indeed, we remain convinced that, absent other evidence that a work preservation strike is actually intended to satisfy illegal secondary objectives, such a strike is lawful primary activity, protected under Sections 7 and 13 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157, 163 (1970),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> as well as under the proviso to Section 8(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">In validating work preservation clauses, the <em>National Woodwork </em>Court placed primary reliance on the legislative history of Sections 8(b)(4)(B) and 8(e). The Court determined that Congress only intended these sections to prohibit coercive union activity that is directly exerted against an \u201cunconcerned\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or \u201cneutral\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> employer, drawn by the union\u2019s activities into \u201cdisputes not his own.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Section 8(b)(4)(B) was seen as an accommodation between the \u201cdual congressional objectives of preserving the right of labor organizations to bring pressure to bear on offending employers in primary labor disputes and of shielding unoffending employers and others from pressures in controversies not their own.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Board acknowledges that the neutrality of the employer against whom pressure is directly exerted is critical to the distinction between primary and secondary activity.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It nevertheless comes to the remarkable conclusion that an employer like Hudik-Ross, which is struck by its own employees for the purpose of enforcement of a clause in its collective bargaining agreement with these employees which preserves work which the employees have traditionally performed, is the type of innocent neutral which the Supreme Court says Section 8(b)(4)(B) was fashioned to protect. We cannot agree with the Board\u2019s portrayal.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-16\">To assert that Hudik-Ross is a neutral bystander innocently caught up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>in the union\u2019s attempts to achieve its objectives by changing Austin\u2019s policy of purchasing prefabricated climate control units is to ignore the realities of this labor conflict and the process by which Hudik-Ross was confronted with conflicting contractual commitments. The Hudik-Ross management did not innocently awake one day to find itself in the midst of this dispute. The management had negotiated, presumably in good faith, a collective bargaining agreement which obligated Hudik-Ross to preserve for its employees the work of cutting and threading internal piping on the climate control units which these employees were to install. When the management subsequently executed a contract with Austin which it was fully aware would require its employees to install units on which these employees had not done the internal piping, it could hardly have expected the employees to acquiesce in the blatant violation of their contractual rights.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As we emphasized in <em>Local 742, supra, </em>\u201cThe legal effect of the Board\u2019s test is to allow an employer to bind his own hands and thereby immunize himself from union pressure occasioned by his employees\u2019 loss of work. In one act, the employer helps to create a labor conflict and simultaneously wash his hands of it.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Hudik-Ross could have totally avoided the labor dispute merely by honoring its bargaining agreement and not bidding on a contract which required it to breach the valid work preservation provision it had negotiated with the union.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, to accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>the Board\u2019s characterization of Hudik-Ross as a neutral bystander under these circumstances would allow the \u201cCinderella-like transformation of an obviously in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>volved party,\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and would both render nugatory the commitment which Hudik-Ross made<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and demean the collective bargaining process which is the cornerstone of labor relations in the United States.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Board insists on closing its eyes to the circumstances surrounding the creation of this labor dispute, circumstances which belie the assertion that Hudik-Ross is a neutral caught between the contending forces really involved in the work preservation controversy.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>stead, it reasons that, since \u201c[the subcontractor] had no past, present, or future authority to award this work to the Respondents, their actions here must have been undertaken to produce their effect elsewhere,\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and thus must violate Section 8(b)(4)(B).<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> From the premise that it is \u201creasonable to hold that the object of the union was not an impossible act but was the alternative possible,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the Board reaches what it considers to be an ineluctable conclusion that \u201cwhere the pressured employer cannot himself accede to the union\u2019s wishes, the pressure is secondary because it is undertaken for its effect elsewhere.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> But rhetoric and rationalization are no substitute for substantial evidence. Even ignoring Hu-dik-Ross\u2019 actions in initially bidding on the subcontract, the fallacy of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>Board\u2019s conclusion is readily apparent. For even if one focuses narrowly on the point in time when Hudik-Ross had already executed its second contract, one can clearly see that it was possible for Hudik-Ross to settle the labor dispute which it had created. The record is void of any suggestion that Hudik-Ross attempted to negotiate a compromise with the union under which the union would have agreed to install the climate control units in exchange for extra pay or other special benefits.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> If the Board\u2019s finding that the union\u2019s purpose in refusing to install the units was work preservation was correct, it can be assumed that the union would have accepted a payment from Hudik-Ross to the employees to compensate them at least in part for the employer\u2019s breach of the bargaining agreement. Unions presumably seek agreements to preserve for their members the work which they have traditionally performed in order to maintain the income level of the members. Evidence that the union was unwilling to permit its members to install the prefabricated units even if they were paid for the work they lost by the prefabrication would call into question the Board\u2019s finding that the union\u2019s objective was merely work preservation; it would suggest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>that the union desired to boycott Slant/Fin\u2019s goods for some other reason, such as that firm\u2019s labor relations policies. However, such evidence was not adduced and, given the Board\u2019s finding that the union\u2019s purpose was work preservation, we cannot speculate as to its existence.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Of course, Hudik-Ross might prefer to terminate its subcontract with Austin or pressure Austin to change its specifications for premachined climate control units rather than to negotiate with its employees as to alternatives for compensating them for their lost work. However, the fact that such a decision might have adverse effects on other employers like Austin and Slant/Fin does not transform an involved employer like Hudik-Ross against whom pressure is exerted into an innocent neutral.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> For as the <em>National Woodwork </em>Court teaches, in enacting the proviso to Section 8(b)(4)(B) Congress made it clear that even a strike which would inevitably have an adverse impact on a secondary employer, like the National Woodwork Association member in that ease who had contracted to sell prefabricated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>doors, is not proscribed by Section 8(b)(4)(B) if the employer struck is not an innocent neutral to the union\u2019s dispute.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\">The Board\u2019s right to control doctrine is a continuing attempt to circumvent the congressional proviso and is inconsistent with the Court\u2019s analysis in <em>National Woodwork. </em>Moreover, it is a continuing inducement for employers to violate their bargaining agreements. If employers do not want work preservation clauses to cover prefabricated units, they should not sign bargaining agreements with such clauses unless they so state. And when an employer gets himself into a bind, as did Hudik-Ross, he should arbitrate or negotiate his way out. Having the Board bail him out is to demean the National Labor Relations Act by encouraging deliberate, if not always planned, violations of bargaining agreements.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b970-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">In its brief to this court, the Board vigorously asserts that <em>NLRB v. Denver Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council, </em>341 U.S. 675, 71 S.Ct. 943, 95 L.Ed. 1234 (1951), mandates a different conclusion than the one we have reached. We find that this reliance on <em>Denver </em>is misplaced. The <em>Denver </em>Court sustained a Board finding that a construction union had violated Section 8(b)(4)(B) by striking against a general contractor in order to force him to terminate his contract with a subcontractor who employed nonunion labor \u2014 a classic secondary boycott. In the course of its opinion the <em>Denver </em>Court in dicta made several statements which the Board in its brief now maintains establish principles upon which the right to control test can be based:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-5\">If there had been no contract between Doose &amp; Lintner [the general contractor] and Gould &amp; Preisner [the nonunion subcontractor] there might be substance in [the union employees\u2019] contention that the dispute involved no boycott. If, for example, Doose &amp; Lintner had been doing all the electrical work on this project through its own nonunion employees, it could have replaced them with union men and thus disposed of the dispute. However, the existence of the Gould &amp; Preisner subcontract presented a materially different situation. The nonunion employees were employees of Gould &amp; Preisner. The only way that respondents [the union employees] could attain their purpose was to force Gould &amp; Preisner itself off the job. This, in turn, could be done only through Doose &amp; Lintner\u2019s termination of Gould &amp; Preisner\u2019s subcontract. The result is that the Council\u2019s strike, in order to attain its ultimate purpose [full unionization of the construction site], must have included among its objects that of forcing Doose &amp; Lintner to terminate that subcontract. * * * It is not necessary to find that the <em>sole </em>object of the strike was that of forcing the contractor to terminate the subcontractor\u2019s contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">341 U.S. at 688-89, 71 S.Ct. at 951, <em>quoted in </em>brief for the NLRB at 8 \u2014 9 (emphasis in original). Although this language obviously does not constitute a holding endorsing the Board\u2019s right to control doctrine since the general contractor in <em>Denver </em>had full legal power to assign the work which the union did not want nonunion employees to perform, the Board argues that this language should be applied in the instant case. The union\u2019s ultimate objective of work preservation, the argument runs, could only be attained by keeping Slant/Fin from completing the internal piping; this, in turn, could be done only through Austin\u2019s termination of its contract with Slant/Fin; the union\u2019s refusal to install the units must therefore have included among its objects that of forcing Austin to terminate the Slant/Fin contract; and such an objective would, given the dicta from the <em>Denver </em>opinion, render the refusal to install the units an illegal secondary boycott under Section 8(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">As we have already indicated, we do not agree that termination of the Slant/Fin contract was a necessary intermediate step to satisfaction of the union\u2019s ultimate objective; Hudik-Ross could have resolved the dispute without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>affecting the contractual relationships of either Austin or Slant/Fin. But even accepting the factual premises of the Board\u2019s analysis, the quoted <em>Denver </em>language does not support the Board\u2019s right to control test. For a literal application of that language would have outlawed even the union activity in <em>National Woodwork, </em>where the struck employer was a general contractor with full legal control over assignment of the work in dispute. In <em>National Woodwork </em>the carpentry union\u2019s objective of work preservation was only obtained by the general contractor\u2019s termination of his contract to purchase prefabricated doors from one of the Woodwork Association\u2019s members. But the <em>National Woodwork </em>Court, in upholding the union\u2019s actions, clearly did not consider this to be a proscribed secondary objective; indeed, that Court did not find it necessary to even consider the quoted <em>Denver </em>language.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">A closer examination of the <em>Denver </em>opinion reveals why that case was inap-posite to both <em>National Woodwork </em>and the present case. The Board\u2019s quotation of <em>Denver </em>is less than candid, and reveals the danger of reducing a complex analysis turning upon \u201call the surrounding circumstances\u201d into a simplistic <em>per se </em>doctrine. For the above paragraph from <em>Denver </em>was introduced by this observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b971-5\">In the background of the instant case there was a longstanding labor dispute between the Council and Gould &amp; Preisner due to the latter\u2019s practice of employing nonunion workmen on construction jobs in Denver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-12\">341 U.S. at 688, 71 S.Ct. at 951. The Court, looking to the whole factual context of the controversy, thus recognized that the union pressure was directed against the labor relations practices of the subcontractor, and that the strike against the general contractor was \u201ctactically calculated to satisfy union objectives elsewhere.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In <em>National Woodwork, </em>as in our case, there was no indication that the substance of the dispute was with a third party. Given <em>National Woodwork </em>and the 1959 proviso added to \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B), the mere fact that the primary employer, in order to settle the dispute between himself and his employees concerning his \u201clabor relations * * * <em>vis-\u00e1-vis </em>his own employees,\u201d <footnotemark>41</footnotemark> might be forced to terminate his contract with such a third party cannot alter this conclusion.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-13\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b971-14\">We do not think that an employer who is struck by his own employees for the purpose of requiring him to do what he has lawfully contracted to do to benefit those employees can ever be considered a neutral bystander in a dispute not his own.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> We recognize, of course, that a strike may have more than a single objective and may thus violate Section 8(b)(4)(B) if even one objective is a prohibited secondary one.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>we hold that in situations such as the present one, where there is a valid work preservation provision in a collective bargaining agreement and where a union refuses to acquiesce in an employer\u2019s violation of that agreement, it is reasonable to assume that the employer <em>can </em>comply in accordance with his prior commitment to his workers and that, absent more evidence than mere stoppage of work, the union\u2019s objectives are legitimate and the refusal to install the prefabricated materials is lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">We therefore conclude that in this case, as in <em>National Woodwork, </em>the union\u2019s refusal to install the prefabricated components must be deemed primary concerted activity not prohibited by Section 8(b)(4)(B) if it is determined, \u201cunder all the surrounding circumstances,\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> that the sole objective of the union was to preserve for employees of the struck employer work they traditionally performed. Since the Board here found that the union\u2019s purpose was to preserve work which Hudik-Ross\u2019 employees had traditionally performed, and there is no substantial evidence, as distinguished from the Board\u2019s rationalizations, in this record that the union\u2019s purpose was also \u201cto satisfy union objectives elsewhere,\u201d the Board\u2019s decision holding the union guilty of a Section 8(b)(4)(B) violation may not stand. However, in remanding in <em>Local 742, supra, </em>and <em>Local 686, supra, </em>we held that legal control in the struck employer over assignment of the work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>which a union professes a desire to preserve, while not alone dispositive, may be considered by the Board along with other factors suggested by the <em>National Woodwork </em>Court in determining the union\u2019s actual objective. In remanding here to give the Board an opportunity to reconsider its ruling in this case,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> we emphasize at the risk of repetition that the Board is not free to focus on Hudik-Ross\u2019 lack of control to the total exclusion of the circumstances which the <em>National Woodwork </em>Court stated might be relevant to the inquiry into the union\u2019s objective.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The Board may fashion its own formulations as to the relevance of certain facts to <em>National Woodwork\u2019s </em>test for distinguishing primary from secondary activity. But as we held in <em>Local 742, supra, </em>and <em>Local 6S6, supra, </em>the Board may not transform that test, directly or indirectly, into a vehicle for subverting the congressional purpose by focusing on only one among many potentially relevant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-4\">\n<em>Remanded for further proceedings.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-12\">.

NLRB, </em>514 F.2d 433 (decided March 28, 1975), <em>vacating </em>207 NLRB No. 58 (1973). Although professing that a subcontractor\u2019s right to control is merely an \u201cimportant factor\u201d in assessing \u201call the surrounding circumstances\u201d of a labor dispute, the <em>Associated General Contractors </em>court in effect asserted that a single, sufficient criterion for finding that a subcontractor is a \u201cneutral, unoffending employer\u201d is the fact that it \u201cdid not have and never had the power to accede to the union\u2019s demands.\u201d <em>Id., </em>514 F.2d at 437. <em>See also, e. g., id. </em>at 438 (\u201cA union\u2019s right to enforce a work preservation clause against an employer may extend only to work which is his to assign.

This is, in actuality, the <em>per se </em>right to control test. <em>See </em>note 9 <em>infra. </em>It is curious that in making these statements the Ninth Circuit panel acknowledged neither a contrary precedent in the Ninth Circuit, <em>see Western Monolithics, supra, </em>nor the analysis and holdings (or the existence) of contrary cases in four other circuits. Moreover, in basing its holding on the rationale that in such situations the union is seeking to acquire rather than to preserve work, the court manifested a misunderstanding of the nature of work preservation agreements. <em>See, e. g\u201e </em>172 U.S.App.D.C. pp.---, 521 F.2d pp. 898-900 &amp; notes 25, 34, &amp; 37 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b957-13\">. <em>See Local 438, Plumbers &amp; Pipe Fitters, </em>201 NLRB 59, <em>enforced sub nom.

Unlike its earlier right to control opinions, in its <em>Koch </em>opinion the Board does say it is applying the \u201call the surrounding circumstances\u201d test required by <em>National Woodwork </em>and all the Circuit Courts that have considered the question.

Since the right to control doctrine had been rejected by five circuits, the Board understandably did not mention that doctrine by name. Rather, after noting the union\u2019s work preservation purpose, the Board merely cited its <em>Koch </em>opinion and stated that \u201cHudik was incapable of assigning its employees this work; such work was never Hudik\u2019s to assign in the first place.\u201d <em>Id. See also </em>note 36 <em>infra. </em>In its brief to this court the Board admits that it is applying the right to control doctrine, but characterizes the test as merely creating a <em>\u201cprima facie\u201d </em>inference that there is an illegal secondary objective, \u201cabsent proof to the contrary.\u201d Brief for the NLRB at 5. We realize that under <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>318 U.S. 80, 93-95, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943), we review the Board\u2019s opinions and not its counsel\u2019s brief. However, since counsel\u2019s rationalization might be adopted by the Board in its next right to control case, we deem it useful, in the interest of bringing right to control litigation to an early conclusion, to comment on it. In short, we find that, given the virtual impossibility of proving the <em>lack </em>of the imputed secondary objective, this <em>\u201cprima facie\" </em>approach in effect constitutes the same old <em>per se </em>test which we have condemned in our prior opinions and which contravenes the rationale and spirit of <em>National Woodwork. See, </em>172 U.S.App.D.C. pp.---, 521 F.2d pp. 892-901, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-13\">Our conclusion that Hudik-Ross is far from being an innocent neutral bystander to the dispute over installation of the prefabricated units does not depend at all on any suspicion that Hudik-Ross instigated Austin\u2019s decision to use the Slant/Fin units. <em>Cf. Painters Dist. Council No. 20, </em>185 NLRB 930, 932 (1970). We fully accept the Board\u2019s factual finding that Hudik-Ross merely bid on a job for which Austin had already specified the Slant/Fin units. Rather, our conclusions are based on an analysis of <em>all the surrounding circumstances </em>of the conflict, <em>not just the circumstances relating to the locus of actual power to assign the work. </em>By contrast, once the Board finds that the employer lacked legal control, it finds a <em>per se </em>violation of \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B). <em>See generally Local 438, Plumbers &amp; Pipe Fitters, supra </em>note 4. As we stated in <em>Local 742, Carpenters v. NLRB, </em>144 U.S.App.D.C. 20, 24, 444 F.2d 895, 899 (1971):</p>\n<p id=\"b958-14\">The artificiality of the [Board\u2019s right to control] test is particularly patent in cases such as this one \u2014 where the employees apparently have a grievance growing out of labor relations with their own employer (i. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>Note 9 \u2014 Continued</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-5\"><em>e., </em>loss of traditional unit work) and immediately provoked by an action of their own employer (i. <em>e., </em>his signing of a contract which would deprive them of that work). The Board does not stop to consider these aspects of the dispute. Nor does it look to see whether there may be other grievances, against other employers, which underlie the union\u2019s action. Rather, the Board seems to hold that, when an employer contracts away his power to satisfy union demands, he also contracts away his interest and involvement in the labor relations issue in dispute. He is depicted as the mere passive agent of others * * * ; the fact that the present dispute has its origin and its substantive focus in his ongoing labor relations with his employees is deemed irrelevant. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">In attempting to rationalize and affirm the Board\u2019s holding, the dissenters present a smorgasbord of possible explanations of what the Board has done. <em>But see </em>dissenting op. at n.72. First, we are offered the <em>per se </em>right to control test in its purest form:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-8\">Hudik is essentially neutral in this dispute <em>because it does not have and never did have the power to comply with the Steamfitters\u2019 demands. </em>Thus the pressure created by the Hudik employees\u2019 boycott of the Slant/Fin units <em>must have been directed at Austin and Slant/Fin as they were the only parties with the power to satisfy </em>the demand that the work be taken from Slant/Fin employees and reassigned to the Union.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 172 U.S.App.D.C. -, 521 F.2d at 920 (emphasis added). <em>See also id. </em>at -, 521 F.2d at 921 (\u201cThe Union is seeking what it asserts is <em>work preservation, </em>but the means it has chosen toward that end \u2014 a strike against an employer who never had the disputed work to assign \u2014 constitutes secondary pressure.\u201d) (emphasis in original); <em>id. </em>172 U.S.App.D.C. at-, 521 F.2d at 926 (\u201cEven where right to control is not decisive, in almost any case it will be a factor entitled to very substantial weight because it measures the ability of the employer to comply with the union demands.\u201d); <em>id. </em>172 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 521 F.2d at 928 (\u201cboycotts by craft unions against subcontractors <em>necessarily </em>have as a primary object the <em>application of pressure to those third parties who actually require the use </em>of factory-prepared products\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>id. </em>at n.53 (\u201c[Ojnly Austin and Slant/Fin are capable of acceding to the Union\u2019s demands. Thus Hudik is neutral with respect to the particular remedy of economic action which the Union invoked to redress its grievances.\u201d); <em>id. </em>172 U-S.App.DX:. at-, 521 F.2d at 938 &amp; n.101. <em>But see id. </em>at n.44.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-17\">Next, we are told that the Board has applied a <em>prima facie </em>test because it will validate a work preservation action against a subcontractor who possessed the legal right to control the work assignment but contracted away that right:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-18\">The Board does not employ a <em>per se </em>formulation, which might well violate the stricture of <em>National Woodwork </em>that the focus of a union\u2019s action must be determined from all the surrounding circumstances; instead, the Board relies on a <em>prima facie </em>standard. By this test, a union may not boycott an employer who lacks the right to control the assignment of disputed work, <em>provided </em>that the employer has not voluntarily relinquished that control. The redeeming feature of this criterion is that it permits and even mandates the conclusion that the union acted properly in launching an economic action whenever \u201cthe employer\u2019s loss of power to assign the work is the result of his own efforts to instigate the subcontracting to another of work subject to his work preservation agreement with the union\u201d * * *. In such a case the employer would cease to be neutral, and would be termed \u201coffending\u201d by virtue of his voluntary action surrendering legal control of the disputed work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-19\">Dissenting op., 172 U.S.App.D.C. at---, 521 F.2d at 931 (footnotes omitted; emphasis in original). <em>See also id. </em>172 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 521 F.2d at 937 (\u201cthe <em>prima facie </em>right-to-control test rests on the Board\u2019s considered judgment that a subcontractor\u2019s <em>inability to affect or avoid prefabrication specif\u00edcations </em>in general contracts renders him an inappropriate and impermissible target of union economic activity\u201d) (emphasis added). This is the approach of the Board as elaborated in <em>Koch, </em>and which, as we have indicated above, is a <em>per se </em>test once the <em>actual locus of legal control </em>is isolated; the Board does not consider other circumstances to determine whether the employer without control over the work itself is nevertheless not a neutral in the labor dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-23\">Finally, the dissent asserts that the Board, in conformity with the <em>National Woodwork </em>decision, actually evaluated \u201call the surrounding circumstances\u201d to determine whether Hudik-Ross was a neutral; the Board, under this rationalization, did not simply label Hudik-Ross a neutral party once the Board concluded it did not have, and never had, the legal power to assign its employees the disputed work. <em>See, e. g., </em>dissenting op., 172 U.S.App.D.C. at---,---, -, 519 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>Note 9 \u2014 Continued</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">at 917-918, 925-926, 928-929, 941, &amp; nn.8, 74. The dissent premises this explanation on the fact that the ALJ, in another context, used the phrase \u201call the surrounding circumstances,\u201d and the fact that the Board affirmed his \u201crulings, findings, and conclusions\u201d to the extent they were consistent with its decision. <em>See, e. g., id. </em>172 U.S.App.D.C. at----, 521 F.2d at 925-926 &amp; n.8. Based on this slender reed, we are implored to discount the fact that the Board, in citing <em>Koch </em>as the basis for its decision, was following its right to control test as fully enunciated in that case. The dissent wisely omits the Board\u2019s citation of <em>Koch </em>and similar cases in its otherwise extensive quotation from the Board\u2019s decision, <em>see id. </em>at n.10, and'it is clear that both the ALJ and the Board simply categorized Hudik-Ross as a neutral <em>because </em>it lacked control over the assignment of the disputed work. Indeed, the ALJ concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-9\">While it is true that there are conflicting interpretations of the <em>National Woodwork </em>decision, <em>supra, </em>I believe that under the Board\u2019s view of the law the Respondent herein has violated section 8(b)(4)(i)(ii)(B) of the Act <em>since Hudik was a secondary employer that, </em>unlike Frouge in the <em>National Woodwork </em>case, <em>had no control over the selection and specification of the prepiped units. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">JA at 242 (emphasis added). Moreover, the cases cited and discussed by the ALJ, <em>see </em>JA at 237, 242 n.13, are all ones in which the Board determined that the locus of control over the work in dispute was conclusive as to the question of the legality of the union\u2019s activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">Nevertheless, it is true that the ALJ employed the phrase \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d in the hypotheticals quoted by the dissent, <em>see </em>dissenting op. at n.8, and the dissenters dwell at considerable length on the circumstance to which the ALJ referred. \u2014 -the extent to which the construction industry m major metropolitan areas is unionized. <em>See, e. g., id. </em>172 U.S.App.D.C. at---, 521 F.2d at 928-930. However, the ALJ simply referred to that factor as a circumstance which he believed made Hudik-Ross an <em>effective </em>instrumentality of pressure against Austin and Slant/Fin. <em>See id. </em>at n.8. Even the ALJ recognized that this factor (effectiveness or ineffectiveness of secondary pressure) is absolutely irrelevant to the question of whether Hudik-Ross was a <em>neutral </em>in the labor dispute and thus immune even from <em>threats </em>of secondary pressures under \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B). <em>See id. </em>(\u201cthe fact that in Example A * * * Hudik would be an ineffective means of pressure by the Union against Slant/Fin and Austin, and, in Example B, the instant case, Hudik is an effective means of pressure in view of all the surrounding circumstances, does not alter the fact that in both situations, Hudik is a means or instrumentality and that the Union\u2019s primary dispute is with Slant/Fin and Austin\u201d). <em>But see </em>dissenting op. at n.55. Thus the ALJ\u2019s use of that phrase (as part of an argument that Hudik could not comply with the union\u2019s demands) in no way discredits our conviction that both the ALJ and the Board are continuing to apply an impermissible <em>per se </em>right to control test. Moreover, as we elucidate more fully later in our opinion, both the ALJ and the Board are incorrect in the premises which underlie both the right to control test and the hypotheticals the dissent quotes; Hudik is not a neutral in this labor dispute, <em>see generally </em>pp. 172 U.S.App.D.C.---, 521 F.2d pp. 921-928, <em>infra, </em>and it may comply with the union\u2019s demands, even without ceasing doing business with Austin and Slant/Fin or attempting to force them to change their business practices, <em>see, e. g., </em>pp. 172 U.S.App.D.C. ---, 521 F.2d pp. 924-928, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b960-18\">.

However, the <em>National Woodwork </em>Court has already thoroughly canvassed this legislative history, <em>see generally </em>386 U.S. at 620 \u2014 44, 87 S.Ct. 1250, and has concluded that the refusal to install prefabricated products is proper if the pressure is exerted against an employer who is not a neutral in the dispute.

Indeed, the terms of the collective bargaining agreement itself provide internal indicia that Hudik-Ross is not a neutral to this dispute. Article One of that agreement specifies that both parties are to abide by certain rules governing wages, hours, \u201cand other conditions of employment.\u201d JA at 210. Rule IX is among those to which both sides agreed to be bound. JA at 213. Article Two of the agreement then stipulates that strikes or lockouts are to be prohibited, but only \u201cso long as this agreement <em>and the rules hereto attached </em>are conformed to by both parties.\u201d JA at 210 (emphasis added). Hudik-Ross must therefore have realized that it had contractually acknowledged the union\u2019s right to strike in the situation presented to us. Indeed, it is curious that Hudik-Ross, the \u201cneutral\u201d that was supposedly injured by being dragged into a \u201clabor dispute not its own,\u201d did not file the charge of an unfair labor practice; rather, it was filed by the general contractor, Austin. Perhaps Hu-dik-Ross perceived the injustice that would result if it attempted to have the Board directly rectify Hudik-Ross\u2019 breach of contract; perhaps it merely sought to avoid the exacerbation of labor relations that would result by adding this insult to the injury it had previously inflicted on the union. We appreciate the fact that a contractual provision cannot immunize either an employer or a union from an unfair labor practice charge. <em>See, e. g., Radio Officers\u2019 Union v. NLRB, </em>347 U.S. 17, 74 S.Ct. 323, 98 L.Ed. 455 (1954). However, we see no justification for converting this dispute over enforcement of a valid contractual provision, in which the union lawfully strikes in accordance with an explicit bargaining clause, into an unfair labor practice proceeding before the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b963-6\">. <em>Local 742, Carpenters v.

We do not believe that this restriction unduly ties an employer\u2019s hands concerning managerial decisions. Hudik-Ross could have, and still can, negotiate collective bargaining agreements which exempt from the work preservation clause work over which it does not have legal control. Indeed, on remand the Board is free to reconsider whether the parties to the agreement actually intended the cutting, threading, and installation of the internal piping of the climate control units to fall within its scope in the situation here presented. The dissent implies that the ALJ has already made a finding that the parties to the bargaining agreement did not so intend, and that the Board implicitly upheld this finding. <em>See, </em>e. <em>g., </em>dissenting op., 172 U.S.App.D.C. at ---, -, 521 F.2d at 927-928, 940, &amp; nn.71 &amp; 106. However, the dissent recognizes that the ALJ declined to rely on his \u201copinion\u201d that Rule IX \u201cnecessarily implied that it referred to pipe within Hudik\u2019s control,\u201d <em>see </em>JA at 237. Dissenting op. at n.7. In any event, the ALJ\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d appears to be premised on his views of the ultimate merits of the right to control doctrine rather than on any expertise in interpreting collective bargaining agreements, and would appear to be contradicted by the plain language of the agreement, which stipulates that \u201c[rjadiator branches, convector branches and coil connectors <em>shall be cut and threaded by hand on the job </em>* * * JA at 233 (emphasis added). The Board accepted the fact that the work stoppage was motivated by the desire to preserve traditional unit work, and we therefore do not believe it accepted any finding (to the extent one may have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Note 25 \u2014 Continued</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">made) that this work was not intended to be included within the ambit of Rule IX. See <em>also </em>text appended to dissenting op. Figure 1. In any event, custom and tradition in the industry must also be looked to in determining the intent of the parties with respect to what work is to be preserved, even in the absence of an explicit work preservation provision. <em>See Local 742, Carpenters v. NLRB, supra </em>note 9, 144 U.S.App.D.C. at 24, 444 F.2d at 899. Moreover, given the record now before us, when the Board on remand analyzes \u201cnot only the situation the pressured employer finds himself in but also how he came to be in that situation,\u201d in order to determine whether he is an \u201cunoffending party,\u201d <em>see Local 438, Plumbers &amp; Pipe Fitters, supra </em>note 4, 201 NLRB at 64, it must consider whether Hudik-Ross knowingly entered the second contract in contravention of the prior one.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">It is important to recognize that Hudik-Ross\u2019 refusal to bid on the Austin contract, in compliance with its collective bargaining agreement, would indeed serve work preservation goals. This point is often misunderstood. For example, the ALJ in this case asked rhetorically: \u201c[I]f Hudik, an employer of union steamfitters, does not bid on jobs and does not secure subcontracts, how does such a situation preserve or increase work for Hudik\u2019s union steamfitters[?]\u201d JA at 240. Yet he had unknowingly answered that question himself earlier in his opinion: \u201cIf prepaid [sic] units cannot be installed * * * Austin and other engineers and general contractors will not specify their purchase and use in buildings.\u201d JA at 239. The union certainly expected the work preservation clause to be complied with. Like the ALJ, it knew such clauses would in fact subserve its legitimate end of ensuring that its members could continue to perform in the future the work they had traditionally performed in the past. Of course, it is also true that Hudik-Ross and similar employers could bid on a subcontract specifying prefabricated products and still satisfy a union\u2019s work preservation goals, but in this latter situation they would probably be subserved by negotiation of a monetary settlement that would partially compensate the employees for their lost work. <em>See </em>172 U.S.App.D.C. pp.---, 521 F.2d pp. 898-900 &amp; note 34 <em>infra. </em>It should also be noted that the dissent, apparently oblivious to the fact that Hudik-Ross could take this latter tack, compounds its error by making the statement, which has no support in the record, that \u201cHudik could not decline to bid on projects with prefabrication specifications and continue to be a competitive subcontractor.\u201d Dissenting op., 172 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 521 F.2d at 928. If this were actually the case, one might wonder why Hudik-Ross contractually bound itself to such an allegedly self-destructive course.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-14\">Although the Board rejected the ALJ\u2019s misconception that Rule IX was not designed for work preservation purposes in these circumstances, a similar fallacious belief may lie at the root of its right to control doctrine. In its brief to the Supreme Court in <em>National Woodwork, </em>in supporting its claim that the union had not violated \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B), the Board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASq\">[T]his provision [in the bargaining agreement in <em>National </em>Woodwork] was a lawful work preservation clause, reflecting the Union\u2019s policy of preserving for jobsite carpenters work which they have performed for over 80 years. <em>Since Frouge had failed to abide by this lawful contract provision, the Union had a legitimate dispute with </em>him; and, since he was not required by any arrangement with the project owner to use pre-cut doors, Frouge was in a position to accede to the Union\u2019s demands without having contract relations severed or even directly affected. Accordingly, by refusing to handle pre-cut doors for Frouge, the Union confined its activity to the employer with whom it had its basic dispute, and its activity was therefore primary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-15\">Brief for the NLRB at 5-6 (emphasis added). If the Board is serious about its characterization of the union/Hudik-Ross provision as a valid work preservation clause, the logic of <em>National Woodwork </em>should mandate a conclusion that the union\u2019s activity in our case is lawful. In <em>both National Woodwork </em>and this case, there was a valid work preservation clause. In <em>both National Woodwork </em>and this case, the employer could comply with the union\u2019s demands <em>before </em>breaking the contract. And, contrary to the Board\u2019s assertion, in <em>both National Woodwork </em>and this case, <em>some </em>third party would inevitably be affected by compliance after the contract was broken. Admittedly, only a manufacturer was involved in <em>National Woodwork, </em>whereas this case involves both a manufacturer and a general contractor. But that cannot obscure the fact that for all relevant analytical purposes the situation of the two employers is identical. <em>See also </em>note 28 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b964-16\"><em>A </em>final misconception concerning work preservation agreements between subcontractors and unions is that exhibited by the dissent, <em>see, e. g., </em>dissenting op., 172 U.S.App.D.C. at---, -, 521 F.2d at 921-922, 928, and by the recent panel opinion in the Ninth Circuit, <em>see Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. NLRB, supra </em>note 3, 514 F.2d at 435. This misconception involves the belief that when a subcontractor\u2019s employees request that when a construction contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>Note 25 \u2014 Continued</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">specifies prefabricated products the subcontractor either not bid on the contract or else compensate them for their lost work, they are not seeking to <em>preserve </em>traditional work but are attempting to <em>acquire </em>additional work. However, by the very nature of subcontract bidding, a subcontractor will always be acquiring work when he bids on a project; the characterization of union activity as having a work preservation objective must therefore depend on whether it is the <em>type </em>of unit work which the employees have traditionally performed, not whether they actually performed the particular work in question. And as indicated above, enforcement of a work preservation clause is designed to protect such traditional work whether the subcontract specifications themselves required that the traditional work be replaced by prefabrication or whether the specifications granted to the subcontractor discretion to displace the employees\u2019 traditional work. In both situations the union seeks to prevent elimination of employees\u2019 work through factory prefabrication or, at a minimum, to prevent their employer from lending active support to elimination of that work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b965-7\">. <em>Local 742, Carpenters v.

We fail to comprehend the logic of this assertion. Certainly Phillips in that case and Hudik-Ross in our case were free to agree not to execute other contracts which would require them to force their employees to handle prefabricated goods. This is effectively what a work preservation clause requires in the present situation. Although we do not reach the substantial question whether employers could be forced to bargain over such clauses, we find that, having negotiated and agreed to such a clause, Hudik-Ross must abide by it; nothing in the Act or the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>National Woodwork </em>requires that an employer be allowed to escape such a freely-undertaken obligation merely by unilaterally executing subsequent contracts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b965-17\">. The Board\u2019s holding has the potential for unnecessarily harsh or excessively disruptive results. Although the ALJ found that Austin and Slant/Fin were the primary employers for purposes of the work preservation dispute with the union, the Board declined to decide whether the union could therefore have exerted direct pressure against them. <em>See </em>JA at 254 n.l. It is thus possible that the Board is prepared to accept the position advanced by <em>amicus curiae </em>Chamber of Commerce of the United States that, unless the target of the strike has <em>both </em>the power to control the work assigned and a bargaining relationship with the union, the union\u2019s economic pressures are illegal secondary activity. In the present case there would thus be no primary employer; indeed, in most subcontracting situations the subcontractor\u2019s employees would be deprived <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>of all economic weapons and all legal mechanisms for preserving their traditional work against onrushing technological changes. We do not find it necessary to rule on whether the union could have exerted pressure directly against Austin or Slant/Fin. However, we do note that interpreting \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) so that, in a situation where a union is motivated by a single lawful goal, it is nevertheless adjudged guilty of secondary activity without there being some employer against whom it could have exerted pressure gives the section a harshness which has not heretofore been suggested by its most aggressive proponents. Certainly nothing in \u00a7 8(b) compels such a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">On the other hand, when a union\u2019s sole objective is work preservation, it would be anomalous to allow it to press its demands on a general contractor with whom it has no ongoing relationship. Rather than limit the scope of labor disputes consonant with the congressional intent expressed in \u00a7 8(b)(4), such a result is likely to expand them since it would probably affect all subcontractors on a jobsite. The <em>National Woodwork </em>Court tacitly accepted work preservation as a legitimate subject of mandatory collective bargaining, within the \u201cwages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment\u201d language of \u00a7\u00a7 8(d) and 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act. <em>See </em>386 U.S. at 642-43. 87 S.Ct. at 1267; note 28 <em>supra. </em>Disputes over such subjects are best resolved within the bargaining unit encompassing the contending parties. <em>See also Connell Constr.

Indeed the whole affirmative case that the Board makes for the right to control doctrine is found in a single simplistic paragraph of its <em>Koch </em>opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-12\">By the contract under which [the subcontractor] Phillips was to perform its work at the G.E. site or not perform any work at all, <em>Phillips was contractually required to utilize in its work certain prefabricated pipe </em>which had not been worked on by the employees the [union] Respondents represented. Thus, <em>although the Respondent\u2019s claim of work preservation was indeed valid, </em>Phillips by its contract with [the general contractor] <em>Koch had no power to give the Respondents the work they sought, </em>since such work was never Phillips\u2019 to award in the first place. And as Phillips had no past, present, or future authority to award this work to the <em>Respondents, </em>their <em>actions here </em>must have been undertaken in <em>order to produce their effects elsewhere. Therefore, </em>since the pressure directed at Phillips was undertaken for its effect elsewhere, <em>such activity was secondary </em>even though Phillips was the immediate employer here. As the Supreme Court itself said in <em>National Woodwork, </em>\u201cIn effect Congress in enacting \u00a7 8(b)(4)(A) of the Act (hence this holds for the present Section 8(b)(4)(B)) . . . barred as a secondary boycott union activity <em>directed against a neutral employer, </em>including the immediate employer when in fact the activity directed against him was carried on for its effect elsewhere.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b966-14\">201 NLRB at 62 (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-15\">As our opinion elaborates, we remain bewildered as to how Hudik-Ross may be characterized as \u201cneutral\u201d when it executed its contract with Austin in violation of a concededly valid work preservation clause. Nor can we understand how the union\u2019s refusal to acquiesce in that violation must indicate that its objectives were \u201cdirected elsewhere,\u201d particularly since Hudik-Ross could itself satisfy the union\u2019s demands, whether by negotiating a compromise with the union or, as in <em>National Woodwork, </em>terminating its tainted contract with Austin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b967-4\">. Hudik-Ross was free to engage the union in negotiations either before or after it had accepted the subcontracting work. Such negotiations could have centered on an appropriate compromise payment that employees would receive for installing the prefabricated units, although other bargaining solutions were possible. For example, when the collective bargaining agreement was originally accepted the union may have given up demands for additional vacation time or other fringe benefits in order to receive the work preservation guarantee; Hudik-Ross could have achieved a settlement with the union by making concessions on such matters as a <em>quid pro quo </em>for the union\u2019s relaxation of the strictures of Rule IX. Alternatively, Hudik-Ross could have sought an arbitrated solution of the controversy. We cannot understand how, in the absence of such initiatives, Hudik-Ross may be labeled an innocent bystander. The Board appears to place the burden of finding such peaceful resolutions on the union, but we believe that Hudik-Ross, which was the culpable party in generating the controversy, had an obligation to reconcile its actions with its contractual commitments. If Hudik-Ross desires protection from work preservation pressures in the future, it need only negotiate an agreement that incorporates a no-strike provision and that stipulates that such disputes will be submitted to arbitration. <em>Cf. Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Local 770, </em>398 U.S. 235, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 26 L.Ed.2d 199 (1970). However, no such provision precluded the work stoppage in this case, <em>see </em>note 23 <em>supra, </em>and it is improper for the Board to limit the union\u2019s arsenal of weapons as a matter of law. <em>Cf. NLRB </em>v. insurance Agents\u2019 <em>International Union, </em>361 U.S. 477, 497-98, 80 S.Ct. 419, 4 L.Ed.2d 454 (1960). And although the dissent might believe it is \u201cpreferable\u201d to resort to such peaceful mechanisms for resolving work preservation controversies, <em>see </em>dissenting op. at n.66, there is no justification in the Act for asserting that arbitration must be employed or that only a suit for contract breach is proper in the circumstances of the case <em>sub judice, see </em>note 38 infra; if the employer seeks to exclude certain instruments from the union\u2019s armamentarium, the collective bargaining process accords him an adequate and appropriate mechanism for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">What would appear to be a paradigmatic voluntary vehicle for peacefully settling work preservation disputes, both allowing the subcontractor to bid for construction contracts involving prefabricated products and guaranteeing union compensation for an employer\u2019s breach of his collective bargaining agreement, was executed by several of the parties ir \u2022 volved in <em>Associated General Contractors of California, Inc. v. NLRB, supra </em>note 3. There a trade council composed of 17 local unions and a trade association of employers in the construction industry had negotiated a work preservation agreement; if a union representative believed that the agreement was being violated, the union could require the employer to cease doing the contested work, but only for a period of 72 hours, while a joint arbitration board investigated the merits of the claim. After the expiration of 72 hours, the employer could resume work whether or not the investigation was complete. The arbitration board could make a variety of appropriate awards against an offending employer, including \u201cpay[ment of] the equivalent in wages and fringe benefits lost by employees * * * \u201d into the union\u2019s pension fund. Nevertheless, the court in that case found the arbitration board\u2019s assessment against the offending employer of approximately $560 to be improper since it determined that, to the extent the agreement covered work not within a subcontractor\u2019s legal control, it was a prohibited \u201chot cargo\u201d clause in violation of \u00a7 8(e), and that enforcement of that clause constituted a violation of \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b968-5\">.

In such circumstances, termination of that contract would not simply be an ancillary effect of the union\u2019s primary action, but an objective whose legality would have to be assessed independently. If Hudik-Ross is recognized as the primary employer for purposes of this work preservation dispute, the Board might reconsider whether Austin might appropriately be held to be a neutral party against whom economic pressure could not be directly applied. <em>See </em>note 44 <em>infra. </em>We note, however, that contrary to the assertions of the dissenting judges, <em>see, e. g., </em>dissenting op., 172 U.S.App.D.C. at -,---, -, 521 F.2d at 916, 918, 930, the mere fact that on a single occasion the union \u201cinformed Austin * * * that it would not let Hudik install the climate control units involved,\u201d JA at 254, does not constitute sufficient evidence to indicate that impermissible pressure was directed against Austin. Indeed, in simply informing the general contractor, contemporaneously with the arrival of the prepiped units on the jobsite and the initial notification of Hudik concerning the union\u2019s belief that the work was guaranteed to it by Rule IX, that the union would not install those units \u201cbecause the piping inside the units was steamfitters\u2019 work,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 235, the union was doing no more than Hudik-Ross should have done in apprising Austin of the fact that Hudik-Ross\u2019 conflicting contractual commitments had generated a labor controversy at the jobsite.

However, as we stressed in our discussion of Hudik-Ross\u2019 neutrality, it was possible for HudikRoss to effectively satisfy the union\u2019s demands without affecting the contractual rights of any third party.

The Board maintains that this circuit and those other courts which have rejected the right to control doctrine have improperly converted the search for proscribed union activity from an analysis of whether <em>an </em>object of the union is secondary to an analysis of whether the <em>principal </em>object of the union is secondary. See brief for the NLRB at 27-28. The Board thus criticizes these courts because they \u201cseem to conclude that if the union is seeking to enforce a valid work preservation clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>against the employer who signed it, then in every instance, <em>without further inquiry, </em>such activity is primary because motivated by a work preservation objective and enforced against the immediate employer.\u201d <em>Local 438, Plumbers &amp; Pipe Fitters, supra </em>note 4, 201 NLRB at 62 (footnote omitted; emphasis added). <em>See also, e. g., </em>dissenting op. 172 U.S.App.D.C. at---, 521 F.2d at 934-935 &amp; nn.87 &amp; 102. We must respectfully inform the Board that it has totally misunderstood the import of our prior decisions and, we presume, those of our sister circuits. Admittedly, the Board\u2019s statement is correct to the extent that under those circumstances we presume, absent evidence to the contrary, that the union\u2019s activity is primary and lawful and that the employer\u2019s mere lack of legal control over the work does not overcome that presumption. It is also true that, when the pressure is exerted solely against the immediate employer, we would consider termination of the subcontract or the general contractor\u2019s contract with the manufacturer to be acceptable ancillary effects of the primary action. However, even when we find that the union\u2019s primary motivation is work preservation, we will hold its actions unlawful under \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B) if they are tainted by secondary objectives. Several examples can illustrate the differences of such situations from the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"A1f\">The first situation would be one in which the union, in furtherance of a work preservation agreement with a subcontractor, not only refuses to handle prefabricated goods, but also exerts pressure directly against the general contractor to terminate its contract with the manufacturer. <em>Cf. NLRB v. Local 825, Operating Eng\u2019rs [Bums and Roe], </em>400 U.S. 297, 91 S.Ct. 402, 27 L.Ed.2d 398 (1971). In such cases, it would be appropriate to consider the general contractor to be a neutral party since he should not be forced to investigate the collective bargaining agreements of each of his subcontractors and since he could presume that they would resolve their own disputes with their own employees.</p>\n<p id=\"A0s\">A second situation would be one in which the union discriminates in its work preservation tactics on the basis of the organizational status of the manufacturer. For example, when a dispute arose over work preservation and the disputed work was performed by an affiliated labor organization, the union may have only sought compensatory pay and submitted the dispute to arbitration. Yet in similar circumstances, when the manufacturer\u2019s employees were nonunionized, the union may have struck against its employer, hoping it would pressure the general contractor to terminate the manufacturer\u2019s contract. Given such facts, the valid work preservation objective could be held to be tainted by the improper secondary objective.</p>\n<p id=\"agx-dedup-0\">We recognize that such secondary objectives will not often be found when the union\u2019s principal objective is work preservation. We merely wish to demonstrate that we are cognizant of the statutory mandate and that we will hold such secondary objectives to be unlawful should they be detected. However, given the Supreme Court\u2019s approval of work preservation clauses in <em>National Woodwork, </em>and the policy of allowing contending parties to support their demands through economic pressures, we do not find that a work preservation action such as the one in the present case necessarily has <em>per se </em>any unlawful secondary objective, although it may have severe effects on neutral employers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b972-13\">. 386 U.S. at 644, 87 S.Ct. at 1268.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b973-6\">.

The <em>National Woodwork </em>Court stated that the relevant \u201ccircumstances might include the remoteness of the threat of displacement by the banned product or services, the history of labor relations between the union and the employers who would be boycotted, and the economic personality of the industry. See Comment, 62 Mich.L.Rev. 1176, 1185 <em>et seq. </em>(1964).\u201d 386 U.S. at 644 n.38, 87 S.Ct. at 1268. In its analysis of the evidence supporting the Board\u2019s finding that the carpentry union\u2019s ultimate objective was work preservation, the Court stressed that the union \u201crefused to hang prefabricated doors whether or not they bore a union label, and even refused to install prefabricated doors manufactured off the jobsite by members of the Union.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 646, 87 S.Ct. at 1269. In short, the substance, history, and motivation of the particular dispute must be examined, with particular emphasis on identifying the employer whose <em>labor relations </em>are being affected.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b973-5\">BAZELON, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ax1y\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"A3nR\">I concur in Part III of the Court\u2019s opinion, in the bulk of its reasoning and in its judgment that the Board\u2019s \u201cright to control\u201d test is inconsistent with <em>National Woodwork Manufacturing Association v. NLRB, </em>386 U.S. 612, 87 S.Ct. 1250, 18 L.Ed.2d 357 (1967). My path to this conclusion makes it unnecessary for me to consider certain issues raised by the Board in its argument<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and considered in the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">The central dilemma presented by \u00a7 8(b)(4) is well known and needs no extended recital. The section purports to prohibit any inducement to force an employer \u201cto cease doing business with any other person.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the objectives of every strike or job action \u201cinclude a desire to influence others from withholding from the employer their services or trade.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The union by striking always wants to completely shut down the employer and cause the economic injury pursuant to that shut down. Similarly, the union is surely aware and must intend that those who are cut off from the employer\u2019s services by the strike will also be injured and that injury might well create a climate in which the union\u2019s demands will be met. For example, in a strike of the trucking industry, the hardest hit will be not the trucking industry but the producers of perishable commodities. The union surely intends that and surely expects that injury to help its cause. The strike weapon is not a mere contrivance of the courts nor is it permitted through legislative inaction. The strike weapon is explicitly preserved by Sections 7 and 13 of the NLRA. More than this, that weapon forms the base for the system of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>private ordering the NLRA promotes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To forbid the use of this weapon or permit a reduction of its effectiveness without explicit legislative approval would radically shift the balance of advantage struck by Congress between union economic power and employer economic power. Courts were and are naturally hesitant to alter that balance and thus, with the Labor Board, sought to accommodate the right to strike with the prohibition on secondary boycotts.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">The accommodation between Sections 7 and 13 and Section 8(b)(4) which the Board urges upon us focuses on the union\u2019s \u201csecondary intent.\u201d If a union has an \u201cintent\u201d to achieve the secondary effects occasioned by its strike otherwise protected by Sections 7 and 13, then it follows that the union has engaged in a \u00a7 8(b)(4) \u201csecondary boycott.\u201d If the union does not intend to achieve those effects but rather seeks only to achieve effects on the primary employer, then the strike is \u201cprimary\u201d and not violative of \u00a7 8(b)(4). In the Board\u2019s words: \u201cWhile not prohibiting \u2018the <em>incidental </em>effects of <em>traditional primary activity,\u2019 </em>Congress by Section 8(b)(4)(B) has \u2018barred as a secondary boycott union activity directed against a neutral employer, <em>including the immediate employer </em>when in fact the activity directed against him was carried on for its effect <em>elsewhere.\u2019 </em>... If a \u2018tactical object\u2019 of the union\u2019s conduct is a person other than the employer of the boycotting employees, the \u2018boycott [is] secondary in its aim.' \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-7\">A moment\u2019s reflection will suggest the difficulty with this formulation. The union surely intends the secondary effects of all strikes. That secondary effect is part, indeed, in some cases the only operative part of the strike weapon. This observation, rejoins the Board, citing dicta in <em>Denver Building and Trades,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>proves it is correct here in finding Local 638\u2019s activity was secondary, since \u201can object\u201d (the precise statutory phrase of \u00a7 8(b)(4) of Local 638\u2019s job action was to put pressure on the general contractor through a strike of its own employer, the \u201csecondary\u201d, to force it to terminate business with the general. The obvious response is that this reasoning taken literally would outlaw all strikes, exactly what the \u201cunion intent\u201d accommodation seemingly was designed to prevent. A union always intends that employers other than the immediate employer will be pressured by its strikes or job actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">The Board attempts to limit the far reaching effect of its reasoning by applying it only when the primary employer has no \u201cright to control\u201d assignment of disputed work in work preservation controversies. The Board argues that in this limited situation it can reasonably presume that the union\u2019s economic pressure on the primary employer is intended to particularly affect the employer who does have the right to control assignment of the disputed work. The union\u2019s object must then be to pressure the employer who does have this right to control to satisfy the union's objective. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>This formulation essentially limits the Board\u2019s reasoning to the construction industry.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Board asks us to accept this reasoning as based upon its expertise in ascertaining union objectives and evaluating union conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">But can the Board\u2019s reasoning be limited to situations in which the struck employer has no right to control the disputed work? Assume the immediate employer <em>does </em>have the right to control assignment of the work. A strike to force him to exercise that discretion, i. e. change his purchasing policies, to assign the work to his employees has exactly the same effect as a strike to force him to stop doing business with an individual who, in the situation in which the immediate employer has <em>no </em>right to control, would have the discretion to assign the work to the disputing employees. We have consistently held that a strike to force a termination of business is no different from a strike to force a change in purchasing policies;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the language of the statute and common sense clearly support that view.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">If the secondary effects of a strike of or job action against a primary employer are equal when the employer has right to control and when he does not have right to control, why is it that the union does not \u201cintend\u201d the secondary effects in the first situation but does in the second? Surely, the Board will not be heard to argue that since the primary employer can legally \u201csatisfy\u201d the union\u2019s demand in the first situation, the presumption as to \u201cintent\u201d is not applicable. The employer who has no right to control can also legally satisfy the union\u2019s demand by terminating the offending contract or paying off the union for its lost wages. Similarly, as the general contractor in the non-right to control situation can satisfy the union\u2019s demands by changing his own purchasing policies, so the manufacturer in the right to control situation can satisfy the union demands by constructing heating and cooling units such that threading and fitting is done on the job or by going out of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-10\">To this argument, I take it, the Board\u2019s only possible response is that its experience with union actions in the construction industry convince it that (a.) the union is unconcerned with any secondary effect on a manufacturer, when the union\u2019s employer can assign it the work in dispute, but (b.) is specially and vitally concerned with the secondary effect on an employer who could assign the disputed work to the union. But surely the Board does not argue that the union does not intend that the manufacturer feel <em>no </em>effects of economic pressure on a right to control employer; nor by its own admission in this case does it argue that the union is specifically seeking to bargain with an employer who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>does have the right to control when the union\u2019s immediate employer does not. It is difficult to perceive how the Board\u2019s gradation of union intent can serve as any kind of a rational or definitive standard to distinguish a \u00a7 8(b)(4) violation: in both cases the union \u201cintends\u201d the secondary effect and surely makes use of that effect to gain its objective. It may be in other industries that the secondary effects of a strike are less important to a union than in, for example, the trucking industry. Does that make strikes in the trucking industry \u201csecondary\u201d and strikes in other industries \u201cprimary\u201d? In any event, the Board has presented us with no record that unions in the construction industry are particularly inclined to manipulate the secondary effects of their primary strikes more in a non-right to control situation than in a right to control situation. Such a conclusion is not intuitively obvious to me: my own suspicion is that the unions intend to force everybody, everywhere to recognize their right to traditional jobs and if a strike of their primary employer pinches some other entity which is ignoring the union\u2019s \u201cright\u201d then so much the better from the union\u2019s point of view. Thus, I am unwilling to rely on the Board\u2019s conclusory allegations of expertise when the illogic of its position is not overcome by a record supportive of that position. In these circumstances, I cannot conclude that the Board has successfully demonstrated that there is any distinction between the union\u2019s intent in situations in which the immediate employer has the right to control and the situation in which that employer does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">My conclusion in this regard is buttressed by another consideration. Clearly, a union strike over failure to agree to an increase in wages or failure to comply with such an agreement does not become secondary activity simply because the employer\u2019s ability to pay is practically dependent on the price he himself receives from a third party. Yet only the third party has the \u201cright to control\u201d resolution of the dispute and thus, under the Board\u2019s reasoning, the immediate employer is a \u201csecondary.\u201d The Board seeks to avoid this intuitively absurd result by stating that the inability to satisfy union demands must be \u201clegal\u201d not \u201cpractical\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in order to support the right to control test. But what principles support this distinction? One searches in vain. Indeed, the distinction between \u201cpractical\u201d and \u201clegal\u201d power, never the most obvious of distinctions in the non-legal world, is attenuated to the point of disappearance when, as here, the \u201clegal\u201d inability of the immediate employer is caused by his own \u201cpractical\u201d estimations as to the profit in entering a subcontract in derogation of his work preservation agreement. If the union decides, as an employer might well importune it to decide, to agree to a monetary settlement in lieu of compliance with the work preservation agreement, the immediate employer may find it necessary to seek aid from the general contractor in order to get the job moving. Can the Board really distinguish between \u201cpractical\u201d and \u201clegal\u201d control over a labor dispute?</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">If the Board\u2019s presumption of secondary intent when the employer has no right to control is extended to situations in which the employer does have the right to control \u2014 as, in logic, it must be extended, as discussed above \u2014 the right to control presumption becomes not an accommodation between \u00a7 8(b)(4) and \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 13 but rather an administrative repeal of the right to strike.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>Chamber of Commerce in its <em>amicus </em>brief quite unabashedly presses upon us that contention; job site strikes over work preservation issues should be outlawed because of their disruptive effect, While I must commend the Chamber for its honesty of presentation, its argument was over-ruled in the most explicit terms in <em>National Woodwork</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and upon reflection is really no more than the old, discredited contention bandied about in the days prior to the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Accepting the Chamber\u2019s position would re-introduce the labor injunction through the fragile vehicle of \u00a7 8(b)(4) and \u00a7 10(1). It is simply incomprehensible that Congress would intend such a result without altering Norris-LaGuardia or Sections 7 and 13; in any event, I for one would not bring back the doctrine of <em>Coronado </em>(II) and <em>Bedford Cut Stone</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>without the most explicit Congressional statement that such was demanded by dictates of sound economic policy. Finally, the Board\u2019s right to control test must be rejected because the Supreme Court in <em>National Woodwork </em>expressly held that the union could use economic pressure for work preservation against an immediate employer who does have the right to control. As discussed above, there is no distinction between economic pressure against an immediate employer who does have the right to control and one who does not that is relevant to the purposes of \u00a7 8(b)(4). Therefore, <em>National Woodwork </em>requires us to reverse the Board\u2019s action as arbitrary and as inconsistent with the Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Having said all this, I think it appropriate to make some brief remarks about what <em>is </em>proscribed by \u00a7 8(b)(4). That is not an easy task since the 80th Congress which passed that provision did not specify what the provision was meant to outlaw. All who read the Section agree it can not be taken literally. All who know the history of the Taft-Hartley Act realize that Congress surely meant to outlaw something that unions were engaged in. The project for the courts and the Board has been to formulate the scope of \u00a7 8(b)(4)\u2019s proscription. It is instructive to consider the two areas in which the Board and the courts have with some exactitude delineated the scope of \u00a7 8(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b978-9\">The first area involves those cases in which the union directly seeks to obtain a concession for a specific group of employees from an employer with whom it has no bargaining relationship under the NLRA <em>relating to those specific employees.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>An example would be where a union pickets an employer with whom it has no collective bargaining agreement to prevent that employer from doing something that would affect the union. In such cases the union is in effect seeking to bargain with the third-party employer. When \u00a7 8(b)(4)\u2019s proscription is stated in those terms, it is easily reconciled with the NLRA and particularly the Taft-Hartley Act as a whole. Such an attempt by the union to bargain with an employer, with whom it has no collective bargaining relationship in relation to the affected employees, would conflict with the policy of the Act of free choice for the actual employees of the employer so importuned as to whether they wish to be represented by a union; would conflict with the employer\u2019s actual or potential duty to bargain with his own employees; and could conflict with the union\u2019s concomitant duty to represent those employees. The employer may thus be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>forced to bargain with two unions and the union who seeks to force bargaining must represent two work forces, which may or may not have conflicting interests.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The interloper union thus finds no protection in the Act for his bargaining. Indeed, one could construe such a bargaining attempt as a petition for recognition which is itself illegal unless done in conformity with the rather specific provisions of the Act governing rec-ognitional activity.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">These same general policies of the Act may also explain the other area in which the courts and Board have reached agreement on the scope of \u00a7 8(b)(4) \u2014 any union attempts to obtain from its immediate employer an agreement to or prac-tise of refusing to handle non-union goods or to work on jobs where non-union workers will be present violate \u00a7 8(b)(4).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Professor Lesnick criticizes these cases because they are insensitive to the subtleties of \u201cunion intent.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, that criticism ignores what I perceive to be the real import of this rule. A union objective to promote unionization or for \u201caesthetic\u201d reasons to refuse to handle non-union goods even if directed solely at the primary employer (although I would argue no union objective ever is in intent) is not protected by the Act since the Act is neutral toward unionization and affirmatively seeks to protect employee freedom of choice in deciding upon union representation. The union\u2019s objective, not its \u201cintent\u201d to make tactical use of secondary effects, is illegal and \u201csecondary\u201d as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">The relation of the proscription of \u00a7 8(b)(4) to the general policies of Taft-Hartley and the NLRA provides a more firm structure to the secondary boycott provisions, one more easily complied with and one more readily administered. It furthermore has the salutory effect of enhancing Congress\u2019 role as the ultimate arbiter of union power and employer power in the collective bargaining process. With attention thus directed to the <em>substantive desirability </em>of the union\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>bargaining objective, Congress may with the issue so framed give full consideration to the desirability of that objective in balance with its adverse secondary effects. On the other hand, if courts and the Board continue to focus on \u201cunion intent\u201d, Congress may be deterred from intervention by the heavily factual nature of the inquiry. The energies of management and labor will be spent on subtle questions of evidence while the central questions of the desirability of the objective as against its adverse effects will be submerged in judicial consideration of evidentiary presumptions such as the \u201cright to control.\u201d A better institutional position for appellate courts is as a structuring agent, promoting rationalization and consistency in labor policy, and thereby framing issues for legislative and administrative consideration. The history of legislative-judicial-administrative dialogue is most impressive in those situations in which the judiciary considers the legality of a particular bargaining objective after the parties and the Labor Board have formulated the issue and either applies existing legislative policy to that objective or in effect \u201cremands\u201d the issue to Congress for action.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Finally, a relation of the proscription of \u00a7 8(b)(4) to the policies of the Taft-Hartley Act is probably the best approximation of the true intent of the 80th Congress in passing \u00a7 8(b)(4) while leaving Sections 7 and 13, not to mention Norris-LaGuardia, unscathed.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>As to the result in this case, I concur in Part III of the Court\u2019s opinion which establishes that if the union is striking its employer over the violation of a lawful collective bargaining agreement, the union may not be found in violation of \u00a7 8(b)(4) unless the objects listed in footnote 44 taint the union\u2019s strike. While I am less convinced than the majority that the Board deserves another opportunity to determine whether any of those objects tainted Local 638\u2019s strike, I concur in its reasoned judgment that a remand is the proper disposition at this time.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b973-14\">. <em>See </em>Brief for the NLRB at 8-10.

The Board seems unaware of this fact and of the serious problems such an approach raises in terms of the over-all equity of the NLRA. It is largely for this reason that I would, if I were writing on a clean slate, adopt the views of Judge Fahy stated in <em>Denver Bldg. &amp; Construc. Trades Council v.

The Board is apparently waffling on the question of whether the union may strike the general contractor who in circumstances as those <em>sub judice </em>has the right to control. It first held that the union did have that right but the 9th Circuit rejected that holding on appeal. <em>See Western Monolithics Concrete Prod., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>446 F.2d 522 (9th Cir. 1971). This Board position apparently motivated the refusal to issue a complaint in <em>Connell Construe. Co. v. Local 100, Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters, </em>421 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>U.S. 616, 95 S.Ct. 1830, 44 L.Ed.2d 418 (1975), <em>rev\u2019g, </em>483 F.2d 1154, 1158 (5th Cir. 1973) and was implicitly rejected by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding. The Board\u2019s apparent position seems manifestly inconsistent with the Act, <em>see </em>172 U.S.App.D.C. pp.---, 521 F.2d pp. 892-893 <em>infra, </em>and, as the Court notes in note 29, would seem to expand rather than contract the scope of labor disputes in contravention of the stated goal of \u00a7 8(b)(4). Thus, we are forced to the conclusion that when the immediate employer has no right to control, the union is deprived of the right to strike. This cannot be squared with Sections 7 and 13.</p>\n<p id=\"Axe\">The Board offers solace to the union by stating that the union may enforce its contractual agreement with its immediate employer in a \u00a7 301 suit. See <em>Local 438, Plumbers &amp; Pipefit-ters (George Koch Sons), </em>201 N.L.R.B. 59, 63 (1973) , <em>affd, </em>490 F.2d 323 (4th Cir. 1973). Thus, the Board implies that the scope of \u00a7 8(b)(4) is broader than that of \u00a7 8(e). The Court in note 38 correctly notes that both the majority and dissent in <em>National Woodwork </em>held that \u00a7 8(b)(4) and 8(e) were to be construed <em>in pari passu. </em>Furthermore, the Board\u2019s position raises the intriguing question of whether the union may strike to require the immediate employer to pay damages for violating the concededly valid work preservation agreement. The only minimal rationality to the Board\u2019s position is provided by our recent holding in <em>Local 223, Sheet Metal Workers v. NLRB, </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. 145, 498 F.2d 687 (1974) which held that the validity of a work preservation agreement could only be determined at its inception. The Board could argue that since the work preservation agreement is valid and a later specific secondary intent could not void it, the courts should permit \u00a7 8(b)(4) findings in such situations to preserve the intent of \u00a7 8(b)(4). The most obvious response is that Judge Wilkey\u2019s opinion for the Court in <em>Local 223 </em>does not hold that an agreement originally valid under \u00a7 8(e) may be <em>enforced </em>in all circumstances, only that the agreement itself cannot be <em>voided </em>because of one incident of secondary intent in enforcing that agreement. I conclude, as does the Court, that the Board must either completely outlaw the union\u2019s action or completely protect it. The Board is not authorized to initiate under \u00a7\u00a7 8(b)(4) and 8(e) a compulsory arbitration scheme for the construction industry. That is a project for management and labor to resolve in collective bargaining. The Board\u2019s implied response that \u00a7 8(e)\u2019s construction industry proviso should cover disputes of the sort we confront in this case must be rejected. <em>See </em>note 22 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"ady-dedup-0\">While the Board does not explicitly make the argument, one could argue that the principle of <em>Local 174, Teamsters v. Lucas Flour Co., </em>369 U.S. 95, 82 S.Ct. 571, 7 L.Ed.2d 593 (1962) should permit the Board to extend the compulsory arbitration schemes specifically approved in \u00a7\u00a7 8(b)(4)(ii)(D), 10(k), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(b)(4)(ii)(D), 160(k) (1970) (compulsory arbitration of work assignment and jurisdictional disputes) and in the construction industry proviso to \u00a7 8(e) (union and employer may agree to hot cargo clause but the clause may not be enforced through a strike if the subject of the agreement relates to job site work) to the facts of this case. I am not impressed with this potential argument since it restricts the right to strike by implication. Such restriction was permitted in <em>Lucas Flour </em>because of the union\u2019s own agreement to a plenary arbitration scheme. There is no such agreement in this case. <em>See </em>Wellington &amp; Albert, <em>Statutory Interpretation and the Political Process: A Comment on Sinclair v.

First, it may directly restrict union economic power when used in pursuit of a particular bargaining objective. See \u00a7\u00a7 8(b)(4)(ii)(D); 10(k), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(b)(4)(ii)(D); 160(k) (1970) (compulsory arbitration over work assignment and jurisdictional disputes); \u00a7 8(b)(7), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(7) (1970) (time limitation for organizational picketing and the right to have a Board regulated election); \u00a7 8(b)(1), (2), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(b)(1), (2) (1970) (limitations of union security objectives); and the provisos to \u00a7 8(e), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(e) (1970) (union may bargain for agreement not to handle non-union goods or work with nonunion workmen but may not strike to enforce such an agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">Second, Congress may take steps to mitigate the more harsh effects of union economic power. <em>See, e. g., </em>National Labor Relations Act \u00a7 208, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 178 (1970); Railway Labor Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 154-63, 183-85 (1970); C.

Wellington, Labor Law 845-883 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">The \u201cinstitutional\u201d view of the role of the courts suggested in the text would also seem to mitigate the difficulties of judicial application of the stated purpose of \u00a7 8(b)(4) \u2014 the protection of \u201cneutral\u201d third parties. <em>See, e. g., National Woodwork Manuf.

The Board finds injury to neutral third parties in this case involving a small construction job in Brooklyn and proscribes that injury through \u00a7 8(b)(4). However, the Board would not and under current law could not redress through \u00a7 8(b)(4) the very real injury to neutral third parties caused by a nationwide truckers strike or a local public employees strike. When one compares the relative seriousness of the injuries to neutral third parties, one must certainly pause to consider whether judicial effort to control secondary effects through \u00a7 8(b)(4) is a fruitless if not Sisyphise-an task. The inherent inequity in this task is made doubly obvious in \u201cRight to Control\u201d work preservation disputes since construction unions are the only apparent object of \u00a7 8(b)(4) in such circumstances due to the peculiar structure of the industry. <em>See </em>note 7 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b980-11\">. <em>Cf. </em>National Labor Relations Act \u00a7 7, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 157 (1970) (\u201cEmployees . . . shall also have the right to refrain from\u201d collective bargaining); \u00a7\u00a7 8(a)(1), (b)(1), 14(b), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(1), (b)(1), 164(b) (1970). <em>See also International Ass\u2019n of Machinists v.

This correlation has already been suggested in note 15 <em>supra. </em>It may also be seen in a comparison of <em>Local 189, Meat Cutters v.

The suggestion of this correlation is that if the union\u2019s substantive objective is within the scope of mandatory subjects of bargaining, it is exempt from both anti-trust and secondary boycott proscription. For another interesting comparison suggested in part by Professors Wellington and Summers, compare <em>Goldfinger </em>v. <em>Feintuch, </em>276 N.Y. 281, 11 N.E.2d 910 (1937) <em>with Douds v. Metropolitan Fed\u2019n of Architects, </em>75 F.Supp. 672, 676-77 (S.D.N.Y. 1948) <em>and </em>the Court\u2019s opinion in this case. Indeed, the central definition of \u201csecondary\u201d intent for \u00a7 8(e) developed in <em>National Woodwork </em>and applied by this Court in <em>Local 223, Sheet Metal Workers v. NLRB, </em>162 U.S.App.D.C. 145, 498 F.2d 687 (1974) is a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s construction of its <em>antitrust </em>opinion, <em>Allen Bradley Co. v. Local 3, Electrical Workers, </em>325 U.S. 797, 65 S.Ct. 1533, 89 L.Ed. 1939 (1945). <em>See also Westinghouse Electric Corp., </em>150 N.L.R.B. 1574 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"Ae2g\">This correspondence between present antitrust doctrine and \u00a7 8(b)(4), which focuses on the union\u2019s bargaining objective, is consistent with the common law position on secondary boycotts \u2014 that union boycott activity is illegal unless justified by a \u201cprivilege.\u201d <em>See Vegelahn v. Guntner, </em>167 Mass. 92, 44 N.E. 1077 (1896); Holmes, <em>Privilege, Malice and Intent, </em>8 Harv.L.Rev. 1 (1894). The NLRA which protects mandatory collective bargaining over certain subjects supplies the \u201cprivilege\u201d which protects the union\u2019s boycott activities. <em>Compare Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, </em>246 U.S. 231, 38 S.Ct. 242, 62 L.Ed. 683 (1918); <em>Silver v. New York Stock Exchange , </em>373 U.S. 341, 83 S.Ct. 1246, 10 L.Ed.2d 389 (1963) <em>and </em>cases cited S.

Senator Taft stated expressly that the purpose of \u00a7 8(b)(4) was to \u201creverse the effect of the law as to secondary boycotts\u201d by restoring the common law position. II Legislative History of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, at 1106 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"AAT\">The Supreme Court appeared to recognize the relation of \u00a7 8(b)(4) doctrine and anti-trust doctrine in <em>Connell Construe. Co. v. Local 100, Plumbers &amp; Steamf\u00edtters, </em>421 U.S. 616, 95 S.Ct. 1830, 44 L.Ed.2d 418 (1975). There the union engaged in seemingly flagrant secondary activity, the Board refused to issue a complaint in an identical case involving the same union and a different subcontractor \u2014 either on the basis of its \u201cright to control\u201d doctrine or on the basis of an expansive view of \u00a7 8(e)\u2014 and the injured employer filed an anti-trust complaint. If anti-trust doctrine and secondary boycott doctrine are fully correlated, then an anti-trust cause of action can properly be viewed as a third party remedy when the Board refuses to issue a complaint. <em>Cf. W. J. Milner &amp; Co. v. Local 349, Electrical Workers, </em>476 F.2d 8 (5th Cir. 1973). See <em>also Connell Construction Co. v.

The Board makes one final implied argument. It is suggested that the construction industry proviso to \u00a7 8(e) by approving certain types of job sites agreements but forbidding economic pressure brought to enforce such agreements would be undermined by our holding in this case. By permitting economic pressure in support of an agreement which would fall under the proviso to \u00a7 8(e) if it involved an agreement with the general contractor, it is argued, this Court is ignoring the Congressional assumption that such agreements may not be enforced through economic pressure. This argument must be rejected. First, a close reading of the legislative history, particularly the Congressional consideration of <em>Denver Bldg. Trades, </em>indicates the only subject of Congressional action was union signatory agreements, economic pressure in support of which would <em>not </em>be approved by my reasoning or the Court\u2019s. <em>See </em>Conf.Rep., <em>supra </em>note 1, at 39; Connell <em>Construction Co. v. Local 100, Plumbers &amp; Steamf\u00edtters, </em>421 U.S. 616, 95 S.Ct. 1830, 44 L.Ed.2d 418 (1975) <em>citing Drivers, Salesmen, etc., Local 695, Teamsters v. NLRB, </em>124 U.S.App.D.C. 93, 361 F.2d 547, 553 (1966). Second, we will not extend such a narrow Congressional balance of union and employer economic power beyond the specific subject which motivated Congressional action, when such extension will reduce the effectiveness of the strike weapon. <em>See </em>note 11 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">1 make one <em>caveat </em>to the reasoning of this opinion. The case <em>sub judice </em>concerns union pressure on an allegedly third party employer proscribed by \u00a7 (b)(4)(ii)(B), and not union pressure on other employees as proscribed by \u00a7 8(b)(4)(i), except to the extent the union here attempted to persuade its own members to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>participate in the job action. I have not fully explored whether the reasoning applied to \u00a7 8(b)(4)(ii)(B) should apply exactly to \u00a7 8(b)(4)(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>MacKINNON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AMu3\">with whom TAMM, ROBB and WILKEY, Circuit Judges, join (dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">We review here a determination of the National Labor Relations Board that Enterprise Association engaged in an illegal secondary boycott as proscribed by section 8(b)(4)(B) when it sought to enforce its interpretation of a clause in its collective bargaining contract wherein the employer agreed that certain pipefitting operations would be performed at the job-site. The majority opinion concerns itself almost entirely with the validity of the \u201cright-to-control test\u201d which it asserts the Board used as the sole test to judge the legality of the Union\u2019s action. I disagree with the majority\u2019s assessment as to the use of the test, which seems to me thoroughly compatible with the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>National Woodwork </em>decision,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but more fundamentally this opinion concludes that the majority has taken an unduly restrictive view of the scope of section 8(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">I. THE PROHIBITION AGAINST SECONDARY BOYCOTTS</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">The central issue in this appeal revolves around the secondary boycott provisions of the Labor-Management Relations Act. The statute prohibiting such boycotts was first enacted in 1947 as section 8(b)(4)(A) of the Taft-Hartley Act. It was amended by the Landrum-Griffin Act in 1959 and at that time redesigna-ted as section 8(b)(4)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is this portion of the statute that must be applied to the facts of this appeal, which comes to us following written opinions by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) and by a unanimous three-member panel of the National Labor Relations Board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-14\">A. <em>Factual Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b982-15\">The rendition of the following basic facts by the AU is not in dispute<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>:</p>\n<p id=\"b982-16\">Slant/Fin Corporation (hereafter Slant/Fin), manufacturer of the air-conditioning units, was a New York Corporation with its principal office and place of business in Greenvale, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-17\">Austin, the general contractor and engineer for the Norwegian Home for the Aged, was an Ohio Corporation with its principal office and place of business in Roselle, New Jersey. Austin engaged in providing and performing engineering, general contracting and related services in various states of the United States, including New Jersey and New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-18\">Hudik-Ross Co., Inc. (hereafter Hudik), the heating and air-conditioning subcontractor, was a New York Corporation with its principal office and place of business in New York City. It engaged in providing heating, ventilation, air-con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>ditioning and related services at various construction jobsites in New York state. The Enterprise Association, Local Union No. 638 (hereafter the Union, also the Steamfitters), affiliated with the International Plumbing and Pipefitters Union, AFL-CIO, operated in New York City and is a labor organization as defined by section 2(5) of the Labor-Management Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">Austin was designated general contractor and engineer for the construction of the Norwegian Home in New York City. In that capacity, Austin prepared the engineering job specifications, employed directly certain Union construction workers, and subcontracted the electrical, plumbing, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning work to various subcontractors.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">The building specifications were dated November 29, 1971. With respect to the heating and air-conditioning units they provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-6\">Furnish at the jobsite Slant/Fin Climate Command Air Conditioners. The unit shall be <em>complete </em>with cabinets, filters, cooling chasis, heating coil fans, main water flow and condensate assembly</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-7\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-8\">\n<em>The main flow and condensate assembly shall be factory installed as an integral part of the unit by the manufacturer .</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-10\">Manufacturer shall furnish a written guarantee for a period of one year after completion of installation .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-11\">******</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-12\">(J.A. 233). (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-13\">These specifications required the subcontractor (Hudik) to install air-conditioning units as manufactured by Slant/Fin <em>complete </em>with the factory installed \u201cwat-erflow and condensate assembly,\u201d i. e., with internal prepiped waterflow and condensate assemblies. With this prepip-ing, the equipment would be guaranteed by the manufacturer for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">Hudik received the subcontract for the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning work as the result of competitive bidding and on January 14, 1972, entered into the subcontract with Austin to install the heating and air conditioning in the building according to the specifications. The Administrative Law Judge found that Hudik was aware of the above-quoted specifications prior to bidding.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-16\">Hudik had been a union contractor in New York City for many years and its collective bargaining contract with the Union provided for compliance with the following rule:</p>\n<p id=\"b983-17\">RULE IX</p>\n<p id=\"b983-18\">CUTTING PIPE AND MAKING UP FITTINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b983-19\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b983-20\">Radiator branches, convector branches and coil connections shall be cut and threaded by hand on the job in accordance with Rule V.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-21\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b983-22\">(J.A. 213). The Union contends that Rule IX required Hudik to assign to its members on the jobsite the work of cutting and threading certain \u201cinternal piping\u201d in the air-conditioning units. But the building specifications with which Hudik was .obligated to comply required the installation of the completed units as delivered by Slant/Fin with their internal piping for main waterflow and condensate assembly already assembled by the manufacturer. The subcontract called for the installation of 114 air-conditioning units at a total cost of $51,000 (J.A. 192).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-23\">On June 22, 1972, the air-conditioning units arrived at the jobsite and were unloaded. Hudik\u2019s job foreman contacted Daly, the Union\u2019s business agent, and the two men proceeded to inspect the units. The next day, Daly told <em>Austin\u2019s </em>project superintendent that members of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>the steamfitters\u2019 union \u201cwould not install the Slant/Fin units because the <em>piping inside </em>the units was steamfitters\u2019 work and that Rule IX of their contract with Hudik called for them to do the inside piping work on site\u201d (J.A. 235, emphasis added). Daly conveyed the same message to the Hudik superintendent and to Frank Hudik. Hudik pointed out to Daly that the units had been preassembled and pretested at the factory and that the building specifications called for installation of the complete Slant/Fin units.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">Nevertheless, because the internal piping had been done at the factory, the Union refused to install the Slant/Fin units, and as a consequence held up completion of the building. Austin filed an unfair labor practice charge against the Union alleging that it was engaged in an illegal secondary boycott prohibited by section 8(b)(4)(B). The Union had never met with Slant/Fin and there was no evidence that the Union had ever tried to organize Slant/Fin\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">There was testimony that on other jobs the Union had fitted pipe on similar American Standard air-conditioning units on the jobsite, but a witness for the pipefitters pointed out that those units did not have the bypass arrangement or condenser contained in the Slant/Fin equipment. (J.A. 151 \u2014 155). The engineering sketch of the manufactured unit, see Figure 1 (J.A. 196, 224, 225), indicates that the work the local Union claimed included a number of integrated and necessary <em>internal </em>parts of the complete air-conditioning unit produced and guaranteed by Slant/Fin. The disputed work was substantially more than just cutting and threading the pipe to connect the air-conditioning units to the basic piping that ran throughout the building. It included connecting up two valves and a condenser (J.A. 196, 224, 225) \u2014 in other words, the Union sought to perform final assembly tasks on <em>internal parts </em>of the air-conditioning units. See Figure 1. To comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>the demand that the local Union perform that internal work would require the unit to be dismantled, the assembly surrounding the two valves and the condenser to be taken apart, and the local workmen to reconstruct the internal piping, fit new pipe to the valves and condenser, connect them and then reassemble the complete unit.

Upon review of these submissions, the Board decided</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b986-6\">to affirm the rulings, findings, and conclusions of the Administrative Law Judge to the extent consistent herewith, and to adopt his recommended Order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">(J.A. 252).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">Although the Board essentially adopted the findings and reasoning of the ALJ, its opinion highlighted the facts that (1) the refusal to work was based on a \u201cvalid work preservation\u201d contract with Hudik, (2) Hudik was incapable of assigning the work because the questioned work was never Hudik\u2019s to assign in the first place, and (3) the Union had immediately and specifically informed Austin, the general contractor, who did not have a contract with or employ any members of the Union, that it would not permit Hudik to install the air-conditioning units. This latter fact indicates that Austin was an object of the Union\u2019s complaint from the very start. The Union knew that Austin as the general contractor was the only party with the power to comply with its demand. Thus, relying on the opinion of the ALJ and its own additional statement, the Board found that the Union was exerting prohibited secondary pressure on Hudik with the object either of forcing a change in Austin\u2019s manner of doing business or of forcing Hudik to terminate its subcontract with Austin. The Board concluded that the Union\u2019s exertion of pressure on Hudik contravened section 8(b)(4)(B) because it was undertaken for its effect on Austin and Slant/Fin.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b987-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>D. <em>The </em>National Woodwork <em>Precedent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">It is apparent that the literal provisions of the secondary boycott statute were violated; the Union did as \u201ca labor organization . . . induce [and] encourage . . . individuals] employed by any person engaged . in an industry affecting commerce to engage in, a strike [and] . . . refusal in the course of [their] employment to use <em>... or otherwise handle or work on . . </em>goods, articles . where ... an object thereof [was] \u2014 (B) forcing [and] requiring ...

Translating the statute to the facts of this case;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-12\">The Union induced and encouraged its steamfitters employed by Hudik to strike and refuse to use, handle and work on air-conditioning units with internal prepiping where an object of their strike and refusal was forcing and requiring Hudik to cease using the products of Slant/Fin and to cause Austin to cease doing business with Slant/Fin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b987-17\">We are told by <em>National Woodwork, </em>however, that it is not sufficient to find a violation of the \u201cthe letter of the statute\u201d and that in determining whether certain action is \u201cwithin the intention of the makers [of the statute],\u201d we should interpret the Act according to \u201cits spirit.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 386 U.S. at 619, 87 S.Ct. 1250. This is always a sound rule of statutory interpretation, but it does not permit wholesale deviation from the provisions of the statute. In any case involving the interpretation of a legislative act the provisions of the statute itself are of primary importance, and the fact that certain conduct is within the literal language of the Act is a weighty and often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>controlling factor in its interpretation. When we try to overcome the literal applicability of section 8(b)(4) to the facts of this case we have a pretty riddle.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">To solve it we start with a factual situation which presents a secondary boycott as proscribed by the literal language of the Act. The question then arises whether the spirit of that law is violated by the acts of the Union in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">The majority points to <em>National Woodwork </em>for the principle that \u201c[t]he touchstone is whether the agreement <em>or its maintenance </em>is addressed to the labor relations of the contracting employer visa-vis his own employees.\u201d 386 U.S. at 644 \u2014 45, 87 S.Ct. at 1268 (emphasis added). In that case both \u201cthe agreement\u201d and \u201cits maintenance\u201d were addressed to the immediate contracting employer. However, while the written agreement here may have been addressed to the contracting employer (Hudik), at least in part, the Union addressed the boycott endeavoring to <em>maintain </em>the agreement to employers elsewhere, <em>i. e., </em>to Austin and Slant/Fin. As I read <em>National Woodwork </em>it is not sufficient that the agreement have a primary focus, if its enforcement is attempted by secondary pressures.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">Judge Wright\u2019s opinion seeks its principal support in the decision in <em>National Woodwork, </em>but the Supreme Court noted that that case involved a <em>primary </em>boycott, a fact which clearly distinguishes it from this case. There the general contractor had agreed with the local carpenters\u2019 union that carpenters he employed would not handle premachined doors. This building contract gave him <em>discretion </em>to use premachined <em>or </em>blank doors, yet he ordered premachined doors from the National Woodwork Manufacturers Association. He was promptly struck by his union carpenters. On these facts the Supreme Court, in the case which resulted from the petition of the Association, held that when employees strike their immediate employer to secure compliance with demands for legitimate work preservation, the boycott is primary and thus not prohibited by section 8(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">While the opinion in <em>National Woodwork </em>recognizes that the object of the strike was the preservation of traditional work it does not hold that all attempts to preserve traditional work by striking one\u2019s immediate employer constitute permissible primary boycotts. In fact, the opinion states exactly the contrary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-9\">In effect Congress, in enacting \u00a7 8(b)(4)(A) [now \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B)] of the Act, returned to the regime of <em>Duplex Printing Press Co. </em>and <em>Bedford Cut Stone Co., supra, </em>and barred as a secondary boycott union activity directed against a neutral employer, <em>including the immediate employer </em>[emphasis added] when in fact the activity directed against him was carried on for its effect elsewhere.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">386 U.S. at 632, 87 S.Ct. at 1262. That is the situation we confront here. Hudik is essentially neutral in this dispute because it does not have and never did have the power to comply with the Steamfitters\u2019 demands. Thus the pressure created by the Hudik employees\u2019 boycott of the Slant/Fin units must have been directed at Austin and Slant/Fin as they were the only parties with the power to satisfy the demand that the work be taken from Slant/Fin employees and reassigned to the Union. We should not assume an absurdity and conclude that the Union would expect its demands to be met by an employer who did not possess the power to do so. The logical deduction that Austin and Slant/Fin are the objects of the Union\u2019s action is as sound a basis for invoking the prohibition of section 8(b)(4) as would be specific proof that the Union was motivated by disapproval of the labor policies of those parties. The <em>National Woodwork </em>Court noted that \u201c[t]here need not be an actual dispute with the boycotted employer [here Austin and Slant/Fin] . for the activity to fall within this category [boycotts \u2018tactically calculated to satisfy union objectives elsewhere\u2019], so long as the tactical object of the agreement and its maintenance is that em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>ployer . . . thus making the . boycott secondary in its aim.\u201d 386 U.S. at 645, 87 S.Ct. at 1268.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">E. <em>Traditional Work</em></p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">The Union contends, and Judge Wright\u2019s opinion concludes, that the strike against Hudik is primary because the strikers are employed by Hudik, because they are striking Hudik, and because they claim that their sole objective is to enforce Hudik\u2019s agreement to assign them their traditional work. Because they are striking their immediate employer to enforce a provision of their contract with him, this argument has a surface plausibility. But this superficial analysis of obvious facts does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the Union\u2019s refusal to work on the Slant/Fin air-conditioning units was a primary boycott of Hudik.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">As Representative Griffin pointed out during the debate on the Landrum-Grif-fin Bill, \u201c[w]e must look to the purpose of the picketing in the particular situation.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Kennedy-Thompson analysis of the Landrum-Griffin Bill also identifies the basic flaw in the above reasoning of the majority. It clearly points out the distinction between permitted primary and illegal secondary activity where employees are striking their own employer over wages, <em>i. </em>e.: \u201c[When the picket line at the employees\u2019 job site] . aims at halting commercial intercourse with [their own employer, it is] (a primary boycott) [but when the aim is] at halting intercourse with persons who have intercourse with him [it is] (a secondary boycott).\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-14\">The Union is seeking what it asserts is <em>work preservation, </em>but the means it has chosen toward that end \u2014 a strike against an employer who never had the disputed work to assign \u2014 constitutes secondary pressure. The boycott\u2019s purpose is served primarily by the pressure the Union brings to bear on Austin and Slant/Fin through its strike against Hu-dik. It is the force and direction of this pressure that determines whether the boycott is primary or secondary. The only parties who could be said to have taken the work away from the local union are Slant/Fin, who manufactured the units complete with internal piping, and Austin, who specified the installation of such completed units. The strike insofar as it is against Hudik is not to achieve work <em>preservation </em>because the strike could not <em>preserve </em>work that Hudik never possessed and never had the power to assign.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-15\">What the Union is attempting to do by its strike is to compel Hudik to acquire work its members can perform, and this goal is to be accomplished by the secondary pressure that the strike against Hudik brings to bear upon Austin and Slant/Fin: specifically, Hudik can no longer install air-conditioning units necessary for the completion of the building according to contract specifications. Unlike the strike in <em>National Woodwork, </em>this action is not a primary boycott against an immediate employer seeking to compel him to exercise discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>tion over work assignments committed to him by the general contract in a manner compatible with the operative terms of a collective bargaining agreement; instead, this is a secondary boycott against the Union\u2019s immediate employer (Hudik) seeking by the pressure such a strike brings to bear on third parties (Austin and Slant/Fin) to cause the immediate employer to <em>acquire </em>certain traditional work so he can assign it to his employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">The determination whether a boycott is secondary involves consideration not only of the objective of the strike in terms of working conditions, but also of the <em>means </em>sought to achieve that objective. As the <em>National Woodwork </em>Court noted, the \u201ccentral theme\u201d of section 8(b)(4)(B) is \u201cthe protection of neutrals against secondary pressure.\u201d 386 U.S. at 627, 87 S.Ct. at 1259. Thus the statute does not tolerate boycotts involving secondary pressures conducted to preserve traditional work,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> nor is there anything in its legislative history to support that conclusion. The object, spirit and language of the statute all coalesce in a conclusion that traditional work can be preserved only by a primary boycott and that it is unlawful to use secondary pressure to achieve an otherwise legitimate purpose. Here the pressure on Hudik was secondary and hence the strike against Hudik is proscribed by the letter and spirit of \u00a7 8(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">F. <em>The Secondary Boycott Conducted by Local No. 3 in New York City</em></p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">The majority opinion in <em>National Woodwork </em>sought to identify \u201cCongress\u2019 purpose in enacting\u201d section 8(e), a provision closely related to and enacted at the same time as section 8(b)(4)(B). The Court indicated that the answer was to be found \u201cfrom an examination of the history of congressional action on the subject.\u201d 386 U.S. at 620, 87 S.Ct. at 1255. The opinion proceeded to set out and discuss the extensive statutory history of certain applicable labor legislation. 386 U.S. at 620-24, 87 S.Ct. 1250. Next to the language of the statute itself, no better indicia of congressional intent can be found than that provided by a close examination of the complete legislative history of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-12\">This legislative history begins with the enactment in 1947 of section 8(b)(4)(A),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which was part of the Taft-Hartley Act. That Act was drafted and enacted by the 80th Congress over the President\u2019s veto following very extensive labor hearings in both the House and Senate. In the course of those hearings there were many references to secondary boycotts.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the House of Representatives, where the legislation originated, the Hartley Bill, H.R. 3020, brought secondary boycotts within its definition of \u201cillegal boycott\u201d (Sec. 2(14)).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> An illegal boycott <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>was within those \u201cunlawful concerted activities\u201d (Sec. 12(a)(3))<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> for which the union and its members were made subject to a suit for damages and to deprivation of their rights under the Act to the same extent as a person found to have engaged in an unfair labor practice (Sec. 12(b) and (d)).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">In the Senate the subject matter of section 2(14)(A) and (C) of H.R. 3020, provisions dealing with \u201cillegal boycotts,\u201d was placed in section 8(b)(4)(A), which tracked closely the language of the House bill. In the Senate the section assumed its present basic character as a prohibition against an unfair labor practice.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> But it was the House bill which first attached union demands upon employers to \u201ccease doing business\u201d with others and refusals \u201cto use, install [or] handle particular articles.\u201d The House Committee Report made it clear that in addition to employer-union activities the bill was also aimed at removing \u201cdirect restraints of trade.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-5\">Illegal boycotts take many forms. Often they are to compel employers to force their employees into unions or to give a union control over them as their bargaining agent in violation of the Labor Act itself. <em>Sometimes they are direct restraints of trade, designed to compel people against whom they are engaged in to place their business with some other than those they are dealing with at the time, or vice versa. </em>The effects of boycotts upon business, and particularly upon small commercial enterprises in metropolitan centers, such as New York, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh, have often been disastrous.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">The sentence in italics identifies an objective of the boycott we are dealing with here.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">The House accepted the statutory framework adopted by the Senate and the Senate\u2019s redraft of section 8(b)(4)(A)<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>; therefore the Senate Report<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> is informative (although not to the exclusion of the House Report) as to the congressional intent of the provision finally enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">The statements on the floor of Congress and the committee reports all make some contribution toward clarifying the legislative intent, but no single item of legislative history is any more important to the problem posed by this appeal than the following quotation with respect to section 8(b)(4)(A) from the Senate Report in 1947 on the Senate bill: This paragraph [\u00a7 8(b)(4)(A)] also</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-11\">makes it an unfair labor practice for a union to engage in the type of secondary boycott that has been conducted in New York City by local No. 3 of the IBEW, whereby electricians have <em>refused to install </em>electrical products of manufacturers employing electricians who are members of some labor organization other than local No. 3. (See testimony of R. S. Edwards, vol. 1, p. 176 et seq.; <em>Allen Bradley Co. v. Local Union No. 3, I. B. E. W., </em>325 U.S. 797, 65 S.Ct. 1533, 89 L.Ed. 1939.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-12\">S. Rep. No. 105 on S. 1126, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 22, 1 Leg.Hist. 428 (emphasis added). While the secondary boycott conducted by Local No. 3 in New York City encompassed manufacturing, distribution, installation and repair, it is significant that the Senate Report on the bill chose to mention only the installa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>tion aspect. The <em>National Woodwork </em>opinion refers to the passage above, but because it quotes only the first sentence the decision does not reveal the very clear intent that Congress indicated by its specific reference to the particular testimony of R. S. Edwards before the Senate committee on Local No. 3\u2019s secondary boycott.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> 386 U.S. at 619\u201420, 87 S.Ct. 1250. The Committee Report also cited the decision in <em>Allen Bradley Co. </em>v. <em>Local 3, IBEW, </em>325 U.S. 797, 65 S.Ct. 1533, 89 L.Ed. 1939 (1945), where the Supreme Court considered the secondary boycott activities of Local No. 3. Neither the reference to Edwards\u2019 testimony nor that to <em>Allen Bradley </em>indicates that Congress intended section 8(b)(4)(B) to be given so narrow a construction as to exclude the secondary boycott that exists here. Let us then examine the Edwards and <em>Allen Bradley </em>references as an aid in ascertaining congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">G. <em>Edwards\u2019 Senate Testimony and the Conspiracy in Allen Bradley</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">The secondary boycott conducted in New York City by Local No. 3, IBEW is best described in Edwards\u2019 testimony<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> rather than in the opinion in <em>Allen Brad</em>ley,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> since Edwards\u2019 testimony was directed to the labor law aspects of Local No. 3\u2019s activities, while the opinion in <em>Allen Bradley </em>related primarily to antitrust issues. In fact the Supreme Court decided that under the law as it existed prior to outlawing secondary boycotts, the union\u2019s conduct would have been valid if it had acted alone and not conspired with employers. Edwards testified that Local No. 3 was involved in a monopoly in New York City of the \u201ccomplete manufacture, distribution, installation and maintenance of all electrical-construction materials.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Local No. 3 was for all practical purposes the only electrical \u201cinstallation\u201d union in New York City.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It was the <em>installation </em>restrictions as enforced by the conspiracy, prohibiting local electricians in New York City from doing any work on electrical fixtures and other electrical materials <em>after </em>their manufacture, to which the product boycott prohibitions of section 8(b)(4)(A) of the Labor Act were particularly directed. The Department of Labor had received a number of complaints that Local No. 3 was \u201cdeclining to install electrical equipment unless it bears the label of that organization [i. <em>e., </em>Local No. 3].\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> \u201cEven materials manufactured by other IBEW locals outside the Greater New York district are black listed.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Prior to passage of section 8(b)(4)(A) the boycott imposed by Local No. 3 was successful in requiring that electrical fixtures or installations manufactured elsewhere be \u201cdismantled and the wire taken out of them, and then\u201d rewired on the job by the local union before they could be installed in New York City.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-12\">Thus, in its essential features, and particularly as it related to <em>installation abuses, </em>the boycott by Electricians Local No. 3 in New York City described in Edwards\u2019 testimony was very close to that which the Steamfitters\u2019 Union here brought against Hudik. Both unions refused to install manufactured articles to protect the on-site job work of their union members, and the only way their demands could be met was to allow the manufactured articles to be dismantled on site and permit the members of the local union to redo the work already done by the manufacturer, and for the future, for the employer having charge of the installation to cease doing busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>ness with the manufacturer unless it changed its manufactured articles to permit on-site workers to do some of the final assembly work. The result in the case of Local No. 3 would be the delivery to the installers of incomplete fixtures without internal wiring (or dismantling and rewiring) and with Local No. 638 (the Steamfitters) it would be the delivery of incomplete air-conditioning units without internal piping (or dismantling and repiping).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">The Senate Report clearly indicated that the \u201cwill not handle or work on\u201d provisions of section 8(b)(4)(A) were aimed at precisely the type of secondary boycott that exists here.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> And since, as <em>National Woodwork </em>states, \u201cthe basic thrust of [section 8(b)(4)(A)] was not expanded by the Landrum-Griffin [1959] amendments,\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the same interpretation is to be given to the present section 8(b)(4)(B). The addition in 1959 of the specific proviso protecting primary boycotts that were not \u201cotherwise unlawful\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> did not change the intent of the section. What the proviso did was merely make explicit that which was previously implicit. The statement that Congress intended to make secondary boycotts illegal<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> clearly implies that primary boycotts are legal.</p>\n<p id=\"AEWf\">H. <em>The Majority Opinion and Right to Control</em></p>\n<p id=\"b993-13\">Faced with the fact that the letter of the statute is clearly violated and that the ALJ and the NLRB after considering all the surrounding circumstances found a secondary boycott in violation of the Act, the majority opinion launches into an attack on the so-called right-to-eontrol test, which it asserts the Board used as the <em>sole </em>basis for its decision. In this respect the majority opinion is in error. The ALJ clearly considered all the \u201csurrounding circumstances\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and the Board affirmed his \u201crulings, findings and conclusions\u201d (J.A. 252) insofar as they were consistent with its decision and adopted his recommended Order. Since the opinion of the ALJ was consistent in almost every respect with the Board\u2019s decision, the Board indicated that it relied on all the surrounding circumstances of the boycott to the same extent as the ALJ. Thus the basic attack of the majority opinion, the claim that the Board based its decision only on the right-to-control test and failed to take into consideration all the surrounding circumstances, has no foundation in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-14\">Moreover, after devoting most of its opinion to an attack on the concept of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>right-to-control as a complete test to determine whether a boycott is primary or secondary, the majority in its closing paragraph finally comes to reality and admits that control over disputed work does have a vital place in determining the essential issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b994-4\">However, in remanding in <em>Local </em>742;<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> <em>supra, </em>and <em>Local </em>686,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> <em>supra, </em>we held that legal control in the struck employer over assignment of the work which a union professes a desire to preserve, while not alone dispositive, <em>may be considered by the Board along with other factors </em>[emphasis added] suggested by the <em>National Woodwork </em>Court in determining the union\u2019s actual objective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Majority Op., 172 U.S.App.D.C. at ---, 521 F.2d at 904-905. That is precisely the manner in which the AU and the Board did weigh and evaluate the demand of the Union and Hudik\u2019s inability to meet the work assignment demands of the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-8\">It must also be noted that since right-to-control is recognized as a part of the test to be applied in such cases, instances may well arise where the outcome of its application will prove to be the <em>decisive </em>factor. In passing the original secondary boycott restriction, the House of Representatives forecast the use of a right-to-control test when it indicated that it intended to proscribe those boycotts where \u201cthe employers are powerless to comply with the demands giving rise to the [boycotting] activities . . . .\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess. 23 (1947), I 1947 Leg. Hist. 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-14\">This comment recognizes the force and validity of a right-to-control test and the unfairness of permitting a strike against an employer who lacks the right to control the decision. Even where right-to-control is not decisive, in almost any case it will be a factor entitled to very substantial weight because it measures the ability of the employer to comply with the union demands. Law and logic compel the conclusion that the ability or inability of two individuals to comply with a demand is a very material factor in determining whether one or the other is the true object of the demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-15\">II. THE RIGHT-TO-CONTROL TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b994-16\">By 1967 seven Circuit Courts of Appeals had reviewed the right-to-control test: each circuit had validated the test without dissent.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In that year the Supreme Court in <em>National Woodwork </em>articulated the standards by which primary and secondary activity should be distinguished. The Court upheld the Board\u2019s determination that the particular work preservation clause at issue was not vio-lative of section 8(e) of the Act<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>that enforcement of the provision against a primary employer did not contravene section 8(b)(4)(B), but specifically withheld judgment on the propriety of the right-to-control test upon which the Board\u2019s conclusions in that case were founded.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Yet several circuits thereafter reversed their prior decision sanctioning the test, based upon language in <em>National Woodwork </em>which supposedly disapproved exclusive use of the test by the Board.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">On two occasions this court has announced similar decisions.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The majority now insists once more that the theoretical underpinnings of the right-to-control test were completely destroyed by <em>National Woodwork. </em>I am more inclined to accept at face value the Court\u2019s statement that the test was not under consideration in that case. I thus dispute the basic premises of the majority\u2019s opinion, and conclude that the reasoning of <em>National Woodwork </em>is compatible with the use of the right-to-control test to the extent that it was used in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">A. <em>The Surrounding Circumstances </em>The majority admonishes the Board to scrutinize the \u201crealities\u201d of the Union\u2019s dispute with Hudick-Ross, and insists that the single-minded right-to-control formula is devoid of practicality as well as theoretically bankrupt. A closer look at the findings and conclusions of the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) which the Board adopted<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> reveals that the test, as it was applied to the facts of this controversy, furnished a distinctively realistic basis for interpreting the relative positions of Enterprise and Hudik-Ross and a thoroughly practical determination of the objects of the Union\u2019s economic action.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-10\">1. <em>The Contractual Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-11\">The ALJ determined that Austin was both general contractor and engineer for construction of the Norwegian Home for the Aged. Significantly, \u201cAustin prepared the engineering job specifications for the Norwegian Home.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> By the time Austin subcontracted the heating, ventilating and air-conditioning work on the project to Hudik-Ross, it had contracted for the purchase of prepiped Slant/Fin climate control units.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-12\">In his conclusions of fact, the ALJ advanced an interpretation of the work preservation agreement between Hudik and Enterprise.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-13\">[I]n my opinion, the instant contract between Hudik and the Union, in providing that pipe would be cut and threaded on the job, necessarily implied that it referred to pipe within Hudik\u2019s control and which could be cut on the job. Neither Hudik nor the Union in their contract could prescribe nor were they prescribing the treatment of pipe that was within or had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>been within the control of some other party . . . .<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">The ALJ buttressed his interpretation of the work preservation agreement with a practical analysis of the benefit the Union hoped to derive from the provision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"amr-dedup-0\">[W]e might presume that the Union would have been happy and content if Hudik had never sought or received the Norwegian Home contract or if Hudik would breach his subcontract as soon as the Union reminded Hudik of Rule IX of the Union contract. But, if Hudik, an employer of union steamfitters, does not bid on jobs and does not secure subcontracts, how does such a situation preserve or increase work for Hudik\u2019s union steamfitters <footnotemark>48</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Implicit in this observation is a reality to which the majority gives lip service but which it fails to apprehend: Hudik could not decline to bid on projects with prefabrication specifications and continue to be a competitive subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">Regardless of the validity of the ALJ\u2019s construction of Rule IX of the collective bargaining agreement, his tacit observation that trade unions\u2019 work preservation agreements almost inevitably conflict with contractual design specifications evinces a practical understanding of the true nature of the dispute between Hu-dik and Enterprise. Underlying his decision is the determination that the fundamental responsibility for prefabrication specifications in the construction industry falls on architects, engineers, and general contractors, and that boycotts by craft unions against subcontractors necessarily have as a primary object the application of pressure to those third parties who actually require the use of factory-prepared products.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> A recital of the surrounding circumstances that the ALJ examined to arrive at this conclusion demonstrates that he was concerned less with the locus of legal or contractual hegemony over disputed work than with the source of practical or effective control over prefabrication specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-10\">2. <em>The Labor Situation in New York</em></p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">In analyzing the dispute between Enterprise and Hudik, the ALJ gave particular emphasis to three distinct points. First, Austin, in its capacity as \u201cengineer and general contractor for the entire job, had made an engineering and business judgment that the Slant/Fin units were to be used on the project . . ..\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The ALJ noted Austin\u2019s awareness that \u201cthese units were factory prepiped, tested, and guaranteed by the manufacturer,\u201d <footnotemark>51</footnotemark> apparently to suggest the factors that prompted the use of prefabricated climate control units. In discussing analogous contractual predicaments, both hypothetical and real, he pointedly identified the parties who controlled the specification of prefabricated products: in each case, an architect, engineer, or general contractor. His drift was unmistakable: pressure for the modification of prefabrication policies must focus on these principals or on the manufacturers of prefabricated goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-13\">Second, the ALJ identified the means by which pressure could be brought to bear on these responsible parties. He drew a distinction between \u201ceffective\u201d and \u201cineffective\u201d \u201cmeans or instrumen-talitpes] . . . for exerting pressure against the manufacturer of prepiped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>units or the engineer specifying their use.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> In a thoroughly unionized setting, subcontractors could influence project specifications by declining to bid on projects which denied their employees the right to perform traditional unit work. The threat or enforcement of a boycott by those employees or unions representing them would deter subcontractors from bidding on projects with such specifications, and thus similarly discourage the use of prefabricated goods. But in a nonunionized area subcontractors would clearly be ineffective instrumentalities for exerting these pressures: the sole consequence of their actions would be the hiring of nonunion labor to install prepiped units. In obei-sanee to <em>National Woodwork, </em>the ALJ noted that the distinction was meaningful only in the context of \u201call the surrounding circumstances\u201d \u2014 evidently, it was drawn to shed light on the practical purposes of work preservation boycotts.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> He concluded after his analysis of all the relevant facts that \u201cHudik [was] only a means or instrumentality for exerting pressure against Slant/Fin and Austin with whom the Union has its primary dispute . . ..\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">Third, the ALJ examined the circumstance most relevant to the instant case: the dearth of nonunion labor in New York City, site of the Norwegian project.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>[I]t is an appropriate subject of official notice that in New York City and probably in all or most of the major cities in this country, the building and construction industry is unionized, certainly with respect to major industrial, commercial, and public construction.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">The ALJ asserted that the Norwegian Home was \u201cin an area where there are no nonunion steamfitters available or no nonunion mechanical contractors; or, if either of the nonunion categories exist, neither Austin, the union general contractor and engineer, nor Hudik, the union subcontractor could or would see them.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Thus Hudik was an effective instrumentality for pressuring the \u201ctrue \u2018culprits,\u2019 and the parties with whom the Union has its dispute[:] Slant/Fin, who manufactures prepiped units, and Austin, who specified such units as the heating and cooling units for installation in the Norwegian Home.\u201d <footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Alternative union labor would not be available, for \u201cin the construction industry it is the unions that control the labor supply and if the union steamfitter employees of Hudik on the Norwegian job refuse to work, other steamfitters will not be available to Hu-dik or to anyone else to perform work on the job.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> The consequence of a Hudik boycott was clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-5\">If prepaid [prepiped] units cannot be installed in the large commercial, public, and industrial buildings in the New York area or in other areas effectively organized by the Union and other building trades unions, the manufacture^] will be materially affected and Austin and other engineers and general contractors will not specify their purchase and use in buildings.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Finally, the ALJ fit these factual parameters into the legal equation of section 8(b)(4)(B) and concluded that the Union\u2019s dispute was not with the actions of Hudik, but rather with the labor policies that Austin enforced through its specifications and with the products distributed by Slant/Fin. Because Hudik was accorded a secondary role in the conflict, the boycott by the Union violated the Act\u2019s prohibition of economic action directed toward neutral employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-11\">3. <em>The Order of the Board</em></p>\n<p id=\"b998-12\">The Labor Board affirmed \u201cthe rulings, findings, and conclusions of the Administrative Law Judge to the extent consistent\u201d with its own brief Decision and Order, and adopted his recommendation that the Union be ordered to discontinue its boycott of Hudik. The Board\u2019s principal exception to the ALJ\u2019s findings was its refusal to rule, as he had, that economic actions directed against Austin and Slant/Fin would constitute lawful primary activity. It nevertheless concurred in his determination of Hudik\u2019s neutrality. To reinforce his conclusion that Austin was the true object of the boycott, the Board noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b998-13\">the Respondent informed Austin, who did not employ employees represented by the Respondent and had no agreement with that Union, that it would not let Hudik install the climate control units involved.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b998-14\">The Board also articulated a point that was implicit in the findings of the ALJ, that the ultimate purpose of the Union\u2019s action was the preservation of work its member employees had traditionally performed. But the means adopted by the Union to achieve this goal offended the Act\u2019s proscription of secondary boycotts. \u201cSince the pressure exerted by the Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>spondent on Hudik was undertaken for its effect on other neutral employers, this pressure was secondary and prohibited by Section 8(b)(4)(B).\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">B. <em>The Significance of \u201cControl\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">The unrealistic, undimensional <em>per se </em>control test the majority discredits is a straw man. The Board does not employ a <em>per se </em>formulation, which might well violate the stricture of <em>National Woodwork </em>that the focus of a union\u2019s action must be determined from all the surrounding circumstances; instead, the Board relies on a <em>prima facie </em>standard. By this test, a union may not boycott an employer who lacks the right to control the assignment of disputed work, <em>provided </em>that the employer has not voluntarily relinquished that control.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The redeeming feature of this criterion is that it permits and even mandates the conclusion that the union acted properly in launching an economic action whenever \u201cthe employer\u2019s loss of power to assign the work is the result of his own efforts to instigate the subcontracting to another of work subject to his work preservation agreement with the union\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> \u2014 in the majority\u2019s parlance, whenever he \u201cbinds his own hands.\u201d In such a case the employer would cease to be neutral, and would be termed \u201coffending\u201d by virtue of his voluntary action surrendering legal control of the disputed work.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-16\">The situation which the Board contemplates would shift responsibility for the dispute to the employer is precisely that of <em>National Woodwork. </em>Discretion in the specification of prefitted doors rested with Frouge, the general contractor.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> His unilateral decision to use premachined rather than \u201cblank\u201d doors prompted the Union\u2019s boycott. By contrast, here the specification of prepiped climate control units was fixed by a provision of the contract on which Hudik bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-17\">That the factual differences between <em>National Woodwork </em>and this case are sufficient to justify the legal distinction the Board urges is suggested by the AU\u2019s conclusion that Hudik\u2019s alternatives were either to bid on the Norwegian Home contract in spite of the contractual conflict or to have insufficient work for its employees.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The Board had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>expert knowledge of the competing forces within the construction industry\u2014 perhaps the exclusive domain of the complex and contradictory subcontracting practices we consider here.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The wiser course is to recognize and respect the distinction the Board observes between \u201coffending\u201d employers \u2014 most commonly, engineers and general contractors \u2014 who actively and by choice assign traditional unit work in derogation of work preservation agreements, and \u201cunoffending\u201d subcontractors who enter into contracts with prefabrication specifications rather than pursue the economically disastrous course of declining to bid on such contracts.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The legal consequence of this distinction is the classification of subcontractors like Hudik who enter contracts with specifications contrary to their work preservation agreements as neutral employers. The majority rejects as inherently sophistical the notion that such employers can ever be termed neutral; in their eyes Hudik, for example, has actively violated an understanding for which the Union bargained collectively, and the Union\u2019s dispute is clearly with Hudik.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> But the Labor Board takes a more refined and realistic view of the situation. The Board insists that the Union\u2019s true complaint is with the predilection of architects, engineers and general contractors for factory-designed and -assembled goods. The Board need not consider the encroachment of modern technology, the relative advantages and disadvantages of prefabricated products, or the economic arguments which the <em>National Woodwork </em>Court ignored<footnotemark>70</footnotemark>; it simply recognizes as one factor influencing its decision that the policy of using prefabricated goods, and the power to compel their use, belong to the general contractor and not to the subcontractor.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Thus the Union\u2019s dispute cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>logically be solely with the subcontractor, but must instead be also with the party who dictates that prefabricated products shall be employed: the owner, the designer, the general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">The right-to-control test would clearly be less palatable if \u201ccontrol\u201d signified only immediate legal dominion or contractual power, as the majority suggests.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The term includes these factors, but in addition it denotes an employer\u2019s ability to effect changes in or exert influence upon the construction policies of those parties who specify the use of prefabricated products.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> To this end the ALJ scrutinized not just the provisions of Hudik\u2019s contracts with Austin and Enterprise, but more importantly Hudik\u2019s practical ability to satisfy Rule IX of its collective bargaining agreement by inducing or persuading Austin to allow jobsite piping of climate control units. The ALJ concluded that Hudik, though an effective instrumentality of pressure against Austin and other New York City engineers if it refrained from bidding, could exert little influence on the use of Slant/Fin products if it participated in construction of the Norwegian Home. As a typical craft subcontractor, Hudik lacked effective control over Austin\u2019s use of prepiped units.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>C. <em>The Object of the Union\u2019s Boycott</em></p>\n<p id=\"aie-dedup-1\">I recognize, as have both the majority and the ALJ, that as a class, as an intermediate echelon in the construction industry, subcontractors like Hudik do exert considerable influence over the use of prefabricated materials in construction projects. In footnote 25 the majority cites the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[i]f prepaid [sic] units cannot be installed * * Austin and other engineers and general contractors will not specify their purchase and use in buildings.\u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> For the majority this pressure has an apparently salutary consequence: work preservation clauses \u201csubserve its [Union\u2019s] legitimate end of ensuring that its members [can] continue to perform in the future the work they [have] traditionally performed in the past.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> But by acknowledging that those work preservation boycotts against subcontractors have as their primary purpose \u2014 indeed, their only logical purpose<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> \u2014 the bringing to bear of pressure against engineers and general contractors responsible for prefabrication specifications, the majority undercuts the analytical framework of its opinion. The majority concedes the effective neutrality of subcontractors like Hudik by admitting that the primary goal of work preservation boycotts against subcontractors is the effectuation of a change in design specifications for construction projects.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-11\">Clearly section 8(b)(4)(B) represents a compromise, an accommodation between the \u201cdual congressional objectives of preserving the right of labor organizations to bring pressure to bear on offending employers in primary labor disputes and of shielding unoffending employers and others from pressures in controversies not their own.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The majority would emphasize the Union interest in this balance, but explicit statutory language delimits the union\u2019s right to exert economic pressure at that point where <em>an object </em>of the action is forcing secondary employers to modify their labor policies and practices. The Supreme Court announced in <em>Denver </em>Trades<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> that \u201c[i]t is not necessary to find that the <em>sole </em>object of the strike [is] that of forcing the contractor to terminate the subcontractor\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>tract.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> This court has also embraced the view that a violation of section 8(b)(4) is established if <em>\u201can </em>objective of the union\u2019s secondary action, although <em>not necessarily the only objective, </em>is to force the secondary employer to cease doing business with the primary employer.\u201d <footnotemark>82</footnotemark> And the <em>National Woodwork </em>decision has not altered the balance between permissible primary and prohibited secondary activity. Thus the fact that Enterprise had as one object of its boycott the enforcement of its legitimate work preservation agreement with Hu-dik does not exculpate the union of 8(b)(4) charges if another object of the action was the application of pressure to Austin to prevent the use of prepiped Slant/Fin units.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">The majority skirts the effect of the inclusive language of section 8(b)(4)(B) by insisting that the provision cannot in all reason be construed to preclude enforcement of a valid collective bargaining agreement. But we have been cautioned not to expand the Union\u2019s right to strike beyond the limits prescribed by the Act. The principle that \u201ca violation of the secondary boycott provisions cannot be justified by a contractual arrangement between the union and the neutral employer\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> dates to the Supreme Court\u2019s 1958 <em>Sand Door </em>decision.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> There the Court recognized that a union might be left with a valid contractual provision and with no means of enforcing it other than in a civil suit.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> The majority position is largely premised on the legitimacy of the Union\u2019s work preservation goal,<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> but this court has given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>unequivocal support to the almost tautological view that legitimate ends may not be pursued by unlawful means.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Where the valid goal of compelling compliance with a contractual provision combines with the unlawful object of pressuring neutral or secondary employers to achieve that goal, the statute will not permit a union to engage in economic action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Analysis of the object of economic action taken to enforce a contractual provision would be strained if the purpose of the provision itself were not considered. The <em>National Woodwork </em>Court noted that union economic activity enforcing contractual provisions was prohibited where <em>\u201cthe agreements and boycott </em>were tactically calculated to satisfy union objectives elsewhere.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> The Court\u2019s awareness that admittedly valid contractual clauses may have secondary objects and that their enforcement may offend the Act\u2019s ban on secondary pressures recalls an observation of the <em>Sand Door </em>Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-5\">The realities of coercion are not altered simply because it is said that the employer is forced to carry out a prior engagement rather than forced now to cease doing business with another. A more important consideration, and one <em>peculiarly within the cognizance of the Board </em>... is the possibility that the contractual provision itself may well not have been the result of choice on the employer\u2019s part free from the kind of coercion Congress has condemned. [T]o allow the union to invoke the provision to justify conduct that in the absence of such a provision would be a violation of the statute might give it the means to transmit to the moment of boycott, through the contract, the very pressures from which Congress has determined to relieve secondary employers.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">Partly in response to <em>Sand Door</em><footnotemark><em>91</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Congress enacted section 8(e) to prohibit even the execution of \u201chot cargo\u201d clauses.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> The <em>proviso </em>permitting \u201chot cargo\u201d agreements for jobsite construction work, included \u201cbecause of the close community of interests there,\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> was intended to reduce periodic strikes and boycotts occasioned by the peculiar circumstances of the construction industry.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Thus, although Congress and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>the Court have sanctioned particularly restrictive clauses in the context of job-site construction work since the <em>Sand Door </em>decision, the Court is no less suspicious of clauses negotiated and enforced to serve secondary purposes, simply because they appear in construction contracts. Here the Board, with its unique perspective on labor practices and pressures, has considered the relative individual and institutional strengths of the contracting parties, the practical purposes of work preservation clauses, and the realistic effect of the Union\u2019s economic action. After consideration of all these factors the Board has determined that Enterprise\u2019s enforcement of its work preservation clause against Hudik has a substantial secondary object and secondary effects of impermissible magnitude, and has concluded that the Union\u2019s boycott violates section 8(b)(4)(B). The means by which the Board reached this result satisfy the requirements of the statute and the case law, including <em>National Woodwork: </em>the <em>prima facie </em>right-to-eontrol test rests on the Board\u2019s considered judgment that a subcontractor\u2019s inability to affect or avoid prefabrication specifications in general contracts renders him an inappropriate and impermissible target of union economic activity. The majority has not shown an adequate basis for upsetting that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">D. <em>The Union\u2019s Alternative Remedies</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">The majority disapproves the Board\u2019s result as well as its analysis, suggesting that the NLRB is not empowered to define the arsenal of economic weapons each party to a labor dispute may use.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> This challenge is more plausible, for it is the basis on which the <em>National Woodwork </em>Court indicated it would have considered the test, had the issue been presented in that case.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> But since the Board\u2019s decision rests on its interpretation of section 8(b)(4) and not on an equitable attempt to fashion bargaining parity, its result satisfies the guidelines set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>NLRB v. Insurance Agents\u2019 International Union.</em><footnotemark><em>97</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">In <em>Insurance Agents </em>the Court rejected a distinction which the Board essayed, between the traditional \u201ctotal strike\u201d and concerted on-the-job harassment. The Board had concluded that the latter variety of economic action constituted a refusal to bargain collectively in violation of section 8(b)(3); the Court could find no basis for the Board\u2019s ruling within that statutory provision. Neither did the Act permit the Board\u2019s conclusion that the union\u2019s tactics \u2014 demonstrations, leafletting, and refusal to cooperate with company rules and policies \u2014 were beyond \u2019 the protection of sections 7 and 8(a)(1) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>the statute. Because of the \u201clack of relationship to the statutory standard inherent in\u201d the Board\u2019s distinctions, the Court rejected them. Significantly, the Court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axt\">when the Board moves in this area, <em>with only \u00a7 8(b)(3) for support, </em>it is functioning as an arbiter of the sort of economic weapons the parties can use in seeking to gain acceptance of their bargaining demands.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">The right-to-control test has a legal as well as a factual component. The standard is predicated on the Board\u2019s determination that subcontractors who lack influence over project specifications cannot realistically be the targets of craft unions\u2019 work preservation boycotts and that union pressure in such instances is more logically considered to be aimed at general contractors and engineers who require the use of prefabricated products. When the Board examines the facts surrounding a particular work preservation dispute and concludes that the true object of the union\u2019s action is to' force a change in the project designs of engineers and general contractors, it denies the union\u2019s right to enforce the work preservation clause in contravention of section 8(b)(4)(B). Clearly this scheme bears a close relation to the statutory standards of the National Labor Relations Act, for by factual determinations and legal conclusions well within its province the Board identifies and prohibits economic actions with secondary objects. This role is readily distinguishable from the one the Board assumed in <em>Insurance Agents, </em>where the line drawn between various species of concerted activity was not founded on specific statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">Moreover, the notion that certain types of contractual provisions might be enforceable by lawsuit but not by economic action did not perish with the <em>Sand Door </em>holding when Congress enacted section 8(e). In a remarkably lucid and unequivocal passage of legislative history the Conference Committee which submitted section 8(e) to the Congress announced that construction subcontracting agreements authorized by the <em>proviso </em>to section 8(e) should not be enforceable by strike or boycott:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1006-9\">The committee of conference does not' intend that this proviso should be construed so as to change the present state of the law with respect to the validity of this specific type of agreement relating to work to be done at the site of the construction project or to remove the\" limitations which the present law imposes with respect to such agreements. Picketing to enforce such contracts would be illegal under the Sand <em>Door </em>case <em>(Local 1796, United Brotherhood of Carpenters v. NLRB </em>[357 U.S. 93, 78 S.Ct. 1011, 2 L.Ed.2d 1186] (1958)). To the extent that such agreements are legal today under section 8(b)(4) of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, the proviso would .prevent such legality from being affected by section 8(e). The proviso applies only to section 8(e) and therefore leaves unaffected the law developed under section 8(b)(4). The <em>Denver Building Trades </em>case and the <em>Moore Drydock </em>cases would remain in full force and effect. The proviso is not intended to limit, change, or modify the present state of the law with respect to picketing at the site of a construction project.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">In <em>Orange Belt District Council of Painters, No. 48 v. NLRB,</em><footnotemark><em>100</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this court reasserted the <em>Sand Door </em>principle that economic actions enforcing certain valid contractual terms would violate section 8(b)(4). Speaking with reference to \u201cunion signatory\u201d provisions, Judge Wright asserted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>[secondary subcontracting clauses in the construction industry are lawful, under the <em>proviso </em>to Section 8(e), and economic force may be used to obtain them notwithstanding Section 8(b)(4)(A) . . . . But under Section 8(b)(4)(B) such secondary clauses may be enforced only through lawsuits, and not through economic action.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">The <em>National Woodwork </em>holding did not undermine this proposition; rather the Court determined that primary work preservation agreements properly enforceable under section 8(b)(4) were not prohibited by section 8(e).<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> This determination did not preclude the conclusion, reached by the Fourth Circuit in <em>George Koch,</em><footnotemark><em>103</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that work preservation agreements whose enforcement would be proscribed by section 8(b)(4) might nevertheless be valid under section 8(e), for the simple reason that a subcontractor\u2019s inability to cease using prefabricated products \u2014 his \u201clack of control over disputed work\u201d \u2014 defeats a finding of \u201csecondary pressures\u201d <footnotemark>104</footnotemark> absent enforcement of the clause. This case presents that precise situation: the work preservation agreement between Hudik and Enterprise does not constitute a forbidden \u201cagreement . . . whereby [the] employer . . . agrees to cease or refrain from handling . . . any of the products of any other employer .,\u201d according to the precept of <em>National Woodwork, </em>yet the Union cannot reasonably strike to enforce the provision without exerting secondary pressures prohibited by section 8(b)(4). The majority cites to Justice Stewart\u2019s dissenting view concerning the illogic of this position, but fails to recognize both the thrust of his argument<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>fact that the Court\u2019s opinion in <em>National Woodwork </em>did in fact allow the possibility that section 8(b)(4) sweeps wider than section 8(e).<footnotemark>106</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">The majority opinion conveys a sense that a work preservation clause would be valueless if it were not enforceable by economic action, and argues that surely the Union did not bargain for a nugatory contractual right. But the ALJ has suggested the function of such clauses: they insure that an employer who in fact has an opportunity to assign work traditionally performed by members of the union representing his employees will not voluntarily order prefabricated goods in derogation of the contract term. In fact the work preservation clause may be given greater impact. If the agreement is interpreted to apply to work beyond the control of the subcontractor at the time he signs the subcontract, he might agree to pay to the union in a contract suit the value of traditional work he cannot assign to his employees. Contrary to the majority\u2019s view that the burden of offering this compensation rests on the employer, the union should pursue an appropriate adjustment, re-, sorting to judicial enforcement when necessary. Neither the Supreme Court in <em>Sand Door </em>nor the Congress that enacted section 8(e) found the concept of enforcement by lawsuit to be disrespectful of employee or union interests. Without speculating over the wisdom\u2014 or necessity \u2014 of such contractual arrangements, we may note that employers gain considerable bidding flexibility by them, and that they promote resolution of work preservation disputes by an orderly legal process. By endorsing this scheme the Board does not \u201cbail out\u201d delinquent employers, but rather serves the legitimate end of contractually appointed work preservation without unnecessary and unlawful economic dislocations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-9\">E. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1008-10\">Reduced to its essentials, this case questions the power of the Board (1) to decide that certain kinds of valid contractual provisions cannot be enforced by economic action without prohibited secondary effects and objects, and (2) to draw the line between permissible primary and unlawful secondary activity at the point where subcontractors employing members of particular craft unions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>lose meaningful control over conflicts between contracts and collective bargaining agreements. Though they did not address the problem in these precise terms, the circuits which considered the right-to-control test prior to <em>National Woodwork </em>upheld without dissent the Board\u2019s right to treat control over the assignment of disputed work as the discriminant of primary status.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\"><em>National Woodwork </em>is an inadequate justification for completely abandoning the logic of these earlier rulings. The decision constitutes a \u201cdelineation of that degree of proof which establishes a permissible primary boycott but falls short of evidencing the interdicted secondary boycott.\u201d<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> It asserts that a boycott tactically calculated to satisfy objectives elsewhere is prohibited secondary activity.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> Thus a Board ruling that under all the surrounding circumstances Enterprise could only have sought to influence the labor policies of Austin, the general contractor, and Slant/Fin, the manufacturer, would seem to satisfy <em>National Woodwork\u2019s </em>definition of a section 8(b)(4) violation. Yet the majority balks at the Board\u2019s decision, in part because of its analysis ignores the ALJ\u2019s thorough discussion of relevant subcontracting practices in the New York City construction industry, and in part because it cannot allow a violation of a collective bargaining agreement to go unremedied by economic action. There may be some question whether Rule IX was in fact violated; there is little doubt that a strike to enforce the Union\u2019s literal construction of its terms has as its only logical purpose the exertion of pressure on Austin and other engineers and general contractors who specify the use of prefabricated products.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">The majority is not compelled to consider the fact that the result it reaches strips subcontractors of opportunities to bid on projects with prefabrication specifications, divests designers and architects of meaningful control over the details of their projects, and simultaneously increases the costs of construction projects suited to pre-prepared components. But it should not fail to recognize that the boycott it sanctions is both a \u201csword\u201d and a \u201cshield,\u201d <footnotemark>109</footnotemark> that Hudik is simultaneously a vehicle for exerting pressure on Austin, the party responsible for the use of prepiped climate control units, and a buffer, whose contractual obligation insulates Enterprise from legal responsibility for its secondary activity. Because I read <em>National Woodwork </em>to prohibit \u201coffensive\u201d economic actions serving secondary goals, and because to deny that Austin is the true object of the Union\u2019s boycott would be disingenuous, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b982-9\">. <em>National Woodwork Manufacturers Ass\u2019n v.

Enforcing a union contract with Hudik to prevent Hudik\u2019s installing prepiped units that were neither manufactured nor specified by Hudik is simply a use of Hu-dik as an instrumentality or means of exerting pressure against Slant/Fin and Austin. The Union\u2019s real problem and dispute is with the manufacturer of prepiped units and the engineer who specifies that such units are to be used. That Hudik is only a means or instrumentality for exerting pressure against Slant/Fin and Austin with whom the Union has its primary dispute, will appear if we consider two possible situations.</p>\n<p id=\"AZCC\">\u201cExample A is where Hudik or similar union subcontractor is invited to bid on a job where prepiped units are to be installed. The Union reminds Hudik of the terms of the union contract requiring on the job piping. Hudik therefore does not bid and does not get the job, or if he does bid and obtains the subcontract, his union employees refuse to install the prepiped units. The construction site, however, in Example A, is in an area where the engineer and general contractor are then able and willing to secure a non-union subcontractor or a subcontractor employing members of a union who are not adverse to installing prepiped units. The job is therefore completed without Hudik and his employees. Assume that this pattern is repeated on other jobs in the area and with the same results. It is clear therefore that in Example A, the Union\u2019s problem and dispute is not with Hudik since Hudik, despite voluntary or involuntary compliance with the union contract, is an ineffective means or instrumentality \u2018under all the surrounding circumstances\u2019 for exerting pressure against the manufacturer of prepiped units or the engineer specifying their use. The Union\u2019s problem or dispute is with the last two mentioned parties, not with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>Hudik. Union enforcement of the Union-Hu-dik contract in Example A does not preserve work for the Union but serves to deprive Hu-dik and its employees of work. The Union does not exist as an organization whose purpose is to deprive its members of work. It is apparent that the Union\u2019s dispute is not with Hudik but that it is with the manufacturer and the party specifying prepiped units.</p>\n<p id=\"A1de\">\u201cExample B is of course the instant case. The sole difference between A and B is that in the instant case, B, Hudik is an effective means or instrumentality for exerting the economic pressure of the Union against Slant/Fin, the manufacturer, and Austin, the engineer. In Example A Hudik was an ineffective means or instrumentality against the manufacturer and the engineer. The reason for the difference between being an effective or ineffective instrumentality for pressure in the two examples is revealed by considering all the surrounding circumstances. In the instant case, the matter occurs in New York City, where the construction site is in an area where there are no nonunion steamfitters available or no nonunion mechanical contractors; or, if either of the nonunion categories exist, neither Austin, the union general contractor and engineer, nor Hudik, the union subcontractor could or would see them. That is the reason why the union steamfitters, employees of Hudik, by refusing to install Slant/Fin [units] specified by Austin, are able to use Hudik as an effective means or instrumentality for exerting pressure against Slant/Fin and Austin. The true \u2018culprits\u2019 and the parties with whom the Union has its dispute are Slant/Fin, who manufactures prepiped units, and Austin, who specified such units as the heating and cooling units for installation in the Norwegian Home. If prepaid units cannot be installed in the large commercial, public, and industrial buildings in the New York area or in other areas effectively organized by the Union and other building trades union, the manufacture[r] will be materially affected and Austin and other engineers and general contractors will not specify their purchase and use in buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"auy-dedup-0\">\u201cBut the fact that in Example A, above, Hu-dik would be an ineffective means of pressure by the Union against Slant/Fin and Austin, and, in Example B, the instant case, Hudik is an effective means of pressure in view of all the surrounding circumstances, does not alter the fact that in both situations, Hudik is a means or instrumentality and that the Union\u2019s primary dispute is with Slant/Fin and Austin.\u201d [Footnotes omitted.]</p>\n<p id=\"axu-dedup-0\">J.A. 238^0.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b986-15\">. 386 U.S. at 644, 87 S.Ct. 1250. <em>See generally </em>Part II of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b986-16\">. The Board\u2019s opinion stated, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b986-17\">We agree with the Administrative Law Judge that the Respondent thereby violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>Section 8(b)(4)(i) and (ii)(B) of the Act. We note that the refusal of the Respondent to let Hudik\u2019s employees install the climate control units was based on a valid work preservation clause in the agreement with Hudik, the subcontractor, and was for the purpose of preserving work they had traditionally performed. However, Hudik was incapable of assigning its employees this work; such work was never Hudik\u2019s to assign in the first place. Moreover, we note that the Respondent informed Austin, who did not employ employees represented by the Respondent and had no agreement with that Union, that it would not let Hudik install the climate control units involved. Considered together, these facts clearly indicate that the Respondent was exerting prohibited pressure on Hudik with an object of either forcing a change in Austin\u2019s manner of doing business or forcing Hudik to terminate its subcontract with Austin. Since the pressure exerted by the Respondent on Hudik was undertaken for its effect on other neutral employers, this pressure was secondary and prohibited by Section 8(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"aqv-dedup-0\">Accordingly, we find that by its conduct the Respondent violated Section 8(b)(4)(i) and (ii)(B) of the Act.

The spirit of the Act is to be found in a combination of (1) the statutory language, (2) the committee proceedings and reports, and (3) the congressional debates. There is no question about the statutory language \u2014 it clearly prohibits product boycotts directed to interference in handling or working on articles such as we have here, where the Union seeks to accomplish its objective through secondary pressures. As for the congressional proceedings, <em>National Woodwork </em>notes, 386 U.S. at 624, 87 S.Ct. at 1257, and nn. 12, 13, that Senator Taft and others \u201cfrequently [stated] that \u00a7 8(b)(4)(A) was designed to eliminate the \u2018secondary boycott.\u2019 \u201d The Senate Committee Report reiterated this intent.

A panel of this court composed of Judges Bast\u00edan, Burger (now Chief Justice), and Wright held it was a violation of section 8(b)(4)(B) for a union to strike its immediate employer in an attempt to enforce a provision of its collective bargaining agreement which prohibited the employer from contracting for work where plumbing was \u201cwithheld from the plumbing contract by either the owner or general contractor for the purpose of being installed by other than journeymen plumbers. . . \u201d In that case the union contractor (a plumbing subcontractor) had contracted for the inside plumbing and another contractor who employed members of the Laborers\u2019 Union had received the contract for the outside utilities.

The significance of the distinction between \u201ceffective\u201d and \u201cineffective\u201d means of exerting pressure escapes the majority, which can only conclude that it is \u201cabsolutely <em>irrelevant\u201d </em>to the issue of Hudik\u2019s neutrality. Majority Op., 172 U.S.App.D.C. at-, 521 F.2d at 892 n.9. But it is inaccurate to ascribe this view to the ALJ. He drew the dichotomy to demonstrate in bold relief the purpose of the Union\u2019s action, the bringing to bear of pressure on those parties who specified the use of prefabricated products, and thus to highlight Hudik\u2019s incidental role in the controversy. The statute requires proof that <em>an object </em>of an economic action be proved to be secondary, and so the ALJ turned to the most important single \u201csurrounding circumstance,\u201d the balance of power in the New York construction industry, to find an absence of nonunion labor in that area, bolstering his belief that the Union\u2019s purpose was to influence the policies of Austin and Slant/Fin. A contrary finding that ample nonunion replacement labor rendered Hudik an ineffective means or instrumentality for pressuring parties to the Norwegian Home contract would have undermined his theory, for the motive and expectation he imputed to the Union would in that case have been unreasonable. His announcement that \u201cin both situations\u201d Hudik was just a \u201cmeans or instrumentality\u201d signalled that in either event Hudik was not the object of the Union\u2019s action, while the effective/ineffective distinction went to the validity of the conclusion that Austin and Slant/Fin were in fact such objects.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-8\">I sympathize with the majority\u2019s hesitancy concerning the use of the word \u201cneutral,\u201d and concede that Hudik is not neutral in the sense that it is uninvolved with, or unaffected by, the instant dispute. The source of Hudik\u2019s legal neutrality is the fact that the Union in these circumstances cannot <em>rationally </em>boycott Hudik to secure the right to perform internal piping on the heating and cooling units, without intending to pressure Austin and Slant/Fin, since only Austin and Slant/Fin are capable of acceding to the Union\u2019s demands. Thus Hudik is neutral with respect to the particular remedy of economic action which the Union invoked to redress its grievances. This line of reasoning does not confuse \u201cobjects\u201d and \u201ceffects\u201d of economic actions, as the majority fears, see Majority Op., 172 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 521 F.2d at 900 n.36. Where secondary consequences are essential to the success of a strike, and are in fact the reason for its existence, the strike has a secondary object. <em>Cf. </em>note 78 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b997-14\">.

This aspect of the ALJ\u2019s findings is an effective response to the argument that the Board may not generalize concerning the relative bargaining positions of sub- and general contractors, but must consider the surrounding circumstances of each individual labor dispute. While the ALJ relies \u2014 and must rely \u2014 in part on experience in assessing the ability of Hudik to influence Austin\u2019s prefabrication specifications, he examines the factors which might rebut his presumption that subcontractors cannot directly influence the decision of an engineer or general contractor to use prefabricated products. Contrary to the majority\u2019s insistence that it is virtually impossible to prove the absence of an imputed secondary objective, Majority Op., 172 U.S.App.D.C. at-, 521 F.2d at 890 n.9, the Board\u2019s review of circumstances determining the degree of a subcontractor\u2019s control may indicate an unequivocally primary purpose. Here, if unions did not control the labor supply in the New York construction industry, J.A. 239 n.10, or if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>Hudik were deemed an ineffective instrumentality of pressure on Austin, the analysis by the ALJ might well have yielded a contrary conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b998-8\">.

The majority argues that \"for all relevant analytical purposes the situation of the employers [in this case and in <em>National Wood</em>work] is identical.\u201d Majority Op., 172 U.S.App.D.C. at-, 521 F.2d at 896 n.25. One of the parallels drawn to support this contention is the claim that in both cases \u201cthe employer could comply with the union\u2019s demands <em>before </em>breaking the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We deem it a relevant analytical distinction that in <em>National Woodwork, </em>Frouge, the general contractor and the target of the strike at issue, was able to comply with the union\u2019s demands and simultaneously continue work on the project, while Hudik could comply only by declining to bid for Austin\u2019s subcontract or for that of any other general contractor intent on utilizing prefabricated goods. The realism of this approach lies in its recognition that an employer who simply bids on a contract with specifications which conflict with his own work preservation agreement is not truly \u201coffending\u201d: the economics and practicalities of his occupation leave him little choice. In these circumstances he is a neutral caught between the union on one side and the general contractor and manufacturer on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"aka-dedup-0\">The majority suggests as another alternative that Hudik and other subcontractors similarly situated should by prior arrangement offer their employees compensation for traditional work which cannot be performed at jobsite. The short answer to this proposal is that it is not necessary: if the work preservation agreement at issue is construed to reserve to the union all traditional work and not simply that over which the employer has control, then a contractual right to damages enforceable by lawsuit may have accrued to the union. Adjustment by prior arrangement is a desirable solution, but where by ignorance or design an employer enters a contract which denies him the right to preserve traditional work for his employees, judicial enforcement is an established remedy clearly preferable to economic action which violates \u00a7 8(b)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">.

Mindful of the Court\u2019s pronouncement, I do not argue that the law should be tailored to suit protean economic conditions, but only that the structure, customs and economics of a particular trade or industry may help to define the purpose of actions taken by parties to a labor dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"71\">\n<p id=\"b1000-14\">. The majority ignores a critical point which validates the Board\u2019s approach: the Board is looking not only at the locus of legal control over disputed work at the time charges are filed, nor only at the predicament of a particular employer and employee, but instead at the locus of power over design specifications in the construction industry in the New York area. Recognizing that the subcontractors who employ members of traditional craft unions lack meaningful input into decisions concerning project specifications, the Board refuses to penalize them for conflicts beyond their control, but does not hesitate to affix responsibility when they voluntarily reassign work which is subject to work preservation agreements. <em>See </em>cases cited at note 68 <em>supra. </em>The ALJ\u2019s construction of Rule IX of Hudik\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with Enterprise to apply only to work which Hudik had discretion to preserve is consonant with this approach. Absent his overview of subcontracting practices in the construction industry, the ALJ could not accurately ascertain an employer\u2019s ability to accede to union demands; with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>out this determination, his identification of the focus and purpose of the union\u2019s economic action would be more difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"aet-dedup-0\">To hold that the Board cannot generalize from its examination of particular factual situations, that it cannot adopt a rule based on the structure and custom of construction subcontracting, is to reject the benefits of administrative experience and expertise. Like the Supreme Court in <em>National Woodwork, we </em>are confronted with voluminous briefs of <em>amici </em>submitted to demonstrate that prefabrication specifications are both ubiquitous and essential \u2014 economically and functionally \u2014 to the construction of modern buildings. While it is intuitively evident that the meticulous requirements of specialized projects may at times compel the use of prefitted, prefabricated or factory-installed equipment, we cannot extrapolate from the data the <em>amici </em>submit any legal or factual principle concerning work preservation boycotts. But we may note that the Board\u2019s conclusion that general contractors and not subcontractors tend to exercise control over the specification of prefabricated products is not without record support. <em>See, e. g., </em>cases cited at note 68 <em>supra. </em>And this conclusion inevitably influences the Board\u2019s decision as to whose labor policies a boycotting union is attempting to change. <em>Cf. </em>note 55 and accompanying text <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"72\">\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>Majority Op., 172 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 521 F.2d at 890 n.9. The majority depicts this opinion as a \u201csmorgasbord,\u201d which it attempts to separate into three \u201cpossible explanations\u201d of the Board\u2019s action. Instead what is offered, \u00e1 la carte, is a solitary thesis: that the ALJ, in conformity with the <em>National Woodwork </em>mandate, applied to the circumstances of this dispute a <em>prima facie </em>right-to-control test, whereby an illegal secondary objective would be imputed to the Union if an examination of the surrounding circumstances revealed that the boycott was directed at a subcontractor who from the start lacked <em>legal and practical </em>control over the assignment of the disputed work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"73\">\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">. Discussing the significance of economic interrelationship between the parties to a construction project, a panel of this court noted that \u201cthe factors on which the independent contractor finding rests demonstrate that one party does not exercise control over the other in significant respects.\u201d <em>Carpet Layers Local 419 V. NLRB, </em>151 U.S.App.D.C. 338, 345, 467 F.2d 392, 399 (1972). In that case the inability of one contractor to control another was deemed relevant to the determination of secondary status for the purposes of section 8(b)(4). This broader sense of the term \u201ccontrol\u201d is the usage and intendment of the Board in its right-to-control formulation, rather than the concept of immediate legal control which the majority assails.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"74\">\n<p id=\"b1001-13\">. The majority in its footnote 25 states that on remand the Board can examine the contractual relations of the parties to determine \u201cnot only the situation the pressured employer finds himself in but also how he came to be in that situation.\u201d This inquiry is one of the surrounding circumstances the Board is urged to consider in assessing innocence, neutrality, and primary status. The majority fails to recognize that the Board has already made precisely such a judgment, that it has determined, contrary to the views of the majority, that to deny subcontractors like Hudik the right to bid where such conflicts exist does in fact \u201cunduly [tie] an employer\u2019s hands concerning managerial discretion.\u201d The Board has concluded that the subcontractor\u2019s hands are tied long before he bids on a general contract with provisions contrary to his work preservation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"ax7-dedup-0\">Significantly, if the only impediment to Hu-dik\u2019s ability to preserve work for its employees had been a contractual term, the ALJ\u2019s exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>nation of the factual context of the labor dispute and his identification of the parties responsible for prefabrication specifications might nevertheless have led him to conclude that the Union was engaged in a primary boycott. If, for example, Austin\u2019s plans allowed Hudik the option of jobsite piping, any attempt to establish a dummy subcontracting scheme to absolve Hudik of responsibility for prefabrication specifications and to immunize it from boycotts would be frustrated at the outset by the Board\u2019s analysis. This legal fiction would not negate Hudik\u2019s practical ability to accede to its employees\u2019 bargaining demands and to meet the requirements of its collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"75\">\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">.

The majority notes the facial validity of the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Hudik cannot preserve work by failing to bid on jobs and secure contracts, but explains that work preservation clauses are in fact efficacious when enforced in concert, since engineers and general contractors will ultimately be forced to eschew prefabrication specifications in order to secure bids from subcontractors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"78\">\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">. A fine distinction may exist between the secondary <em>objects </em>which the statute proscribes and secondary <em>effects </em>of primary action, which the case law tolerates. <em>See, e. g., NLRB v. Local 825, Operating Engineers, </em>400 U.S. 297, 304-05, 91 S.Ct. 402, 27 L.Ed.2d 398 (1971); <em>Steelworkers (Carrier) v.

Because the ALJ and the majority both recognize that Enterprise\u2019s enforcement of its work preservation agreement against Hudik makes sense only if concomitant pressures are exerted on Austin, I have no difficulty concluding that those pressures are an object and not just an ancillary consequence of the Union\u2019s action. <em>Cf.

The standard employed by the majority is even more monolithic and unrealistic than the majority\u2019s characterization of the Board\u2019s right-to-control test. For the majority the sole determinant of employer liability to economic action is the existence of a work preservation agreement. This assumption suggests that by acquiring pacts, agreements and contractual provisions, explicit or implicit, which guarantee work to the union, the union is able to immunize itself from liability for economic actions. The equation is, contractual provision plus violation equals legitimate strike. But a realistic appraisal of the construction industry defies this simplistic analysis. Work preservation agreements for crafts are ubiquitous; if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>each can be enforced by economic action, regardless of secondary effects, product boycotts will be validated wholesale and unions will effectively dictate both which projects their employers can undertake and what the details and specifications of the projects will be. Thus to look solely to the existence of a work preservation agreement or understanding, without examining the particulars of its creation and reasonable scope, is to adhere to a unitary and impractical standard in the manner which the majority explicitly disapproves. At the least, the Board\u2019s formula is the product of and reflects intimate familiarity with the vertical organization of craft unions, the forces prompting their proliferation, and the complex matrix of hot cargo, union signatory and work preservation clauses surrounding construction projects, a web commonly weaved to lend all strikes and boycotts the dignity of primary action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"88\">\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">. <em>Local 5, Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters v.

At the close of its footnote 34 the majority insists that the Board is not authorized to function as an arbiter of the economic weapons respective parties may employ, in order to achieve and maintain what it deems a proper balance between the power of labor and management. This delimitation of Board authority is founded on specific language in <em>NLRB v. Insurance Agents\u2019 Int\u2019l Union, </em>361 U.S. 477, 497-98, 80 S.Ct. 419, 4 L.Ed.2d 454 (1960). But nothing the Court or the Congress has said detracts from Board authority to proscribe the use of the economic weapon of a boycott where an object of the action is the bringing to bear of secondary pressures. To the contrary, judicial decision and legislative enactment give emphatic support to that prohibition and compel the Board to enforce the statutory stricture. When a legitimate contractual provision cannot be enforced by strike without a violation of section 8(b)(4), the Board is charged with removing that weapon from the union\u2019s arsenal and requiring the use of alternatives such as arbitration or lawsuit for breach of contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"96\">\n<p id=\"b1005-11\">.

A year earlier, in <em>Local 5, Plumbers &amp; Pipefitters v. NLRB, </em>116 U.S.App.D.C. 100, 103, 321 F.2d 366, 369, <em>cert. denied, </em>375 U.S. 921, 84 S.Ct. 266, 11 L.Ed.2d 165 (1963), a panel of this court referred to two cases involving attempts to change purchasing policies of general contractors. The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1007-7\">Both of these cases reflect a situation similar to the present one, for in both the union brought pressure on a subcontractor who was powerless to settle the dispute, as <em>Akron </em>here, in order to affect the purchasing policies of a general contractor. The only significant difference in this case is that the union attempted to influence the subcontracting policies of the general contractor, rather than its purchasing policies. There is nothing in the statute to indicate that this difference should produce a dissimilar result, for in both cases we have a secondary boycott.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1007-8\">(Footnote omitted.) This reasoning supports an analogy between union signatory and work preservation boycotts: both sorts of contract terms have been specifically validated (union signatory by enactment of the section 8(e) construction <em>proviso, </em>work preservation by <em>National </em>Woodwork), yet neither may be enforced where the subcontractor\u2019s lack of control demonstrates the union\u2019s action has a secondary object.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"102\">\n<p id=\"b1007-9\">. This determination is not the logical equivalent of the proposition the majority derives from <em>National Woodwork: </em>that work preservation is a valid primary purpose, that work preservation clauses therefore comply with section 8(e), and that their enforcement must satisfy section 8(b)(4). The more precise holding of the case is that section 8(b)(4) and section 8(e) do not prohibit primary activity directed to work preservation; primary activity is in turn defined as pressure levelled against an immediate employer because of some disagreement between boycotting employees and the boycotted employer. Where the Board determines that the operative dispute is in fact with a different employer and that the principal object of the boycott is to change that party\u2019s work policies, the work preservation shibboleth cannot render the economic action permissible under sections 8(b)(4) and 8(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"103\">\n<p id=\"b1007-15\">. <em>George Koch Sons, Inc. v.

Majority Op., 172 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 521 F.2d at 901 n.38. Justice Stewart attempted to demonstrate that any contractual provision invalid under section 8(b)(4) when enforced should similarly be invalid under section 8(e), whose \u201csweep\u201d he found to be coterminous with that of section 8(b)(4). Because he recognized that enforcement of work preservation provisions might violate section 8(b)(4) \u2014 in fact, in his opinion the statute condemned all product boycotts \u2014 he believed that under section 8(e) such provisions should not be permitted in collective bargaining agreements. The <em>National Woodwork </em>majority would not give so broad an interpretation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>section 8(e). Because the majority\u2019s opinion left open the possibility that a clause whose enforcement would constitute secondary activity illegal under section 8(b)(4) might not be condemned under section 8(e), he offered this argument, to expand interpretation of section 8(e), not to constrict section 8(b)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"106\">\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">. The Court concluded that Congress meant sections 8(e) and 8(b)(4)(B) to prohibit only \u201csecondary\u201d objectives, and that primary work preservation clauses were valid under both provisions of the Act. A subcontractor\u2019s work preservation agreement would clearly be primary if it were given the construction the ALJ placed on Rule IX of Hudik\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with Enterprise: the employer will preserve for the union all its traditional work which he has the ability to assign. This type of provision, innocuous by the standards of section 8(e), nevertheless clearly violates section 8(b)(4) when the union strikes for the right to perform work over which the employer has no effective control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">Even if the ALJ\u2019s interpretation of Rule IX is rejected, a work preservation agreement could satisfy section 8(e) but offend section 8(b)(4) if, for example, it were a lawful primary clause enforced against a neutral employer. <em>Cf. </em>386 U.S. at 632, 87 S.Ct. at 1262: \u201cIn effect Congress, in enacting \u00a7 8(b)(4)(A) of the Act [the predecessor of the present section 8(b)(4)(B)], . . . barred as a secondary boycott union activity directed against a neutral employer, including the immediate employer when in fact the activity directed against him was carried on for its effect elsewhere.\u201d The Court noted in <em>National Woodwork </em>that the redrafting of the provision was intended to insure that lawful primary activity would remain legitimate under section 8(b)(4). But although the case validates the concept of primary work preservation, it does not sanction the full panoply of secondary means of enforcing work preservation clauses. Thus a clause which on its face did not constitute an \u201cagreement to cease or refrain from handling any of the products of any other employer\u201d according to the precept of <em>National Woodwork </em>might nevertheless by its enforcement reflect a secondary object of changing the labor policies of a neutral employer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"107\">\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">. <em>George Koch Sons, Inc. v.
