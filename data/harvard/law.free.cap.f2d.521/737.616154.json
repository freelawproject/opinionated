Late at night in Union City, bars like El Tropicano at 49th Street and Hudson Avenue and restaurants like El Meson Espa\u00f1ol at 4018 Bergen-line Avenue become good places to meet a connection. Park your car some night in front of one of them, turn off all the lights, and focus your binoculars on a big Cadillac El Dorado with Miami plates, or, if you\u2019re lucky, a nice Lincoln with diplomatic plates. A great tourist attraction, that Union City.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b806-25\">Jurisdiction is based on diversity of citizenship, with a claim for damages in excess of $10,000. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. The complaint alleges that the defendant maliciously published a \u201cfalse and libelous statement\u201d consisting of the foregoing quotation, that it had reason to believe the same was false and that it was published with actual malice toward the plaintiff corporation. It averred that the defendant negligently failed to make investigation as to the truth of the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ment \u201cinsofar as the same concern plaintiff and plaintiff\u2019s reputation for being a law abiding business and accused the plaintiff corporation and its employees of engaging in criminal actions.\u201d It further stated \u201cthat by publication of the said statement the defendant intended to convey and expose the plaintiff corporation to hatred, contempt, ridicule, eversion (sic) and to indicate that it conducted its business in an unlawful manner and encouraged the commission of crimes on its premises.\u201d It finally claims injury to its \u201creputation\u201d and that it has been damaged in its attempt to conduct a law abiding business.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">For a second claim the complaint alleges, in support of punitive damages, that the defendant was actuated by actual malice and wrongfully intended to injure the plaintiff which has been greatly injured in its credit and reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Judge Brieant granted summary judgment to the defendant on the theory that the offending matter was a libel on the place and not on the owner, and that the complaint was therefore fatally defective because it alleged no special damages. 389 F.Supp. 357 (S.D.N.Y.1974). Both parties agree that New York law is to be applied. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\"> While a corporation enjoys the same right to plead general damages as do individuals, <em>Drug Research Corp. v. Curtis Publishing Co., </em>7 N.Y.2d 435, 440, 199 N.Y.S.2d 33, 166 N.E.2d 319 (1960), since it has no character to be affected by a libel it can only be protected against false and malicious statements affecting its credit or property. <em>Reporters\u2019 Ass\u2019n of America v. Sun Printing &amp; Publishing Ass\u2019n, </em>186 N.Y. 437, 440, 79 N.E. 710 (1906); <em>Steak Bit of Westbury, Inc. v. Newsday, Inc., </em>70 Misc.2d 437, 334 N.Y.S.2d 325 (Sup.Ct.1972). While the complaint, averring injury to \u201creputation,\u201d would be more appropriate pleading a libel against a natural person, we construe the pleading liberally as including injury to the property of the corporation. We must determine whether the statement charged to be defamatory is a libel against the plaintiff and is, in any event, libel <em>per se, </em>since no special damage was pleaded. <em>Reporters\u2019 Ass\u2019n of America v. Sun Printing &amp; Publishing Ass\u2019n, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">At the threshold we are met by the established New York doctrine that a publication defamatory of a place or product is not a libel against its owner unless the owner himself is accused of disreputable conduct. <em>Kennedy v. Press Publishing Co., </em>41 Hun 422 (1886) (place); see <em>Stillman v. Paramount Pictures Corp., </em>2 A.D.2d 18, 20, 153 N.Y.S.2d 190 (1st Dept. 1956), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>5 N.Y.2d 994 (1959) (place); <em>Dauer &amp; Fittipaldi, Inc. v. Twenty First Century Communications, Inc., </em>43 A.D.2d 178, 349 N.Y.S.2d 736 (1st Dept. 1973) (place); <em>Drug Research Corp. v. Curtis Publishing Co., </em>7 N.Y.2d 435, 440, 199 N.Y.S.2d 33, 166 N.E.2d 319 (1960) (product).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">In <em>Kennedy, supra, </em>the article charged that the plaintiff\u2019s saloon in Coney Island was a resort for improper characters and that the influence was bad. In <em>Maglio v. New York Herald Co., </em>93 App. Div. 546, 87 N.Y.S. 927 (2d Dept. 1904), the article charged that the Roma Hotel kept by plaintiff Maglio was harboring a murderer. In both cases, the court held no cause of action was stated. In <em>Richman v. New York Herald Tribune, Inc., </em>7 Misc.2d 563, 166 N.Y.S.2d 103 (Sup.Ct. 1957), the court held that even if the defamatory matter is libelous <em>per se </em>with respect to a proprietary hospital, it is not defamatory of its owner in the absence of a statement charging the plaintiff with personal misconduct or reprehensible character. In <em>Stillman, supra, </em>a possibly defamatory reference to \u201cStillman\u2019s Gym\u201d was held not to be a libel against plaintiff Stillman, its owner, absent a pleading of special damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">The article\u2019s susceptibility to a reading of libelous meaning, is a matter of law, not fact. <em>Tracy v. Newsday, Inc., </em>5 N.Y.2d 134, 136, 182 N.Y.S.2d 1, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>155 N.E.2d 853 (1959), and we find no libel against the plaintiff. <em>See O\u2019Connell v. Press Publishing Co., </em>214 N.Y. 352, 360, 108 N.E. 556 (1915); <em>Gambuzza v. Time, Inc., </em>18 A.D.2d 351, 354-56, 239 N.Y.S.2d 466 (1st Dept. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The quoted passage, tested by a \u201cfair\u201d not a broad reading, judged in its full context as it must be, see <em>Drug Research Corp. v. Curtis Publishing Co., supra, </em>7 N.Y.2d at 440, 199 N.Y.S.2d at 36, 166 N.E.2d at 321, cannot be read to accuse the plaintiff corporation of \u201cknowing\u201d acquiescence or participation in narcotics activity on its premises.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The passage certainly does not expressly do so, and the interpretation plaintiff attempts to establish by innuendo distorts the logical meaning of the text beyond the limits of its language. See <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Newsday, Inc., supra, </em>5 N.Y.2d at 136, 182 N.Y.S.2d at 3-4, 155 N.E.2d at 854-55. As was the case in <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Press Publishing Co., supra, </em>41 Hun at 422-23, \u201cthere is nothing in the article charging that the plaintiff conducts his [restaurant] improperly, or that he is responsible for the character of his guests.\u201d In the paraphrase of <em>Kennedy </em>by Justice McGivern, \u201c[i]t is even difficult to appreciate how the corporate sensibilities of the plaintiff have been wounded. Saloons have traditionally not been the habitats of Nobel prize winners, or even Rhodes scholars.\u201d <em>Dauer &amp; Fittipaldi, supra, </em>43 A.D.2d at 180, 349 N.Y.S.2d at 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Here, too, there is not a single word in the article which suggests that the proprietor of the restaurant knew that persons congregating in its restaurant found it a good place \u201cto meet a connection.\u201d We find that under New York law no claim for relief has been stated. The innuendo alleged cannot enlarge rather than explain the libel. <em>Rogow, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ally, Inc., </em>29 A.D.2d 423, 288 N.Y.S.2d 556 (1st Dept. 1968), <em>aff\u2019d mem., </em>25 N.Y.2d 943, 305 N.Y.S.2d 154, 252 N.E.2d 663 (1969). But even if the language could be read to libel the plaintiff, it is not a libel <em>per se, </em>and the plaintiff has not pleaded facts showing special damage resulting from the alleged libel. General allegations of damage are not sufficient. <em>O\u2019Connell v. Press Publishing Co., </em>214 N.Y. 352, 358, 108 N.E. 556 (1915).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">In the circumstances, the application of New York law requires us to affirm the dismissal of the complaint.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-5\">. On appeal plaintiff argues for the first time that the quoted passage constitutes libel <em>per se </em>because it accused the plaintiff of violating a New Jersey statute which proscribes knowing maintenance of a place of business used for illegal narcotics activity. N.J.S.A. \u00a7 24:21-21, subd. a(6). The difficulty is that, fairly read, the language of the alleged libel does not accuse the plaintiff of knowledge of such activity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b808-6\">. The complaint seeks compensatory damages of $250,000 and a like amount for punitive damages. \u201cSuch round figures, with no attempt at itemization, must be deemed to be a representation of general damages.\u201d <em>Drug Research Corp. v. Curtis Publishing Co., supra, </em>7 N.Y.2d at 441, 199 N.Y.S.2d at 37, 166 N.E.2d at 322.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b808-13\">. In view of our decision that dismissal is required under New York law, we need not determine whether the existence of a public issue \u2014 narcotics traffic \u2014 would any longer require consideration of the First Amendment if New York law permitted recovery. See <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 347, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
