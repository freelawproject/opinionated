Various insurance entities have objected: Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company, Dkt. No. 2454, Westchester Fire Insurance Company, Dkt. No. 2475, and Century Indemnity Company, Dkt. No. 2515.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The general basis for the objections is that GHR is not disinterested and has a conflict of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">On June 12, 2003, Lumbermens moved to disqualify GHR as counsel for the ACC and the FCR (the \u201cClaimant Entities\u201d) based on a conflict of interest arising from a violation of Rule 1.9 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>See </em>Dkt. No. 2231. The issues raised by the motion to disqualify, which was denied without prejudice as premature by order dated July 22, 2003, Dkt. No. 2351, and the application to employ GHR filed July 28, 2003, are identical. GHR formerly represented Corning, Incorporated (\u201cCorning\u201d), one of Debtor\u2019s two shareholders, in matters regarding its asbestos insurance coverage. GHR now seeks to represent the ACC, the FCR, and the Asbestos PI Trust that is to be created if and when Debtor\u2019s plan is confirmed. The plan as filed contains an injunction in favor of Corning due to its contribution to the Asbestos PI Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">During the course of plan negotiations, the ACC, with the FCR\u2019s knowledge and consent, accepted an assignment from PPG of PPG\u2019s claims against unsettled, disputed insurance coverage that is available for asbestos-related personal injury claims. The ACC, also with the FCR\u2019s knowledge and consent, negotiated a commitment from PPG to pay insurance counsel chosen by the ACC to provide legal services with respect to pursuit of PPG\u2019s insurance coverage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Again with the FCR\u2019s knowledge and consent, the ACC chose GHR. GHR also represents PPG, Inc., Debtor\u2019s other shareholder, regarding its asbestos insurance coverage but that representation is not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Corning asserts that it executed a \u201climited\u201d waiver of the alleged conflict in June of 2003 and that GHR never acquired confidential information about the underlying individual asbestos suits. Lumbermens did not provide Corning with confidential information. In connection with its objection to the application to employ GHR, however, Lumbermens submitted an \u201c \u2018Updated Privilege Log of GHR Documents\u2019 provided in connection with the Subpoena Duces Tecum served by Lumbermens ... upon [GHR] on July 2, 2003.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>Lumbermens asserts that it must consent to GHR\u2019s proposed representation of the ACC and the FCR (and the Asbestos PI Trust in the future) inasmuch as it shares a common interest in Coming\u2019s underlying defense and the privileges that attach thereto. <em>See </em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company\u2019s Objection to the Application of the Official Committee of Asbestos Creditors and Future Claimants\u2019 Representative to Retain Gilbert Heintz &amp; Randolph LLP as Special Insurance Counsel (\u201cLumbermens\u2019 Objection to GHR Retention Application\u201d), Dkt. No. 2454, at 12. Despite standing to raise the conflict, we find that the common interest or joint defense doctrine does not apply to Lum-bermens and, therefore, its consent is not needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Nonetheless, we find that GHR cannot be employed as a professional in this case. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 327, 1103. It is not disinterested, has an actual conflict of interest, or, at a minimum, a potential conflict of interest, and holds an interest adverse to the estate insofar as it purports to undertake representation of those who have claims against its former client, Corning, a shareholder of the Debtor, PCC. Further, we find that GHR\u2019s stated belief that the representation of the Claimant Entities will not adversely affect GHR\u2019s relationship with Corning is not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Lumbermens also filed a motion to compel production of documents with respect to the motion to employ GHR. To the extent the ACC and the FCR agreed to produce documents, the motion will be granted. To the extent the motion to compel is based on the common interest/joint defense theory it is denied. Although some of the discovery requested is directed to the question of when GHR began its representation of the ACC and the FCR (i.e., while it was still representing Corning), in light of our ruling that the motion to retain GHR will be denied, we do not reach this issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A6l\">\n<em>Standing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">GHR contends that Lumbermens is without standing to raise this objection. We conclude that, under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1103, Lumbermens, although not a former or current client of GHR, has standing through its counsel to object to the application to employ GHR inasmuch as actual and potential conflicts of interest exist between GHR\u2019s former and current (proposed) clients.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although Lumbermens was never GHR\u2019s client, Lumbermens\u2019 counsel, as an officer of the court, is required to report an actual or potential conflict of interest to the court under Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">Lumbermens\u2019 counsel has standing to object to the application to employ GHR. Any attorney, not just a former client\u2019s attorney, has standing, and, indeed, the obligation, to call a conflict of interest to the attention of the court because attorneys must report any actual or potential ethical violations. <em>Schiffli Embroidery Workers Pension Fund v. Ryan, Beck &amp; Co., </em>1994 WL 62124 (D.N.J., Feb.23, 1994) at *5. In <em>Schiffli, </em>the firm of P <em>&amp; </em>G represented the plaintiffs trustees and a third-party defendant in a suit against Ryan Beck. Ryan Beck\u2019s counsel moved to disqualify P <em>&amp; </em>G as counsel for the plaintiffs trustees based on a potential conflict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>of interest. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey held that counsel for Ryan Beck had standing to file a disqualification motion because, under New Jersey\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct, Ryan Beck\u2019s counsel was required to report actual or potential ethical violations to the court so had standing. Lumbermens\u2019 counsel is in the position of Ryan Beck\u2019s counsel. Applying the rule in <em>Schiffli, </em>Lumbermens has standing to object to GHR\u2019s retention as counsel for the Claimant Entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in <em>In re Com Derivatives Antitrust Litig., </em>748 F.2d 157 (3d Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Cochrane &amp; Bresnahan v. Plaintiff Class Representatives, </em>472 U.S. 1008, 105 S.Ct. 2702, 86 L.Ed.2d 718 (1985), raised, but did not resolve, the issue of whether only a client or former client could move for disqualification. Other circuits have held that attorneys are required to report actual or potential ethical violations. <em>See Schiffli, </em>1994 WL 62124 at *2, citing <em>Kevlik v. Goldstein, </em>724 F.2d 844 (1st Cir.1984); <em>U.S. v. Clarkson, </em>567 F.2d 270 (4th Cir.1977); <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Daniel Int\u2019l Corp., </em>563 F.2d 671 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Rule 1.7 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-6\">(a) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client will be directly adverse to another client, unless: (1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the relationship with the other client; and (2) each client consents after consultation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b754-8\">(b) A lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer\u2019s responsibilities to another client or to a third person, or by the lawyer\u2019s own interests, unless: (1) the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not be adversely affected; and (2) the client consents after full disclosure and consultation. When representation of multiple clients in a single matter is undertaken, the consultation shall include explanation of the implications of the common representation and the advantages and risks involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">The comment to Pennsylvania Rule of Professional Conduct 1.7 provides that \u201cwhere the conflict is such as clearly to call in question the fair or efficient administration of justice, opposing counsel may properly raise the question.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We find this standard is met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">Over 140,000 individuals filed asbestos-related claims against Pittsburgh Corning Corporation (\u201cPCC\u201d) prior to PCC\u2019s April 2000 bankruptcy filing. Some individuals (approximately 11,400) also filed claims against Corning. <em>See </em>Disclosure Statement at 43, Dkt. No. 2065, filed April 30, 2003. The ACC is composed of individual asbestos claimants in the suits.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Corning retained tort counsel, (Nixon Peabody LLP), insurance counsel (Ward Norris Heller and Reidy LLP), and bankruptcy counsel (Thorp Reed &amp; Armstrong LLP and Shearman &amp; Sterling LLP). Around March 1, 2001, Corning also retained Gilbert Heintz &amp; Randolph LLP (\u201cGHR\u201d) as its supplementary insurance coverage counsel to settle insurance coverage dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>putes between Corning and Coming\u2019s primary insurers, Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company (\u201cLumbermens\u201d) and ACE USA Companies (\u201cACE\u201d). The following events illustrate GHR\u2019s role.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In June 2001, Coming\u2019s counsel, including Scott Gilbert of GHR, Andrew Burns of Nixon Peabody and Cheryl Heller of Ward Norris, met with Lumbermens and ACE to discuss coverage-related topics, Coming\u2019s defense strategies against the Claimant Entities and Coming\u2019s willingness to contribute to a \u00a7 524(g) trust. At the meeting, Mr. Gilbert obtained a 24-page confidential memo prepared by Mr. Burns, Coming\u2019s tort counsel, and marked \u201cPrivileged and Confidential/Attorney Work Product/Attorney-Client Communication.\u201d The memo contained detailed facts and law relating to the Unibestos-related claims against Corning.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">On September 27, 2001, Lumbermens sent Ms. Heller, Coming\u2019s insurance counsel, a letter marked \u201cConfidential-For Settlement Purposes Only\u201d that denounced Coming\u2019s intentions to contribute to the trust. GHR received this letter six months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">On May 1, 2002, Lumbermens called Ms. Orr of GHR to discuss the following: (i) the ACC\u2019s demands of Corning; (ii) Lumbermens\u2019 involvement in discussions between the ACC and Coming; (iii) Lum-bermens\u2019 interest in keeping abreast of negotiations between Corning and the ACC; and (iv) Lumbermens\u2019 September 2001 settlement letter. Two weeks later, Ms. Orr met with Lumbermens to try to convince it to contribute to the trust to settle its coverage obligation to Corning. Lum-bermens refused and continues to refuse to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">In June, 2002, GHR met with Lumber-mens and ACE to discuss: (i) the status of Coming\u2019s negotiations with the ACC; (ii) Coming\u2019s defense strategies; (iii) Coming\u2019s demands on its insurers; and (iv) the insurers\u2019 role in handling the Claimant Entities\u2019 demands. Also in June of 2002 Scott Gilbert of GHR acknowledged that GHR had been asked to serve as PPG\u2019s insurance counsel for a fee of $30 million to be paid by PPG. <em>See </em>Letter of June 10, 2002, from Scott D. Gilbert to James C. Diggs, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of PPG Industries, Inc., LMC Deposition Exhibit 8, GHR 0106.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">On or about March 28, 2003, Corning settled with the Claimant Entities, resolving its asbestos liability and assigning insurance rights against Lumbermens and ACE to the trust. The settlement is contingent on the confirmation of the proposed plan of reorganization. Corning orally consented to GHR\u2019s representation of the Claimant Entities on or about the same date, and then signed a formal limited waiver in June of 2003. Neither GHR nor the Claimant Entities filed an application to employ GHR until July 28, 2003.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> GHR denies that its representation of the ACC and the FCR began before December of 2002.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Lumbermens asserts that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>there were meetings between April and June of 2002 at which no carriers were present, but GHR was there as were the ACC and Corning. These meetings are referred to by the parties as \u201cthe McGovern meetings.\u201d GHR represented Corning in the negotiations during the McGovern meetings but asserts that it was not party to the final negotiations leading to the settlement Corning reached with the ACC and the FCR. One of the meetings was held on June 10, 2002, after a settlement with PPG<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was announced but before Corning reached a deal with the ACC. Although GHR says it did not participate in the final negotiations, it is apparent from the record that it participated in other negotiations and was still holding itself out as and known to the parties to be Coming\u2019s counsel at the time those final negotiations occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">The date on which GHR began its work on behalf of the ACC and the FCR is in dispute. In pleadings in support of the retention application it is asserted that no work was done until work for Corning ceased. GHR avers that this was no earlier than December 2002 but in his Verified Statement Scott Gilbert states</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-7\">As part of the settlement between PPG and the ACC on May 14, 2002, PPG agreed to fund ... insurance counsel designated by the ACC to continue to pursue the insurance coverage issued by certain PPG insurance companies that refused to participate in the settlement. The ACC, with the knowledge and consent of the FCR, designated GHR as its choice for insurance counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-8\">I negotiated with PPG and its counsel about the scope and terms of GHR\u2019s retention ... [which] were included in the PCC Disclosure Statement filed April 30, 2003. By May 23,2003, GHR and PPG, along with the other parties thereto, had finalized the Term Sheet....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-9\">On December 5, 2002, GHR began doing preliminary insurance work on behalf of the ACC against PPG\u2019s insurers. GHR did not undertake any work on behalf of the ACC against Coming\u2019s insurers. At that time, Corning had no agreement with the ACC to resolve its asbestos-related personal injury claims by participation in the [Asbestos PI] Trust. Therefore, GHR\u2019s employment by the ACC did not include advice with respect to resolution of any Corning insurance policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>Verified Statement of Scott D. Gilbert, Exhibit to Retention Application, Dkt. No. 2345, at \u00b6\u00b620, 21, 22. The above statements seem to indicate that GHR was working for the ACC and Corning simultaneously but for purposes of this Memorandum Opinion we do not need to resolve the issue inasmuch as we find that GHR has a conflict of interest and the retention application filed by the ACC and the FCR must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">With respect to the retention, Mr. Gilbert states in \u00b6 23 of his Verified Statement that on behalf of the ACC and the FCR, GHR will pursue Corning Plan Insurance Policies but that his judgment will not be hindered by GHR\u2019s prior representation of Corning. This self-serving statement ignores the problem. GHR received confidential information from Corning regarding its defense strategies in suits filed by asbestos plaintiffs. GHR cannot now change allegiance and advocate for the representatives of those asbestos plaintiffs when it previously represented Corning, the putative defendant in the suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">That GHR\u2019s advice would be directed to the Asbestos PI Trust after plan confirmation if the Asbestos PI Trust retained GHR does not resolve the issue as a conflict of interest exists with respect to the Asbestos PI Trust as well. The duties of the Asbestos PI Trust trustees will include examining asbestos claims to determine the extent to which they should be paid or disallowed, paying appropriate claims, and pursuing applicable insurance coverage. This situation presents an actual conflict\u2014 GHR cannot undertake the representation of the ACC, the FCR or the Asbestos PI Trust regarding Coming\u2019s non-settling insurers. .</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">We also note that in his deposition Mr. Gilbert testified that as early as October 4, 2002, GHR had been designated as the ACC\u2019s \u201ccounsel of choice\u201d to pursue PPG, Transcript of Video Deposition of Scott D. Gilbert dated July 18, 2003, at 160-61, although as of November 18, 2002, some details remained to be resolved. <em>Id. </em>at 164. In GHR\u2019s Brief in Opposition to Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company\u2019s Motion to Disqualify, Dkt. No. 2281, GHR asserted that on October 4, 2002, GHR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0D9\">met with representatives of the ACC and the FCR with respect to Corning-related matters. At a break at one of Coming\u2019s ongoing mediation sessions at which GHR was not present, representatives of the ACC and FCR asked if they could meet with Gilbert to discuss Coming\u2019s insurance coverage. According to these representatives, Corning and its insurers present at the mediation consented to the conversation, which lasted 80 minutes. At all times during this conversation, Gilbert acted as Coming\u2019s insurance coverage counsel. He had no legal relationship, formal or informal, with the ACC, FCR, or the proposed [Asbestos PI] Trust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Dkt. No. 2281 at 7-8.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">\u201cPreliminary review\u201d work on behalf of the ACC and the FCR had begun \u201cat the very end of 2002 and following.\u201d Transcript of Video Deposition of Scott D. Gilbert dated July 18, 2003, at 164-65. However, Bette Orr of GHR asserts that this was with respect to PPG\u2019s insurers. Declaration of Bette M. Orr, Exhibit H to Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company\u2019s Motion to Compel the Production of Documents (Number Two), Dkt. No. 2409, at \u00b6 6. At that time there was no agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>between the ACC and Corning with respect to resolving Coming\u2019s, asbestos liability through participation in the Asbestos PI Trust. <em>Id. </em>The record before us establishes that Corning was aware of the proposed representation of the ACC and the FCR by GHR at least by March 25, 2003. <em>See </em>LMC Deposition Exhibit 14, at 2, GHR 0657, Letter of March 26, 2003, from William D. Eggers of Corning to Joseph F. Rice of the Ness Motley firm. Mr. Eggers wrote, \u201cIf the document is acceptable to the ACC, I am prepared to sign for Corning. ... As a final matter, we agree that Scott Gilbert and his firm may be available to the ACC as insurance counsel with respect to the rights/proceeds that will be assigned.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">For purposes of this Memorandum Opinion, although it appears that simultaneous representation by GHR occurred, we do not need to decide whether or not it did inasmuch as we find that there was an actual conflict of interest between GHR\u2019s former and current clients and its retention cannot be approved. GHR, as Coming\u2019s counsel, was involved in discussions regarding Coming\u2019s defense strategies against the Claimant Entities, GHR\u2019s proposed current clients. The issues that those discussions centered around are the same issues that will arise with respect to the Asbestos PI Trust administration and the interests of the ACC\u2019s and FCR\u2019s constituencies. Furthermore, if the plan is not confirmed, the Corning settlement will not become effective and Coming and the Claimant Entities will be in the same adversarial position they were in before the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\"><em>The Coming Waiver </em>Although Corning waived the conflict, the waiver was limited in scope and an actual conflict remains. GHR acknowledges that the \u201cpossibility\u201d of a conflict exists. <em>See </em>Letter of June 11, 2003, from Scott D. Gilbert of GHR to William Eg-gers, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Corning Inc., LMC Deposition Exhibit 20, GHR 0296, attached as an exhibit to Lumbermens\u2019 Objection to GHR Retention Application.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The June 11, 2003, letter was a precursor to the limited waiver that was signed on June 20, 2003 (LMC Deposition Exhibit No. 22, GHR 0397). In the June 11 letter Mr. Gilbert wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-9\">Although we do not anticipate that the Claimant Entities will take positions materially adverse to Corning on issues that are substantially related to our pri- or representation of Corning, namely insurance recovery for asbestos-related claims, such a possibility exists, and we therefore believe it prudent to seek Coming\u2019s consent to GHR\u2019s representation of the Claimant Entities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-10\">LMC Deposition Exhibit 20, GHR 0297. Mr. Eggers via e-mail dated June 16, 2003, directed to Judith A. Barbee, who forwarded it to Bette M. Orr and Scott D. Gilbert, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-11\">We are reviewing and discussing with our outside counsel whether the content and format as proposed would be appropriate. Items to consider \u2014 explicit definition of what roles the Gilbert firm will have and will not have (i.e., nothing adverse to Corning; no use of any information acquired in the course of representing Corning; no role in connection with the terms of the Corning deal with the ACC) and explicit agreement to protect the confidentiality of all information acquired in the course of representing Corning. I am not prepared to sign in the form faxed to me, but we will consider alternatives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-12\">LMC Deposition Exhibit 21, GHR 0300. On June 20, 2003, Mr. Gilbert wrote the following to Mr. Eggers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>We anticipate that we will be advising and representing the Claimant Entities in much the same capacity as we have advised Corning, namely by advising the Claimant Entities on the most effective way to recover those insurance assets that will be assigned to the Asbestos PI Trust, and we would then pursue directly the recovery of such assets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">LMC Deposition Exhibit 22, GHR 0397.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">We find that there is more than a possibility of a conflict \u2014 an actual conflict exists and the potential for a conflict in the future is so great as to be a near certainty because GHR is representing its former client\u2019s adversaries, the ACC and the FCR, with respect to the same matter. Furthermore, the interests of the ACC and the FCR are not identical and are likely to conflict with each other and with the interests of the post-confirmation Asbestos PI Trust as illustrated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">\n<em>The Interests of the Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aoe\">The parties in interest represented by the ACC assert that Corning, among others, is liable for asbestos-related injuries. The FCR represents future claimants who, when they are found to exist, are likely to take the same position. Without the settlement Corning reached with the Claimant Entities, Corning would be defending those claims. Absent confirmation of the proposed plan, the Corning settlement will not be final and Corning will once again be in the position of having to defend against those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">It is asserted by Lumbermens that Corning is obligated under relevant insurance policies to cooperate in the defense of claims and we assume for purposes of this Memorandum Opinion that this is true. The insurance companies have an interest in utilizing Coming\u2019s cooperation in the defense of claims that the insurers may be called upon to pay. In this respect both Corning and its insurers have an interest in defending liability and minimizing damages. The Claimant Entities\u2019 interest is in getting payment for asbestos plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. Corning decided that it was in its best interests to settle with the ACC and the FCR. Coming\u2019s interest therefore will change upon plan confirmation \u2014 it will have no liability other than that provided by the plan as to any issues with respect to asbestos plaintiffs or as to settling insurers. Until the settlement is approved as part of plan confirmation, however, Coming\u2019s interests remain adverse to the claimants represented by the ACC and the FCR. Until plan confirmation, the settling insurers\u2019 interests will not change. Moreover, Coming\u2019s and the Claimant Entities\u2019 interests will remain adverse, even after plan confirmation, with respect to the non-settling insurers. Corning reserved its rights under policies held by non-settling insurers, including Lumbermens, and those interests remain unchanged pre- and post-confirmation.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Corning originally retained GHR to advise it with respect to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-11\">claims it has, or may have, against its insurers for asbestos-related coverage, either on its own behalf or in connection with its partial ownership of Pittsburgh Corning\u201d.We advised Corning on how its insurance asset could be utilized in the Pittsburgh Corning bankruptcy to resolve Coming\u2019s pending and future asbestos-related claims. Although [] we provided strategic advice to Corning concerning insurance coverage for its asbestos-related claims, we did not represent or advise Corning in the defense of the underlying litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-14\">LMC Deposition Exhibit 20, GHR 0296-97. The limited waiver that was eventually signed on June 20, 2003, provides that GHR anticipates that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>... will be advising and representing the Claimant Entities in much the same capacity as we have advised Corning on insurance matters, namely by advising the Claimant Entities on the most effective way to recover those insurance assets that will be assigned to the Asbestos PI Trust, and we would then pursue directly the recovery of such assets. We will not, in the course of our representation of the Claimant Entities, represent them in litigation against or negotiations with Corning prior to the effective date of a confirmed PC Plan. Nor will we provide counsel or advice to the Claimant Entities in the pursuit or establishment of any asbestos-related liabilities alleged against Corning. This is consistent with GHR\u2019s practice of strictly limiting any representation for asbestos claimants or claimant committees to insurance matters.... Corning consents to this representation ... and waives any and all potential conflicts that may result from the Firm\u2019s prior representation of Corning subject to the limitations stated herein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">LMC Deposition Exhibit 22, GHR 0398, Letter of June 20, 2003, from Scott D. Gilbert of GHR to William D. Eggers on behalf of Corning. In the same letter, Mr. Gilbert wrote</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-5\">Although we provided strategic advice to Corning concerning insurance coverage for its asbestos-related claims, we did not represent or advise Corning in the defense of the underlying litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-6\"><em>Id. </em>As this court sees it, \u201cstrategic advice\u201d is an essential component of any defense of the underlying claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">In order to establish insurer liability, the ACC and the FCR will have to claim against Corning or the Corning Fund that is to be established under the plan. Plan confirmation will not fix Coming\u2019s non-settling insurers\u2019 liability, it will only establish that claims against Corning will be directed to the trust. In the event there is coverage litigation post-confirmation, Corning will be obliged to cooperate in the defense of claims if its contracts with its insurers so provide. GHR represented Corning with respect to \u201cstrategic advice\u201d regarding asbestos liabilities. That advice necessarily is geared to defense of the liabilities. GHR will be in direct conflict with Coming\u2019s interests when representing the ACC or FCR and/or, as proposed, the Asbestos PI Trust post-confirmation. <em>Joint Defense Doctrine and Whether Lum-bermens\u2019 Consent to Representation is Required</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Even if GHR\u2019s retention application were to be approved, Lumbermens\u2019 consent to the representation is unnecessary.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-11\">Generally, a client waives the attorney-client privilege when it voluntarily discloses privileged communications to a third party....

To establish existence of the joint defense privilege \u201cthe party asserting the privilege must show that (1) the communications were made in the course of a joint defense effort, (2) the statements were designed to further the effort, and (3) the privilege has not been waived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The party moving to disqualify a firm on the basis of a conflict of interest bears the burden of proving both elements of the two-prong test and that the conflict was not waived. <em>In re Com Derivatives Antitrust Litig., </em>748 F.2d 157, 162 (3d Cir. 1984); <em>Brennan v. Independence Blue Cross, </em>949 F.Supp. 305, 307 (E.D.Pa.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">In <em>Russo, </em>Cabot Corporation sold its beryllium manufacturing business and plant to NGK Metals, but remained partially liable to NGK for future injury claims against NGK. Years later, NGK\u2019s employees sued NGK and Cabot for exposure to beryllium products developed and manufactured at the plant. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania held that Cabot and NGK were joint defendants because they clearly shared a legal interest since the suit sought to establish the liability of both NGK and Cabot, not just NGK. The court also noted that Cabot\u2019s and NGK\u2019s common interest had been \u201crecognized and formally established in\u201d an agreement between the parties. 2001 WL 34371702, at *2, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23861, at *7.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">Here, Corning and Lumbermens share an interest in defending Corning against asbestos liability. However, even if there were an adjudication that Corning is liable for an asbestos-related injury, such a ruling would not be an adjudication that Lumbermens is required to pay the claim. Lumbermens\u2019 obligation would be determined by application of the insurance contract provisions. Thus, Lumbermens\u2019 consent to waiver of the conflict is not required.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To be joint defendants under the joint defense doctrine, parties must have identical, not just similar, interests in a lawsuit and must have exchanged confidential information. <em>Russo v. Cabot Corporation, supra, </em>2001 WL 34371702, at *2, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 23861, at *7; <em>Pittston Co. v. Allianz Insurance. Co., </em>143 F.R.D. 66, 69 (D.N.J.1992). Although Lumbermens\u2019 and Coming\u2019s interests in litigating the asbestos cases based upon their contractual duties and responsibilities to each other are similar, they are not identical. In fact, their legal interests have been adverse regarding their legal positions in this bankruptcy. In June of 2001 and in 2002, Corning tried to convince Lumbermens to contribute to the Asbestos PI Trust. Lumbermens was, and still is, opposed. Corning wanted to contribute to the trust to avoid defending itself against future claims. Lumbermens wanted only to resolve current claims, not contribute defense dollars to the Asbestos PI Trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">We also note that Lumbermens did not provide confidential information in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>course of the negotiations predating GHR\u2019s assumption of representation of the ACC and the FCR. Whereas Corning provided Lumbermens with a confidential memo about the Unibestos-related claims, Lumbermens apparently never provided Corning with any confidential information regarding the suits. Lumbermens has not even asserted that it and Corning exchanged confidential information regarding the individual asbestos claims. Therefore, the common interest/joint defense doctrine does not apply to require that Lumber-mens consent to the representation. <em>Conflict of Interest</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">There is a two-prong test with respect to conflicts of interest. <em>See generally International Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n Local Union 1332 v. International Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>909 F.Supp. 287 (E.D.Pa.1995). The first element is substantial relation of the prior and present matters. Matters are substantially related \u201cwhen an attorney might have acquired confidential information as counsel in one matter which is also relevant to the other matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291. The second element, that the former and proposed current clients have materially adverse interests, is also met. The individual asbestos claimants represented by the Claimant Entities, GHR\u2019s proposed current client, sued Corning, GHR\u2019s former client, asserting liability and damages for asbestos-related injuries. Notwithstanding the settlement Corning has reached with respect to its contributions to the \u00a7 524(g) trust, a plan has not been confirmed, the contributions have not been made, and a \u00a7 524(g) injunction has not been entered. GHR is in the position of representing one client against a former client with respect to the same liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">\n<em>Substantial Relation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">The substantial relation test entails the determination of (1) whether the subject matter of the former and current representations are the same and (2) whether the attorney might have acquired confidential information related to the subject matter of the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">With respect to the acquisition of confidential information, it is clear to the court that GHR acquired confidential Corning information related to the subject matter of the Claimant Entities\u2019 actions against Corning. Coming\u2019s limited waiver of the conflict is not effective to permit employment of GHR by the ACC and the FCR as to Coming\u2019s insurance. GHR cannot represent both sides in what amounts to the same dispute. <em>Brennan v. Independence Blue Cross, </em>949 F.Supp. 305, 308 (E.D.Pa. 1996). In <em>Brennan, </em>counsel\u2019s representation of the Brennans against the insurer defendants occurred after settling an underlying medical malpractice action in which counsel represented both the Bren-nans regarding their tort claims and the defendants concerning their subrogation right. The underlying medical malpractice action included a claim for future medical benefits. The court found that a conflict existed inasmuch as counsel was seeking to represent the Brennans in their claims against the defendant insurers for the same medical benefits at issue in the medical malpractice action. In the matter at bench at least a potential conflict exists and the representation cannot go forward. Although Corning and the ACC and the FCR have settled, that settlement is contingent on plan confirmation. If the plan is not confirmed, the settlement will not become effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">In the matter at bench, Mr. Gilbert and Ms. Orr of GHR met with Corning and Coming\u2019s insurers at least four times to discuss Coming\u2019s defense strategies against the Claimant Entities, the ACC\u2019s demands on Corning, and Coming\u2019s will<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>ingness to contribute to the Asbestos PI Trust. Further, Mr. Gilbert obtained a confidential memo from Coming\u2019s other counsel that contained detailed facts and law about the underlying Unibestos-relat-ed claims against Corning.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We find that GHR would be disqualified even if Corning executed a blanket waiver due to the nature of the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">\n<em>Materially Adverse Interests</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">To avoid conflicts of interest among an attorney\u2019s clients, Rule 1.9 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Cpnduct prohibits an attorney from representing a client in the same or substantially similar matter in which that client\u2019s interests are materially adverse to those of the attorney\u2019s former client, unless the former client consents after full disclosure of the circumstances.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Likewise, a firm cannot represent a client when any of its attorneys practicing alone would be prohibited from doing so. Pa. R. Prof. Conduct 1.10(a). For the reasons stated, the interests of GHR\u2019s former and proposed clients are materially adverse and so the retention application must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">A federal court has the inherent power to supervise the conduct of attorneys practicing before it. <em>In re Com Derivatives Antitrust Litig., </em>748 F.2d at 160; <em>Clark Capital Mgmt. Group, Inc. v. Annuity Investors Life Insurance Co., </em>149 F.Supp.2d 193, 198 (E.D.Pa.2001). It may disqualify a firm from representing a client where a conflict of interest arises. <em>Clark Capital Mgmt. Group, </em>149 F.Supp.2d at 198. However, a court should disqualify a firm only when it determines, on the particular facts of the case, that disqualification is an appropriate means of enforcing Rule 1.9. <em>Id. </em>The court must weigh the objectives of Rule 1.9, which include maintaining the public\u2019s confidence in the bar, fulfilling the former client\u2019s expectations that attorneys will be loyal to their clients, and preventing the possibility that a client\u2019s secrets will be used against him, against any countervailing policies such as permitting the litigant to retain counsel of his choice. If disqualification is inappropriate, the court may screen attorneys to remedy the conflict. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">The comment to Rule 1.9 also provides a comparison with the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility, noting that the problem stated in Rule 1.9(a) has sometimes been dealt with under Canon 9 of the Disciplinary Rules. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Canon 9 provides that \u201cA lawyer should avoid even the appearance of professional impropriety.\u201d However, the Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit has made it very clear that the appearance of impropriety alone is not sufficient to disqualify counsel. <em>In re Pillowtex, Inc., </em>304 F.3d 246, 251 (3d Cir.2002). The comment to Rule 1.9 further provides that the scope of Rule 1.6(a) concerning the revelation of information about a client is broader than \u201cconfidences and secrets\u201d included in EC 4-6 and, therefore, the extent to which an attorney may use information about a client after termination of the attorney-client relationship must be determined. In this case the issues and the parties are so inter-related and inter-dependent that the parameters cannot be defined. The representation cannot be permitted to go forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Even GHR admits the \u201cpossibility\u201d of a conflict. <em>See </em>Letter of June 11, 2003, from Scott D. Gilbert of GHR to William Eggers, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Corning Inc., LMC Deposition Exhibit 20, GHR 0296, attached as an exhibit to Lumbermens\u2019 Objection to GHR Retention Application. The ACC and the FCR have fiduciary duties to <em>each </em>present and future asbestos creditor, respectively. Moreover, some individual asbestos creditors may actually litigate, at which point the Asbestos PI Trust, having succeeded to Coming\u2019s interests, will be represented by Coming\u2019s former counsel against the interests of the ACC and the FCR. The objective of the ACC and the FCR focuses on settlements and administrative resolution of claims rather than litigation in order to preserve available funds for qualified asbestos creditors. However, the objective may not be 100 percent attainable and, to whatever extent the goal is not met, litigation may ensue. In <em>In re Corn Derivatives Antitrust Litig., </em>748 F.2d 157 (3d Cir.1984), the Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[t]he duty of loyalty [to a former client] does not always detach when the representation ends.... In litigation, an attorney may not abandon his client and take [an] adverse position in the same case. This is not merely a matter of revealing or using the client\u2019s confidences and secrets, but of a duty of continuing loyalty to the client.\u201d <em>Corn Derivatives, </em>748 F.2d at 161. Referring to ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 1.9 as it existed at the time, the Court of Appeals went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">A rule against representation of interests adverse to a former client in the same or substantially related litigation has several purposes. It is a prophylactic rule to prevent even the potential that a former client\u2019s confidences and secrets may be used against him. Without such a rule, clients may be reluctant to confide completely in their attorneys. Second, the rule is important for the maintenance of public confidence in the integrity of the bar.... Finally, and importantly, a client has a right to expect the loyalty of his attorney in the matter for which he is retained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">748 F.2d at 162. We note that the Court of Appeals did not reach the issue of whether circumstances could exist \u201cwhere even the consent by the former client will not immunize an attorney against a disqualification based upon the appearance of impropriety and the maintenance of the integrity of the bar.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Later, however, as stated above, in a series of cases, the court indicated that the appearance of a conflict alone is insufficient to disqualify counsel. <em>See In re Pillowtex, Inc., </em>304 F.3d 246 (3d Cir.2002); <em>In re Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc., </em>140 F.3d 463 (3d Cir. 1998); <em>In re BH &amp; P, Inc., </em>949 F.2d 1300 (3d Cir.1991). However, there is a <em>per se </em>disqualification imposed by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(c) on an attorney who has an actual conflict of interest. In addition, it is with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>in the court\u2019s discretion to disqualify counsel who has a potential conflict of interest, pursuant to \u00a7 327(a) and consistent with \u00a7 327(c). <em>In </em>re <em>Pillowtex, Inc., </em>304 F.3d at 251. The requirements of \u00a7 1103 pursuant to which the application was made in this case are the same as those under \u00a7 327 \u2014 the professional must not have an adverse interest and must be disinterested. <em>See In re Metropolitan Hospital, </em>119 B.R. 910, 919 (Bankr.E.D.Pa.1990). GHR wants to represent the ACC and the FCR whose constituencies\u2019 claims, and the insurance issues surrounding them, are the very reasons Corning hired GHR in the first place. We find an actual conflict but to the extent there is not an actual conflict at this point, we find the potential for conflict is so great as to be a near certainty and therefore to warrant the exercise of our discretion to disqualify GHR from the multiple representation it seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Corning has provided a limited waiver of GHR\u2019s conflict. Even if Corning waived the conflict in its entirety, however, GHR retains an obligation to keep confidential those matters covered by the attorney-client and work-product privileges. GHR cannot comply with that obligation <em>and </em>exercise its ethical and fiduciary obligations to the ACC and FCR, regardless of intent or effort to do so. GHR cannot serve two masters, let alone three or four (Corning, the ACC, the FCR, and/or the Asbestos PI Trust). GHR was Coming\u2019s insurance counsel. GHR has been represented to the court to be PPG\u2019s insurance counsel. Like Corning, PPG is a shareholder of the Debtor. It has also been represented to the court that GHR would be paid nothing more, if this application were approved, to represent the ACC and the FCR than it will be paid to represent the Asbestos PI Trust regarding PPG\u2019s insurance contributions. However, cost savings cannot justify representation by counsel with a conflict of interest. There is necessarily tension between and among the interests of those represented by the ACC and those represented by the FCR and the Asbestos PI Trust. GHR cannot successfully or ethically represent all entities in the same matter regarding the same issues and claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">The subject matter of the former and current representations is the same in this case where the reasons for retaining counsel and the tasks that the firm performed in the former representation correspond to the issues and underlying facts of the current proposed representation. <em>Commonwealth Insurance. Co. v. Graphix Hot Line, Inc., </em>808 F.Supp. 1200, 1204 (E.D.Pa. 1992). The subject matter of GHR\u2019s former representation of Corning is the same as its current representation of the Claimant Entities. That is, Corning retained GHR to provide advice and strategy in its effort to settle insurance coverage disputes with Coming\u2019s primary insurers. The Claimant Entities retained GHR to provide advice and strategy with respect to collecting Coming's insurance coverage for the Claimant Entities\u2019 individual asbestos claimants. The asbestos-related issues GHR faces in the representation of both its former and current clients concern Coming\u2019s liability, that of its insurers, and insurance coverage in the asbestos suits. Therefore, under <em>Graphix Hot Line, Inc., supra, </em>the subject matter of GHR\u2019s former representation of Corning and its current representation of the Claimant Entities is the same \u2014 advice regarding issues related to Coming\u2019s insurance coverage for asbestos-related claims, the same issues with respect to which GHR seeks to represent the Claimant Entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Although the insurers\u2019 express concern that Coming\u2019s defense strategies (proposed in a confidential memorandum by Coming\u2019s counsel) to which GHR is privy will be used against them in future litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>tion with the ACC and the FCR, those defense strategies could be used by Corning in any event. The relevant focus is on Corning, inasmuch as GHR\u2019s duties regarding the ACC and the FCR are stated to be to assist and advise the ACC and the FCR in the analysis of Debtor\u2019s and its shareholders\u2019 (of which Corning is one) potentially available insurance assets. <em>See </em>Retention Application, Dkt. No. 2345, at \u00b6 18. That determination requires an analysis of Coming\u2019s potential defenses to liability. GHR cannot make that analysis for the ACC and the FCR without violating its obligations to Corning. <em>See </em>Letters of June 11, June 16, and June 20, 2003, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">It is argued that the representation must be permitted because GHR (1) represented Corning with respect to Coming\u2019s insurers and not in negotiations with the ACC, Retention Application, Dkt. No. 2345, at \u00b6 16, (2) has never represented Corning in the bankruptcy in a manner directly in conflict with the ACC, Affidavit of Cheryl A. Heller, Esq., Exhibit A to Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company\u2019s Motion to Disqualify Gilbert Heintz &amp; Randolph LLP as Counsel to the [ACC], the [FCR] and the Proposed Asbestos PI Trust, Dkt. No. 2284 (hereafter Heller Affidavit), and (3) would not violate its obligation to preserve confidential information obtained from Corning during the course of the representation. On a theoretical level, and acknowledging the integrity of counsel, the argument is reasonable. On a practical level, it is unrealistic to expect that confidential information of the nature involved in this case can be kept confidential or that a conflict does not exist and will not arise in the future. First, \u201cdirect conflict\u201d does not appear in any of the authorities examined by the court and the parties in favor of GHR\u2019s retention repeatedly assert that GHR has been and will continue to be adverse to Coming\u2019s insurers. Adversity to the insurers is not the linchpin, however. The test is actual or potential conflict with respect to Corning, the former client.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See In re Marvel Entertainment, supra. </em>Second, even if an actual conflict did not exist, the potential for conflict is great because the claimants represented by the ACC and the FCR have already asserted or may in the future assert claims for asbestos liability against Corning. GHR was involved in Coming\u2019s defense against these same claimants, regardless of the gloss that those arguing in favor of GHR\u2019s retention may put on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">It is also proposed that GHR may represent the Asbestos PI Trust after plan confirmation which would also place GHR in a conflict position inasmuch as it is the Asbestos PI Trust that will be\u2019 dealing with claims after plan confirmation. The Asbestos PI Trust and the ACC and/or FCR may not agree with respect to payment of certain claims which would further complicate GHR\u2019s ability to represent former or proposed clients consistently with the rules governing professional conduct. Third, the waiver executed by Corning was limited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">Corning agreed to waive any objections it might otherwise have had to GHR and [Scott] Gilbert representing ACC, FCR, and others, but only to the extent that such representation did not involve the pursuit or establishment of any asbestos-related liabilities against Corning and did not involve the disclosure of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>information that was confidential to Corning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Heller Affidavit, Dkt. No. 2284, at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Although the appearance of impropriety-alone is not a permissible basis upon which to disqualify counsel,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> in this case the impropriety goes much farther than appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">Nonetheless, one can only surmise what would be the reaction of an asbestos claimant, who alleges that his injury was caused by Corning, when he realizes that counsel hired by his court-appointed representative once was insurance counsel for the company he is suing and that counsel was privy to confidential information as to how Corning intended to defend against his suit, minimize any recovery to be paid, and assist the insurance company in defending against his suit and claim for damages. When the asbestos claimant further learns that that same counsel will be paid $30 million, without court supervision, by Coming\u2019s co-shareholder in the Debtor, the suspicion that counsel has the best interest of Corning in mind rather than that of the asbestos claimant will be heightened. The result is an unacceptable taint that will disrupt the resolution of claims and foster distrust among the real parties in interest \u2014 the asbestos claimants and their fiduciaries, the ACC and the FCR. Counsel is required by professional rules to avoid the appearance of impropriety. It is required to avoid conflicts of interest. These things it cannot do if it undertakes the proposed representation. Moreover, as stated repeatedly herein, actual and potential conflicts of interest exist which dictate that the application to retain GHR be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">Ms. Heller asserts in her affidavit that GHR\u2019s role when employed by Corning was to assist Corning with negotiations with its carriers, \u00b6 9, GHR did not hold itself out as representing Corning in the underlying asbestos actions pending against Corning, \u00b6 10, was \u201cnot involved in the defense of any particular asbestos claims on behalf of Corning, ... not involved in formulating the strategy for defending any particular asbestos cases, and Corning did not share liability-related facts regarding the defense of <em>individual </em>cases\u201d with GHR. Heller Affidavit, Dkt. No. 2284, at \u00b6 12. That the representation was not specific to any individual asbestos action is a distinction without a difference and is not dispositive, if even relevant. GHR was privy to Coming\u2019s defense strategy in general, Coming\u2019s view of its liability, and other related matters. To the extent that asbestos claimants will be pursuing non-settling insurers, GHR\u2019s prior work for Corning will place it in a conflict position. The waiver executed by Corning provides that Corning will not object to Scott Gilbert\u2019s and GHR\u2019s representation of \u201cthe ACC, FCR and other interests <em>to the extent they tvere not otherwise precluded from doing so by reason of their ethical or legal </em>responsibilities\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 14. The problem with retention of GHR by the ACC and the FCR (and later the Asbestos PI Trust) is that counsel\u2019s legal and/or ethical responsibilities to avoid conflicts of interest will be violated. While the court is certain that counsel and the firm would not intentionally breach Coming\u2019s confidence or otherwise violate legal and ethical responsibilities, we are convinced that the conflict cannot be avoided, regardless of good intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Counsel for GHR asserted that as of the time of the argument direct adversity between either two current clients or a current and former client did not exist. We disagree.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Further, although the goal may be the same \u2014 i.e., to maximize insurance proceeds \u2014 where an actual conflict exists, the employment cannot be approved. Furthermore, the court must look at the potential for conflicts and here it is great. GHR represented Corning, a shareholder of Debtor. GHR\u2019s stated proposed duties include analysis of Coming\u2019s potentially available insurance assets which of necessity include assessment of Coming\u2019s liability. To state the obvious, no insurance is available if Corning is not liable for an injury covered by the policies. GHR was privy to Coming\u2019s asbestos defense strategy. It cannot do the job for the ACC or FCR without violating, however unintentionally, its obligations to Corning, its former client.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Corning and the Claimant Entities have materially adverse interests, meeting the second conflict of interest element, notwithstanding Coming\u2019s agreement to contribute to the Asbestos PI Trust in order to obtain the benefits of an injunction through the plan confirmation process. Plan documents and plan related insurance matters remain to be finalized, increasing the potential for prejudice to either or both GHR\u2019s clients in the form of future conflicts due to GHR\u2019s dual representation. Former and current clients have materially adverse interests where the current client sued the former client. <em>Cf Internet tional Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>909 F.Supp. at 291 (former client sued current client). The individual asbestos claimants represented by the Claimant Entities, GHR\u2019s current client, sued Corning, GHR\u2019s former client, for Unibestos-related and Corhart-related injuries. Although Corning has theoretically settled its issues and so is removed from the litigation in that regard, the plan has not been confirmed. If it is not confirmed, the agreement by which Corning will resolve its asbestos liabilities through a trust contribution will not take effect and the parties will be left to other remedies which include returning to the tort system for continued litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">\n<em>The Proposed $30 Million Payment to GHR by PPG</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">There is a further issue to be addressed and that is the proposed payment by PPG to GHR<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> of $30 million, ostensibly to pursue the insurance that PPG proposes to assign to the Asbestos PI Trust. It is apparent from an examination of the Term Sheet agreed upon in this regard that the representation goes far beyond PPG\u2019s insurance issues. At the hearing on September 15, 2003, counsel for the ACC represented to the court that the ACC and the FCR want GHR to provide advice to them regarding plan related insurance matters that have to be addressed in the final versions of the plan documents and for confirmation. Under the agreement that the ACC and the FCR reached with PPG, PPG, a nondebtor and a shareholder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>of the Debtor PCC, will pay a flat fee of $30 million to GHR to represent the ACC, FCR and the postconfirmation Asbestos PI Trust (if the Asbestos PI Trust chooses to use GHR).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The agreement provides for court approval of the payment but also states that retention of GHR and payment to it will not be dependent on court approval. The retention and payment of professionals by authorized committees and the FCR are the subject of \u00a7 327, 328, \u00a7 330, and \u00a7 331. Pursuant to those sections, it is the statutory obligation of attorneys who wish to be retained to establish their qualifications, including disinterestedness. Without first doing so, GHR cannot be authorized to represent any entity in this case nor to accept a fee or payment for its services in this case from any entity. <em>See also </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129(a)(4)(requiring court approval of certain payments for services, costs or expenses in or in connection with the case or the plan).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">We further note that the agreement provides for fee sharing between GHR and Kenesis Group, LLC, a consulting firm providing financial and insurance-related services to assist clients in insurance-related asset and liability management. GHR is a majority shareholder of Kenesis. Section 504 of the Bankruptcy Code prohibits professionals from sharing compensation. Because GHR\u2019s employment and payment are not approved we need not reach the issue of whether \u00a7 504 would apply where payment of the professional is not made by the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">For the reasons stated above, GHR has an actual conflict of interest and the potential for conflicts in the future that preclude its retention. In addition, the payment proposed is prohibited whether or not the retention is approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">Because Lumbermens has not established entitlement to the protections of the common interest or joint defense doctrine, its motion to compel production of documents in connection with the application to employ GHR will be denied as moot. To the extent the motion to compel seeks production of draft plans of reorganization or draft disclosure statements, the motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">An appropriate order will be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">ORDER DENYING APPLICATION TO EMPLOY GILBERT HEINTZ &amp; RANDOLPH LLP AS SPECIAL INSURANCE COUNSEL AND DENYING IN PART THE MOTION TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS (NUMBER TWO) FILED BY LUMBERMENS MUTUAL CASUALTY COMPANY</p>\n<p id=\"b769-12\">AND NOW, this 27th day of April, 2004, it is ORDERED that the Application to Employ Gilbert Heintz &amp; Randolph LLP as Special Insurance Counsel to the Official Committee of Unsecured Asbestos Creditors and the Future Claimants\u2019 Representative Pursuant to \u00a7 1103(a), Docket No. 2345, is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-13\">It is FURTHER ORDERED that the Motion to Compel Production of Documents (Number Two) Filed by Lumber-mens Mutual Casualty Company, Docket No. 2409, is DENIED, <em>provided, however, </em>that those documents that the ACC and/or the FCR previously agreed to produce shall be produced forthwith, to the extent the documents are not subject to a privilege or have not been produced previously.

This Memorandum Opinion constitutes our findings of fact and conclusions of law. The question was raised at a hearing before the Motion to Employ Gilbert Heintz &amp; Randolph was filed whether court approval of GHR's employment is necessary inasmuch as a non-debtor third party, PPG Industries, Inc., will be paying GHR. <em>F/S Airlease II, Inc. v.

GHR\u2019s representation of the ACC and the FCR came to the court\u2019s attention when Lum-bermens filed a motion to disqualify GHR as counsel to the ACC and the FCR. Inasmuch as GHR had never filed a motion to be employed and no order had been entered approving its employment, the court advised GHR to cease representation until an application to employ was filed. We admonished GHR that if a conflict was found, it would be at risk for fees. <em>See F/S Airlease II, Inc. v. Simon, </em>844 F.2d 99 (3d Cir.1988); <em>Matter of Arkansas, Inc., </em>798 F.2d 645 (3d Cir.1986)(no payment is permitted absent an order approving retention).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b755-14\">.There is a dispute with respect to when GHR actually began its representation of the ACC and the FCR. <em>See infra. </em>As early as May of 2002 GHR was discussing with the ACC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>and/or the FCR the possibility of representing them. <em>See </em>Transcript of Video Deposition of Scott D. Gilbert dated July 18, 2003, at 161, 164. Mr. Gilbert testified that as of October 2002 details of the proposed engagement remained to be finalized and that occurred around April or May of 2003. Mr. Gilbert also testified that GHR did some \"preliminaiy work\u201d on behalf of the ACC at the end of 2002 but that the firm was not compensated for this work. <em>Id. </em>at 165.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b756-6\">. The ACC and the FCR reached an agreement with PPG whereby PPG would pay a flat fee ($30 million) to GHR to represent the postconfirmation Asbestos PI Trust in the pursuit of insurance that PPG was assigning to the trust. In the meantime, GHR would represent the ACC and the FCR. Whether GHR would represent the Asbestos PI Trust would be decided by the Asbestos PI Trust. <em>See also </em>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company\u2019s Objection to Application ... to Retain [GHR] as Special Insurance Counsel, Dkt.

Coming\u2019s Response and Objection to Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company Interrogatories (Set No. One), Directed to Corning Incorporated is attached to Lumbermens\u2019 objection to the application to retain GHR and states that \u201d[u]pon information and belief, GHR last rendered substantive legal services to Corning on or about July 23, 2002. Subsequent to July 23, 2002, there were one or perhaps two short telephone calls with GHR in October 2002 and a brief telephone call with GHR on March 26, 2003.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8, Response to Interrogatoiy No. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b757-7\">. We note that the title of Docket No. 2281 in the docket entry does not match the title of the Brief in Opposition that was filed at that docket number. This makes it very difficult to locate the pleading on the docket. We were able to do so after considerable searching, however, and verified that the document at Docket No. 2281 is the brief in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b760-8\">. The joint defense doctrine, a/k/a the \"common interest doctrine\u201d, asserted here involves discovery disputes that are intertwined with the issues surrounding the opposition to the retention of GHR.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\">. To further illustrate the disparity in interests, the court notes that the insurers have raised the argument that by facilitating GHR's representation of Coming's adversaries (those represented by the ACC and the FCR) Corning has left itself open to a charge that it has undermined its duty to cooperate with its insurer(s) or its duty to assist in the defense of claims brought against it. If the insurers prove this assertion in coverage litigation, it may affect their obligation to pay under the policies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b763-8\">. At the hearing on September 15, 2003, there were allegations by insurers that GHR has already breached Coming's confidentiality. However, Corning did not raise it and so we need not address it or make findings regarding this point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b763-9\">. Rule 1.9 regarding conflict of interest in relation to a former client provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-10\">A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter: (a) represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person's interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client consents after a full disclosure of the circumstances and consultation; or (b) use information relating to the representation to the disadvantage of the former client except as Rule 1.6 would permit with respect to a client or when the information has become generally known.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-14\">The comment to Rule 1.9 provides in part: After termination of a client-lawyer relationship, a lawyer may not represent another client except in conformity with this Rule. The principles in Rule 1.7 determine whether the interests of the present and former client are adverse.... The underlying question is whether the lawyer was so involved in the matter that the subsequent representation can be justly regarded as a changing of sides in the matter in question.... Disqualification from subsequent representation is for the protection of clients and can be waived by them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b766-5\">.
