Moore\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising three issues but stating that he finds no meritorious grounds for appeal. The Government did not file an answering brief, and although he was advised of his right to do so, Moore did not file a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-22\">Moore, through counsel, asserts that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence. We find that Moore\u2019s sentence, which was imposed within the properly calculated Guidelines range and was the statutory mandatory minimum, was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-23\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Moore\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy there of was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
