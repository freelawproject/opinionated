Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At our request, Defendant-Appellant Jose Antonio Contreras-Terrazas has submitted a supplemental letter brief addressing the impact of <em>Booker. </em>The government has submitted a motion to reinstate our prior affirmance of his conviction and sentence, which Contreras-Terrazas opposes. For the following reasons, we find that <em>Booker </em>does not affect Contreras-Terrazas\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">Contreras-Terrazas pleaded guilty to reentering the United States unlawfully following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). The district court increased Contreras-Terrazas\u2019s offense level under the Guidelines because he had a prior aggravated felony conviction, and the court ultimately sentenced him to 50 months imprisonment. Contreras-Terrazas appealed his conviction challenging the constitutionality of the statute under which he was convicted. We affirmed in an unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Contreras-Terrazas then obtained Supreme Court review on both his conviction and the constitutionality of his sentence under <em>Booker. </em>As noted above, the Supreme Court remanded to us for reconsideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Contreras-Terrazas raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time in his petition for certiorari. Therefore, we will not review his <em>Booker </em>claim absent \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The extraordinary circumstances standard is more demanding than the plain error review that we employ when a defendant has raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, if a defendant cannot satisfy plain error review, he certainly cannot satisfy extraordinary circumstances review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Contreras-Terrazas argues that the extraordinary circumstances review is inapplicable in this ease for a variety of reasons. As his claim does not survive plain error review, we need not address his objections to the extraordinary circumstances standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-15\">Under plain error review, we will not remand for resentencing unless there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the circumstances meet all three criteria, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error, but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since <em>Booker, </em>sentencing under mandatory Guidelines constitutes (1) error, and that error is (2) plain.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry in which the defendant bears the burden of proof, and he carries his burden if he can \u201cdemonstrate a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>dence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant demonstrates such a probability when he identifies from the record an indication that the sentencing judge would have reached a significantly different result under an advisory Guidelines scheme.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">In his supplemental letter brief, Contreras-Terrazas concedes that he cannot carry his burden under the third prong of the plain error test. Specifically, Contreras-Terrazas is unable to point to any indication in the record that there is a probability that the sentencing judge would have sentenced him differently under an advisory Guidelines scheme. Instead, he urges us to abandon the standard of review we adopted in <em>Mares </em>and instead apply the plain error standard employed by, <em>inter alia, </em>the Fourth Circuit. <em>Mares, </em>however, is the settled law of this circuit, and we can revisit it only en banc or following a Supreme Court decision that effectively overturns it. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">As there exist no extraordinary circumstances or other grounds for relief, Contreras-Terrazas\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED. The government\u2019s motion to reinstate our prior affirmance is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b75-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
