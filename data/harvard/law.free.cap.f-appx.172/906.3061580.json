Plaintiff appeals the district court\u2019s orders (1) dismissing his claims for money damages as barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity, and (2) granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants on his claim for injunctive relief. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-14\">In his complaint, Plaintiff claimed that he was a <em>pro se </em>litigant in four civil cases before the state circuit court. According to Plaintiff, Defendants, including court administrator Matthew Benefiel and assistant court administrator Chuck Hyadovitz, violated his constitutional rights, particularly his right to equal protection and to due process, when they denied him continuing access to the court\u2019s Self Help Center, a facility in the courthouse provided to all <em>pro se </em>litigants. Plaintiff contended that this denial prevented him from preparing for hearings in his civil cases at the state circuit court. Defendants countered that Plaintiff was barred from the Center because he repeatedly had engaged in disruptive and inappropriate conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-15\">We conclude that the district court correctly dismissed Plaintiffs claims for money damages as barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity. Plaintiff argues that the court administration is not an arm of the state of Florida but is a local branch of government: he contends that funding for the court administration predominantly is local and that its controlling officials are elected locally.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-16\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss <em>de novo; </em>and we take as true the facts as alleged in the complaint. <em>Owens v. Samkle Auto., Inc., </em>425 F.3d 1318, 1320 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cThe Eleventh Amendment protects a State from being sued in federal court without the State\u2019s consent.\u201d <em>Manders v. Lee, </em>338 F.3d 1304, 1308 (11th Cir.2003)(en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1107, 124 S.Ct. 1061, 157 L.Ed.2d 892 (2004). Eleventh Amendment immunity also bars suits brought in federal court against defendants acting as an \u201carm of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>the State,\u201d which includes agents and instrumentalities of the State even though these entities are not labeled a \u201cstate officer\u201d or \u201cstate official.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To determine whether an entity is an \u201carm of the State\u201d for Eleventh Amendment purposes, this Court examines: \u201c(1) how state law defines the entity; (2) what degree of control the State maintains over the entity; (3) where the entity derives its funds; and (4) who is responsible for judgments against the entity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1309.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">At least three of the <em>Manders </em>elements weigh in favor of Eleventh Amendment immunity for Defendants. First, Florida law addressing payment of judgments against certain public employees defines \u201cagency of the state\u201d or \u201cstate agency\u201d as including the judicial branch. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 111.071(3). Florida law also indicates that the court administration of a circuit court \u2014 and its employees \u2014 are part of the \u201cstate courts system.\u201d <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 25.382. The first <em>Manders </em>element weighs in favor of Defendants: they are part of the \u201cstate courts system,\u201d which, as a component of the judicial branch, is a state agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">Second, the State exercises substantial control over Defendants. State court administrators are appointed and terminated by the Chief Judge of the Circuit Court, a state officer who is responsible to the Chief Justice of the Florida Supreme Court, which, as part of the judicial branch, is considered a state agency. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 111.071(3); Fla.R.Jud.Admin. 2.050(d). Benefiel stated that his salary is paid by the State of Florida, that he participates in the state retirement system, that he receives no compensation from a county or municipality, and that all directives and instructions for fulfilling his role as court administrator come exclusively from the Chief Judge. And Hyadovitz, as assistant court administrator, reports to Benefiel.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Third, the record is inconclusive about whether the Ninth Judicial Circuit derived its funding from the state at the time Plaintiff filed his complaint. Benefiel is paid by the state and participates in the state retirement program. But the record is silent on who pays Hyadovitz\u2019s salary. And by a constitutional amendment occurring after Plaintiff filed suit, the State assumed some portions of court system funding previously provided by counties. <em>See </em>Fla. Const. Art. 5, \u00a7 14(b), (c). Given that, as the district court stated, \u201c[fjunding for Florida\u2019s judicial branch is in flux,\u201d we cannot determine on this record whether the third <em>Manders </em>element favors immunity for Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">Fourth, the record shows that the state treasury would be responsible for money judgments against Defendants. <em>See Manders, </em>338 F.3d at 1327 n. 51 (noting that, under Supreme Court precedent, \u201cthe state treasury factor is a \u2018core concern\u2019 of Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence\u201d). Florida has a Risk Management Trust Fund that provides insurance for, among other things, \u201cfederal civil rights actions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 or other similar federal statutes.\u201d <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 284.30. This fund covers all state departments and their employees. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 284.31. As we stated, under Florida law, the judicial branch is a state agency. And the state court system \u2014 including employees of the circuit courts \u2014 is part of the judicial branch. Thus, the Risk Management Trust Fund would cover circuit court administrators and their staffs. Furthermore, Benefiel and the circuit court\u2019s counsel, Robin Berghorn, stated that, in their experience, judgments rendered against the court administrator or his staff would be paid by the State out of the Risk Management Trust Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>The <em>Manders </em>analysis weighs in favor of Eleventh Amendment immunity for Defendants. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Plaintiffs claims for money damages was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Plaintiff also challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants on his claims for injunctive relief. He argues that Defendants, in denying him access to the Self-Help Center, violated his due process rights by not posting rules against some of the conduct for which he was banned from the Center. Thus, he claims that he was denied meaningful access to the court system. And he contends that his equal protection rights were violated when he was asked to leave the Center and later issued a trespass warning. Plaintiff suggests that, as a <em>pro se </em>litigant, he should be afforded the same status as prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo; </em>we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Kelley v. Hicks, </em>400 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2005). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">We first conclude that Plaintiff suffered no due process violation: Plaintiff has no constitutional right to be provided access to the Self-Help Center and its resources. We are aware that the right of access to the courts is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Tennessee v. Lane, </em>541 U.S. 509, 124 S.Ct. 1978, 1988, 158 L.Ed.2d 820 (2004). And the Supreme Court has written that, for prisoner litigants, the right of access to the courts \u201crequires prison authorities to assist inmates in the preparation and filing of meaningful legal papers by providing prisoners with adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the law.\u201d <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 1498, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977). But Plaintiff is not a prisoner or in custody of the state: he differs from prisoner litigants because he has freedom to move about and to seek access to additional sources of information and assistance apart from a prison law library.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-11\">We also observe that Plaintiff was not denied meaningful access to the courthouse. Plaintiff did not assert that he was prevented from filing papers and from attending hearings in his cases. Instead, Plaintiff alleged that he was denied access to the Center, which he deemed necessary for his hearing preparation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But we doubt that the Center, with its limited resources, is essential for assisting <em>pro se </em>litigants in preparing for their hearings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Evidence in the record shows that a nearby public library provided legal research materials. We are aware of no constitutional requirement for government officials to provide non-prisoner, <em>pro se </em>litigants with access to a facility like the Self-Help Center. We discern no due process violation: the substantive constitutional right that Plaintiff seeks to enforce does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">We also reject Plaintiffs claim that his equal protection rights as a <em>pro se </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>litigant were violated. No fundamental constitutional right and no suspect classification is involved: the Equal Protection Clause thus requires only that Defendants\u2019 treatment of Plaintiff be rationally related to a legitimate government interest. <em>See Lofton v. Sec\u2019y of Dep\u2019t of Children &amp; Family Servs., </em>358 F.3d 804, 818 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 1081, 125 S.Ct. 869, 160 L.Ed.2d 825 (2005). Here, Defendants assert that their exclusion of Plaintiff from the Center was rationally related to the legitimate interest of maintaining order and security at the Center. We agree with Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Plaintiff disputes some of the misconduct that Defendants have proffered to justify his exclusion from the Center. But he does not deny that he switched the homepage of a Center computer from the Orange County website to <em>www.hell.org </em>and that he left this address on the monitor. Plaintiff also does not dispute that Defendants received complaints about his behavior from other Center patrons.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiffs later statement that he \u201cdid not curse <em>at </em>anyone\u201d (emphasis added) does not rebut this evidence. Plaintiff also admitted that he was involved in an altercation with other Center users, although he claimed that he was not at fault. And Plaintiffs statements that his behavior never was \u201cunacceptable,\u201d or \u201cconcerning or suspicious,\u201d are too conclusory to create an issue of fact about whether Defendants received complaints about his conduct from other Center users. <em>See Leigh v. Warner Bros., Inc., </em>212 F.3d 1210, 1217 (11th Cir.2000) (stating that unsupported conclusory statements have no probative value in opposing summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">In sum, the district court properly dismissed Plaintiffs claims for money damages as barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Defendants on Plaintiffs claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-8\">. The trespass warning Plaintiff received did not ban him from the courthouse for official county business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b935-9\">. The Center is a small room within the courthouse provided as a courtesy to the public. The Center contains three computers with internet access, tables and cubicles, telephones, a facsimile machine, and a copy machine supplied by the Orange County Bar Association. The computers do not link to court files or to the court\u2019s clerk\u2019s office, and the Center does not provide unique access to legal research.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b936-5\">. Plaintiff stated in an affidavit \"I am very sorry if I used profanity that other people heard and were offended about. I don't remember, sometimes I just think out loud[,] especially when there\u2019s noone [sic] else to talk to or bounce ideas off of.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b936-6\">. We reject Plaintiff\u2019s argument that the district court erred in denying his motion to amend the complaint to add claims against Benefiel and Hyadovitz in their individual capacities, filed after the district court dismissed his claims for money damages against Defendants in their official capacities. As Plaintiff showed no violation of his constitutional rights, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint. See <em>Bryant v. Dupree, 252 </em>F.3d 1161, 1163 (11th Cir.2001) (stating that district court need not allow amendment where, among other things, amendment would be futile).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
