Briggs appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) complaint. The district court referred this case to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) (2000). The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Briggs that failure to file timely objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Briggs failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned of the consequence of failure to object. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985). Briggs has waived appellate review by failing to file objections after receiving proper notice. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b543-12\"> In response to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, Briggs filed a notice of appeal. That notice of appeal was interlocutory when filed; however, the district court's subsequent entry of judgment prior to this court\u2019s consideration of the appeal cures the defect in jurisdiction. <em>See Equipment Fin. Group, Inc. v. Traverse Computer Brokers, </em>973 F.2d 345, 347 (4th Cir. 1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
