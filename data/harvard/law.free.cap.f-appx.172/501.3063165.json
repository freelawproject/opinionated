On appeal, he asserts that the evidence was insufficient to show that he knowingly possessed the firearm in question. After a review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-23\">A verdict must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201cthat evidence which \u2018a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996)). We review both direct and circumstantial evidence and permit \u201cthe [Government the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established.\u201d <em>United States v. Tresvant, </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-24\">Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) (2000) prohibits the possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of \u201ca crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>one year.\u201d Possession may be actual or constructive. <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 878 (4th Cir.1992) (possession of a controlled substance). When the Government seeks to establish constructive possession, it must prove that the defendant \u201cintentionally exercised dominion and control over the firearm, or had the power and the intention to exercise dominion and control over the firearm.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>424 F.3d 431, 435-36 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 779, 163 L.Ed.2d 604 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">In support of his argument that there was insufficient evidence that he was in knowing possession of the firearm, Davis chiefly relies on our decision in <em>United States v. Blue, </em>957 F.2d 106 (4th Cir.1992). In <em>Blue, </em>we found that an officer\u2019s testimony that Blue\u2019s shoulder dipped as the officer approached the vehicle in which Blue was a passenger and the fact the gun was found under the passenger seat where Blue had been sitting did not alone support a finding of constructive possession. <em>Id. </em>at 107-08. We explained that, in order to \u201cuphold a finding of constructive possession, this court requires more evidence of dominion and control than the government has offered here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, we noted that \u201c[i]n reaching this decision, we emphasize that the facts of this case fall outside, but just barely, the realm of the quantum of evidence necessary to support a finding of constructive possession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">In this case, there is substantially more evidence than the two pieces of evidence that were available in <em>Blue. </em>Davis was driving the vehicle in question, and the firearm was in plain sight and touching his foot. In addition, after Davis was seen bending over in his seat, the firearm was found moved from the right side of the driver\u2019s seat to the left side and tucked under the seat. Moreover, when questioned about the gun, Davis stated unequivocally that it was not in the car. He did not state that he was unaware of the car\u2019s contents or that, to his knowledge, there was no gun in the car. Instead, his response gave the impression that he was aware of the contents of the car. Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to reach the conclusion that Davis was in possession of the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">Accordingly, we affirm. We deny Davis\u2019s motions to relieve counsel, to appoint new counsel, and to file a supplemental brief. Davis must pursue any claims he has against his trial or appellate counsel in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
