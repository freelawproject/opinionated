The district court dismissed Base/s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 civil rights complaint without prejudice as barred by the three-strikes bar of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) and this court\u2019s prior sanction order.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-15\">For the first time in his IFP motion, Basey alleges that the defendants have retaliated against him by administering contaminated food trays, drugs, and psychotropic medication in his food. He also argues for the first time that the defendants have refused to adhere to a medical directive that he be placed in a single cell, that he went on a \u201chunger strike,\u201d that the defendants refused to give him medical attention following surgery, and that the defendants spread rumors about his homosexuality. These arguments will not be addressed for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">This court has previously sanctioned Basey for filing frivolous pleadings, and Basey does not dispute that he received three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Basey v. Collins, </em>77 F.3d 476 (5th Cir. 1995) (unpublished); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Therefore, to proceed IFP on appeal, he must demonstrate that he is under threat of imminent danger or serious bodily injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-17\">Basey renews his argument that his life endangerment request has been ignored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>and that his attempt to get a transfer to a different housing facility has been denied. Basey does not allege in his IFP motion facts showing that he was under threat of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d at the time he filed his notice of appeal or IFP motion. <em>See Ba\u00f1os v. O\u2019Guin, </em>144 F.3d 883, 884 (5th Cir.1998). Accordingly, Basey is not entitled to proceed IFP on appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">In his request for an injunction and a prison unit transfer, Basey argues that he is in \u201cimminent danger\u201d due to an assault by prison officials on March 7, 2005. He filed his request for an injunction on March 17, 2005. Basey names three specific offenders and alleges that his neck injury required x-rays on March 9 or 10, 2005. Basey argues that this attack was in retaliation for the filing of his civil rights complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">There is no evidence in the record to support Basey\u2019s allegations. Rather, the record contains evidence of one housing transfer at Basey\u2019s request, a history of grievance responses indicating that Basey had failed to abide by direct orders from prison officials, and investigations finding that Basey\u2019s life endangerment claims were meritless. Although the record and Basey\u2019s exhibits include medical records, neither the exhibits nor the records reference any March assault. Moreover, none of Basey\u2019s grievances mention his offenders from the March assault. Therefore, Basey\u2019s motion for an injunction is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Basey\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">In light of the prior sanctions imposed against Basey, he is now ordered to pay sanctions in the amount of $255, the appellate filing fee cost, payable to the clerk of this court. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 3. The clerk of this court and the clerks of all federal district courts within this circuit are directed to refuse to file any pro se civil complaint or appeal by Basey unless Basey submits proof of satisfaction of this sanction. If Basey attempts to file any further notices of appeal or original proceedings in this court without such proof the clerk will docket them for administrative purposes only. Any other submissions which do not show proof that the sanction has been paid will neither be addressed nor acknowledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">IFP AND INJUNCTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b609-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
