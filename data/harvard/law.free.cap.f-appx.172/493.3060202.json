Fed. RApp. P. 4(b)(1)(A). With or without a motion, the district court may grant an extension of time to file of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-26\">The district court entered its judgment on March 31, 2004; Dozier filed his notice of appeal in March 2005. The district court granted no extension of time to appeal, nor did Dozier request an extension or make a showing of excusable neglect to explain why he did not file his notice of appeal until a year after the entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-27\">We therefore dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court requires that counsel inform Dozier, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ther review. If Dozier requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Dozier. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b519-19\"> Dozier's attorney submitted a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue. Dozier also filed a pro se supplemental brief raising additional issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
