Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>At our request, the parties have commented on the impact of <em>Booker. </em>We conclude that <em>Booker </em>does not affect the sentence re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>ceived by Defendant-Appellant Jose Luis Cano-Robledo (\u201cCano-Robledo\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">Cano-Robledo pleaded guilty to and was convicted of being found in the United States after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), which carries a maximum penalty of two years\u2019 imprisonment and one year of supervised release. Cano-Robledo\u2019s Presentencing Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated his offense level to be 21, his criminal history category to be TV, and his resulting sentencing range under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cthe Guidelines\u201d or \u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) to be 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment. In arriving at that sentencing range, the PSR recommended, and the district court imposed, (1) a 16-level increase in Cano-Robledo\u2019s offense level because he had previously been deported from the United States after being convicted of a crime of violence; (2) a two-point increase in his criminal history points because, at the time of the instant \u00a7 1326(a) violation, Cano-Robledo was under supervised release from a previous federal conviction; and (3) a one-point increase in his criminal history points because Cano-Robledo committed the instant \u00a7 1326(a) violation less than two years after being released from a term of imprisonment. Cano-Robledo did not object on Sixth Amendment grounds to the district court\u2019s reliance on these facts in sentencing him. The district court sentenced Cano-Robledo at the bottom of the Guidelines\u2019 sentencing range, imposing a sentence of 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 supervised release, and a $100 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">In addition to sentencing Cano-Robledo for the \u00a7 1326(a) offense, the district court also revoked the remainder of his supervised release and sentenced him to an additional eight months imprisonment to run <em>concurrently </em>with his 57 month sentence. Section 7B1.3(f) of the Guidelines specifically states that \u201cany term of imprisonment imposed upon the revocation of ... supervised release shall be ordered to be served <em>consecutively </em>to any sentence of imprisonment that the defendant is serving.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But, unlike most of the pre-Roo&amp;er sections of the Guidelines, \u00a7 7B1.3(f) was and is a wow-binding policy statement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court thus took it into consideration, but chose not to follow its recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">Cano-Robledo then appealed his sentence to us, contending that it violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. He acknowledged that our precedent foreclosed his argument, but he raised it to preserve possible Supreme Court review. In that appeal, Cano-Robledo did not assert a Sixth Amendment challenge to the district court\u2019s reliance, for sentencing purposes, on facts neither admitted by him nor proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. We affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment in an unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-11\">Cano-Robledo then petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. After the Court handed down <em>Booker, </em>he filed a supplemental petition for certiorari in which, for the first time, he raised a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number><em>Booker </em>challenge to his mandatory Guidelines sentence. The Supreme Court granted Cano-Robledo\u2019s petition, vacated our judgment affirming his sentence, and remanded for our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We again affirm Cano-Robledo\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Avt\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">As Cano-Robledo raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time in his supplemental petition for certiorari, we will review it only in the presence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The precise contours of \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d review remain undefined in this Circuit. We do know, however, that the extraordinary circumstances standard is more difficult to meet than the plain error standard.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If Cano-Robledo is unable to meet the requirements of plain error review, then, he certainly cannot satisfy the requirements of extraordinary circumstances review.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And, although it is a close question whether Cano-Robledo satisfies plain error review, we hold that he has not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-16\">Under plain error review, we will not remand for resentencing unless there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If the circumstances in a case meet all three criteria, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under <em>Booker, </em>a district court\u2019s enhancement of a defendant\u2019s sentence beyond the statutory maximum in reliance on facts not admitted by the defendant or found by a jury (1) constitutes error (2) that is plain.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry <em>in </em>which the defendant bears the burden of proof. He will carry this burden only if he can \u201cshow[ ] that the error \u2018must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That may be shown, in turn, by the defendant\u2019s \u201cdemonstrat[ion of] a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To demonstrate such a probability, the defendant must identify in the record an indication that the \u201csentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory [Guidelines] scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> By all accounts, this burden is \u201cdifficult\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u2014 but not impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>sible<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u2014 to meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Cano-Robledo insists that he meets the requisites of plain error review. Even if he has, though, we are not operating under a plain error standard \u2014 we shall review Cano-Robledo\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim only in the presence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And, even if Cano-Robledo is correct that he meets the lower plain error standard, he barely does, and certainly not in a manner that presents the kind of extraordinary circumstances in which we will review a claim raised for the first time in a petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Cano-Robledo calls to our attention (1) \u201cthe mitigating circumstances surrounding [his] illegal reentry offense,\u201d (2) the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range, (3) the district court\u2019s comments at his sentencing, and (4) the district court\u2019s decision to impose a concurrent (rather than consecutive) sentence for his supervised release violation. We reject outright Cano-Robledo\u2019s first argument. His \u201cmitigating circumstances\u201d \u2014 namely, that he illegally \u201creturned to the United States because his wife was pregnant and about to give birth,\u201d and that he was \u201cborn in Mexico, which is a poor country\u201d \u2014 say nothing about the district court\u2019s likely willingness to impose a lower sentence under an advisory set of Guidelines. Moreover, Cano-Robledo is unable to point to anything in the record supporting such a conclusion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">Cumulatively, however, Cano-Robledo\u2019s remaining arguments are more persuasive. First, Cano-Robledo points out that at his sentencing, the district court seemed to express sympathy for the harsh sentence compelled by the Guidelines. In response to Cano-Robledo\u2019s complaint that he would be sentenced to \u201c57 to 71 months only for intending to come here to work to do something for [his] son\u201d while \u201cpeople who bring drugs across are getting 22 months,\u201d the court stated that it <em>\u201cunderstand^ his] concerns.\u201d </em>Nevertheless, said the court, \u201cyou have to understand that the law is the law.... [E]very time you cross [the border illegally], based on the laws of the United States, the sentence just increases and increases and increases.\u201d Second, Cano-Robledo contends that the district court\u2019s decision to order his \u00a7 1326(a) and revocation sentences to run concurrently \u201cdemonstrate^ that it believed the revocation offense warranted a lesser sentence than called for by the advisory revocation guidelines.\u201d That, insists Cano-Robledo, demonstrates \u201cat least a reasonable probability that, had it understood all the guidelines to be advisory, the court would have shown leniency regarding [his \u00a7 1326(a)] sentence as well.\u201d Finally, Cano-Robledo emphasizes the fact that the district court sentenced him at the bottom of the Guidelines\u2019 sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-13\">Taken individually, each of Cano-Robledo\u2019s arguments would fail.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>together, it is at least arguable that the record demonstrates a sufficient probability that the \u201csentencing judge \u2014 sentencing under an advisory [Guidelines] scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We need not, however, resolve this question because, even if Cano-Robledo has met his burden under plain error review, he has not presented sufficiently extraordinary circumstances for us to consider his <em>Booker </em>claim. In fact, he has made no effort to explain how his circumstances are extraordinary. We therefore conclude that he has not met his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Cano-Robledo concludes by disagreeing with the mechanics of the plain error standard we announced in <em>Mares. </em>He recognizes that our precedent forecloses this argument, but nonetheless raises the point to preserve a challenge to our plain error standard. <em>Mares </em>is the settled law of this Circuit, however, and we may revisit it only <em>en bane </em>or following a Supreme Court decision that actually or effectively overturns it.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">As Cano-Robledo has not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances or other grounds for relief, we AFFIRM his sentence. The Government\u2019s pending motions to reinstate our prior affirmance and, in the alternative, to extend time to file its supplemental brief, are DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b655-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

The significance of any factual differences is, of course, borne out in the sentences imposed: Bringier was sentenced to a Guideline-minimum 30 years' imprisonment, compared to Cano-Robledo\u2019s 57 months.
