This court lacks jurisdiction to consider the denial of Syed\u2019s application for asylum because the BIA denied the application as untimely. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Syed does not challenge the adverse credibility finding which formed the basis for the denial of his applications for withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). He has therefore abandoned any such challenge. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>see also Soadjede v.
