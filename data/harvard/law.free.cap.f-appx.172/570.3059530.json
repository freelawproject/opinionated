Escobar-Gaeta argues that the sentences vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>late <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We conclude that Escobar-Gaeta\u2019s objections to his sentence in the district court preserved his arguments for appellate review. <em>United States v. Olis, </em>429 F.3d 540, 544 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 375-76 (5th Cir.2005). When reviewing a <em>Booker </em>claim that has been preserved, we will ordinarily vacate and remand unless the Government can show beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 285 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The imposition of a sentence based on facts exceeding those stipulated by Escobar-Gaeta when he pleaded guilty was erroneous. <em>Id. </em>The Government\u2019s brief does not address the issue of harmless error, and our review of the record reveals nothing to suggest that the <em>Booker </em>error did not influence the district court\u2019s selection of a sentence. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, Escobar-Gaeta\u2019s sentences are VACATED and this matter is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b596-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
