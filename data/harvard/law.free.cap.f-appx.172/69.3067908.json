He seeks to challenge his sentence based on <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-23\">Merchant asserts that the merits of his appeal should be addressed despite an appeal waiver in his plea agreement. He argues that the appeal waiver, which was entered before the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker, </em>was not informed and voluntary because the waiver was based on the erroneous advice that the Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory and that the district court was required to issue a sentence in conformity with those Guidelines. This argument is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 450-51 (5th Cir.2005). Merchant\u2019s appeal waiver is enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-16\">As part of his plea agreement, Merchant waived his right to appeal on any ground set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, with the exception of an upward departure. Merchant\u2019s sentence did not constitute an upward departure. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746-47 (5th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, we dismiss Merchant\u2019s appeal because it is barred by the waiver contained in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-17\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b95-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
