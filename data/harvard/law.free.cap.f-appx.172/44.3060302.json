Marrufo-Gutierrez opposes the Government\u2019s motion. For the following reasons, we find that <em>Booker </em>does not affect Marrufo-Gutierrez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-26\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b70-27\">Marrufo-Gutierrez pled guilty to and was convicted of being in the United States unlawfully following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. This offense carries a maximum penalty of two years\u2019 imprisonment and one year of supervised release. Marrufo-Gutierrez had a prior conviction for illegal reentry, which under \u00a7 1326(b)(1) triggered an increase in the statutory maximum term of imprisonment and supervised release. It also resulted in a four-level enhancement to the Guidelines offense level, which, combined with Marrufo-Gutierrez\u2019s criminal history score, produced a Guidelines sentencing range of 21 to 27 months. The district court imposed a sentence of 27 months\u2019 imprisonment to be followed by three years\u2019 supervised release. Marrufo-Gutierrez objected to the sentence on the ground that it exceeded the statutory maximum, which objection the district court overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-28\">Marrufo-Gutierrez appealed his conviction and sentence, arguing that because the indictment did not state a \u00a7 1326(b)(1) offense because it did not allege a prior conviction, his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum in violation of the Constitution. In the alternative he challenged the constitutional validity of \u00a7 1326(b)(1). In his brief on appeal Marrufo-Gutierrez acknowledged that his arguments were foreclosed by precedent, but raised them only to preserve them for possible review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>by the Supreme Court. We affirmed the conviction and sentence in an unpublished opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Marrufo-Gutierrez then petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. After <em>Booker </em>was decided, Marrufo-Gutierrez submitted a supplemental petition for certiorari in which he challenged his mandatory Guideline sentence. As noted above, the Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded to this court for further consideration in light of <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AgQ\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Marrufo-Gutierrez raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time in his supplemental petition for certiorari. Therefore, we will not review his <em>Booker </em>claim absent \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The extraordinary circumstances standard is more demanding than the plain error review that we employ when a defendant has raised his <em>Booker </em>claim for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Therefore, if a defendant cannot satisfy the plain error standard, he certainly cannot satisfy the extraordinary circumstances standard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As Marrufo-Gutierrez\u2019s claim does not survive plain error review, we need not address the question of extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Under plain error review, we will not remand for resentencing unless there is \u201c(1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If the circumstances meet all three criteria, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error, but only if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since <em>Booker, </em>sentencing under mandatory Guidelines (1) constitutes error, and (2) that error is plain.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Whether the error affects substantial rights is a more complex inquiry in which the defendant bears the burden of proof. He carries his burden if he can \u201cdemonstrate a probability \u2018sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant demonstrates such a probability when he identifies from the record an indication that the sentencing judge would have reached a significantly different result under an advisory Guidelines scheme.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-15\">B. Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b71-16\">In his supplemental letter brief, Marrufo-Gutierrez concedes that \u201cthe district court imposed [a] sentence at the top of [the Guidelines] range, and it gave no indication that it would have given a lower sentence in an advisory system.\u201d He further acknowledges that he cannot satisfy the plain error standard we articulated in <em>Mares, </em>but expresses his disagreement with that decision in order to preserve a challenge for possible Supreme Court review. <em>Mares </em>is the settled law of this circuit and we may revisit it only <em>en banc </em>or following a Supreme Court decision that effectively overturns it.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">As there exist no extraordinary circumstances or other grounds for relief, Marrufo-Gutierrez\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion to reinstate our prior affirmance is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b70-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
