Clemente\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Clemente contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Clemente properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Clemente correctly asserts that the written judgment does not reflect the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement that his sentence is to run concurrently with the sentence he received for the revocation of supervised release. Any error, however, is harmless because the written judgment in the revocation of supervised release case states that the sentence from that case is to run concurrently with the sentence imposed in this case. <em>See United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 376-77 (5th Cir.2005) (mistake that does not prejudice defendant is harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b607-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
