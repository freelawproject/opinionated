Kimberlin filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000), which the district court construed as a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), and dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Although the district court construed the \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion, Kimberlin clearly intended to file a \u00a7 2241 petition. Kimberlin asserts on appeal that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and ineffective to test the legality of his detention and contends that his claims should be considered in the context of his \u00a7 2241 petition. Because Kimberlin does not meet the standard set forth in <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333-34 (4th Cir.2000), we affirm the denial of relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
