We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Pailin\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Parties are accorded thirty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v.

Pailin\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on September 2, 2005.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Pailin failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b49-10\"> For the purpose of this appeal, we accept as true Pailin\u2019s statement in his informal brief on appeal, that he delivered his notice of appeal to prison officials for mailing on September 2, 2005. <em>See </em>Fed.
