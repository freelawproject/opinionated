Turnbow\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that the SSA Appeals Council and the magistrate judge erred in not considering the new evidence that she presented to the Appeals Council after the administrative law judge rendered her opinion. Turn-bow\u2019s argument is without merit: Under <em>Higginbotham v. Barnhart, </em>a district court should review additional information that a petitioner submits to the Appeals Council after the ALJ has reached a decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under <em>Falco v. Shalala, </em>however, this rule applies only if the new information relates to the time period for which the benefits were sought.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the Appeals Council and the district court are under no obligation to review information submitted for the first time to the Appeals Council when, as here, it relates only to the subsequent deterioration of a previously non-disabling condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">The remainder of Turnbow\u2019s arguments on appeal are without merit; and, after reviewing the record, we affirm for the reasons given by the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
