We find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>that the district court did not clearly err in finding Paz-Barona ineligible for safety-valve relief, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 (2004), and so imposing the statutory mandatory minimum sentence for her offense. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Paz-Barona pled guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement with the government, to importing 100 grams or more of heroin. In a plea agreement, she and the government agreed that the government, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 (\u201csafety-valve\u201d), would recommend to the district court that Paz-Barona be sentenced within the calculated guideline range without regard to the statutory mandatory minimum sentence for her offense, \u201cprovided that ... not later than the time of the sentencing hearing [Paz-Barona] provide[d] to the [government] a written statement truthfully setting forth all information and evidence she ha[d] concerning the offense ... that [was] part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan as charged in the indictment.\u201d Rl-14 at 3. At Paz-Barona\u2019s plea hearing, the government and Paz-Barona\u2019s counsel both stated that they believed the safety-valve provision was likely to apply. R2 at 7. Nevertheless, the court informed Paz-Barona that, unless the safety-valve provision applied, she would be subject to \u201ca mandatory minimum sentence of five years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Paz-Barona said that she understood the possible penalties. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">According to the presentence investigation done by the probation office, Paz-Barona and her sister had arrived at the Miami International Airport on a flight from Cali, Colombia. During an inspection by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials, an x-ray revealed that Paz-Barona had foreign objects in her lower intestine. The officials transported Paz-Barona to a hospital where she expelled nine pellets that contained 271.5 grams of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">After her arrest, Paz-Barona provided a written acceptance of responsibility. According to this statement, she and her sister were contacted by some people she knew, who knew of her difficult financial situation, and, after some discussion, got her to agree to smuggle the drugs into the country. <em>See </em>R-3 at 4, 7. Based on Paz-Barona\u2019s offense conduct, the probation officer assigned a base offense level of 26, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7). This was decreased by three, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b), for her acceptance of responsibility and timely notice of her intent to plead guilty. The probation office also determined, however, that she had not met the requirements for application of the safety-valve provision. With an adjusted offense level of 23, and a criminal history category of I, Paz-Barona\u2019s resulting guideline range was 46 to 57 months imprisonment, but the statutory mandatory minimum was five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Prior to the sentencing hearing, in response to the finding that Paz-Barona had not met the requirements for application of the safety-valve provision, her counsel provided a letter to the government purporting to set forth all the information Paz-Barona had concerning her offense. This letter was also appended to Paz-Barona\u2019s filed objections to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). <em>See </em>Rl-20 Attachment. The letter began by describing how Paz-Barona and her sister had gone to the airline office to change their flight date due to hurricanes in Florida. <em>Id. </em>at 1. The letter then stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-11\">Upon leaving the American Airlines office, two (2) individuals approached the sisters from behind, told them not to turn around and stuck a hard object in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>their backs. The men demanded them to continue to walk. They told the sisters they knew where they lived and how many children they had and that if they did not bring the packages that they were going to hand them to New York, they or their children would be killed. The men told the sisters that when they arrived in New York their representative would retrieve the pellets from the sisters at their apartment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-4\"><em>Id. </em>According to Paz-Barona\u2019s counsel, the government did not agree that the letter met the requirements for the application of the safety-valve provision. Paz-Barona also argued that the PSI ought to have recommended a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12, because, she asserted, she had smuggled the heroin as a result of coercion and duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">At the sentencing hearing, Paz-Barona renewed her objection with regard to the application of the safety-valve. In support of her argument, Paz-Barona testified to the circumstances under which she smuggled heroin into the United States, specifically stating that \u201c[i]t was a person that [she] did not know who offered [her], due to the fact that this person realized the financial situation that [she and her sister] were undergoing, this person offered [she and her sister] to bring the drugs, so [she and her sister] accepted.\u201d R3 at 5. Paz-Barona\u2019s counsel then stated that, because he did not believe that this testimony was \u201csubstantive enough ... for the Court to obtain a clear picture,\u201d he and Paz-Barona would rely on the letter earlier submitted to the government. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">The court denied Paz-Barona\u2019s request for application of the safety-valve provision, explaining that, \u201c[b]ased on the discrepancies between the statements and the failure to explain in any detail what happened or give the [government all the information she has about the offense[,] I find that aspect of the safety-valve requirement has not been met.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. The court concluded that Paz-Barona\u2019s offense level was 23, her criminal history category was I, and the applicable statutory mandatory minimum sentence was 60 months. The court then asked the parties if there was any argument to be made that it had \u201cany discretion on this.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Paz-Barona\u2019s counsel replied,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">[t]he only discretion you would have is under a [Fed. R.Crim. P.] 35 type of situation, which I would request the Government make at this time as a result of Miss Paz Barona supplying them with the letter dated February eighth, 2005, and seek a reduction in sentence via substantial assistance motion by the Government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 7-8. The government declined to file a Rule 35 motion. The court then sentenced Paz-Barona to 60 months imprisonment, to be followed by four years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">On appeal, Paz-Barona argues that she provided the government with complete, truthful information concerning her offense, and so the district court erred in failing to apply the safety-valve provision in imposing her sentence because she had met all the requirements. She also contends that her sentence is excessive and unreasonable and, further, that the court erred in failing to grant a downward departure under \u00a7 5K2.12. Finally, she asserts that the court also erred in failing to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">\u201cWhen reviewing the denial of safety-valve relief, we review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual determinations,\u201d and \u201c[w]e review de novo the court\u2019s legal interpretation of the statutes and sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>375 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Where a defendant is convicted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960, the district court \u201cshall impose a sentence pursuant to [the sentencing guidelines] without regard to any statutory minimum sentence, if the court finds at sentencing\u201d that five enumerated factors are present. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(f). \u201cThis provision, as well as U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 which employs the same list of factors, is commonly called the \u2018safety valve.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>375 F.3d at 1302. As the parties concede, the fifth factor under these provisions is the only one at issue here. The fifth factor provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS5\">not later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan, but the fact that the defendant has no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the Government is already aware of the information shall not preclude a determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">We have determined that this fifth factor \u201cis a \u2018tell-odi\u2019 provision: to meet its requirements, the defendant has an affirmative responsibility to \u2018truthfully disclose to the government all information and evidence that he has about the offense and all relevant conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson, </em>375 F.3d at 1302 (citation omitted). \u201cThe burden is on the defendant to come forward and to supply truthfully to the government all the information that [s]he possesses about [her] involvement in the offense, including information relating to the involvement of others and to the chain of the narcotics distribution.\u201d <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Here, the record reflects that Paz-Barona submitted two inconsistent statements with regard to how she became involved in the heroin smuggling venture. In neither account did she provide any information concerning the individuals who recruited her participation, nor did she explicitly state that she did not have any such information. The district court took note of these inconsistencies and found that, \u201c[b]ased on the discrepancies between the statements and the failure to explain in any detail what happened or give the [g]overnment all the information she ha[d] about the offense[,] ... that aspect of the safety-valve requirement has not been met.\u201d R3 at 7. Based on the record, it cannot be said that the district court clearly erred in making this determination. <em>See Johnson, </em>375 F.3d at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Because we have concluded that the district court did not clearly err in denying Paz-Barona\u2019s request for application of the safety valve, we need not address her arguments that the district court erred (1) in failing to apply a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12; (2) in failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors; or (3) in imposing an unreasonable sentence. Barring safety-valve relief or a Rule 35 \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d motion, the sentencing court remains bound by the statutory mandatory minimum provided by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960. <em>See United States v. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d 1294, 1302-03 (11th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir. 2005) (confirming that statutory mandatory minimums remain binding <em>post-Booker). </em>Paz-Barona\u2019s guidelines range, even without a downward departure, was already below that mandatory minimum, thus no downward departure could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>made any difference. <em>See Cruz, </em>106 F.3d at 1555 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Paz-Barona appeals her 60-month sentence for the importation of 100 grams or more of heroin. We find the district court did not clearly err in declining to apply the safety-valve provisions to her sentence, or in imposing the statutory mandatory minimum sentence provided for her offense. Accordingly, we AFFIRM Paz-Barona\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
