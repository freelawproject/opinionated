He was sentenced to 140 months of imprisonment. On appeal, Hailey asserts the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized from his vehicle. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">This court reviews the factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error, and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). When a suppression motion has been denied, this court reviews the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). With these standards in mind, and having reviewed the transcript of the suppression hearing and the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
