Southern appeals his 320-month sentence resulting from his guilty plea for interference with commerce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>by attempted robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 (2000), discharging a firearm during attempted robbery, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii) (2000), and carjacking, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119 (2000). Southern\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the issue of whether Southern\u2019s sentence was unduly harsh. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005). However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the guideline range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). <em>Id. </em>As stated in <em>Hughes, </em>this Court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is both reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed range. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47. Further, this court has stated that \u201cwhile we believe that the appropriate circumstances for imposing a sentence outside the guideline range will depend on the facts of individual cases, we have no reason to doubt that most sentences will continue to fall within the applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 219 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005). Indeed, \u201ca sentence imposed \u2018within the properly calculated Guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456-57 (4th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Newsom, </em>428 F.3d 685, 687 (7th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, - L.Ed.2d - (2006) (No. 05-8986)).</p>\n<p id=\"AIa\">We find that the district court properly calculated the guideline range and appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory. The court sentenced Southern only after considering and examining the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). The court also clearly noted that it found the guidelines, though advisory, \u201can adequate basis to provide a sufficient and just punishment but not greater than necessary to punish the Defendant in this case for his conduct.\u201d Based on these factors, and because the court sentenced Southern within the applicable guideline range and the statutory maximum, we find that Southern\u2019s sentence of 320 months of imprisonment is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and considered Southern\u2019s pro se supplemental brief and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Southern\u2019s convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. Accordingly, we also deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may renew his motion for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
