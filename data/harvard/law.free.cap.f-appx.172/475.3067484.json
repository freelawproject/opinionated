On appeal Gregory\u2019s counsel filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that the district court may <em>not </em>have fully complied with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in accepting Gregory\u2019s guilty plea and may have imposed sentence in violation of law or by incorrectly applying the sentencing guidelines, but stating he found no meritorious claims for appeal. Gregory was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not done so. The Government elected not to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-21\">Gregory did not move in the district court to withdraw his guilty plea; therefore, his challenge to the adequacy of the Rule 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, 277 </em>F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that \u201cplain error analysis is the proper standard for review of forfeited error in the Rule 11 context\u201d). This analysis requires the court to determine whether there was error, whether.the error was plain, and whether it affected the Defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 524. If a defendant establishes these requirements, the court\u2019s \u201cdiscretion is appropriately exercised only when failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice, such as when the defendant is actually innocent or the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 555 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-22\">Our review of the record reveals that the district court complied with the requirements of Rule 11, except for advising Gregory that the answers he gave at the hearing may be used against him in a prosecution for perjury or false statement as required by Rule 11(b)(1)(A). We find the district court erred in failing to advise Gregory that his answers could be used against him in a prosecution for perjury or false statement, but find the error does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>affect his substantial rights because there has been no assertion either that Gregory\u2019s statements at the plea hearing were prejurious or false, or that the Government seeks to prosecute Gregory for any false statements. Accordingly, we find Gregory\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary and properly accepted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">After review of the record, we also conclude that the mandatory minimum sentence imposed by the district court as required by statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252A(b)(l) (2000), was not unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>404 F.3d 850, 862 (4th Cir.2005). Finding no error, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
