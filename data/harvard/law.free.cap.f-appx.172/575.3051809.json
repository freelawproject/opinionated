He petitions for review from an order from the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirming the decision of the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d). The IJ denied his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). The IJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>determined that (1) Khan\u2019s claim for asylum was time barred; (2) the harm suffered by Khan in the past did not rise to the level of persecution; and (3) Khan had not established a well-grounded fear of future persecution. For the reasons set forth below, we dismiss the asylum claim and deny the petition as to the remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">First, we do not have jurisdiction to review Khan\u2019s asylum claim because the BIA found those claims time barred. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (\u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2) [providing for exceptions, including the time bar, to an alien\u2019s right to apply for asylum].\u201d); <em>see also Zhu v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 521, 527 (5th Cir.2005) (remanding to the BIA because its affirmance without opinion left the court with \u201cno way of knowing whether the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision on a nonreviewable basis, i.e., untimeliness, or a reviewable basis, i.e., the merits of [the] asylum claim\u201d). The BIA explicitly stated in its decision that the IJ \u201ccorrectly found that [Khan] is time-barred for asylum as his application was filed beyond the one-year filing deadline ..., and we find that he does not qualify for an exception to the filing deadline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Khan additionally argues that a recently enacted Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) provision enables this Court to review his asylum claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). The provision states, \u201cNothing in ... this Act ... which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals....\u201d <em>Id. </em>This exception to section 1158(a)(3)\u2019s limitation on judicial review is not applicable in this case. <em>See Bregu v. Gonzales, </em>165 Fed.Appx. 334, 335 (5th Cir.2006) (unpublished). Accordingly, we cannot hear Khan\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The BIA\u2019s decision denying Khan withholding of removal and relief under the CAT, however, is reviewable by this Court. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252; <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 135 (5th Cir.2004). This Court also reviews the decision of the IJ because it was adopted by the BIA. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). \u201c[T]he BIA will be reversed only when the evidence is \u2018so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find\u2019 the petitioner statutorily eligible for relief.\u201d <em>Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 138 (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">To obtain withholding of removal under the INA, an applicant \u201cmust show that it is more likely than not that his life or freedom would be threatened by persecution\u201d based on his political opinion, race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group. <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation omitted). Under the CAT, an alien must show that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">Khan contends the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence. He claims he has shown that (1) he suffered past persecution; (2) he more likely than not would be subjected to persecution if he returned to Pakistan; and (3) he more likely than not would be targeted for torture if he returned to Pakistan. The record reflects that Khan was subjected to two attacks by a rival political faction. In the first, he was beaten and required medical treatment. In the second, he was shot at during a drive-by shooting. He reported the second incident to the police, who did not pursue an investigation. After these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>events, Khan went abroad for several months but returned to Pakistan for a period of seventeen months. During that time, he suffered no attacks. Khan then left for the United States. Shortly thereafter, he returned once again to Pakistan for a few weeks. Again, he did not encounter any problems. The record does not compel a finding that Khan more likely than not will suffer persecution upon return to Pakistan. He also fails to meet the \u201chigher bar\u201d of showing that he will be tortured. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, he has failed to show the BIA\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Mikhael, </em>115 F.3d at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Based on the foregoing, Khan\u2019s asylum claim is DISMISSED, and his petition for review as to the remaining claims is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b601-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, this Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
