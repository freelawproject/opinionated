We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See </em>(R. Vol. 2 at 2-7); <em>Malhotra v. Watergate at Land Condo Assoc., </em>No. CA-05-76-LMB (E.D. Va. filed Sept. 13, 2005 and entered Sept. 14, 2005). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
