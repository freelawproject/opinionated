Apfel, </em>230 F.3d 131, 135 (5th Cir.2000). After reviewing the record, we affirm for the reasons articulated by the District Court, namely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">1. McIntosh did not meet the threshold requirement of Listing 12 .02 that the claimant show a medically documented history of a chronic organic mental disorder. As the District Court wrote, the record evidence at best suggests the mere possibility of such a disorder; it is far from demonstrative of one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">2. Assuming McIntosh met the threshold requirement for either or both Listing 12.02 and Listing 12.04, he has failed to satisfy any of the three additional criteria.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">a. McIntosh has not proved \u201crepeated episodes of decompensation, each of extended duration.\u201d The District Court correctly held that the personality conflicts that occasionally led to McIntosh\u2019s job losses do not rise to the level of a loss of adaptive functioning sufficient to constitute an episode of decompensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">b. McIntosh has not proved \u201ca residual disease process that has resulted in such marginal adjustment that even a minimal increase in mental demands or change in the environment would be predicted to cause the individual to decompensate.\u201d Evaluations suggesting that McIntosh is better suited to independent rather than group work are insufficient to meet this demanding standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\">c. McIntosh has not proved a \u201ccurrent history of one or more years\u2019 inability to function outside a highly supportive living arrangement, with an indication of continued need for such an arrangement.\u201d The District Court correctly noted that McIntosh, despite living with his parents, \u201cappears to have taken care of almost all of his personal needs and made substantial contributions to the household without a high degree of supervision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b618-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
