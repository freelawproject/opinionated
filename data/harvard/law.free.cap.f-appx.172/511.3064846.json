Bruton\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but nonetheless challenging the court\u2019s calculation of Bruton\u2019s sentence. Bruton filed a response to the <em>Anders </em>brief, also challenging the enhancement but also claiming the district court committed sentencing error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-22\">Bruton claims that the district court improperly calculated his guideline range when it added two offense levels for his role in the offense under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3Bl.l(e) (2005). Because Bruton failed to raise this claim below, we must review it for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). To receive an adjustment as a manager or supervisor, a defendant must have managed or supervised at least one other participant, not just property. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3B1.1, comment, (n.2); <em>United States v. Capers, </em>61 F.3d 1100, 1108-09 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-23\">Bruton and Darius Edwards leased a house from which they sold two to three kilograms of cocaine base a week. Bruton claims that he was merely one of equals and did not manage or superase. However, Bruton was a supervisor because he hired Lance Pauley to help run the drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>house. The district court properly enhanced and calculated Bruton\u2019s guideline sentence. As Bruton\u2019s sentence was within that guideline range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456-57 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Bruton\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
