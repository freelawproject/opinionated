The sentence was imposed after Hinestroza pled guilty to the indictment, and after a Presentence Investigation Report reflected that he was arrested by the United States Coast Guard on a fishing vessel carrying 4.6 tons of cocaine. Hinestroza was a member of a crew of eight. On appeal, Hinestroza argues that he was a minor participant in the crime, and, therefore, he should have been granted a minor-role red\u00fcction pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3D 1.2. He also argues that, because of the minor role that he played in the offense, his base offense level should have been capped at 30, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3). He fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>ther appears to argue that based on the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court erred by failing to depart downward from the guideline range. The government responds that Hinestroza failed to raise these issues before the district court and is therefore precluded from raising them on appeal; and even if he could, they have no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">A defendant who fails to object to the denial of a \u00a7 3D1.2 minor-role reduction is precluded from raising the issue on appeal. <em>See United States v. Asseff, </em>917 F.2d 502, 506 n. 4 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam). \u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment ... always bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 939 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">At the sentencing hearing, Hinestroza stated that \u201che is a very minor player, a pawn in a very large game in his country ... I believe that this Court can take it into consideration in creating a reasonable sentence.\u201d We find that this statement, without more, is insufficient to raise the minor-role issue in the district court, and therefore he is precluded from raising this issue on appeal. Even if this elliptic argument preserves a \u00a7 3D1.2 issue for appeal, it is axiomatic that such a brief and conclusory argument fails to meet his burden required by <em>DeVaron.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">Additionally, Hinestroza fails to argue in his initial brief that his sentence is unreasonable under <em>Booker, </em>and therefore we deem the issue abandoned. <em>See United States v. Britt, </em>437 F.3d 1103, 1105 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (holding that we need not address issues not raised in an initial brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-7\">To the extent that Hinestroza is appealing the district court\u2019s refusal to sentence him below the guidelines range, we lack jurisdiction over such an appeal. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and (f); <em>United States v. Wright, </em>895 F.2d 718, 719-20 (11th Cir. 1990) (per curiam) (this Court may not review a sentence within the correctly determined guidelines range \u201cunless the sentence was imposed in violation of law, was based on a misapplication of the guidelines, or was plainly unreasonable and imposed for an offense for which there was no applicable guideline.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-9\">Accordingly, we affirm Hinestroza\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
