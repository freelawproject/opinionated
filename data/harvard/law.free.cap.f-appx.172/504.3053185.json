Love appeals his conviction and sentence following a guilty plea to violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (possession with intent to distribute 50 or more grams of cocaine base) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(I) (possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime). On appeal, Love asserts that the district court erred by denying his motions to withdraw his guilty plea and to subpoena his former attorney. Love also contends that the district court erred by using a state conviction to establish career offender status for sentencing purposes and to impose enhanced penalties under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). Love further claims that the 100:1 statutory sentencing ratio between cocaine base and powder cocaine violates the Equal Protection Clause or, in the alternative, creates a disparity that is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>based on factors adequately considered in the promulgation of the federal sentencing guidelines. For the reasons that follow, we affirm Love\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Love argues that the district court erred by denying his first motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>81 F.3d 1300, 1305 (4th Cir.1996). Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 provides that, prior to sentencing, a court may authorize the withdrawal of a guilty plea if the defendant shows a \u201cfair and just\u201d reason. In determining whether the proffered reason is \u201cfair and just,\u201d district courts must balance the six factors we articulated in <em>United States v. Moore:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">(1) whether the defendant has offered credible evidence that his plea was not knowing or not voluntary, (2) whether the defendant has credibly asserted his legal innocence, (3) whether there has been a delay between the entering of the plea and the filing of the motion, (4) whether defendant has had close assistance of competent counsel, (5) whether withdrawal will cause prejudice to the government, and (6) whether it will inconvenience the court and waste judicial resources.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991). Here, the district court carefully examined the <em>Moore </em>factors and found that they did not weigh in favor of withdrawal. After carefully reviewing the record, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying this motion to withdraw the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Love, while acting pro se, moved a second time to withdraw his guilty plea. He also moved to subpoena his former attorney Herbert Hively, who had served as counsel when Love pled guilty, to testify regrading this motion. Love later withdrew his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and the district court dismissed both motions as moot. Love contends that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to subpoena Hively. <em>See United States v. Owens, </em>528 F.2d 1176, 1180-81 (4th Cir.1975) (providing the standard of review). Because Love withdrew his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the subpoena as moot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">Love also challenges the district court\u2019s use of his Pennsylvania state court conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to deliver to enhance his sentence based on career offender status. In reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines, we review factual determinations for clear error and legal determinations de novo. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217-18 (4th Cir.1989). A defendant qualifies for career offender status if he has \u201cat least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a)(3). A \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-12\">an offense under federal or state law, punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance ... or the possession of a controlled substance ... with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Love does not claim his state conviction failed to meet this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>definition. Rather, Love argues that the state statute that he was convicted under could encompass conduct that is a misdemeanor under federal law and, therefore, should not qualify as a felony conviction for career offender status. Because Love\u2019s state court conviction meets the definition of \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under the federal sentencing guidelines, we conclude that it can be used for career offender status.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Love also contests the district court\u2019s imposition of enhanced penalties under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Prior to Love\u2019s plea, the Government filed an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851, stating its intention to use Love\u2019s state drug conviction for enhanced penalties. Under \u00a7 841(b), a person who violates \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 841(b)(1)(A) is liable for enhanced penalties if the violation occurs \u201cafter a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final.\u201d \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). \u201cFelony drug offense\u201d is defined as an \u201can offense that is punishable by imprisonment for more than one year under any law of the United States or of a State or foreign country that prohibits or restricts conduct relating to ..., marihuana,.... \u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(44). Because Love\u2019s state conviction falls within this definition, we affirm the application of the enhancement to Love\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Finally, Love challenges the constitutionality of the 100:1 statutory sentencing ratio between cocaine base and powder cocaine. Love acknowledges that we have previously rejected similar arguments. Brief of Appellant at 29; <em>See United States v. Fisher, </em>58 F.3d 96, 99 (4th Cir. 1995). A panel of this Court may not overrule the decision of an earlier panel. <em>Brubaker v. Richmond, </em>943 F.2d 1363, 1381-82 (4th Cir.1991). Therefore, we reject this challenge by Love.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">Accordingly, we affirm Love\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-8\">. We note that Hively had previously testified at length before the district court on Love's first motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-14\">. Love's additional felony conviction is a 1995 guilty plea to second degree murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\">. We deny Love\u2019s motions to file a supplemental brief, to exceed filing limits, to extend the filing deadline, and to amend the briefing schedule. We further deny as moot a motion by Love\u2019s counsel seeking leave to withdraw from representation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
