At sentencing, the district court denied Prejean\u2019s motion to appoint an expert to testify about bones based on that expert\u2019s testimony in another trial and overruled without explanation Prejean\u2019s objection to the inclusion of the bones in the drug quantity calculation. Because there is no evidence on the record of the district court\u2019s findings concerning the nature of bones, this court is unable to consider the issue whether bones should be included in the drug quantity calculation. <em>See United States v. Hardin, </em>437 F.3d 463, 469-471 (5th Cir.2006). Accordingly, Prejean\u2019s sentence is vacated and the case is remanded for resentencing. Prior to resentencing, the district court shall hold a hearing on the nature of bones because such findings are necessary for the district court to determine whether the bones should be included in the drug quantity for which Prejean was held accountable. <em>See id. </em>at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-15\">Prejean also argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(5)(A), which provides that the base offense level should be increased by two levels \u201c[i]f the offense involved (i) an unlawful discharge, emission, or release into the environment of a hazardous or toxic substance; or (ii) the unlawful transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of a hazardous waste.\u201d Application note 19 to \u00a7 2D1.1 provides that subsection (b)(5)(A) applies if the conduct for which the defendant is held accountable falls under one of several listed statutes. The record does not support a finding by the district court that Prejean\u2019s conduct fell under any of the listed statutes. Accordingly, we vacate Prejean\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing on this basis as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">SENTENCE VACATED; CASE REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b594-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
