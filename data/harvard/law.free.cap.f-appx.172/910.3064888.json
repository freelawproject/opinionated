He contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence based on his prior convictions for \u201clewd sexual battery\u201d in Florida state court. Specifically, Harding argues that (1) his lewd sexual battery convictions were not qualifying offenses under \u00a7 2252(b)(2), and (2) the application of \u00a7 2252(b)(2) violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, because the Government failed to allege in the Indictment\u2014 and Harding did not admit \u2014 the fact of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>prior convictions. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">I. Qualifying Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">We review de novo whether Harding\u2019s prior convictions constitute qualifying offenses under \u00a7 2252(b)(2). <em>See United States v. James, </em>430 F.3d 1150, 1153 (11th Cir.2005) (reviewing <em>\u201cde novo </em>whether a conviction is a \u2018violent felony\u2019 or a \u2018serious drug offense\u2019 within the meaning of [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 924(e)\u201d), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Feb. 14, 2006) (No. 05-9264). Generally, \u00a7 2252(b)(2) provides that a person who, like Harding, violates \u00a7 2252(a)(4) \u201cshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.... \u201d However, if that person</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APs\">has a prior conviction under this chapter, chapter 71, chapter 109A, or chapter 117, or under section 920 of Title 10 (article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice), or under the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward ... such person shall be fined under this title and imprisoned for not less than 10 years nor more than 20 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2). The application of this enhancement was error, Harding argues, because his state law convictions for lewd sexual battery are not necessarily convictions \u201cunder the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2252(b)(2). According to Harding, the quoted statutory language is best understood by turning to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243, which criminalizes \u201c[sjexual abuse of a minor or ward.\u201d Under \u00a7 2243(a), the minor being abused must not only be at least 12 and younger than 16, but must also be \u201cat least four years younger\u201d than the abuser. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243(a). Nothing in the record we are permitted to consult, Harding argues, establishes that he was at least four years older than the victim at the time of the lewd sexual battery. We disagree with Harding\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">In determining whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense under \u00a7 2252(b)(2), a sentencing court is \u201cgenerally limited to examining the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1257, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005) (applying the rule to the sentencing enhancement contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)); <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2160, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (in determining whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense under \u00a7 924(e), sentencing court is prohibited from delving into particular facts disclosed by the record of conviction, but must normally look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense); <em>United States v. McCutchen, </em>419 F.3d 1122, 1128 (10th Cir. 2005) (concluding that the rule outlined in <em>Shepard </em>\u201capplies to cases ... involving application of \u00a7 2252(b)(2)\u201d). Here, the Criminal Information introduced at sentencing charged Harding with three counts of lewd sexual battery \u201cupon ... a child under the age of 16 years,\u201d in violation of Fla. Stat. 800.04(3) (1995). Under that provision, a person who \u201c[c]ommits an act defined as sexual battery under s. 794.011(l)(h) upon any child under the age of 16 years ... without committing the crime of sexual battery, commits a felony of the second degree.... \u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) (1995). Section 794.011(l)(h) states: \u201c \u2018Sexual battery\u2019 means oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another or the anal or vaginal penetration of another by any oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>er object; however, sexual battery does not include an act done for a bona fide medical purpose.\u201d Fla. Stat. 794.011(l)(h) (1995). Counts One and Three of the Criminal Information charged Harding with committing sexual battery on the child \u201cby placing his penis in union with or penetrating her vagina,\u201d and Count Two charged him with committing sexual battery \u201cby penetrating her vagina with his finger(s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Notwithstanding the foregoing, Harding contends that his convictions under \u00a7 800.04(3) are not convictions \u201cunder the laws of any State relating to aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or abusive sexual conduct involving a minor or ward\u201d under \u00a7 2252(b)(2). In order to understand what constitutes \u201cabusive sexual conduct involving a minor,\u201d Harding argues, we must look to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243, because \u00a7 2252(b)(2) \u201cprovides no definitions.\u201d Section 2243, entitled \u201cSexual abuse of a minor or ward,\u201d makes it a federal crime to engage knowingly in a sexual act with another person who is (1) at least 12 but younger than 16, and (2) \u201cat least four years younger than the person so engaging.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, Harding concludes, for his lewd sexual battery convictions to qualify under \u00a7 2252(b)(2), the minor-victim must have been at least four years younger than Harding at the time of the conduct underlying the convictions. This age difference was not established at sentencing, Harding explains, because it was not an essential element of an offense under \u00a7 800.04(3), was not charged in the Criminal Information, and was not admitted by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">We reject Harding\u2019s attempt to engraft the requirements of \u00a7 2243 on to \u00a7 2252(b)(2). While \u00a7 2243 may \u201cdefine\u201d the federal crime of \u201cSexual abuse of a minor,\u201d it is not a definitional provision applicable to \u00a7 2252. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243(a). Indeed, \u00a7 2252, unlike \u00a7 2243, is codified in chapter 110 of Title 18, Part 1. The definitions applicable to chapter 110 are located in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2256, which defines \u201cminor\u201d as \u201cany person under the age of eighteen years,\u201d and contains no age difference requirement similar to \u00a7 2243(a)(2). Thus, Harding\u2019s approach would create a conflict between the definition of \u201cminor\u201d applicable to \u00a7 2252 through \u00a7 2256, and the definition of minor Harding draws from \u00a7 2243, which refers to a person who is at least 12 but younger than 16 (and at least four years younger than the abuser). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2243(a), 2252(b), 2256(1). Such an interpretation cannot be squared with our obligation to read the statute as a whole. <em>See Dolan v. United States Postal Serv., </em>-U.S.-,-, 126 S.Ct. 1252, 1257, 163 L.Ed.2d 1079 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">Furthermore, \u00a7 2252(b)(2) already accounts for prior convictions under \u00a7 2243 by encompassing \u201ca prior conviction under ... chapter 109A.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2). When addressing state law convictions, however, \u00a7 2252(b)(2) uses broader language, reaching any conviction under a state law <em>\u201crelating to </em>... abusive sexual conduct involving a minor....\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). We find that Harding\u2019s convictions for lewd sexual battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) fall well within the plain meaning of this language, and are supported by the charges in the Criminal Information. <em>See McCutchen, </em>419 F.3d at 1127 (Congress\u2019s use of \u201crelating to\u201d in \u00a7 2252(b)(2) \u201cindicates its intent to allow a sentencing court to look beyond the mere elements of a prior state conviction\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>determining whether conviction triggers enhancement); <em>United States v. Rezin, </em>322 F.3d 443, 448 (7th Cir.2003) (\u201cFrom the standpoint of rational penal policy ... what is important is the conduct that gave rise to the prior conviction, not the elements of the offense underlying that conviction.\u201d); <em>accord James, </em>430 F.3d at 1155 (explaining that for state law offense to constitute \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under Armed Career Criminal Act, or \u201cACCA,\u201d language of state statute need not exactly match ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cserious drug offense,\u201d but merely fall within that definition); <em>cf. United States v. Padillar-Reyes, </em>247 F.3d 1158, 1164 (11th Cir.2001) (concluding that plain meaning of phrase \u201csexual abuse of a minor\u201d in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A) includes a violation of Fla. Stat. 800.04 (1987)); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>367 F.3d 748, 751 (8th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (\u201cAlthough the term \u201csexual exploitation of children\u201d is not defined in the statute, the term unambiguously refers to any criminal sexual conduct with a child\u201d). <em>But see United States v. Galo, </em>239 F.3d 572, 582 (3rd Cir.2001)(\u201cIt is the elements of a given statute, not the conduct that violates it that determines if the statute relates to the sexual exploitation of children.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">II. Almendarez-Torres</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Harding next argues that the application of \u00a7 2252(b)(2) violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights, because his lewd sexual battery convictions were not charged in the Indictment or admitted by him. As Harding raised his constitutional objections before the district court, we review them de novo. <em>United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 228, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1223, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court \u201cheld that the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, 543 </em>U.S. 1013, 125 S.Ct. 637, 160 L.Ed.2d 480 (2004). Although Harding contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been \u201cgravely wounded\u201d by subsequent Supreme Court cases, he concedes we have held that it remains good law. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1247 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cThough wounded, <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>still marches on and we are ordered to follow. We will join the funeral procession only after the Supreme Court has decided to bury it.\u201d). Even so, Harding argues, his case is different because, unlike the defendant in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>he did not even admit to the <em>existence </em>of his prior convictions. <em>See Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>U.S. at 227, 118 S.Ct. at 1222. This argument is unavailing, for Harding does not deny that other evidence as to the existence of his prior convictions was produced at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s decision to enhance Harding\u2019s sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(b)(2), based on his prior Florida convictions for lewd sexual battery. Accordingly, we affirm Harding\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-7\">. Similarly, \u00a7 2244, entitled \"Abusive sexual contact,\u201d prohibits knowingly engaging in or causing sexual contact with or by another person, if doing so would violate \"subsection (a) of section 2243 of this title had the sexual contact been a sexual act....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b940-6\">. Harding contends that even if we disagree with him, we must apply the rule of lenity. \"[W]hen there are two rational readings of a criminal statute, one harsher than the other, the rule of lenity dictates that we are to choose the harsher one only when Congress has spoken in language that is clear and definite.\u201d <em>United States v. Inclema, </em>363 F.3d 1177, 1182 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (internal quotes and citation omitted). For the reasons explained above, Harding has not proposed a rational reading of \u00a7 2252(b)(2), and we therefore need not apply the rule of lenity. <em>See United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.) (per curiam) (\"We will apply the rule of lenity only if the provision being construed is still ambiguous after application of normal rules of construction.\u201d), <em>cert, denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 457, 163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005). Harding also asserts that, to the extent \u00a7 2252(b)(2) is \"without definition,\u201d it is void for vagueness. He raised this argument for the first time in his reply brief, and it is therefore waived. <em>See United States v. Dicter, </em>198 F.3d 1284, 1289 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
