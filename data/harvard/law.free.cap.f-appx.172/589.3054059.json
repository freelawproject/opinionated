The record indicates that Taylor exhausted his challenge to being housed in unit 29-L and to his reclassification as a field worker. However, this claim lacks merit because Taylor does not have a liberty interest in his work or housing assignment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing the claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Taylor argues that the rules violation report (RVR), received for hanging a sheet in front of himself while using the bathroom, was not based on any prison rule; he contends that he \u201chas the liberty right to not have false evidence intentionally presented against him in official proceedings by those acting under color of law.\u201d However, since Taylor does not assert that he was restrained in any way due to this RYR and since he concedes that he was found not guilty at a hearing eoncerning the RVR, he has not asserted a constitutional deprivation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Furthermore, a rule preventing an inmate from obscuring prison officials\u2019 view is \u201creasonably related to legitimate penological interests.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Taylor\u2019s claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">Taylor argues that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint before summonses were served on the defendants. However, service is not required before dismissal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">Taylor asserts for the first time on appeal that his housing in segregated confinement amounted to cruel and unusual punishment, rendered in retaliation for his filing of grievances against prison officials. However, we need not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b616-19\"> Pursuant to the 5th Cir.
