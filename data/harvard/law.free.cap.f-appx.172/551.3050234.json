We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinions and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court as to all complaints except the district court order denying bail pending appeal. <em>See United, States v. Cabiness, </em>4:02-CR-70031 (W.D.Va. Sept. 8, 2005); <em>United States v. Cabiness, </em>4:02-CR-70031 (W.D.Va. Sept. 2, 2005). Because the underlying appeals lack merit, the appeal from the denial of bail (No. 05-7508) is dismissed as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
