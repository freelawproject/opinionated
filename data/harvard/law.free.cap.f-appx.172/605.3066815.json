Lututa has failed to show that the record compels reversal of the finding of the IJ that Lututa failed to give credible testimony that she is entitled to asylum or withholding of removal and that the application is frivolous. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994); <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 306 (5th Cir.1997). Because Lututa does not argue in her brief that she is entitled to relief under the CAT, she has abandoned any challenge to the denial of that relief. <em>See Rodriguez v. INS, </em>9 F.3d 408, 414 n. 15 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, Lututa\u2019s petition for review of the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s dismissal as frivolous of her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
