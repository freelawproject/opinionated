Gordon alleged that he was denied his right of access to the courts when his case manager lost the documents necessary to correct a defect in his original petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court after Gordon asked his case manager to copy them. Gordon was unable to copy the documents himself due to his confinement in the Special Housing Unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-17\">The district court dismissed Gordon\u2019s complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) as frivolous and for failure to state a claim. Gordon contends that the district court erred in finding that his original petition for a writ of certiorari was untimely. He asserts that his original petition for a writ of certiorari from the Sixth Circuit\u2019s November 22, 2000, decision affirming his conviction, was filed on February 24, 2001. He contends that the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision was entered on November 27, 2000, but he has provided no information to support this contention, and it is belied by that court\u2019s docket. The Clerk of the Supreme Court issued a letter requesting Gordon to provide a copy of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision within 60 days, so that the timeliness of his petition for a writ of certiorari could be determined. Because Gordon\u2019s corrected petition was lost after he asked his case manager to copy it, he did not file a timely response to the Clerk\u2019s request. The district court did not err in holding that, even if Gordon had filed a timely response, his petition for a writ of certiorari still would have been denied as untimely. Accordingly, the district court did not err in dismissing Gordon\u2019s claim for denial of access to the courts because this right extends only to nonfrivolous claims. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 355, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); <em>Harper v. Showers, </em>174 F.3d 716, 718 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Because Gordon sued federal employees, the district court erred in holding that Gordon had an adequate postdeprivation remedy in state court with respect to any claim for the deprivation of property. However, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of this claim on the alternative ground that the Federal Tort Claims Act provides such a remedy. <em>Cf. Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 533, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984) (holding with respect to claims against state officials that the intentional deprivation of property does not violate due process if there is an adequate postdeprivation remedy).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b592-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
