No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-26\">The presentence investigation report (PSI) indicated that, while searching a residence suspected of harboring a crack cocaine manufacturing operation, federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>agents discovered Winters lying on a bed. Winters possessed a baggie containing 3.7 grams of crack cocaine. The PSI also listed many offenses for which Defendant had been arrested and convicted. Defendant was convicted of aggravated assault with a weapon, sale/delivery of cocaine, and sale of cocaine. The probation officer recommended, and the district court applied, the career offender provision, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which set Defendant\u2019s criminal history category at VI. The PSI also indicated that Defendant had been arrested eight other times, beginning when he was four years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Defendant argues that, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621, his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the goals in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and it does not reflect the seriousness of the offense, which involved Defendant\u2019s possession of only 3.7 grams of crack cocaine. Defendant also contends that the district court improperly considered his criminal history by focusing on the underlying facts of a prior conviction and on criminal conduct for which he was not convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">After a district court accurately has calculated the guideline range,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it \u201cmay impose a more severe or more lenient sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005). We review such a sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1244 (11th Cir.2005) <em>(per curiam). </em>In determining whether a sentence is reasonable, the district court should be guided by the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 765-66; <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246. But to establish the reasonableness of a sentence, a district court need not discuss explicitly on the record every \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005). An indication that the court \u201cadequately and properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and the advisory Guidelines range\u201d in conjunction with the sentence is enough. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Here, the district court\u2019s 188-month sentence was reasonable. The sentence was at the high end of the guideline range of 155-188 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court considered Defendant\u2019s juvenile criminal history, his arrest record, and the facts behind some of his earlier convictions. The district court suggested that Defendant had received leniency in the past. These factors are ones that the district court has discretion to examine. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>989 F.2d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.1993) (writing that, in considering whether to depart upward under \u00a7 4A1.3, the district court may contemplate juvenile convictions, arrests not resulting in convictions, all facts in the PSI, and leniency of previous sentences). We also note that Defendant did not challenge the factual accuracy of the probation officer\u2019s account of Defendant\u2019s earlier conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">Further, the district court explained that Defendant\u2019s sentence was, in large part, based on \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)\u2019s requirement that a sentence afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct. And the district court stated that it had examined \u201ceach of the enumerated provisions\u201d of \u00a7 3553(a) in determining an appropriate sentence. Thus, the district court contemplated the factors required by <em>Booker. </em>That the district court did not elaborate on considerations other than deterrence does not change this result. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329. Also, Defendant\u2019s sentence was significantly less than the statutory maximum 20-year sentence. <em>See Winingear, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>422 F.3d at 1246 (in reviewing reasonableness of sentence, comparing sentence imposed against statutory maximum). In the light of the factors of \u00a7 3553(a), the district court\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\">.
