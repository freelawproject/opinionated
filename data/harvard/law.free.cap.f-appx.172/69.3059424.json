By separate motion carried with the case, the Babos contend, in the alternative, that this case should be transferred to the district court as a habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 if this court determines that it lacks jurisdiction over the appeal. For the following reasons, we DISMISS the petition for review insofar as it seeks review of the Babos\u2019 asylum claim and DENY the balance of the petition for review and the accompanying motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Petitioners Anand Babo and his son, Haman Babo, were both born in Karachi, Pakistan. They entered the United States together as temporary visitors on July 21, 2000, and were authorized to remain only until January 19, 2001. Both men remained in the United States past that date without explicit authorization from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The DHS issued separate Notices to Appear on March 10, 2003 and filed with the immigration court in Dallas, Texas, on April 1, 2003, to commence removal proceedings against the Babos as nonimmigrants that remained in the United States for a time longer than permitted under section 237(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Babos filed their asylum applications in open court on October 9, 2003, long after the one-year limitation on filing under section 208(a)(2)(B) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), had lapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">On January 5, 2004, the IJ conducted a consolidated removal hearing and issued a written order and decision that (1) denied the petitioners\u2019 requests for asylum relief as time-barred and (2) rejected the petitioners\u2019 claims for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT. Notwithstanding Anand Babo\u2019s generalized assertions during his testimony that the situation had worsened since leaving Pakistan in July of 2000, the IJ determined that the evidence in the record demonstrated that the basis of his fear of mistreatment if he returned to Pakistan already existed at the time he arrived in July of 2000. Thus, the IJ found that the petitioners\u2019 were bound by the one-year limitation on filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">The IJ next addressed the withholding of removal and CAT claims. The IJ acknowledged that, as practicing Hindus, the Babos are indeed a religious minority in their Muslim-dominated native country of Pakistan. When tensions escalated between Hindus and Muslims in Pakistan following the destruction of the Babri Mosque in December of 1992, Anand Babo testified that he was particularly targeted and threatened because he was purportedly the secretary of a Hindu graveyard that certain Muslim shopkeepers were encroaching upon. Although Anand Babo testified that he was shot at by these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Muslim individuals in 2000 and allegedly reported the incident to the authorities,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the IJ noted that this incident was neither included in his handwritten affidavit nor corroborated by any documentary evidence in the record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the IJ also found a discrepancy with a document that supposedly certified that Anand Babo was an active member in the Hindu community and joint secretary of a particular Hindu organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">After carefully reviewing the evidence, the IJ determined that, even putting aside some of his doubts about the credibility of Anand Babo\u2019s testimony, the alleged acts of persecution against him seemed to have arisen in response to a real estate dispute over the cemetery plot, rather than on account of his religion. Thus, the IJ found that the Babos had failed to establish a clear probability of persecution on the basis of religion if they returned to Pakistan and accordingly denied their requests for withholding of removal. The IJ similarly rejected the CAT claims because the petitioners had failed to demonstrate how the police were supposed to know who to arrest based on the limited information from Anand Babo following the alleged shooting incident in 2000. Despite denying all requests for protective relief, the IJ granted voluntary departure to the Babos with specific instructions to leave the United States on or before March 5, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">On April 29, 2005, the BIA adopted and affirmed the decision of the IJ. The Babos timely filed a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">First, we lack jurisdiction to review the Babos\u2019 asylum claims because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s conclusion that those claims were time barred. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (\u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination of the Attorney General under paragraph (2).\u201d); <em>see also Nugroho v. Gonzales, </em>168 Fed.Appx. 14, 15 (5th Cir.2006) (citing <em>Zhu v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 521, 527 (5th Cir.2004)). The IJ determined that the basis for Anand Babo\u2019s fear of persecution upon a return to Pakistan already existed when he arrived in the United States in July of 2000. Thus, the IJ determined that the Babos failed to demonstrate \u201ceither the existence of changed circumstances which materially affected [their] eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing\u201d necessary to overcome the one-year limitation. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B),(D). Accordingly, this court must dismiss the petitioners\u2019 asylum claims for lack of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_1q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>We retain jurisdiction to review the withholding of removal and CAT claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252; <em>Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 137. \u201cWithholding of removal is a higher standard than asylum.\u201d <em>Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 906 (5th Cir.2002). The petitioners must prove a \u201cclear probability of persecution\u201d based on their religion or some other enumerated ground upon removal to Pakistan. <em>INS v. Stevic, </em>467 U.S. 407, 413, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 906. We review the BIA\u2019s conclusion on such claims for substantial evidence. <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 78 (5th Cir.1994). Under substantial evidence review, we will reverse the BIA only \u201cwhen the evidence is \u2018so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find\u2019 the petitioner statutorily eligible for relief.\u201d <em>Roy, </em>389 F.3d at 138 (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). Moreover, \u201c[w]e cannot substitute our judgment for that of the BIA or IJ with respect to the credibility of the witnesses or ultimate factual findings based on credibility determinations.\u201d <em>Chun, </em>40 F.3d at 78; <em>see also Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 903 (noting that courts afford \u201cgreat deference to an immigration judge\u2019s decisions concerning an alien\u2019s credibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">As practicing Hindus, the Babos allegedly fear persecution on the basis of their religion if removed to Pakistan, which remains a predominantly Muslim country. Given the lack of documentary evidence to support Anand Babo\u2019s testimony about the alleged shooting incident in 2000 and lingering questions over the veracity of a particular piece of evidence, however, the IJ drew an adverse credibility determination about the existence of past persecution and concluded that the petitioners had failed to demonstrate a clear probability of persecution on the basis of their Hindu beliefs if removed to Pakistan. The IJ also determined that the harassment was at least partially motivated by a real estate dispute over the cemetery land, rather than simply animosity toward the Babos because they were Hindus. Even under a mixed motive analysis, the petitioners must still present evidence \u201cof such weight that it compels the fact-finder to conclude that the applicant suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution <em>on account of a protected ground.\u201d Girma v. INS, </em>283 F.3d 664, 668 (5th Cir.2002) (finding the BIA\u2019s denial withholding of removal relief to be consistent with a mixed motive analysis) (emphasis added). Therefore, we conclude that the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision to deny withholding of removal relief was supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Finally, we separately address the remaining CAT claims because such claims are distinct \u201cfrom the claims for asylum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>and withholding of removal and should receive separate analytical attention.\u201d <em>Efe, </em>293 F.3d at 906-07. CAT claims differ from asylum and withholding of removal in two principal respects: (1) CAT claims require a showing of the \u201chigher bar\u201d of torture, rather than persecution; and (2) CAT regulations do not require the torture to fall within one of the enumerated grounds for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>The applicant must demonstrate \u201cthat it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2)). Because of the sketchy details surrounding the alleged police indifference following the shooting and the aforementioned credibility doubts surrounding the testimony, the IJ concluded that the petitioners had not established the requisite likelihood of torture upon removal to Pakistan. Thus, we conclude that the BIA\u2019s decision to affirm the IJ\u2019s denial of CAT protection was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we DISMISS the petition for review insofar as it seeks review of the denial of asylum and we DENY the balance of the petition for review and the accompanying motion to transfer.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b96-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-7\">. As of March 1, 2003, the INS\u2019s administrative, service, and enforcement functions were transferred from the Department of Justice to the new Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\u201d). <em>See </em>Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, \u00a7\u00a7 441, 451, 471, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002). The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"BICE\u201d) in the DHS assumed the INS\u2019s detention, removal, enforcement, and investigative functions. <em>See Peters v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 302, 304 n. 1 (5th Cir.2004). Because the removal proceedings in this case began after the reorganization, we will henceforth refer to the current agencies in this opinion for the sake of accuracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-13\">. The petitioners conceded removability on this ground and petition this court to review only the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b98-5\">. Anand Babo also testified that the police did not take any specific action following his report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b98-6\">. Besides expressing a general familiarity with the Hindu-Muslim conflict in Pakistan and a preference for continuing his education in the United States, Haman Babo\u2019s testimony largely tracked that of his father.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b98-7\">. A panel from this court denied the petitioners motion for a stay of deportation on July 14, 2005. The BIA subsequently denied the petitioners' motion to reopen on July 21, 2005, and further ordered that they would be barred from applying for adjustment of status pursuant to section 240B(d) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(d). The petitioners have not challenged these orders in the instant appeal, which would have otherwise been consolidated with this appeal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(6); <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 136 n. 3 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b98-15\">. In their reply brief and accompanying motion to transfer, the petitioners urge that this court has jurisdiction to consider the timeliness of their asylum claim following the passage of the REAL ID Act, Pub.L. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231 (May 11, 2005). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) (providing for judicial review of \"constitutional claims or questions of law raised upon a petition for review\u201d). Follow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>ing the passage of the REAL ID Act, however, previous panels of this court have noted that this provision does not preserve jurisdiction over an IJ\u2019s determination of the timeliness of an asylum application. <em>See, e.g. Nugroho, </em>168 Fed.Appx. at 15; <em>Bregu v. Gonzales, </em>165 Fed.Appx. 334, 335 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Maredia v. Gonzales, </em>160 Fed.Appx. 398, 399-400 (5th Cir.2005) (\"We cannot review whether the petitioner\u2019s application for asylum was timely filed or whether an exception to the one-year filing requirement applied.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b99-9\">. Because we have jurisdiction to review the remaining withholding of removal and CAT claims, we deny the petitioners' motion to transfer the case to the district court as a habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See Rosales v. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, </em>426 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.2005) (discussing the effect of the REAL ID Act and noting that this court is the \"exclusive forum\u201d for petitioners to challenge removal orders).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
