He now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of a \u201csafety valve\u201d reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The district court concluded that Gongora did not truthfully provide all information to the Government, as required for the application of the safety valve. The court found that Gongora\u2019s contention that he did not know the name of his employer was not credible. In light of the record as a whole, and in accordance with the deference due the district court\u2019s fact-finding, we find no clear error in the district court\u2019s determination. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>179 F.3d 961, 963-64 (5th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-10\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b638-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
