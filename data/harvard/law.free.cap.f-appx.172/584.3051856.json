The respondent has moved to dismiss Gerik\u2019s appeal as moot and to supplement the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">During the pendency of this appeal, Gerik was reclassified as being eligible for release on mandatory supervision and later released on mandatory supervision. As Gerik has received all of the relief he was seeking in his \u00a7 2254 application, his appeal is moot. <em>See McRae v. Hogan, </em>576 F.2d 615, 616-17 (5th Cir.1978). Accordingly, the motion to supplement the record is granted, the motion to dismiss is granted, and this appeal is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">MOTION TO SUPPLEMENT THE RECORD GRANTED; MOTION TO DISMISS GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b611-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
