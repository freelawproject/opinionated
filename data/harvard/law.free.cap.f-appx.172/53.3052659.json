Roman claims the district court reversibly erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Sentencing Guidelines. There was no <em>Booker </em>error (Sixth-Amendment violation) because the only enhancement to Roman\u2019s sentence was for his prior conviction. <em>See id., </em>125 S.Ct. at 756, 769. Instead, the district court committed <em>Fanfan </em>error by sentencing Roman under a mandatory guidelines scheme. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>418 F.3d 461, 463-64 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">The Government concedes Roman preserved his <em>Fanfan </em>claim. As such, we review for harmless error. <em>See id. </em>at 464. This court has rejected that <em>Fanfan </em>error is structural. <em>See id. </em>at 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The record does not show the district court would have imposed the same sentence had the guidelines been advisory rather than mandatory. The Government has not satisfied its burden of showing the <em>Fanfan </em>error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See id. </em>at 463-64. Accordingly, we vacate Roman\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing in accordance with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Roman next asserts that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional on their face, and as applied in his case, in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Roman\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Roman contends that ease was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule it in the light of <em>Apprendi </em>we have repeatedly rejected such contentions on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Roman concedes this claim is foreclosed in the light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent; he raises it to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">\n<em>CONVICTION AFFIRMED; SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b79-10\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
