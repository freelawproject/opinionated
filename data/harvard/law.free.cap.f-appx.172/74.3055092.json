Upon consideration of the motion and Wade\u2019s opposition, the magistrate judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>recommended that the complaint be dismissed because, <em>inter alia, </em>the transfer did not have prior written approval.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Wade filed written objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation of dismissal. He argued that the transfer of the television \u201cwas not contested by the Correctional Staff who called [the] Law Library Technician ... on said day to come to Unit 81 and not[a]rize the transfer\u201d and that \u201cCorrectional Staff knew of the transfer for three (3) years before confiscating the ... television.\u201d He also claimed that he did not receive a Rules Violation Report (\u201cRVR\u201d) or a \u201cnon-allowable items receipt\u201d for possession of contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Stating that Wade had not filed objections to the report, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and granted Simon\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Wade filed a \u201cPetition for Writ of Objection to Final Judgment\u201d asserting that he had filed objections. The court construed Wade\u2019s filing as a motion for reconsideration, which it denied despite acknowledging that Wade had, in fact, filed timely objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Wade appeals the denial of his motion for reconsideration. We review the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Dunn v. Cockrell, </em>302 F.3d 491, 492 (5th Cir.2002). Under this standard, \u201c[i]t is not enough that the granting of relief might have been permissible, or even warranted \u2014 denial must have been so <em>unwarranted </em>as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Williams v. Brown &amp; Root, Inc., </em>828 F.2d 325, 328 (5th Cir.1987) (citation omitted). \u201cWe examine only the trial judge\u2019s action in denying [the] motion; we cannot extend our review to the underlying merits of [the] case.\u201d <em>Trinity Carton Co., Inc. v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., </em>816 F.2d 1066, 1070 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The district court granted summary judgment and dismissed the case concluding that Wade had not received written approval before obtaining the television. Although the district court erred when it initially found that Wade had not filed objections to this report, it did not abuse its discretion in denying his motion to reconsider. Nowhere in his pleadings, including his objections, does Wade assert that he received written permission prior to obtaining the television. Furthermore, the only record evidence of the transfer is a notarized document, prepared by inmates, recording an inmate-to-inmate exchange. Notarization, however, is not written approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The district court\u2019s rejection of Wade\u2019s motion for reconsideration was not an abuse of discretion because he failed to demonstrate any error of law or fact establishing that dismissal was completely unwarranted. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b101-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-13\">. Wade also sued Christopher Epps, the Commissioner of Corrections. After conducting a <em>Spears </em>hearing, the district court dismissed the complaint against Epps, asserting that a superior cannot be held liable for the actions of a subordinate under <em>Monell v. Dept. of Social Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Wade did not timely appeal this dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b101-14\">. To state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must show the depravation of a constitutional right by a person acting under col- or of state law. <em>Briscoe v. LaHue, </em>460 U.S. 325, 329-30, 103 S.Ct. 1108, 75 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983). Here, Wade alleges that his property was taken without due process of law. <em>See Zinermon v. Burch, </em>494 U.S. 113, 125, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990) (\"In procedural due process claims, the deprivation by state action of a constitutionally protected interest in \u2018life, liberty, or property\u2019 is not in itself unconstitutional; what is unconstitutional is the deprivation of such an interest <em>without due process of law.\u201d)', Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 430, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982) (\u201cThe hallmark of property ... is an individual entitlement grounded in state law, which cannot be removed except 'for cause.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b102-19\">. There is some question as to whether the television listed as non-allowable property on Simon's incident report is the same as that seized from Wade. There is no dispute, however, that Correctional Staff confiscated a television from Wade.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
