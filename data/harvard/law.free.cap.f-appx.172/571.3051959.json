We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-18\">We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As Matney concedes, we review Hartford\u2019s decision to deny disability benefits under an abuse-of-discretion standard because the insurance plan gives Hartford discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits and to construe the plan\u2019s terms.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cWhen applying the abuse of discretion standard, \u2018we analyze whether the plan administrator acted arbitrarily or capriciously,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and \u201cwe [will] affirm an administrator\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A decision is arbitrary if there is no rational connection between the known or found facts and the evidence in the record.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cAn administrator\u2019s decision to deny benefits must be \u2018based on evidence, even if disputable, that clearly supports the basis for its denial.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This standard of review applies to an initial denial of benefits as well as termination of benefits after an initial determination of eligibility.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-19\">A potential conflict of interest is also a factor in the abuse-of-discretion inquiry, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>and under <em>Vega v. National Life Insurance Services, Inc., </em>evidence of such a conflict would require us to apply a \u201csliding scale\u201d with respect to the level of deference afforded to the administrator\u2019s decision, based on the degree of conflict.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Here, there is no evidence of a conflict other than Hartford\u2019s position as both the insurer and the administrator. Consequently, to the extent such a conflict affects the amount of discretion afforded Hartford\u2019s decision,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it is \u201conly a modicum less deference\u201d than we would otherwise afford.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Under Matney\u2019s long-term disability plan, \u201cDisabled\u201d means \u201ceither Totally or Partially Disabled\u201d and includes \u201cany accidental bodily injury, sickness, or pregnancy.\u201d Matney does not contend that she meets the plan\u2019s definition of \u201cpartially disabled,\u201d which would require her to show that she is \u201creceiving or entitled to benefits under this Plan while Totally Disabled, but: (1) [she is] able to perform some but not all of the material and substantial duties of [her] or any occupation on either a full-time or part-time basis; and (2) [she is] engaged in a program of Rehabilitative Employment.\u201d Therefore, recovery of benefits under Matney\u2019s plan requires proof that she is \u201ctotally disabled,\u201d which under the plan means she is \u201cprevented by Disability from doing any occupation or work for which [she is] or could become qualified by (1) training; (2) education; or (3) work experience.\u201d Even when total disability has been established, the plan requires continued proof of disability at Hartford\u2019s discretion: \u201cThe Hartford may require further written proof that you are still Disabled.\u201d The plan provides that disability payments will stop on \u201cthe date you fail to furnish proof that you are continuously Disabled.\u201d Although Matney received total disability benefits for several years, Hartford terminated benefits, concluding that Matney could no longer furnish proof of a physical disability that prevents her from \u201cdoing any occupation or work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Like the district court, our review is limited to the administrative record available to Hartford at the time it made the decision to terminate Matney\u2019s benefits.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Having reviewed the administrative record, which includes the opinions of several doctors who either treated Matney or reviewed her medical records, we conclude that Hartford\u2019s decision to terminate total disability benefits is supported by substantial evidence and has a rational connection to the evidence in the record. Therefore, Hartford did not abuse its discretion in finding that Matney does not meet the plan\u2019s definition of \u201ctotally disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">The district court made several other legal determinations that Matney does not contest on appeal even under the most liberal reading of her briefs. To the extent Matney\u2019s brief could be construed as challenging the district court\u2019s conclusion that Hartford applied a legally correct interpretation of the policy, which is not at all apparent from her brief, she has provided no argument or authorities supporting such a challenge. Therefore, Matney has waived the argument.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>In her reply brief, Matney asks the court to strike Hartford\u2019s brief because it uses a record-numbering system that differs from the one used by the district court and to strike portions of the administrative record containing the written reports of two doctors whose opinions she says are not reliable. Matney\u2019s motions to strike are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Hartford\u2019s motion to strike Matney\u2019s brief for failure to comply with Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9), which requires briefs to contain the parties\u2019 \u201ccontentions and the reasons for them, with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies,\u201d is DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">AFFIRMED; APPELLANT\u2019S MOTIONS TO STRIKE DENIED; APPELLEE\u2019S MOTION TO STRIKE IS DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b598-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
