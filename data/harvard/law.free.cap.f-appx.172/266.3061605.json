No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-15\">Defendant was convicted in June 1998 of five counts: (1) conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; (2) possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; (3) conspiracy to use and carry a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(o); (4) using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(1) and (2); and (5) possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e). The PSI first calculated a total offense level of 26: the base offense level was 24 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 3D1.3(a) and 2K2.1, plus a two-level increase was imposed under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) because the firearm with which Defendant was found was stolen. But the PSI also determined that the career offender and armed career offender provisions in U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.2 and 4B1.4(b)(2), applied; under the career offender provisions, the PSI recommended an enhanced offense level of 37, a criminal history category of VI, and a guideline range of 360 months to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-18\">The district court determined that scoring under the career offender provisions was proper but concluded that Defendant\u2019s criminal history was over-represented. The district court decided to depart downward to a base offense level of 30. Defendant was sentenced to a total of 270 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Defendant moved pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3582(c)(2) for a reduction of sentence arguing that Amendment 599 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 applied retroactively to preclude his possession of a firearm from contributing to his sentence calculation under more than one guideline section. The district court denied Defendant\u2019s motion without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">We review denial of a motion to reduce sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2003). Under certain circumstances, a court may, after consideration of sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), reduce the term of imprisonment based on a later lowering of the sentencing range by the Sentencing Commission \u201cif such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Amendment 599 altered \u00a7 2K2.4 and clarified the circumstances under which a court may impose a weapons enhancement on a defendant convicted of a firearms offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). <em>See </em>2000 Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual, Appendix C; <em>see also United States v. Pringle, </em>350 F.3d 1172, 1176 (11th Cir. 2003). But Defendant\u2019s first sentence calculation that included scoring under \u00a7 2K2.4 was trumped by the greater sentence applicable to a career offender under Chapter Four; \u00a7 2K2.4 had no effect on the sentence actually imposed. Because Defendant was not sentenced under \u00a7 2K2.4 (the section addressed by Amendment 599), Amendment 599 is inapposite. <em>See United States v. Sanders, </em>372 F.3d 1183, 1186 (10th Cir.2004) (\u201cAmendment 599 has nothing to do with \u00a7 4B1.4 but instead applies to \u00a7 2K2.4 of the Guidelines.\u201d). Amendment 599 can support no reduction in Defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 907 (11th Cir.2003) (Amendment 599 has no application when a defendant\u2019s sentence was not increased because of his possession of a firearm). No abuse of discretion has been shown.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\">. Defendant also argues that a reduction is due under Amendment 600. Amendment 600 revised \u00a7 2K2.4 to prohibit the use of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) convictions \"either to trigger application of the career offender guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, or to determine the appropriate offense level under that guideline.\u201d U.S.S.G. Manual Supp. to App. C (Nov. 1, 2002). Even assuming arguendo that this issue is properly preserved on appeal\u2014 Amendment 600 was not cited in Defendant's motion \u2014 Amendment 600 offers Defendant no relief. Retroactive application of a guidelines amendment is consistent with Sentencing Commission policy only if the amendment is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10(c). <em>See Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d at 907. Amendment 600 is not listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c). The district court\u2019s failure to apply Amendment 600 retroactively to modify Defendant\u2019s sentence supports no abuse of discretion claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
