On appeal, Berrio challenges (1) the district court\u2019s denial of a mitigating-role reduction, and (2) the reasonableness of his sentence. Finding no reversible error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-14\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b274-15\">A federal grand jury indicted Berrio for conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while aboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1903(a), (g), and (j), and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii) (Count 1); and possession with the intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while aboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 46 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1903(a) and (g), and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii) (Count 2). The indictment alleged a total of 1,450 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-16\">According to the record, Berrio was on a \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat intercepted by United States Coast Guard officers. During a pursuit from the officers, the crew jettisoned fifty-eight bales from the boat, which were later determined to contain 1,450 kilograms of cocaine. Berrio pled guilty to both counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-17\">The probation officer set Berrio\u2019s base offense level at 38 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2005). Berrio received a net three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1, resulting in a total offense level of 35. Berrio was assessed no criminal history points, making <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>his criminal history category I. His Sentencing Guidelines range was 168 to 210 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">At sentencing, Berrio raised two arguments that are relevant on appeal. First, Berrio argued that if he received a sentence equivalent to that of the average participant in the offense, he in effect would receive an enhanced sentence. Berrio stated that there was no evidence in this case that would justify an enhanced sentence and, instead, contended that he was entitled to a mitigating-role reduction because he was merely a mule in the operation. Berrio explained that the district court should consider the larger drug conspiracy, not just the individuals on the \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat, because those individuals, like Berrio, were not essential to the overall conspiracy and were easily replaceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The district court overruled this objection. It found that Berrio was \u201csimply a crew member\u201d and was only held accountable for the quantity of cocaine aboard the \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat and should only be compared to those with whom he participated. The district court found that, except for the captain, Berrio had the same role and responsibilities as the other crew members, and that he had not been shown to be less culpable. Therefore, the district court determined that Berrio had not established his entitlement to a role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Second, he argued that the district court should apply the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) rather than a strict application of the Guidelines. Berrio stressed that the district court should consider his personal characteristics and family situation in imposing a sentence. The government responded that, while <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), requires the district court to continue to consult the Guidelines, the district court had the discretion to depart from the advisory Guidelines range within the statutory minimum and maximum. The district court acknowledged that, in light of <em>Booker, </em>it would consider the advisory Guidelines range as well as the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Agreeing that Berrio was eligible for a safety-valve adjustment, the district court lowered Berrio\u2019s total offense level to 33 and his Sentencing Guidelines range to 135 to 168 months\u2019 imprisonment. Noting the advisory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines and the considerations in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the district court stated that \u201cthis is a serious case as are all drug distribution cases. And in order to reflect the seriousness of the offense and to promote respect for the laws of this country and provide appropriate punishment, substantial sentences of imprisonment are appropriate.\u201d R3 at 32. The court then sentenced Berrio to 135 months of imprisonment for Counts 1 and 2, and three years of supervised release for each count, to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">On appeal, Berrio argues that (1) the district court erred in refusing to provide a mitigating-role reduction and that (2) his sentence was unreasonable in light of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">A. <em>Mitigating-Role Reduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">We use pr <em>e-Booker </em>standards to review Sentencing Guidelines calculations. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (reviewing a pr <em>e-Booker </em>sentence). Even though the Guidelines are advisory after <em>Booker, </em>the district court must continue to consider them when sentencing and must correctly calculate the sentence under the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 1178-79. A sentencing court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>finding of fact that we review for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>0en banc). </em>\u201cThe proponent of the downward adjustment ... always bears the burden of proving a mitigating role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The Sentencing Guidelines permit a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by four levels if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminimal participant\u201d or two levels if it finds that the defendant was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 (2005). A minimal participant is one who is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved in the conduct of a group.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 4. A minor participant is one \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The adjustment applies if the defendant \u201cplay[ed] a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially less culpable than the average participant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(A). The determination of whether to apply a role reduction is a fact-based inquiry, and a sentencing court, \u201cin weighing the totality of the circumstances, is not required to find, based solely on the defendant\u2019s bare assertion, that such a role adjustment is warranted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In determining whether a mitigating role adjustment is warranted, a district court \u201cshould be informed by two principles discerned from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 940. In the first step of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, the court should evaluate the defendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which he has been held accountable at sentencing. In looking at relevant conduct, \u201cthe district court must assess whether the defendant is a minor or minimal participant in relation to the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant in calculating [his] base offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. \u201cOnly if the defendant can establish that [he] played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [he] has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant a downward adjustment for minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. Although a defendant\u2019s status as a drug courier alone does not establish whether or not he is a minor participant, \u201cwhen a drug courier\u2019s relevant conduct is limited to [his] own act of importation, a district court may legitimately conclude that the courier played an important or essential role in the importation of those drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 942-43. Furthermore, in the drug courier context, \u201cthe amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct\u201d and, in some cases, could be dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">In the second step of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, the district court should evaluate a defendant\u2019s role \u201cas compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940. In so doing, a district court may consider only those participants who are identifiable by the evidence and who were involved in the relevant conduct for which the defendant was convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 944. \u201cThe fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of [his] role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor or minimal participants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original); see <em>also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(A) (\u201cThis section provides a range of adjustments for a defendant who plays a part in committing the offense that makes him substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>less culpable than the average participant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Here, the district court did not clearly err in refusing to grant Berrio a mitigating-role reduction. Under the first step of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis, the district court properly measured Berrio\u2019s role against the relevant conduct attributed to him. Berrio\u2019s relevant conduct was possessing with intent to distribute 1,450 kilograms of cocaine. Such a large amount of drugs is enough reason by itself to preclude him from receiving a mitigating role adjustment. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 943. Additionally, he did not establish that he was a minor participant with respect to that relevant conduct that was attributed to him, and he cannot point to any larger criminal conspiracy beyond the facts presented in this case. It was legitimate for the court to conclude that Berrio, as a crewman on the \u201cgo-fast\u201d boat that was transporting the drugs, played an essential role in the conduct for which he has been held accountable. <em>See id. </em>at 942-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The second step of <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>analysis further precludes a mitigating role adjustment. To the extent that Berrio argues that his role should be compared to others in a larger conspiracy, his argument is meritless because other unnamed conspirators were not discernible from the evidence, and they are not part of the relevant conduct for which Berrio was convicted. <em>See id. </em>at 940, 944. With respect to the other named participants in the relevant conduct, they were all part of the same conspiracy and were all held accountable for the same amount of drugs. There is nothing in the facts to indicate that he was substantially less culpable than most of his fellow crewmen, who, with the exception of the captain, shared similar roles and responsibilities. Therefore, the district court did not clearly err by denying Berrio a mitigating-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">B. <em>Reasonableness of Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">Berrio next argues that his sentence was unreasonable in light of the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that the district court failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or other factors that would have reduced his sentence, such as his familial and financial background.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Berrio contends that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 provides us with jurisdiction to review his sentence because it vests appellate courts with jurisdiction to review \u201call\u201d final decisions of the district courts. He asserts that \u00a7 3742 does not alter or limit our jurisdiction under \u00a7 1291. Berrio argues that <em>Booker </em>provided for a reasonableness review of all sentences, whether within or outside of the Guidelines range. Therefore, Berrio claims that a sentence that is greater than necessary to fulfill the purposes of sentencing is contrary to law and reviewable under \u00a7 3742(a)(1) as a sentence \u201cimposed in violation of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">The government responds that we lack jurisdiction to decide the reasonableness of Berrio\u2019s sentence. It argues that the factors found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) provide the only means for appellate review of a sentence. According to the government, when a sentence falls within the advisory Guidelines range, a defendant\u2019s claim of unreasonableness does not meet the \u201cimposed in violation of the law\u201d standard of \u00a7 3742(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">We review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), a defendant may appeal his sentence if that sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-13\">(1) was imposed in violation of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>(2) was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">(3) is greater than the sentence specified in the applicable guideline range to the extent that the sentence includes a greater fine or term of imprisonment, probation, or supervised release than the maximum established in the guideline range, or includes a more limiting condition of probation or supervised release under section 3563(b)(6) or (b)(ll) than the maximum established in the guideline range; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">(4) was imposed for an offense for which there is no sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\"><em>See also Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 258-67, 125 S.Ct. at 764-68 (2005) (excising the standards of review in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) and holding that a review for reasonableness could be inferred from pre-2003 text preceding the revisions of the PROTECT Act Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 670). We have held that \u201ca post <em>-Booker </em>appeal based on the \u2018unreasonableness\u2019 of a sentence, whether within or outside the advisory guidelines range, is an appeal asserting that the sentence was imposed in violation of law pursuant to \u00a7 3742(a)(1).\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Sentences imposed under the advisory Sentencing Guidelines are reviewed for \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 260-61, 263-65, 125 S.Ct. at 765, 767. Following <em>Booker, </em>we have stated that the district court must first correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s Guidelines range, then, using the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court \u201cmay impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as it is reasonable.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>407 F.3d at 1179. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the available sentences, the applicable Guidelines range and policy statements, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to (1) reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense, (2) afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, (3) protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and (4) provide the defendant with needed correctional treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1246. However, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">\u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence within the advisory Guidelines range is not per se reasonable, though it is expected to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c[W]hen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d). We have held that a district court\u2019s statement that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors alone is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences to indicate that it considered the factors, and we concluded that the defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable because the district court accurately calculated the Guidelines range and the defendant\u2019s sentence at the low end of the range reflected the court\u2019s consideration of his evidence in mitigation. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-11\">Because we have rejected a jurisdictional argument similar to the one the government advances and held that we have jurisdiction under \u00a7 3742(a)(1) to review a sentence within the advisory Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>range for reasonableness, we reject the government\u2019s jurisdictional argument in this case. <em>See Martinez, </em>434 F.3d at 1321-22. Upon review of the sentence, we note that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and accurately calculated the Guidelines range. Moreover, the district court explicitly mentioned its consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the seriousness of Berrio\u2019s crime when it determined that the facts warranted a substantial sentence. Additionally, Berrio\u2019s sentence was at the low end of the Guidelines range, a range that takes into account his offense conduct, his personal characteristics and history, just punishment, and adequate deterrence. Thus, we conclude that Berrio\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Berrio appeals his 135-month sentence for his drug convictions. We conclude (1) that the district court\u2019s denial of a mitigating-role reduction was not reversible error and (2) that the sentence was reasonable. AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
