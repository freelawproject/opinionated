Shepherd argues that his sentence was improper under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). However, Shepherd knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights, the Government has invoked the waiver, and the plain language of the waiver bars this appeal. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 231-232 (5th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 546 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir. 2005). Shepherd\u2019s argument that the waiver does not bind him because it was perfected prior to the release of <em>Booker </em>is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 450-51 (5th Cir.2005). Consequently, Shepherd\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b593-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
