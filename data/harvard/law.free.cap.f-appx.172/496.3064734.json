He challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to give an alibi instruction and its sentencing finding that he suborned perjury. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-20\">In 2004, a grand jury indicted Smoot on charges of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine and possessing with intent to distribute at least 500 grams of cocaine on March 2, 2003. At trial, two of Smoot\u2019s co-conspirators testified about the conspiracy and also testified that they purchased a kilogram of cocaine from Smoot on both March 2 and March 3 of 2003 at Smoot\u2019s apartment. Smoot presented Latisha Bryant, his ex-girlfriend, as his only witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-21\">Bryant testified that on March 2, 2003, she spent the night at Smoot\u2019s apartment, and that they were alone the entire time. She further testified that Smoot spent March 3, 2003 at her apartment. Bryant relied on a personal calendar to refresh her memory; she testified that she had recorded where she spent the night on those dates in her calendar. On cross-examination, Bryant admitted that Smoot had asked her to serve as a witness. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>There were a number of inconsistencies in Bryant\u2019s testimony. She gave varying accounts of when her relationship with Smoot began and ended, and although she remembered what happened in March 2003 in great detail, she was unable to recall the content of more recent conversations she had with Smoot after his arrest. In addition, she was unable to explain phone calls between her cell phone and a phone number used by Smoot on March 2, 2003 during the time that she claimed to be with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Before Bryant ever testified, Smoot\u2019s lawyer accurately proffered the content of her testimony and requested that the district court give the jury an alibi instruction. During the charge conference, Smoot\u2019s attorney admitted that Bryant could only provide an alibi for March 3, 2003, because Bryant\u2019s testimony would indicate that Smoot spent March 2, 2003 in his apartment. The district court declined to give the alibi instruction, finding that Smoot\u2019s presence was not required for the conspiracy charge and that the evidence did not provide an alibi for the substantive charge \u2014 possession with intent to distribute on March 2, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The jury convicted Smoot of both the conspiracy and the substantive charge. At Smoot\u2019s sentencing hearing, he objected to the Presentence Report\u2019s recommendation that he receive an enhancement for obstruction of justice on the grounds that he suborned perjury when he asked Bryant to testify on his behalf. He argued that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding that Bryant perjured herself or that Smoot suborned perjury. The district court overruled Smoot\u2019s objection, finding that Bryant\u2019s testimony was \u201cpreposterous\u201d and \u201cincredible\u201d and that Smoot urged his lawyer to subpoena Bryant. Smoot\u2019s total offense level and criminal history resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 121 to 151 months. The district court sentenced Smoot to 136 months for each count, with sentences to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Smoot alleges that the district court erred when it refused to give the jury an alibi instruction. We review a district court\u2019s decision not to give a requested jury instruction for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Hassouneh, </em>199 F.3d 175, 181 (4th Cir.2000). \u201cA district court\u2019s refusal to provide an instruction requested by a defendant constitutes reversible error only if the instruction: 1) was correct; 2) was not substantially covered by the court\u2019s charge to the jury; and 3) dealt with some point in the trial so important, that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to conduct his defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>53 F.3d 29, 32 (4th Cir. 1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Camejo, </em>929 F.2d 610, 614 (11th Cir.1991)) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, \u201cas a threshold for applying this test, a defendant must present an adequate evidentiary foundation supporting the instruction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">An alibi is \u201ca defense that places the defendant at the relevant time of crime in a different place than the scene involved and so removed therefrom as to render it impossible for him to be the guilty party.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>71 (6th ed. 1990); <em>see also Holdren v. Legursky, </em>16 F.3d 57, 63 n. 4 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">In this case, the indictment indicated that the conspiracy in question lasted for four years and involved at least seven participants. Smoot\u2019s presence at his apartment on March 2 and 3, 2003 was not a required element of the conspiracy, thus an alibi instruction for the conspiracy charge in this case would clearly have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>inappropriate. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>483 F.2d 968, 970 (5th Cir.1973) (\u201cSince it was unnecessary for the government to have proved his presence, the alibi defense failed and no instruction concerning it was required.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The substantive drug count charged Smoot with possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine \u201con or about March 2, 2003.\u201d The testimony of Smoot\u2019s co-conspirators indicated that the drug sales in question occurred at Smoot\u2019s apartment. Although Bryant\u2019s testimony offered Smoot a potential alibi for March 3, 2003, she testified that Smoot was at his apartment the night of March 2, 2003. Smoot admitted that Bryant did not provide an alibi for March 2 when he described her as \u201can alibi witness as to the 3rd and a present witness as to the 2nd.\u201d Because Smoot did not offer any evidence that he was not at his apartment on March 2, 2003, we find that he has not established the evidentiary foundation required by <em>Lewis, </em>53 F.3d at 33 n. 8. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to give Smoot\u2019s requested alibi instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Smoot additionally contends that there was insufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s finding that Smoot suborned perjury. The district court made this finding while calculating Smoot\u2019s advisory sentencing guidelines range; the court imposed a two level enhancement for obstruction of justice based on the finding. <em>Post-Booker, </em>we review sentences for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546-47 (2005). Smoot does not allege <em>Booker </em>error here; rather, he asserts that the district court\u2019s error in calculating the advisory guidelines range justifies vacating his sentence. We continue to review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and legal interpretations of the guidelines <em>de novo. See United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456-57 (4th Cir.2006). A district court\u2019s error in calculating the advisory guidelines range will, in most cases, render the ultimate sentence unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">The sentencing guidelines clearly contemplate that the act of suborning perjury qualifies a defendant for a two level obstruction of justice enhancement. <em>See </em>United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3C1.1, application note 4 (2004). Perjury requires a finding that a witness \u201ctestified 1) falsely, 2) as to a material fact, and 3) willfully in order to obstruct justice, not merely inaccurately as the result of confusion or a faulty memory.\u201d <em>United States v. Cook, </em>76 F.3d 596, 605 (4th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). Circuit precedent indicates that subornation of perjury requires that the \u201cthe suborner should have known or believed or have had good reason to believe that the testimony given would be false; that he should have known or believed that the witness would testify willfully and corruptly, and with knowledge of the falsity; and that he should have knowingly and willfully induced or procured the witness to give such false testimony.\u201d <em>Petite v. United States, </em>262 F.2d 788, 794 (4th Cir.1959) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1622 (2000) (defining suborning perjury as procuring another to commit perjury).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">In this case, the district court found that the jury discredited Bryant\u2019s testimony, and that Bryant \u201ccertainly was bound and determined to try to help [Smoot], to the extent of perjuring herself.\u201d The inconsistencies in Bryant\u2019s testimony and the fact that the jury disbelieved her account of what happened on March 2 and 3 suffice to support the district court\u2019s finding that Bryant committed perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>The record also provides sufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that Smoot procured Bryant\u2019s testimony. Smoot knew the content of Bryant\u2019s testimony in advance because his counsel summarized Bryant\u2019s testimony for the court when he requested the alibi instruction. In addition, Bryant testified that Smoot asked her to testify on his behalf. These two facts indicate that Smoot knew Bryant would offer false testimony and that he persuaded her to give that testimony. Thus we conclude that the district court did not err in applying a two level obstruction of justice enhancement to Smoot\u2019s advisory guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
