Brown\u2019s estate given to me by her will to Henry J. Williams, Esq., and George B.

And it is further my will and direction, that the principal of the property hereby devised, shall in no event be liable for any debts or claims which now exist, or may hereafter exist, against my said nephew, or against his children, or any of them.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-7\">The questions raised under the will of Mrs. Brown, before the auditor and the court below, were, first, whether Thomas Niell was entitled to the entire fee, subject to the trust during his life; and, secondly, whether the will of Mrs. Brown contained a good executory devise on the failure of Mrs. Finney to dispose of the estate by either deed or will. The question that was raised before the auditor and the Orphans\u2019 Court under the will of Mrs. Finney was, whether there was an intestacy as to any portion of Mrs. Finney\u2019s estate, or whether the latter clause, above recited, was sufficient to raise an estate by implication in the children of Thomas Neill. If such an estate could not be implied from the words of the will, then the real estate would descend to Thomas Neill, and the personal estate would be divided <em>per capita </em>among the children of Jacob Reese and Thomas Neill, the latter obtaining one eighth part. The following is the distribution which the auditor made, and which being affirmed by the court below, was here assigned for error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-8\">The balance in the hands of the accountant as administrator of Mrs. Brown, which was $37,580.67, was distributed as follows':</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-9\">To George B.

Murray Rush </em>and <em>W. JF. Judson,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amf\">on behalf of Thomas Niell, contended on the first point under Mrs. Brown\u2019s will, that the expression \u201c children\u201d was intended by the testatrix to have the same meaning with issue or other word which would convey a fee tail in real estate and fee simple in personal: Price <em>v. </em>Taylor, 4 Casey 102; Williams <em>v. </em>Leech, Id. 89; Steacy <em>v. </em>Rice, 3 Id. 82; Naglee\u2019s Appeal, 9 Id. 89; McKee <em>v. </em>McKenley, 9 Id. 92.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b291-11\">And those same gentlemen with Mr. McQall, who represented a separate interest, that of the Pennsylvania Company, on the second point, argued that the bequest in question was not an absolute one, but a gift for life with remainder to Mrs. Finney\u2019s appointees, by either deed or will. That the evident design of the testatrix was that if her sister desired, she might make an absolute disposition of it. By the subsequent limitation in the will, an estate was <em>vested </em>in the trustees of Thomas Neill: Fearne 223; Maundrell <em>v. </em>Maundrell, 7 Ves. Jr. 557; 10 Ves. Jr. 246; Sugden on Powers, ch. 2, \u00a7 4, p. 151; Smith on Executory Interests, \u00a7 115. It is submitted that the devise or bequest over to the trustees of the Neills is a good executory bequest: Williams on Real Property, Am. ed., p. 259; Fearne 468; Doe <em>v. </em>Webber, 1 B. &amp; Ald. 713; 4 Bacon\u2019s Abridgment 297; Beachcroft <em>v. </em>Broome, 4 Term R. 441; Doe <em>v. </em>Glover, 1 C.

The implication in such a case need not be a necessary one, but only reasonable: <em>Doe v. </em>Summersett, 5 Burr. 2608.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b292-7\"><em>Eli K.

These words are sufficiently satisfied by the estate to fall upon the children as her heirs, namely: all the real estate as heirs of- the whole blood, and their father\u2019s share of the personalty as one with all the Reese family of the half blood, in equal degree, <em>per capita: </em>Purd. 453; Lewin on Trusts 181; Hill on Trustees 119; Flintham\u2019s Appeal, 11 S. &amp; R. 18; Morris <em>v. </em>Phaler, 1 Watts 389; Fisher <em>v. </em>Herbell, 7 W. &amp; S. 63; Gernet <em>v. </em>Lynn, 7 Casey 94; Fairies\u2019 Appeal, 23 P.

Mrs. Brown, after giving, by her will, various legacies, divided the residue of her estate into two half parts \u2014 one of which she gave to her sister, Mrs. Finney, \u201c absolut\u00e9ly, so that she may dispose of the same by will or otherwise, as fully and amply as if the same now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>belonged to her\u201d \u2014 and the other half to Mrs. Finney to receive the income thereof during her natural life, and after her death, over to trustees, to pay the income to her nephews Thomas Neill and George B. Neill, \u201c in equal shares, and in case of the death of either of said nephews, to pay his share of the said income to the children of the said deceased nephew, and if he should die without children, then to the surviving nephew during his natural life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">As to the first half, we cannot doubt that Mrs. Finney took an absolute fee simple interest. Nor is it affected by the concluding clause of the will, in which the testatrix provided that in case Mrs. Finney should not survive her, or, surviving her, should not by will or otherwise dispose of this part of the estate, it should go to the nephews under the same trust as that above expressed, because Mrs. Finney did survive Mrs. Brown, and did dispose of the estate by her will for life, and left the fee to descend to her heirs under the intestate laws. That was <em>\u201c </em>disposing\u201d of it within the meaning of Mrs. Brown\u2019s will. The condition was not that it should be disposed of in any particular manner, but <em>\u201c by will or otherwise.\" </em>Such a condition is no restraint upon a tenant in fee, for it is only declaratory of one of the necessary incidents of the estate. A fee simple may be disposed of by deed, or will, or the intestate laws, according to the election of the owner, and all the powers which any tenant in fee possesses, Mrs. Brown meant should vest in Mrs. Finney in respect to this half of her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Then as to the other half, we think it equally clear that Mrs. Finney had a life estate, and after her death, George B. Neill having also died childless, Thomas took an estate for life, and that the fee, undisposed of by flhe will, descended to the heirs at law of Mrs. Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Such is our reading of Mrs. Brown\u2019s will. We come now to that of Mrs. Finney. She gives all her estate, real and personal, \u201c and also all that part of my sister Susan B. Brown\u2019s estate, given me by .her will,\u201d to trustees \u201c in trust, to pay over the rents, issues,' profits, and income thereof, as the same may be received, to my nephew Thomas Neill, during his life.\u201d This was a devise of a life estate, and a dying intestate as to the fee. We have already shown that she had an absolute property in half of Mrs. Brown\u2019s estate. In her own estate her rights were no more absolute. Carving out a life estate for Thomas, she left the fee in her whole estate to descend to her heirs at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">We see no symptom of an executory devise. The only ground for an argument in favour of one, is contained in the following clause: <em>\u201c </em>And it is further my will and direction, that the principal of the property hereby devised shall in no event be liable for any debts or claims which now exist, or may hereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>exist against my said, nephew, or against <em>his children or any of them.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">This was copied from Mrs. Brown\u2019s will, and was intended to protect the \u201c principal\u201d of the estate from Thomas\u2019s creditors; hut as the estate was expressly limited to his life, the creditors of his children could not touch it, of course. That clause was superfluous and absurd. An estate to A. for life shall not be subject to the debts of his children \u2014 does that make an executory devise ? Surely not. An executory devise is a limitation by will of a future estate or interest in lands or chattels; but here the will limits no estate except a life estate in the nephew Thomas. None is to be implied from the thoughtless declaration, copied from a previous will, that \u201c the principal of the property hereby devised\u201d shall not be subject to the debts of the devisee\u2019s children. The \u201cproperty hereby devised\u201d could not be liable, in the nature of things, but even if it could be, the words are limited to <em>that </em>estate \u2014 a life estate in- Thomas \u2014 and import no intention to create any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">This is, in substance and effect, the manner in which the auditor and the court below construed the wills of these ladies, and therefore the decree in each case is affirmed, and the appeals dismissed at costs of appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
