That plaintiff was not entitled to judgment, even if defendant had filed no affidavit, forasmuch as his own affidavit showed that the mortgage had been duly and legally assigned to him, and as a consequence the suit should have been brought in his name as the legal plaintiff, and could not be sustained as brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-8\">2. That the rule of court required nothing more than a general affidavit that the party has a just and legal defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-9\">3. That defendant\u2019s affidavit, either with or without the supplemental affidavit, is sufficient under said rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-10\">The court below entered judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. Whereupon defendant sued out this writ, and assigned for error\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-11\">The court erred in entering judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, because</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-12\">1. The suit should have been in his own name. 2. The rule requires but a general affidavit; and, 3. The affidavit of defendant, with or without his supplemental affidavit, was sufficient under any construction which could be given to the rule of court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-13\"><em>B. S. Woods, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAx\">\u2014 The suit should have been brought in the name of McMahan: Pryor <em>v. </em>Wood, 7 Casey 142. The affidavits show the \u201cnature and character of the defence at length;\u201d and there was a sufficient consideration to support the contract for extending the time of payment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-14\"><em>J. H. Miller, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZ\">\u2014 The case of Pryor <em>v. </em>Wood is unlike the present. The assignment was different.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-15\">An equitable assignment is a declaration of trust, with an agreement to permit the assignee to sue in assignor\u2019s name: Kennedy\u2019s Executors <em>v. </em>Ware, 1 Barr 450; see also Moor <em>v. </em>Harrisburg Bank, 8 Watts 138. The legal title can only pass by conforming to the provisions of the Act of 1715, or by an assignment duly acknowledged and recorded. If an equitable assignee could sue in his own name, the Act of April 23d 1829, Purd. 304, would be absurd.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-16\">2. The affidavit was insufficient under the rule of court which requires that it should \u201cstate specifically and at length the nature and character of the defence\u201d relied on.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>There was no new consideration for the alleged agreement for time. To pay \u201c6 per cent, during -the averred extension\u201d was no more than the mortgage called for, and the deposit in specie was only a mode of payment for the convenience of defendant.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Atn\">November 19th 1860,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"A-I\">by Thompson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbT\">\u2014 In Pryor <em>v. </em>Wood, 7 Casey 142, it was held that where the assignment of the mortgage was duly executed, acknowledged, and recorded according to the Act of 9th April 1849, it passed the legal title of the mortgagee, and the suit must be in the name of the assignee. That case is very unlike the present. Here the assignment was neither under seal nor in the presence of witnesses, or acknowledged and recorded. It was therefore but an equitable assignment, and the <em>soi. fa. </em>was properly issued in the name of the holder of the legal title for use of the assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">The original affidavit of defence was clearly insufficient, for it disclosed no binding obligation on part of the assignee to forbear suit on the mortgage. The contract disclosed, if it could be called such, was <em>nudum paotum, </em>and not binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">To remedy this, a supplemental affidavit by leave of court was filed. But this was not any better than its predecessor. It disclosed an agreement to pay interest at the usual rate for the time alleged to have been given. This was what was secured already by the mortgage. It was not to pay interest in advance, or any such matter; but that the mortgage should bear interest. There was no consideration in this. It was the contract relation of the parties without such agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">But the affidavit also disclosed as a consideration of forbearance, an agreement on part of the mortgagor to pay the mortgage-money in specie into bank, and send a certificate of deposit to the mortgagee in Ohio. As the mortgagee had a right to exact specie, that stipulation amounted to nothing. The arrangement to send a certificate of deposit was evidently for the convenience of the debtor; otherwise it would have been his duty to have gone, or sent some one to Ohio to pay off the mortgage. It was not attempted to be shown that in fact the rate of exchange would have been in favour of the mortgagee if the certificate of deposit had been sent. The affidavits disclosed no defence, and the court below were right in so ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
