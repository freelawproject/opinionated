That the estate given to Robert Stewart Story was neither a fee simple nor- a fee tail; and</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-11\">2. That, if the estate given was a fee tail, it was not well barred; and</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b168-12\">3. That the estate given to him was a life estate, capable of being enlarged to a fee on the happening of the contingency on which it was to depend, viz., the leaving of issue, but that on his dying without issue the devise over was to take effect: citing, in support of these propositions, Johnson <em>v. </em>Currin, 10 Barr 503; Roe <em>v. </em>Jeffery, 7 T. R. 333; Langley <em>v. </em>Heald, 7 W. &amp; S. 98; 2 Jarman on Wills 311; Pells <em>v. </em>Brown, Cro.

W. 667; 3 Atkins 288; Clark <em>v. </em>Baker, 3 S. &amp; R. 477; Middleswarth <em>v. </em>Collins, 8 Leg. Int. 11; Allen <em>v. </em>Markle, 12 Casey 117 ; \u2014 and that, being an estate tail, it was barred in accordance with the Act of Assembly on that subject.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AC06\">February 4th 1861,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b168-14\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"Anl\">by Strong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYf\">\u2014 We think that, under the will of Robert Stewart, Robert S. Story took an estate tail, which by his deed to bar the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>entailment, and the subsequent reconveyance to bim, became a fee simple. The devise was to him for life, and if be should die leaving lawful issue, to bim, bis heirs and assigns for ever; but if be should die leaving no such lawful issue, then over. The argument of the plaintiff in error is that the testator contemplated a definite and not an indefinite failure of issue of the first taker.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The thing given was real estate. However much the rule may be relaxed in regard to bequests of personalty, it is inflexible as regards devises of realty; that words such as are used in this will import an indefinite failure of issue. Smith, in his work on Executory Interests, p. 588, collects a large number of cases, and remarks in regard to them, that \u201cit will be perceived that, as regards real estate, no distinction exists between the words \u2018 die without issue,\u2019 and \u2018die without leaving issue,\u2019 and \u2018in default,\u2019 or on failure,\u2019 and \u2018for want of issue,\u2019 but that all those expressions, in devises made before the year 1838 (the date of the recent British statute), are construed to import of themselves an indefinite failure of issue.\u201d The rule has again and again been asserted to be the law of Pennsylvania. The case was, therefore, rightly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
