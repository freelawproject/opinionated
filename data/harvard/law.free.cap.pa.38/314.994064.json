Whether testator intended to bequeath the sums of money named in his will to John Armistead Carter and others, so as to make them legacies taking effect under the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-14\">2.

He accordingly awarded to Mrs. Miitter the whole of the balance in hand, to be held by her for her own use during her life, and, subject to her life estate therein, awarded to John Armistead Carter $10,000, to Mrs. Mary L. Eliason $10,000, to Thomas Miitter Cleeman $5000, and to Thomas Miitter Hoff $5000, over which sums he reported that Mrs. Miitter had no power of testamentary appointment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">As to the balance of the estate, he reported that Mrs. Miitter had only a life estate therein, with a power of disposing by last will and testament of the remainder after her life estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-7\">Exceptions to this report were filed on behalf of Mrs. Miitter, but the Orphans\u2019 Court on argument confirmed the report.

The court erred in confirming the report of the auditor awarding $10,000 to John Armistead Carter, $10,000 to Mrs. Mary L. Eliason, $5000 to Thomas Miitter Cleeman, and $5000 to Thomas Miitter Hoff, as vested in them, but payable to them at the death of the said Mary W. A.

The will first gives her all his property of every description. The bequest to the College of Physicians is subordinate to her enjoyment in case of her surviving him. When he speaks of his estate being reduced by further losses to less than $90,000, he gives his entire property to his wife <em>without restriction, </em>postponing the College of Physicians until after her death; and the interlineation of the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number><em>\u201cand in fee to </em>will\u201d all indicate his intention to give her absolute dominion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-6\">Admitting the existence of contradictory clauses in the latter portion of the will, and the general rule under which they are allowed to prevail over the former, it is settled that a prior devise must be disturbed no further than is absolutely necessary for the purpose of giving effect to the posterior qualifying disposition : 1 Jarman on Wills 414.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-7\">The bequest here is \u201cfor life and in fee\u201d \u2014 both incidents of ownership, the mention of which is not inconsistent with absolute ownership: Doe <em>v. </em>Thomas, 3 A. &amp; E. 123, 30 E.

Where several clauses are contradictory, the latter prevail over the former.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-11\">The case presents three questions:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-12\">1. Was the bequest to Thomas Miitter Hoff adeemed by the survivorship of Mrs. Miitter ? To her it was a bequest for life, and was not enlarged to a fee by the words \u201c and in fee to will at her death,\u201d under the rule above given. Doe <em>v. </em>Thornly, 10 East 458, was a case like this, in which this rule was recognised. Nor is there any force in the argument that this was no bequest to Thomas Miitter Hoff, but only a wish that she would bequeath him $5000. Words occurring more than once in a will are presumed to be used always in the same sense: 2 Powell on Devises 8, 9. Elsewhere in this will the words \u201c I wish\u201d clearly express an absolute disposition.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-13\">2. Is the legacy of Thomas Miitter Hoff defeated by the fact that the whole estate was worth less than $90,000 ? It does not appear that testator met with further losses, which was the condition on which this provision relative to the College of Physicians depended. It has no bearing whatever on any other legacy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b319-14\">3. Is the legacy in Thomas Miitter Hoff vested ? That it is so, is evident from the provision of the will examined in the light of the following authorities: Stapleton <em>v. </em>Cheales, 1 Eq. Ca. Abr. 295, pl. 1; Hanson <em>v. </em>Graham, 6 Vesey 239; Duffield v. Duffield, 1 Dow. &amp; C. 311; Jackson <em>v. </em>Jackson, 1 Ves. 216; Sydney <em>v. </em>Vaughn, 2 Bro. P.

C. 471.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Arg\">March 11th 1861,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"ABV\">by Strong, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahl\">\u2014 We are of opinion that under the will, Mrs. Miitter takes the whole estate of the testator, subject only to the payment at her death of the legacies to John Armistead Carter, Mrs. Mary L. Eliason, Thomas Miitter Cleeman, and Thomas Miitter Hoff. The paramount purpose, the ruling intention, of the testator evidently was to make the most ample provision for his wife, if she should survive him. ' Accordingly, after having given directions for carrying out an agreement which he had made with the \u201c College of Physicians,\u201d he bequeathed to her all his property of every description and everything which he possessed, or to which he might have any claim, with the sole exception of the bequest to the \u201c College of Physicians.\u201d He next directed that if Ms proposed arrangement with the college should fail, and if the New York Academy of Medicine should also decline his propositions, the legacy which he had given to them should be paid to his wife, if she should survive him. Then again he gave and bequeathed his entire property, <em>without restriction, </em>to his wife, in the contingency that further losses should reduce it to a value less than the sum of ninety thousand dollars, clear of all encumbrance and doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Having thus made arrangements for the distribution of his entire estate, he. next settled another disposition of it, to take effect only in the contingency that he should survive his wife. By this alternative disposition he gave, among other legacies, four to the persons above named, without directing any postponement of the time of enjoyment, and appointed a residuary legatee. He then added, \u201c I wish to state distinctly that the above-named, legacies (referring to all those given, if his wife should die before him) only hold good in case of my surviving my beloved wife, to whom I give the entire use of my estate and property during her life and in fee to will at her death. But I wish the four following legacies to be paid at her death, viz.: ten thousand dollars to John Armistead Carter, or in case of his death to his son Welby; ten thousand dollars to Mrs. Mary L. Eliason, or in case of her death to her daughter Mary, to be settled upon herself; five thousand dollars to Thomas Miitter Cleeman, or in case of his death to be divided between his two sisters; five thousand dollars to Thomas Miitter Hoff, and in case of death, to revert to his mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Does then this latter clause cut down to a life interest the absolute and entire estate given to the wife in the former part of the will ? If it be utterly inconsistent with the gift of the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>interest in the property, it must prevail, because it is expressive of the latest intention of the testator. But the will is to be construed as a whole, and one part is not to be treated as repugnant to another, if it be possible for both to stand. Mr. Jarman lays down the rule of construction in these words, 1 Jar. on Wills 416-6: <em>\u201c </em>But the rule which sacrifices the former of several contradictory clauses, is never applied but on the failure of every attempt to give the whole such a construction, as will render every part of it effective. In the attainment of this object, the local order of the limitations is disregarded, if it be possible by the transposition of them to deduce a consistent disposition from the entire will.\u201d Bearing in mind then, that the testator had expressed more than once his will that his wife should have the' entire ownership of his property, and that in the strongest possible language, and that the \u201cpurpose of the last clause seems to have been not so much to designate the extent of his benefactions to his wife as to secure the payment of certain legacies after her death, we adopt no strained construction when we hold that a gift to her \u201c for life and in fee to will\u201d was not. intended to take away anything which had been previously given. We cannot construe one part of the will without reference to the other parts. A gift \u201cfor life and in fee to will\u201d may mean a gift of the whole, and if it may, then it must in this case; for otherwise the different parts of the will would be repugnant to each other. This conclusion is also fortified by the fact that no disposition is made of what would remain if Mrs. Miitter takes but a life estate. She would then have a power to dispose of the remainder by will. Yet if she should fail to exercise that power, that remainder would fall under the- intestate laws. But in addition to the ordinary presumption against an intended intestacy, this will furnishes abundant proof of the testator\u2019s purpose to make a complete disposition of all his property. Intestacy was not in any event contemplated. We do not overlook the rule that a power of testamentary appointment, added to a gift expressly for life, does not enlarge the estate given to an entire interest; but the question here is, not whether the estate shall be enlarged, but whether a fee shall be diminished. Nor is the last clause of the will, standing alone, a mere gift of a life interest with a power of testamentary disposition added. The testator gives for life <em>and in fee </em>to will. We cannot, by transposition, make these words contradictory of what the testator had before directed, and especially when there is no limitation over. Taking the will as a whole, there is a close resemblance between this case and Doe <em>v. </em>Thomas and Lewis, 3 Ad. &amp; El. 123. There lands were devised to a wife, her heirs and assigns, for ever, with the intention that she may enjoy the same for life, and by her will dispose of the same as she thinks proper. It was held that she took a fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Upon the whole, therefore, we think that Mrs. Miitter takes under the will of her husband his whole estate subject only to the payment of the legacies to John Armistead Carter, Mrs. Mary L. Eliason, Thomas Miitter Cleeman, and Thomas Miitter Hoff, at her death. We cannot regard the language of the testator respecting those legacies as a mere expression of desire or recommendation addressed to his wife. They are positive directions that the several sums shall be paid at her death. Dr. Miitter had previously given them as legacies, to take effect as such in the event that he should survive his wife, and the manifest intention of the last clause of the will was to preserve them as legacies, even if his wife should outlive him, only postponing the time of enjoyment.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We need only add, it is quite clear they are vested legacies in the legatees living at the death of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court is reversed, and it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the sum of $10,000 be awarded to John Armistead Carter, the sum of $10,000 to Mrs. Mary L. Eliason, the sum of $5000 to Thomas Miitter Cleeman, and the sum of $5000 to Thomas Miitter Hoff, each of said sums to be paid at the death of Mrs. Mary W. A. Miitter, without interest, and that the remainder of the sum for distribution be retained by the said Mrs. Mary W. A. Miitter in her own right, absolutely, and as entire proprietor, and the interest of the four first-mentioned legacies is adjudged to the said Mary W. A. Miitter during her natural life.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
