Jeremiah and Catharine died in the lifetime of their father and mother, unmarried and without issue. Maria, one of the children, was married on the 2d of March, A. D. 1847, to Septimus Thomas, the above-stated plaintiff, and died on the 23d day of June, A. D. 1853, leaving issue a daughter, Maria, who died on the 2d day of August, A.

If the court shall be of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover any part of the premises, then judgment to be entered for him, for whatever he may be entitled to recover, with costs. If the opinion of the court shall be that the plaintiff is not entitled to any interest in the premises, then judgment to be entered for the defendant with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-6\">The one-half of the land in controversy was claimed by the plaintiff, as heir to his daughter Maria, while the defendant claimed the whole of it, thus: one-fourth by the original limitation in the deed from Benjamin Pott; one-fourth as heir to his brother Jeremiah and his sister Catharine; and one-half as the heir of his sister Maria, the deceased wife of Septimus Thomas, who, he averred, owned one-fourth by the above-mentioned limitation, and one-fourth as heir to her brother Jeremiah and her sister Catharine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-7\">On argument, the court below (Hegins, J.), on September 22d 1856, directed the entry of judgment in favour of the plaintiff for the undivided half of all the property described in the writ, with six cents damages and six cents costs, under which judgment possession was delivered by the sheriff, and the costs paid by defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-8\">After the judgment of the court below, the defendant died, and his widow (who was married to John T.

Moyer and Kate his wife, late Kate Minnich, who was the widow of the late William Minnich, deceased, and Mary Ellen Minnich, William F. Minnich, and John Minnich, minor children and heirs-at-law of William Minnich, deceased, who sue by John T. Moyer, their next friend, as plaintiffs in error, and Septimus Thomas defendant in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-9\">The error assigned here was the entering of judgment for the plaintiff and not for the defendant, upon the facts contained in the case stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-10\"><em>F.

Hughes, </em>for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtSr\">\u2014 If the deed from Pott to Minnich vested a trust estate for life in Mary Minnich, and a vested remainder to their several children; and Maria, the wife of Septimus Thomas, was, prior to her decease, vested with the undivided moiety, viz., one-fourth as original purchaser, and one-fourth as heir to her brother and -sister, subject to the life estate of her mother, the question is, did Septimus Thomas take either a life estate, or an estate of inheritance from his daughter Maria ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-11\">If she had taken the undivided half by purchase, her father would have taken either one or the other. We think it would have been an estate of inheritance, and that as she took by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>descent and not by purchase, he took nothing, but that her estate goes to the blood of the first purchaser. The court below erred in supposing that the father in all cases takes only a life estate in the real estate of a deceased child. This only occurs where the child leaves brothers and sisters. When this is not the case, the father takes an estate of inheritance where the child was a purchaser: Act of April 8th 1883, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, 5, 9; Maffit <em>v. </em>Clark, 6 W. &amp; S. 258; Lewis <em>v. </em>Gorman, 5 Barr 164; Act of 1794, \u00a7 5; Baker <em>v. </em>Chalfant, 5 Wh. 477.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-6\">The maxim .is, that he who claims an estate which descended to an intestate, must show himself heir of him from whom it descended as perquisitor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b428-7\">This ease is peculiar in this, that Thomas cannot claim as tenant by the courtesy, because he had neither possession nor the right of possession during her life, her interest being a remainder over after the death of her mother, who survived her: 4 Kent Com., p. 28.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b428-8\"><em>Benjamin </em>Bartholomew, with whom was <em>J.

Upon her death, her interest (being one-half) vested in her daughter Maria, on whose subsequent death it vested in the father, Septimus Thomas, for life, as heir of his child, in which capacity he claims here, and not as tenant by the-courtesy. This is his right under the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 22d, and 26th sections of the Intestate Law of this Commonwealth. The case of Maffit <em>v. </em>Clark, 6 W. &amp; S. 258, decides what is here contended for. See also Chew\u2019s Appeal, Leg. Int., January 11th 1861.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A_1c\">March 14th 1861,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b428-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"Aul\">by Thompson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ah4\">\u2014 The defendant in error was plaintiff below, and claimed to recover a life estate in the premises under the intestate laws. Benjamin Pott and wife, in 1829, granted the estate out of which this controversy has arisen, to Jacob Minnich, in trust for his wife for life, with remainder to their children in fee. -Minnich and wife afterwards, in 1832, conveyed the premises to Joshua Comley, Esq., in trust to convey the same to Mrs. Minnich for life, the remainder as in the first deed. Minnich and wife had four children; two died unmarried and without issue; a third became the wife of Thomas; she died leaving issue, an only daughter, who also died shortly after her mother, unmarried.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>The contest here is between the father of this child and the heir of his uncle William Minnich, who was the surviving brother of her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Not being entitled under the circumstances of the case, as tenant by the courtesy to the life estate in the first taker, Mrs. Minnich not having expired during the life of his wife, he now claims a life estate through his deceased child under the 3d section of the Intestate Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">It is conceded that he is not entitled to an estate of inheritance as heir to his daughter, on account of the exclusion in the 9th section of the Act of 1833, of all \u201c who are not of the blood of the ancestors or other relation from whom any real estate descended, or by whom it was given or devised to the intestate.\u201d He was not of the blood of the wife, the mother of the child, and did not fall within the 5th section of the act, which provides, that in default of issue, and brothers and sisters of the whole blood and their descendants, the whole estate vests in the father and mother, if both be living, or in the survivor in case of the death of either.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">It was contended, that when an intestate leaves brothers and sisters, then the parents take a life estate in the realty; but when, as in the present case, the child left neither brother nor sister or descendants of such, the father could have taken an estate of inheritance had the child acquired by purchase and not by descent, and this not being the case, he is not entitled to any estate whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">This we think is not the true exposition to be given to the law. The 3d section of the Act of 1833 provides, that \u201cin default of issue and subject also, as aforesaid, to the estate and interest hereinbefore given to the widow or surviving husband, if any, the real estate shall go to <em>the father and mother </em>of such intestate <em>during their joint lives and the life of the survivors of them.\u201d </em>If one parent be alive at the death of the intestate, the estate goes to that one for life, in the same manner as if both were alive. The personal estate vests absolutely in the parents or survivor.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">There is no exclusion in this section on account of blood, when the succession is to a life estate as there was in the Act of 1794, \u00a7\u00a7 5-7, 3 S. L. 146. Without attending closely to the wording of the two acts, those of 1794 and 1833,1 think Mr. Justice Bell was led into an error in Lewis <em>v. </em>Gorman, 5 Barr 164, in saying, that the \u201cmeaning of both acts was the same.\u201d It seems to be clear that the scope was greater in the former than in the latter in the particular suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">I understand the law now to be, that there is no exclusion where the interest is a life estate: Section 3, Act of 1833. That the parents take for life, before brothers and sisters, nephews <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>and nieces, and their descendants, without regard to the question of blood. So does the survivor of them. This was what was held in this court in Maffit <em>v. </em>Clark, 6 W. &amp; S. 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In the 5th section of the act, there is a provision for an estate of inheritance in the real estate of a deceased child in the parents or survivor of them. The qualification or limitation of that is to be found in the 9th section of the act already quoted. It excludes only in cases where, by the act, the <em>inheritance </em>is to pass; those in that case who are not of the blood of the ancestor or other relative from whom the real estate descended are not to succeed, <em>\u201c </em>but such real estate, subject to such life estate as may be in existence by this act, shall pass and vest in such other persons as would be entitled by this act, if the persons not of the blood of such ancestor or other relative had never existed or were dead at the decease of the intestate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The exclusion is from inheritance only, saving the life estates in existence. That gives to Septimus Thomas a life estate in the fee descended to his daughter from her mother. And there was no error in the court below so ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
