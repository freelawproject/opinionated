Wright and his two daughters Frances Elizabeth Koons and Josephine Amanda Wright, and the survivors and survivor of them living at the time of his decease, and in case any of them should have died before the time of his decease, leaving issue, such issue to take its parent\u2019s share.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-7\">The executors filed their account, in which the above-mentioned $10,000 does not appear. The account was referred to Wm. Henry Rawle, Esq., as auditor, before whom Mr. <em>Gilpin, </em>for the Commonwealth, claimed the sum of $500, for collateral inheritance tax on the said sum. The auditor decided that only that portion of this fund which was to come into the possession of the executors, after the death of all the annuitants provided for in said deed, was subject to said tax. To this decision the following exceptions were filed on behalf of the Commonwealth:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-8\">1. That the auditor erred in not allowing the collateral inheritance tax on the whole J:und transferred to and held by the Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-9\">2. That the auditor erred in refusing to allow the collateral inheritance tax on the whole fund, to wit, $10,000, and to order the payment of the same out of the fund in the hands of the executors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-10\">And on behalf of the surviving executors as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-11\">1. The auditor erred in deciding that any portion of the fund held by the Pennsylvania Company for Insurance on Lives, &amp;c., under deed-poll, dated June 24th 1853, was subject to the payment of the collateral inheritance tax.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-12\">On hearing, the Orphans\u2019 Court made the following decree: <em>\u201c </em>And now, July 10th 1860, this case having been argued and considered on the exceptions of the Commonwealth to the report of the auditor, it is ordered, that the report of the auditor be so far corrected and modified as to allow the sum of $500 for collateral inheritance tax to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, being five per cent, on $10,000.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b509-13\">The case was then removed into this court by the executors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>by whom the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court was assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-6\"><em>Wm. F. Judson, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atp\">\u2014 The instrument by which this trust was created is not in law a testamentary paper: Wall <em>v. </em>Wall, 30 Mass. 96; Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Jones, 3 Price\u2019s Exch.

Nor is it made so by the power of revocation which it contains. It is no less a deed for this reason. The legal title was vested in the Pennsylvania Company, and the equitable title in the persons named therein, both of which were liable to be divested by an act which however never was performed. If a deed and not a testamentary paper, it is not within the Collateral Inheritance Act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-7\">The enactments on this subject show that this tax is only to be paid upon property which comes into the hands of executors for distribution. It is collected by charging them ; their sureties can only be discharged by paying it. It is payable before the legacies or distributive shares are paid. It remains a lien on the estate of the person who <em>died seised. </em>The receipt is given to the executor or administrator. When not paid, they may be cited by the register, &amp;c. Nor is the trustee liable for it. He had no legal authority to retain it. If the decree of the court below be not reversed, the loss must fall on the children of deceased.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b510-8\"><em>Qhas. Gilpin, </em>for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agx\">\u2014 1. The main question in this case is, whether the fund deposited by the testator with the company, in trust, is in whole or in part chargeable with collateral inheritance tax; and</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-9\">2. If it be, whether the claim can be sustained in the forum selected, viz.: \u2014 before an auditor appointed to audit the accounts of the executors, and to report distribution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-10\">The first question involves the considerations,</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-11\">1. Whether the declaration of trust is a \u201cwill,\u201d or testamentary paper, or</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-12\">2. A \u201c deed, grant, bargain, or sale, made or intended to take effect, in possession or enjoyment, after the death of the grantor or bargainor.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-13\">I. The instrument appears to be testamentary in its character, from the following features, viz.:</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b510-14\">1. The reservation of absolute control over it during the life of the testator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>2. The clause applying portions of the fund <em>\u201c </em>to the purposes expressed (by him) in any last will and testament.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-6\">3. The concluding clause providing, in the event of revocation and no new appointment, that the fund should become the property of himself, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-7\">II. This instrument or declaration of trust is <em>\u201c </em>a deed or grant made, or intended to take effect, in .possession or enjoyment, after the death of the grantor or bargainor,\u201d and within the letter as well as the spirit of the Act of 7th April 1826.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-8\">If it be not, it would seem difficult, indeed impossible, to devise a deed or grant which the terms of the act would cover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-9\">Neither the possession nor the enjoyment of the testator are disturbed during his life. His power of revocation, notwithstanding the trust, reserves to him the absolute control of the corpus; the income is- expressly reserved to him for life; and no title or beneficial interest, under it, could vest in or be claimed by any one but the testator during his life.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-10\">At his death, other vested interests accrued, and the instrument is in terms and in effect <em>made and intended to take effect in possession and </em>enjoyment, <em>after the death of the grantor or </em>bargainor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-11\">III. If the fund covered by the trust is in whole or in part chargeable with the tax, it would seem that the law provides a remedy, and that the forum selected is the proper one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-12\">If the trust fund is chargeable with the tax, it becomes the duty of the executors to demand and collect from the company the tax on every dollar distributed or to be distributed by the company under the deed, and they can no more avoid this dnty than they can any other incident to their office.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-13\">Again, the balance of the principal of the trust fund must come, after the death of the last annuitant, to the executors: there is no other mode of administering the estate of the testator. This balance must exceed $6600.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b511-14\">Under these circumstances, it is submitted that the whole tax is chargeable against the estate in the hands of the executors or under their control.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AjU\">March 25th 1861,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b511-15\">The opinion of the court was delivered,</p>\n<author id=\"A3F\">by Lowrje, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZE7\">\u2014 In this case the Commonwealth claimed, and was allowed, a collateral inheritance tax on $10,000, which had been part of the estate of Joseph Wright, deceased; and notwithstanding the very careful argument of the appellant\u2019s counsel, it appears to us very plain that the tax was rightfully allowed. The decedent had assigned $10,000 of stocks to the Pennsylvania Company for Insurance on Lives, in trust, to pay him the income for life, and after that, certain sums and annuities particularly specified, if the persons should outlive him, and the remainder to the purposes of his will, and had reserved a right to revoke all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>or any of tbe said trusts or grants for other persons. He died without any revocation, and of course the trusts took effect in favour of his intended beneficiaries. The subject of the grant falls within the very words of the Act of Assembly, as a part of an estate transferred by a deed, intended to take effect <em>in possession </em>after his death. It took effect neither in right nor in possession, until his death, because none were to take who did not survive him, and because he might revoke the whole. There is no real difficulty about making the executors pay it; for they have means enough, and a large part of this very fund goes to them, and they are entitled at once to so much of it as is necessary to pay the tax. No doubt the trustee has retained from each beneficiary or legatee, the tax on his or her share. It ought to have done it.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Decree affirmed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
