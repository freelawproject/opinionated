The defendants, together with two others, were tried for acting in concert to commit rape in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>degree. The defense was consent. There was a closely contested issue, and we reverse solely on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct. The prosecutor\u2019s acts of discourtesy to the court and to opposing counsel and other improper acts resulted in depriving the defendants of a fair trial. (See <em>People v Cruz, </em>52 AD2d 1.)
