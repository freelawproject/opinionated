Leroy Edward Green, Appellant, v J. Edwin La Vallee, as Superintendent of Clinton Correctional Facility, Respondent.</parties>\n<opinion data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\"><p id=\"ALa\">In a habeas corpus proceeding, petitioner appeals from a judgment of the County Court, Orange County, dated July 25, 1976, which dismissed the proceeding. Judgment affirmed, without costs or disbursements. Petitioner\u2019s application for post-conviction relief was based upon an allegation of bias arising out of a juror\u2019s employment as a corrections officer. The fact of his employment was known to petitioner and his attorney at the time of the <em>voir dire. </em>Therefore petitioner\u2019s failure to raise a timely challenge to the juror waived the objection (see CPL 270.15, subd 4). Hopkins, Acting P. J., Martuscello, Cohalan and Damiani, JJ., concur.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
