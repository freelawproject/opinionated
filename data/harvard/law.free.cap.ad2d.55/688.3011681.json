We find no basis to disturb the discretion and judgment of the sentencing court as to the sentence imposed (e.g., <em>People v Sherlock, </em>51 AD2d 835; see <em>People v Moore, </em>50 AD2d 690, mot for lv to app den 39 NY2d 753). We have examined and find no merit in defendant\u2019s additional contentions. Judgment affirmed. Kane, J. P., Main, Larkin, Herlihy and Reynolds, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
