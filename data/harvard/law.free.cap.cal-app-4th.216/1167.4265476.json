Brown Act (Gov. Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7 54950 et seq.; hereafter the Brown Act) requires, among other things, that the legislative body of a local agency shall post, at least 72 hours before a regular meeting, \u201can agenda <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>containing a brief general description of each item of business to be transacted or discussed at the meeting . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 54954.2, subd. (a)(1).) The same section of the Brown Act adds that \u201c[n]o action or discussion shall be undertaken on any item not appearing on the posted agenda . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 54954.2, subd. (a)(2).) In the present case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Merced County Planning Commission (the Commission) posted an agenda that set forth, as one item of business for its upcoming meeting, the Commission\u2019s potential approval of a subdivision application submitted by William Morris to divide 380.45 acres into nine parcels (the' project). The agenda, however, failed to mention that the Commission would <em>also </em>be considering whether or not to adopt a CEQA<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> document known as a mitigated negative declaration (MND) concerning the environmental impact of the project. At the meeting, the Commission approved the project <em>and </em>adopted the MND. Thereafter, San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center and Protect Our Water (petitioners) filed a petition for writ of mandate against the County of Merced and the Commission (together the County)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> seeking to set aside the approval of the project and the adoption of the MND on the ground that the Commission\u2019s adoption of the MND violated the agenda requirements of the Brown Act. Petitioners also alleged, as a separate cause of action, that the County failed to comply with a CEQA notice provision. Although the trial court eventually dismissed the Brown Act cause of action under the \u201ccure and correct\u201d provisions of that statute (see \u00a7 54960.1, subd. (e)), it found that a violation had occurred and that petitioners were entitled to an award of costs and attorney fees under section 54960.5. The County now appeals from the judgment, arguing that the agenda requirement was satisfied because the public would have implicitly understood that CEQA documents, if any, would likely be considered at the time of the project\u2019s approval. We disagree. As more fully explained herein, we conclude that the Brown Act was violated in this case because the Commission took action on the MND when that matter was not expressly disclosed on the meeting agenda. Accordingly, we affirm that portion of the judgment based on the Brown Act violation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">\n<em>The Public Meetings, Agendas and Actions Taken</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">The agenda issued by the Commission for its October 14, 2009, meeting included the following item of business: \u201cV. . . . MINOR SUBDIVISION APPLICATION No. MS07-030\u2014William Morris\u2014To divide three parcels totaling 380.45 acres into nine parcels, ranging from 40.00 acres to 54.72 acres in size. The project site is located at the southwest comer of American Avenue and Mitchell Road in the Hilmar area. The property is designated Agricultural land use in the General Plan and zoned A-l (General Agricultural). THE ACTION REQUESTED IS TO APPROVE, DISAPPROVE OR MODIFY THE APPLICATION. JH.\u201d No further description of this item of business was provided. No mention was made in the agenda that the Commission would be considering the adoption of an MND in connection with the project. At the October 14, 2009, meeting, the Commission approved the proposed project and, by separate motion, adopted the MND.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">On October 19, 2009, petitioners sent a letter to the County objecting to the Commission\u2019s approval of the MND since \u201cthere was no mention [in the agenda] of consideration of a CEQA document of any kind.\u201d The letter stated that such action violated the Brown Act and asked the Commission to \u201ccure and correct\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the violation by rescinding the approval of the project and the adoption of the MND. The Commission, at its meeting held on October 28, 2009, denied the request to cure or correct the alleged violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">On October 19, 2009, petitioners administratively appealed the Commission\u2019s approval of the project to the Board of Supervisors of Merced County (Board of Supervisors).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">On January 26, 2010, the Board of Supervisors granted petitioners\u2019 administrative appeal. The Board of Supervisors directed the Commission to vacate its approval of the project and to hold a new meeting to readdress whether to approve the project and the MND after first issuing a new agenda in conformity with petitioners\u2019 request that the MND be expressly specified on the agenda. In granting the appeal, the Board of Supervisors did not admit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>that the Commission\u2019s actions violated the Brown Act but indicated that it was good policy for the Commission to provide more information to the public in its agendas, in accordance with petitioners\u2019 request, even though arguably not required by the Brown Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">On February 10, 2010, the Commission complied with the Board of Supervisor\u2019s directive. The agenda for the Commission\u2019s February 10, 2010, meeting expressly listed the MND as an item of business along with the potential approval of the project. The Commission then heard the matter again, readopted the MND and reapproved the project.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">\n<em>The Litigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">Pursuant to statutory deadline, a lawsuit to set aside or nullify the actions of a legislative body based on alleged violations of the Brown Act must be filed within 15 days after notice that a \u201ccure or correct\u201d request was denied by that body. (\u00a7 54960.1, subd. (c)(3).) Here, as noted above, petitioners\u2019 cure or correct request was denied by the Commission on October 28, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">On November 12, 2009, petitioners commenced their lawsuit against the County by filing a petition for writ of mandate seeking to have the approval of the project and adoption of the MND set aside. The petition alleged that a violation of the Brown Act had occurred because the agenda for the Commission\u2019s October 14, 2009, meeting failed to mention that it would be considering the adoption of an MND concerning the project. Thus, the Commission took action at the meeting on a matter that was not included on the agenda, which allegedly was in direct violation of section 54954.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">The petition also included a separate cause of action for an alleged violation of a CEQA notice provision. The CEQA claim alleged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>County \u201cdid not provide sufficient or timely notice to the public of the intent to adopt the [MND] for the [p]roject under Public Resources Code section 21092 and 14 Cal. Code Regs, section 15072.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">On December 24, 2009, the County demurred to the petition. The demurrer alleged that the petition failed to state a cause of action because (1) the Commission\u2019s agenda complied with the requirements of the Brown Act as a matter of law; (2) petitioners and others were given adequate notice under CEQA provisions, therefore no CEQA violation occurred; and (3) petitioners failed to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to the CEQA cause of action. Petitioners opposed the demurrer, arguing the causes of action were sufficiently stated and that the exhaustion of remedies defense should not be applied to the CEQA claim since it was more efficient to file both causes of action together and the Brown Act claim had a short statutory deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">The County filed a reply in support of its demurrer on February 2, 2010. The reply informed the trial court that the Board of Supervisors granted petitioners\u2019 administrative appeal: \u201cThe [B]oard [of Supervisors] recently heard petitioners\u2019 administrative appeal, on January 26, 2010, and ordered the [C]ommission to rehear the [p]roject with direction that the [Commission, purely as a matter of sound policy, conform the format of its agenda descriptions to those of the [B]oard [of Supervisors] and include from now on the type of CEQA document before the [C]ommission.\u201d According to the County\u2019s reply, the trial court was required to dismiss the Brown Act claim since the alleged violations were \u201ccured or corrected\u201d pursuant to the provisions of section 54960.1, subdivision (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">The hearing on the demurrer was held on February 9, 2010, and following oral argument the trial court took the matter under submission. On March 22, 2010, the trial court overruled the demurrers. The trial court\u2019s order did not expressly rule on the alleged failure to exhaust administrative remedies (as to the CEQA claim) and did not address the issue raised in the County\u2019s reply that the Brown Act claim should be dismissed under section 54960.1, subdivision (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-7\">On August 6, 2010, in an ironic reversal of positions, <em>petitioners </em>moved for a judicial determination that the alleged Brown Act violations were \u201ccured and corrected\u201d under section 54960.1, subdivision (e), based on the fact that on February 10, 2010, at the direction of the Board of Supervisors, the Commission had rescinded the approval of the project and the adoption of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>MND, renoticed those matters by a new agenda that expressly stated the MND would be considered, and then proceeded to reapprove the project and readopt the MND. The County <em>opposed </em>the motion, even though it had previously requested such a ruling. The County was apparently concerned that if it conceded the matter was cured or corrected, that might leave room for petitioners to argue in a future attorney fees motion that there was a Brown Act violation, which the County adamantly denied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court denied petitioners\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">On June 28, 2011, the trial court heard oral argument on the merits of the petition for writ of mandate. On October 20, 2011, the trial court ruled on the petition, finding as follows on the Brown Act causes of action: \u201c[Tjhis court finds a Brown Act [violation did occur that was cured and corrected. The agenda item for the [pjroject did include a brief general description of the project, but not of all action items that were to be taken. The fact a MND was under consideration for certification is an action item that should have been included on the agenda. The Board [of Supervisors] rescinded the approval and directed the . . . Commission to include the CEQA decision on the [a]genda, thus curing and correcting the previous Brown Act violation on February 20, 2010. The [Brown Act] cause of action is dismissed with prejudice. Government Code \u00a7 54960.1[, subdivision] (e).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">As to the separate CEQA cause of action, the trial court found: \u201c[A] CEQA [violation did occur because the Notice did not give the correct date of the public hearing. However, said alleged CEQA violation [is] moot because the . . . Commission\u2019s action, rescinding the approval of the project and MND, re-noticing the meeting, re-certifying the CEQA document and re-approving the [p]roject cured and corrected the alleged CEQA violation. Therefore, the [CEQA] Cause of Action is dismissed as moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">Following this ruling but before entry of judgment, a dispute ensued as to which party was the prevailing party for purposes of recovery of statutory costs and attorney fees. The trial court issued what it called an order on judgment in which it found, based on the Brown Act attorney fees and cost provision (\u00a7 54960.5), that petitioners had prevailed in their lawsuit under the Brown Act and were entitled to an award of costs and attorney fees under that section. The trial court noted that the County had consistently denied that the Brown Act had been violated; hence, petitioners\u2019 lawsuit was necessary to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>resolve the issue and to prevent a recurrence. Judgment was entered in petitioners\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-4\">The County appealed from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">Ordinarily, \u201c[o]n appeal following a trial court\u2019s decision on a petition for a writ of mandate, the reviewing court \u2018 \u201cneed only review the record to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] However, we review questions of law independently. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Alliance for a Better Downtown Millbrae v. Wade </em>(2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 123, 129 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 249].) Where, as here, an appeal involves the application of a statute to undisputed facts, our review is de novo. <em>(Southern California Edison Co. v. State Board of Equalization </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 652, 659, fn. 8 [102 Cal.Rptr. 766, 498 P.2d 1014]; <em>Alliance for a Better Downtown Millbrae </em>v. <em>Wade, supra, </em>at p. 129.) Additionally, statutory construction is a question of law requiring our independent review. <em>(Botello v. Shell Oil Co. </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1130, 1134 [280 Cal.Rptr. 535].)</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">II. <em>The Trial Court Correctly Found a Brown Act Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"AFb\">A. <em>Overview of the Brown Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">The Brown Act, one of California\u2019s open meeting laws, provides, among other things, that \u201c[a]ll meetings of the legislative body of a local agency shall be open and public, and all persons shall be permitted to attend any meeting of the legislative body of a local agency, except as otherwise provided in this chapter.\u201d (\u00a7 54953, subd. (a).) The Brown Act begins with a forceful declaration of the Legislature\u2019s purpose: \u201cIn enacting this chapter, the Legislature finds and declares that the public commissions, boards and councils and the other public agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct of the people\u2019s business. It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly. [][] The people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.\u201d (\u00a7 54950.)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>To accomplish these vital goals, the Brown Act, inter alia, (1) requires that an agenda be posted at least 72 hours before a regular meeting and (2) forbids action on any item not on that agenda. (\u00a7 54954.2, subd. (a)(1) &amp; (2); <em>Epstein </em>v. <em>Hollywood Entertainment Dist. II Bus. Improvement Dist. </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 862, 868 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 857] <em>(Epstein).) </em>In this way, \u201c \u2018[t]he [Brown] Act. . . serves to facilitate public participation in all phases of local government decisionmaking and to curb misuse of the democratic process by secret legislation of public bodies. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Los Angeles Times Communications v. Los Angeles County Bd. of Supervisors </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1313, 1321-1322 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 776].)</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">The section of the Brown Act requiring an agenda for regular meetings states more fully as follows: \u201cAt least 72 hours before a regular meeting, the legislative body of the local agency,[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] or its designee, shall post an agenda containing a brief general description of each item of business to be transacted or discussed at the meeting, including items to be discussed in closed session. A brief general description of an item generally need not exceed 20 words. The agenda shall specify the time and location of the regular meeting and shall be posted in a location that is freely accessible to members of the public and on the local agency\u2019s Internet Web site, if the local agency has one. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 54954.2, subd. (a)(1).)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This agenda requirement acts as a limitation on what the public body is authorized to do at the meeting, because the statute further states that \u201c[n]o action or discussion shall be undertaken on any item not appearing on the posted agenda . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 54954.2, subd. (a)(2).)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">B. <em>The Agenda Requirement of the Brown Act Was Violated</em></p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Applying the agenda requirement of the Brown Act to the undisputed facts of this case, we have no difficulty concluding that the Commission violated that requirement. The Brown Act clearly and unambiguously states that an agenda shall describe <em>\u201ceach item of business </em>to be transacted or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>discussed\u201d at the meeting. (\u00a7 54954.2, subd. (a)(1), italics added.) Here, the Commission failed to disclose in its agenda that it would be considering the adoption of the MND at its October 14, 2009, meeting. The adoption of the MND was plainly a distinct item of business, and not a mere component of project approval, since it (1) involved a separate action or determination by the Commission<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and (2) concerned discrete, significant issues of CEQA compliance and the project\u2019s environmental impact.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As an individual item of business, it had to be expressly disclosed on the agenda; it was not sufficient for the agenda to merely reference the project in general.  Because the Commission discussed and adopted the MND at its October 14, 2009, meeting even though that matter was not set forth on the meeting agenda, it violated the Brown Act. (\u00a7 54954.2, subd. (a)(1) &amp; (2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">We are further persuaded of the correctness of this conclusion by the fact that a public agency\u2019s decision whether to adopt or certify a CEQA document (such as a negative declaration, MND or an EIR) is always a matter of at least <em>potential </em>public interest since it would concern the local environmental effects of a proposed project.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Such issues often motivate members of the public to participate in the process and have their voices heard. Of course, that is exactly what the Brown Act seeks to facilitate. Its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1178\">*1178</page-number>purposes include ensuring that the public is adequately notified of what will be addressed at a meeting in order to facilitate public participation and avoid secret legislation or decisionmaking. (\u00a7 54950; <em>Los Angeles Times Communications v. Los Angeles County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1321-1322.) Those purposes would be impaired if a public agency could refuse to disclose in its meeting agenda that it will be considering approval of a CEQA document. Such an approach would allow a potentially controversial issue to be quietly proposed and decided without having to open the discussion to meaningful public input.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That is one of the evils the Brown Act was designed to prevent. (\u00a7 54950; see <em>Epstein, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 869 [the Brown Act is construed liberally to accomplish its remedial purposes].)</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">As should be apparent, we also reject the County\u2019s argument that the agenda\u2019s reference to <em>another </em>item of business\u2014the Commission\u2019s potential approval of the project\u2014somehow provided enough information to the public. Even assuming for the sake of argument that a person could have speculated from what appeared on the agenda (i.e., the project\u2019s approval) that the adoption of the MND <em>might possibly </em>be considered at the meeting, that would not make the agenda legally adequate. The Brown Act mandates that <em>each </em>item of business be <em>described </em>on the agenda, not left to speculation or surmise.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> And, as we have concluded herein, the Commission\u2019s adoption of the MND was a distinct item of business that had to appear on the agenda before it could be discussed and decided. Nor is the County helped by the fact that the statute only requires \u201ca brief general description\u201d of each item of business (\u00a7 54954.2, subd. (a)(1)), since the agenda in question did not mention the MND in even the most general terms. Moreover, contrary to the County\u2019s position that the agenda adequately alerted the public, it seems more likely to us that the net effect of the approach taken by the Commission would be to mislead <em>(not </em>inform) the public about what items of business would be addressed at the meeting, due to the material omission of the MND from the agenda. (See, e.g., <em>Moreno v. City of King </em>(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 17, 26 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 29] [an agenda stating \u201c \u2018Public Employee (employment contract)\u2019 \u201d was inadequate to describe the fact that a particular employee\u2019s <em>dismissal </em>would be discussed]; <em>Carlson v. Paradise Unified Sch. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number><em>Dist. </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 196, 200 [95 Cal.Rptr. 650] [under Ed. Code provisions, an agenda describing the subject matter of a meeting was inadequate and misleading where a vital part of the proposed actions\u2014the school\u2019s \u201cclosure\u201d\u2014was left out].)</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">Finally, we reject the County\u2019s policy argument that the inclusion of CEQA documents in meeting agendas will make the agendas so lengthy and cumbersome that they will no longer be useful. We do not believe that a brief, general statement to the effect that the public agency will be considering the adoption or certification of a CEQA document would have that result. Here, for example, the Commission could easily have complied with the agenda requirement by simply adding a few words, such as \u201cand consider adoption of a mitigated negative declaration,\u201d regarding the project. In any event, even assuming the County is correct that agendas disclosing CEQA documents as items of business are more cumbersome, we would still be required to apply the Brown Act in accordance with its clear terms, as we have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">We hold that the trial court correctly decided the Brown Act was violated in this case based on the Commission\u2019s failure to comply with the agenda requirements set forth in section 54954.2, subdivision (a)(1) and (2). As part of its judgment, the trial court also determined that petitioners were prevailing parties and were entitled to recover costs of suit under the Brown Act in an amount to be determined. As to the trial court\u2019s discretion to award statutory costs and attorney fees, former section 54960.5 stated that a \u201ccourt may award court costs and reasonable attorney fees to the plaintiff[s] in an action brought pursuant to Section 54960 or 54960.1 where it is found that a legislative body of the local agency has violated [the Brown Act].\u201d In light of our holding that the Brown Act was violated, we reject the County\u2019s argument that it was the true prevailing party under section 54960.5. Rather, the trial court correctly held that petitioners prevailed and were entitled to bring a motion for such fees and costs. However, inasmuch as the trial court\u2019s subsequent order awarding attorney fees and costs under section 54960.5 is not before us in the present appeal, but is the subject of a separate appeal, we do not venture beyond what we have stated here concerning that matter.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">III.-V.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1000-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">The portion of the judgment in case No. F064930 addressing the CEQA cause of action is modified to vacate the finding on the merits of that claim. The judgments are affirmed in all other respects. Costs on appeal are awarded to petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">Levy, Acting P.

County of Merced </em>(May 31, 2013, No. F064931) (nonpub. opn.), but we have not consolidated it herewith and that case will be addressed in a separate opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b990-5\"> An abbreviation of the California Environmental Quality Act, found at Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b990-6\"> We frequently refer to the Commission separately in our discussion, even though the Commission is an agency of the County and not a separate entity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b990-7\"> We will correct the portion of the judgment that was based on the alleged CEQA violation, since a failure to exhaust administrative remedies (raised by the County on demurrer) precluded the trial court\u2019s consideration of the merits of that cause of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b991-9\"> Before a lawsuit may be filed to set aside actions taken in violation of certain provisions of the Brown Act, the interested person must send a demand to the legislative body that it \u201ccure or correct\u201d the actions. (\u00a7 54960.1, subd. (b).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b992-9\"> The minutes of the January 26, 2010, meeting of the Board of Supervisors, at which the administrative appeal was granted, included the statement of County Counsel James Fincher that although no violation of the Brown Act occurred, it would be good policy to go beyond what is required and do the utmost to keep the public informed. It was also noted that when the Board of Supervisors considered such issues at its meetings, CEQA documents were always expressly specified in the Board of Supervisor\u2019s agendas, thus it made sense to have the Commission follow the same practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b992-10\"> The Commission\u2019s action at the February 10, 2010, meeting included rescinding both the prior approval of the project and the adoption of the MND, then reapproving and readopting same. The minutes reflect that these actions were taken based on the \u201cpolicy direction\u201d given to the Commission by the Board of Supervisors on January 26, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b994-7\"><em> </em>Under the relevant provision of the Brown Act, the mere fact that a legislative body takes a subsequent action to cure or correct an action previously taken \u201cshall not be construed or admissible as evidence of a violation of this chapter.\u201d (\u00a7 54960.1, subd. (f).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b996-7\"> A \u201c \u2018local agency\u2019 \u201d includes a city or county \u201cor any board, commission or agency thereof . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 54951.) A \u201c \u2018legislative body\u2019 \u201d includes \u201c[t]he governing body of a local agency\u201d and \u201c[a] commission, committee, board, or other body of a local agency, whether permanent or temporary, decisionmaking or advisory, created by charter, ordinance, resolution, or formal action of a legislative body.\u201d (\u00a7 54952, subds. (a) &amp; (b).) There is no question that the Commission comes within these broad definitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b996-8\"> The provision regarding use of the local agency\u2019s Internet Web site is new. (Stats. 2011, ch. 692, \u00a7 8.) That newly added language is not relevant to any issue in the present appeal but is set forth here to show the most current version of the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b996-9\"> A few limited exceptions to this rule are set forth in section 54954.2, subdivisions (a)(2) and (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b997-6\"> The adoption of an MND must be based upon a <em>determination </em>by a public agency as to the environmental impact of a project. (See Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21080, subds. (c) &amp; (d), 21080.1, subd. (a).) In essence, the adoption of an MND means the public agency has determined that the project, as revised or mitigated, would have no significant effect on the environment and thus an environmental impact report (EIR) is unnecessary. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21080, subds. (c) &amp; (d).) The minutes of the Commission\u2019s meeting of October 14, 2009, reflect that the MND was approved, with the required CEQA findings, by a separate motion and vote of the Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b997-7\"> A \u201c \u2018[n]egative declaration\u2019 \u201d means \u201ca written statement briefly describing the reasons that a proposed project will not have a significant effect on the environment and does not require the preparation of an environmental impact report.\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21064.) A \u201c \u2018[m]itigated negative declaration\u2019 \u201d means \u201ca negative declaration prepared for a project when the initial study has identified potentially significant effects on the environment, but (1) revisions in the project plans or proposals made by, or agreed to by, the applicant before the proposed negative declaration and initial study are released for public review would avoid the effects or mitigate the effects to a point where clearly no significant effect on the environment would occur, and (2) there is no substantial evidence in light of the whole record before the public agency that the project, as revised, may have a significant effect on the environment.\u201d (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21064.5.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b997-8\"> CEQA has its own notice statute that comes into play when a public agency proposes to adopt a negative declaration or certify an EIR. (Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7 21092, subd. (a).) However, contrary to the County\u2019s unsupported argument, nothing in the CEQA notice provision would relieve the County of having to comply with the Brown Act concerning <em>meeting agendas. </em>Additionally, although a notice of intent (NOI) to adopt a mitigated negative declaration was issued by the County in July 2009, it contained an erroneous hearing date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b998-5\"> Additionally, CEQA contains short, mandatory statute of limitations and rigorous exhaustion requirements (see, e.g., Pub. Resources Code, \u00a7\u00a7 21167 &amp; 21177), which make the County\u2019s approach even more detrimental in this particular context.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b998-6\"> Furthermore, it does not appear to us that the consideration of a project necessarily means, in every case, that a CEQA document will be considered at that same meeting. For example, nothing in CEQA prevents an agency from holding a separate hearing on the CEQA document and then approving the underlying project at a later meeting. Additionally, if a project was found to be exempt, there may not be a CEQA document at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b999-7\"> That separate appeal by the County is <em>San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center </em>v. <em>County of Merced </em>(Apr. 26, 2013, No. F066060, app. dism.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-8\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1167.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
