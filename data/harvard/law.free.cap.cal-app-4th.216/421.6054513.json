J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqi\">The issue in this case is whether members of certain state bargaining units are entitled to two paid holidays\u2014Lincoln\u2019s Birthday and Columbus Day\u2014which were removed from the list of paid holidays by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Government Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 19853, operative February 20, 2009, in response to a fiscal emergency. Section 19853 further provides that a conflicting memorandum of understanding (MOU) executed on or after February 20, 2009, would be controlling. (\u00a7 19853, subd. (g).) The employee organizations that represent members of the affected bargaining units argue that the bargaining units\u2019 expired MOU\u2019s, which remained in effect by operation of law under the Ralph C. Dills Act (\u00a7\u00a7 3512-3524; hereafter Dills Act), supersede section 19853 by virtue of section 3517.6. (\u00a7 3517.8, subd. (a).) We disagree. Section 19853 supersedes the expired MOU\u2019s because it is a later enactment, and the MOU\u2019s were not executed on or after February 20, 2009. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgments entered in favor of the employee organizations and remand the cases to the trial court with directions.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">A. <em>The MOU\u2019s</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Plaintiff California Association of Psychiatric Technicians (CAPT) is the exclusive representative for State Bargaining Unit 18. For the period June 30, 2006 through July 1, 2008, CAPT had an MOU with the state concerning the terms and conditions of employment of its bargaining unit members. That MOU identified Lincoln\u2019s Birthday (Feb. 12) and Columbus Day (the second Monday in Oct.) as paid holidays.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Plaintiff California Association of Professional Scientists (CAPS) is the exclusive representative of State Bargaining Unit 10. For the period July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2008, CAPS had an MOU with the state concerning the terms and conditions of employment of its bargaining unit members. That MOU identified Lincoln\u2019s Birthday and Columbus Day as paid holidays.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Intervener Service Employees International Union, Local 1000 (SEIU), is the exclusive representative for approximately 95,000 state workers in nine state bargaining units\u20141, 3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, and 21. For the period July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2008, each SEIU bargaining unit had an MOU with the state concerning the terms and conditions of employment of its bargaining unit members. Each of those MOU\u2019s identified Lincoln\u2019s Birthday and Columbus Day as paid holidays. They also contained supersession clauses that read in pertinent part: \u201cif any other provision of this Contract alters or is in conflict with [certain enumerated Government Code sections, including section 19853], the Contract shall be controlling and supersede [section 19853].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>B. <em>The Dills Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The Dills Act governs the collective bargaining process between certified employee organizations and the state. <em>(Professional Engineers in California Government </em>v. <em>Schwarzenegger </em>(2010) 50 Cal.4th 989, 1016, fn. 16 [116 Cal.Rptr.3d 480, 239 P.3d 1186] <em>(Professional Engineers).) </em>Two of its provisions are at issue here: sections 3517.6 and 3517.8. Section 3517.6 was enacted in 1977 (Stats. 1977, ch. 1159, \u00a74, pp. 3751, 3755) and states in pertinent part: \u201cIn any case where the provisions of [over 100 code sections, including section 19853] are in conflict with the provisions of a memorandum of understanding, the memorandum of understanding shall be controlling without further legislative action.\u201d (\u00a7 3517.6, subd. (a)(1).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Section 3517.8 was enacted in 2000 (Stats. 2000, ch. 879, \u00a7 2, p. 6515) and provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf a memorandum of understanding has expired, and the Governor and the recognized employee organization have not agreed to a new memorandum of understanding and have not reached an impasse in negotiations, ... the parties to the agreement shall continue to give effect to the provisions of the expired memorandum of understanding, including, but not limited to, all provisions that supersede existing law . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 3517.8, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">C. <em>The Fiscal Crisis and the Legislature\u2019s Response</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">When the Budget Act of 2008 (2008 Budget Act) was enacted in September 2008, the state and national economies were in dire straits. <em>(Professional </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>Engineers, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th at p. 1001.) Shortly thereafter, the economy further deteriorated, and in November 2008, the Department of Finance reported that the state faced a revenue shortfall of $11.2 billion for the 2008- 2009 fiscal year and a much higher budget deficit by the end of the 2009- 2010 fiscal year. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Department of Finance also cautioned that \u201c \u2018[i]f no action is taken to reduce spending, increase revenues, or a combination of both, the state will run out of cash in February and be unable to meet all of its obligations for the rest of the year.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u201cOn February 19, 2009, after extended discussion and negotiation, the Legislature passed, and on February 20, 2009, the Governor signed, Senate Bill No. 2 (2009-2010 3d Ex. Sess.) (Senate Bill 3X 2), which revised the 2008 Budget Act in response to the fiscal emergency. (Stats. 2009, 3d Ex. Sess. 2009-2010, ch. 2 (sometimes hereinafter revised 2008 Budget Act).) Section 36 of Senate Bill 3X 2 added section 3.90 to the original 2008 Budget Act (Stats. 2008, ch. 268). Section 3.90, subdivision (a) provides in part: \u2018Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, each item of appropriation in this act . . . shall be reduced, as appropriate, to reflect a reduction in employee compensation ... in the total amounts of $385,762,000 from General Fund items and $285,196,000 from items relating to other funds.\u2019 . . . [T]he amount of the reduction in appropriations for employee compensation set forth in section 3.90 reflected ... the reductions that the Governor proposed to achieve through [a] two-day-a-month furlough of state employees [and the elimination of two state holidays and a revision of the method of calculating overtime]. Section 3.90, subdivision (a) also indicated the Legislature\u2019s intent to make similar reductions in employee compensation for the 2009-2010 fiscal year.\u201d <em>(Professional Engineers, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th at pp. 1005-1006 &amp; fin. 7, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Governor estimated that the elimination of two paid holidays and premium pay for holidays worked \u201cwould result in a savings of approximately $39.4 million General.Fund in 2008-09 and $74.5 million General Fund in 2009-10.\u201d (Dept. of Finance, Rep., Governor\u2019s Budget, Special Session 2008-09, p. 25 &lt;http://www.dof.ca.gov/budget/historical/ 2009-10/documents/special_session_08-09_web.pdf&gt; [as of May 16, 2013].)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>On February 19, 2009, the Legislature also passed, and on February 20, 2009, the Governor also signed, Senate Bill No. 3X 8 (2009-2010 3d Ex. Sess.; hereafter Senate Bill 3X 8), which, among other things repealed then reenacted section 19853. (Stats. 2009, 3d Ex. Sess. 2009-2010, ch. 4, \u00a7\u00a7 6, Stats. 2009, 3d Ex. Sess. 2009-2010, ch. 4, \u00a7 7.) Prior to the passage of Senate Bill 3X 8, Lincoln\u2019s Birthday and Columbus Day were on the list of paid holidays set forth in subdivision (a) of section 19853. (Former \u00a7 19853, subd. (a).) Subdivision (b) of former section 19853 further provided that \u201c[i]f the provisions of subdivision (a) are in conflict with the provisions of a memorandum of understanding . . . , the memorandum of understanding shall be controlling without further legislative action . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Former section 19853 became inoperative on February 20, 2009, and was repealed as of January 1, 2010. (Stats. 2009, 3d Ex. Sess. 2009-2010, ch. 4, \u00a7 6.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Section 19853 was reenacted on February 20, 2009. (Stats. 2009, 3d Ex. Sess. 2009-2010, ch. 4, \u00a7 7.) As relevant here, Lincoln\u2019s Birthday and Columbus Day were eliminated from the list of paid holidays set forth in section 19853, subdivision (a). In addition, the supersession language contained in former section 19853, subdivision (b) was deleted, and subdivision (g) was added, which states: \u201cIf subdivision (a) . . . is in conflict with the provisions of a memorandum of understanding <em>executed or amended ... on or after [February 20, 2009], </em>the memorandum of understanding shall be controlling without further legislative action . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (Italics added.) A Senate bill analysis for Senate Bill 3X 8 states that the two holidays and premium pay were being eliminated \u201cin order to achieve budgetary savings.\u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, Unfinished Business Analysis of Sen. Bill 3X 8, as amended Feb. 14, 2009, p. 14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>At the time section 19853 took effect, all of the MOU\u2019s at issue here had expired, and the parties had not entered into successor MOU\u2019s or reached an impasse in their negotiations. Indeed, at least 14 of the state\u2019s 21 bargaining units were operating under expired MOU\u2019s at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">D. <em>The Underlying Actions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">On October 19 and 20, 2009, CAPT and CAPS, respectively, filed verified petitions for writs of mandate and complaints for declaratory relief against then Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the former Department of Personnel Administration, now the Department of Human Resources (CalHR) (sometimes collectively referred to herein as \u201cthe state\u201d)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in the trial court. The causes of action for declaratory relief sought a determination that under section 3517.8, the state must comply with the expired MOU\u2019s and allow Lincoln\u2019s Birthday and Columbus Day as holidays for CAPT\u2019s and CAPS\u2019s members, while the prayer for mandamus asked for a peremptory writ ordering the state to (1) comply with section 3517.8 and give effect to the expired MOU\u2019s and provide Lincoln\u2019s Birthday and Columbus Day to CAPT and CAPS members and (2) compensate CAPT and CAPS members as provided in the MOU\u2019s if they are required to work \u201con those days.\u201d On November 24, 2009, CalHR filed a complaint against SEIU, seeking, among other things, a declaration that section 19853 supersedes SEIU\u2019s expired MOU\u2019s and section 3517.8. In April 2010, the trial court consolidated the three cases and designated the CAPT action as the lead case.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">In July 2010, SEIU was allowed to intervene in the CAPT action. In addition to the arguments advanced by CAPT and CAPS, SEIU further argued that the state\u2019s refusal to honor the MOU\u2019s holiday provisions violates the MOU\u2019s themselves and section 3517.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">After oral argument, the trial court granted CAPS\u2019s and SEIU\u2019s complaints for declaratory relief, determining that \u201csection 3517.8 requires that [the state] give effect to [the expired MOU\u2019s between the state and CAPS and SEIU] . . . until such time as the parties reach impasse in negotiations for a new [MOU] and the state implements a provision contrary to the parties\u2019 agreement in [the expired MOU\u2019s].\u201d The court also issued peremptory writs of mandate, ordering the state to comply with section 3517.8 and give effect to the expired MOU\u2019s between the state and CAPS and SEIU and provide Lincoln\u2019s Birthday and Columbus Day as holidays to CAPS and SEIU members and \u201ccompensate [those] members as provided in the [MOU\u2019s] if they were or are required to work on those days.\u201d The court denied CAPT\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>request for declaratory relief because CAPT and the state had since entered into a successor MOU, but issued a peremptory writ of mandate, ordering the state to compensate CAPT members as provided in the expired MOU if they were required to work on Lincoln\u2019s Birthday or Columbus Day during the period February 20, 2009, through the effective date of the successor MOU. The court denied CalHR\u2019s request for declaratory relief as to section 19853.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The trial court explained the basis of its ruling in a 12-page order. The court concluded \u201cthat the expired MOU[\u2019]s supersede(d) the provisions of section 19853.\u201d The court observed that \u201cthe words of [section 19853] do not . . . expressly limit supersession only to those MOU[\u2019]s enacted after February 20, 2009. The statute merely provides that it can be superseded by an MOU enacted after that dat\u00e9. It says nothing about whether section 19853 can (or cannot) be superseded by an MOU enacted before that date.\u201d The court rejected the notion that the Legislature\u2019s decision to narrow the supersession language \u201cmean[s] that the Legislature intended to permit supersession <em>only </em>by MOU[\u2019]s executed after February 20, 2009. It simply means what it says[:] that supersession is permitted for <em>at least </em>those MOU[\u2019]s.\u201d The court also found that \u201cimplied repeal of sections 3517.6 and 3517.8 [by section 19853] is not appropriate\u201d because \u201cthe two acts are not clearly repugnant,\u201d reasoning, \u201cBoth statutes permit supersession by MOU[\u2019]s executed after February 20, 2009. Sections 3517.8 and 3517.6 also permit supersession by expired MOU[\u2019]s executed before February 20, 2009, but this causes no irreconcilable conflict with section 19853 because section 19853 says nothing about MOU[\u2019]s executed before February 20, 2009.\u201d The court rejected the assertion that applying section 3517.6 renders section 19853\u2019s supersession language superfluous, explaining that \u201c[i]f in the future the reference to section 19853 is removed from section 3517.6, supersession still would be allowed under section 19853.\u201d To the extent the application of section 3517.6 does render section 19853\u2019s supersession language superfluous, the trial court found \u201cit is reasonable to conclude that the Legislature intended it to be so\u201d given that the two statutes overlapped on the issue of supersession before the amendments to section 19853.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The trial court entered final judgment and issued a writ of mandate in the CAPS action on November 29, 2010. The trial court entered final judgment in the CalHR action on January 7, 2011. The trial court entered final judgment and issued a writ of mandate in the CAPT action on February 10, 2011. The state timely appealed from those judgments, and we consolidated those appeals on March 23, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The state contends \u201c[t]he trial court erred when it found that the [employee organizations\u2019] expired MOU\u2019s, which were executed prior to February 20, 2009, superseded section 19853.\u201d According to the state, \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s interpretation of section 19853 . . . contradicts the plain language of the statute [and] contravenes the legislative history to effectuate an immediate cost savings by eliminating the holidays and premium pay.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">As with all matters of statutory construction, our review is de novo. <em>(California Teachers Assn. v. San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 699 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856].) \u201c \u2018Under well-established rules of statutory construction, we must ascertain the intent of the drafters so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citation.] Because the statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent, we first examine the words themselves, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning and construing them in context.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Mejia v. Reed </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 657, 663 [3 Cal.Rptr.3d 390, 74 P.3d 166] <em>(Mejia).) </em>\u201cWhen the plain meaning of the statutory text is insufficient to resolve the question of its interpretation, the courts may turn to rules or maxims of construction \u2018which serve as aids in the sense that they express familiar insights about conventional language usage.\u2019 [Citation.] Courts also look to the legislative history of the enactment. \u2018Both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Where reasonably possible, a court must harmonize statutes, reconcile seeming inconsistencies in them, and construe them to give force and effect to all of their provisions. <em>(Pacific Palisades Bowl Mobile Estates, LLC v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 783, 805 [149 Cal.Rptr.3d 383, 288 P.3d 717].) If inconsistent statutes cannot otherwise be reconciled, a specific provision will prevail over a conflicting general one. <em>(In re Greg F. </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 393, 407 [146 Cal.Rptr.3d 272, 283 P.3d 1160].) Where conflicting statutes cannot be reconciled, later enactments supersede earlier ones. <em>(Collection Bureau of San Jose </em>v. <em>Rumsey </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 301, 310 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 792, 6 P.3d 713]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Moody </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 987, 993 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 527].)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Here, all parties agree that on February 20, 2009, when section 19853 was reenacted and Lincoln\u2019s Birthday and Columbus Day were eliminated from the list of paid holidays to which state employees are entitled, the terms and conditions of employment of the employee organizations\u2019 members were governed by applicable MOU\u2019s. Although each of those MOU\u2019s had expired, under section 3517.8, the terms of the expired MOU\u2019s remained in effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>because the parties had not negotiated new MOU\u2019s or reached an impasse in their negotiations. (\u00a7 3517.8, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Each of the expired MOU\u2019s identified Lincoln\u2019s Birthday and Columbus Day as paid holidays. Moreover, the MOU\u2019s further provided that if any of the provisions of the MOU conflict with various statutory provisions, including section 19853, the MOU would control and supersede section 19853. Thus, a conflict exists between section 19853, subdivision (a), on the one hand, and the MOU\u2019s on the other. The question here is how to resolve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">As set forth above, subdivision (g) of section 19853 provides that if the list of paid holidays set forth in \u201csubdivision (a) . . . is in conflict with the provisions of a memorandum of understanding executed or amended ... on or after [February 20, 2009], the memorandum of understanding shall be controlling without further legislative action . . . .\u201d The state contends that \u201c[o]n its face, section 19853 limits supersession to MOU\u2019s executed <em>after </em>February 20, 2009.\u201d SEIU responds that \u201c[w]hile the amendment to section 19853 allows supersession by MOU[\u2019]s executed after February 19, 2009, the amendment did not prohibit supersession of MOU[\u2019]s executed before then. . . . [S]upersession of section 19853 is authorized by other legal authority[, namely the Dills Act,] which the Legislature could have amended to avoid supersession but chose to leave intact.\u201d Although SEIU is correct that subdivision (g) of section 19853 does not literally state that only MOU\u2019s executed or amended on or after February 20, 2009, supersede section 19853 in the event of a conflict, that, as we explain below, is a necessary corollary to the Legislature\u2019s decision to narrow section 19853\u2019s supersession language. Indeed, if MOU\u2019s executed prior to February 20, 2009, also superseded section 19853, subdivision (a), it would undermine the Legislature\u2019s purpose in eliminating the two paid holidays and render the Legislature\u2019s changes to the supersession language nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u201cUnder the rules governing statutory construction, when the Legislature enacts an amendment, we presume that this \u2018 \u201cindicates that it thereby intended to change the original act by creating a new right or withdrawing an existing one.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018 \u201cTherefore, any material change in the language of the original act is presumed to indicate a change in legal rights.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Garrett v. Young </em>(2003) 109 Cal.App.4th 1393, 1404-1405 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 134].) As set forth above, under former section 19853, any time the provisions of subdivision (a) conflicted with provisions of an MOU, the MOU controlled. (Former \u00a7 19853, subd. (b).)  In February 2009, the Legislature repealed then reenacted section 19853, which provides that if subdivision (a) is in conflict with the provisions of an MOU <em>\u201cexecuted or amended ... on or after [February 20, 2009],\u201d </em>the MOU controls. (\u00a7 19853, subd. (g), italics added.) If we construe subdivision (g) of section 19853 as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>not precluding preexisting MOU\u2019s (MOU\u2019s executed or amended prior to Feb. 20, 2009) from superseding section 19853 and apply section 3517.6 to preexisting MOU\u2019s as the trial court did below, then the amendment to the supersession provision in section 19853 would have no effect. Not only would MOU\u2019s enacted on or after February 20, 2009, supersede section 19853, subdivision (a) (\u00a7 19853, subd. (g)), but so would those enacted prior thereto (\u00a7 3517.6), including those that had expired and had yet to be renegotiated (\u00a7 3517.8). In other words, as was the case before section 19853 was added in February 2009, any time the holidays listed in subdivision (a) of section 19853 conflict with provisions of an MOU, the MOU would control. We cannot- presume that the Legislature, in narrowing section 19853\u2019s supersession language, \u201cengaged in an idle act or enacted a superfluous statutory provision.\u201d <em>(California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>Governing Bd. of Rialto Unified School Dist. </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 627, 634 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 671, 927 P.2d 1175].) Accordingly, we reject the trial court\u2019s implicit finding that despite having narrowed section 19853\u2019s supersession language, the Legislature intended no change in the law. Rather, we interpret section 19853, subdivision (g), as providing that <em>only </em>MOU\u2019s enacted or amended on or after February 20, 2009, supersede section 19853.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Such an interpretation is consistent with the rule of statutory construction <em>expressio unius est exlusio alterius, </em>or \u201c \u2018to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Imperial Merchant Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hunt </em>(2009) 47 Cal.4th 381, 389 [97 Cal.Rptr.3d 464, 212 P.3d 736], quoting Black\u2019s Law Dict. (8th ed. 2004) p. 620, col. 2.) Here, the Legislature expressly identified MOU\u2019s executed or amended on or after February 20, 2009, as superseding section 19853 in the event of a conflict. If the Legislature had intended for all MOU\u2019s to control in the event of a conflict with section 19853, there would have be no need to amend the supersession language.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Our interpretation also is supported by the legislative history and the wider historical circumstances of section 19853\u2019s reenactment. <em>(See Mejia, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 663.) Section 19853\u2019s reenactment was part of a comprehensive budget plan passed in response to a fiscal emergency. (Stats. 2009, 3d Ex. Sess. 2009-2010, ch. 4, \u00a7 7.) At the time section 19853 was reenacted, the state faced a $11.2 billion budget deficit in fiscal year 2008-2009 and a much higher deficit by the end of the 2009-2010 fiscal year. <em>(Professional Engineers, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th at p. 1001.) Moreover, the Department of Finance warned that the state would run out of cash in February 2009 if immediate action was not taken. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Legislature responded by passing a comprehensive budget plan, which included a two-day-a-month furlough program and the elimination of Lincoln\u2019s Birthday and Columbus Day as paid holidays and premium pay. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1005-1006 &amp; fn. 7, 1046-1047.) The Governor estimated that the elimination of the two paid holidays and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>premium pay would \u201cresult in a savings of approximately $39.4 million General Fund in 2008-09 and $74.5 million General Fund in 2009-10.\u201d A Senate bill analysis confirms that the elimination of two paid holidays and premium pay was intended to result in budgetary savings. The trial court\u2019s interpretation, which exempted the majority of then existing MOU\u2019s from section 19853, ignores this legislative history and nullifies the immediate cost savings sought by the Governor and Legislature. Under the trial court\u2019s interpretation, only those MOU\u2019s executed or amended in the future would be affected by the changes to section 19853, thereby significantly reducing any immediate cost savings.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">SEIU argues that the state \u201cfailed to provide any evidence that the estimated [savings] included savings derived by eliminating the holidays and premium pay to SEIU bargaining units. [][] In fact, [the state] provide[d] no evidence to rule out the possibility that the savings came solely from applying the changes to employees not covered under any MOU (managers, supervisors, confidential employees, etc.) and/or those employees working under the other 11 labor agreements.\u201d The state responds that \u201cthe record demonstrates that the cost-savings achieved by eliminating the holidays results from eliminating the holidays for <em>all </em>state employees,\u201d including the 95,000 state workers SEIU represents. Among other things, the state points to evidence that at the time section 19853 was reenacted, at least 14 of the state\u2019s 21 bargaining units were operating under expired MOU\u2019s and persuasively argues that \u201c[a]n interpretation that section 19853 can be superseded by expired MOU\u2019s would mean that the vast majority of union contracts would have superseded section 19853, and the cost savings anticipated in the Senate Floor Bill Analysis would not exist.\u201d Having reviewed the legislative history and considered the historical context in which section 19853 was reenacted, we have no doubt that the Legislature eliminated the two holidays and premium pay in an effort to address an immediate fiscal crisis. Accordingly, we find it inconceivable that the Legislature intended to exempt the vast majority of the state\u2019s bargaining units from those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Having interpreted section 19853 as limiting supersession to MOU\u2019s executed or amended on or after February 20, 2009, we are left with a conflict between it and section 3517.6, which provides that anytime there is a conflict between section 19853 and an MOU, the MOU controls. (\u00a7 3517.6, subd. (a)(1).) As we shall explain, there is no rational basis for reconciling the two statutes, and thus conclude that section 19853, subdivision (g), supersedes section 3517.6, subdivision (a)(1), as a later enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The employee organizations claim and the trial court found that section 19853, subdivision (g), on the one hand, and sections 3517.6 and 3517.8 on the other, could be harmonized by interpreting section 19853, subdivision (g), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>as applying to MOU\u2019s executed or amended on or after February 20, 2009, and section 3517.6 as applying to MOU\u2019s executed or amended prior thereto. As detailed above, rather than harmonizing the statutes, such an interpretation renders section 19853, subdivision (g), nugatory and reduces the Legislature\u2019s changes to section 19853\u2019s supersession language to an idle act.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Before we address sections 19853 and 3517.6, we pause to note that we agree with the trial court\u2019s determination that sections 19853 and 3517.8 can be harmonized. Under section 3517.8, the provisions of an expired MOU, including those that \u201csupersede existing law,\u201d continue in effect until the state and the employee organization agree to a successor MOU or reach an impasse in negotiations. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (a).) Thus, as previously discussed, the provisions of the expired MOU\u2019s remained in effect at the time the Legislature enacted and the Governor signed the bill amending, repealing, and adding section 19853. It does not follow, however, that the terms of those MOU\u2019s supersede section 19853. By reenacting section 19853, the Legislature effectively altered the terms of the MOU\u2019s, including the holiday provisions contained in all of the expired MOU\u2019s and the supersession provisions contained in the SEIU MOU\u2019s. SEIU challenged the Legislature\u2019s ability to do so in the trial court and lost, and it has not challenged the trial court\u2019s ruling. <em>(Ante, </em>fn. 9.) Moreover, \u201c[w]e find nothing in the language or legislative history of [section 3517.8] to indicate the Legislature intended to limit its authority to legislate changes in terms and conditions of employment during the period when [CalHR] is bargaining with a recognized employee organization following the expiration of an MOU.\u201d <em>(Stationary Engineers Local 39 </em>(2009) PERB Dec. No. 2085-S [34 PERC \u00b624, p. 97] [cited with approval in <em>Professional Engineers, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th at p. 1048].)</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Unlike sections 19853 and 3517.8, there is no rational way to harmonize sections 19853 and 3517.6. As interpreted here, subdivision (g) of section 19853 provides that <em>only </em>MOU\u2019s executed or amended on or after February 20, 2009, supersede subdivision (a) of section 19853 in the event of a conflict. Conversely, under section 3517.6, anytime there is a conflict between an MOU and section 19853, the MOU prevails. Where conflicting statutes cannot be reconciled, later enactments supersede earlier ones. <em>(Collection Bureau of San Jose v. Rumsey, supra, </em>24 Cal.4th at p. 310; <em>People </em>v. <em>Moody, supra, </em>96 Cal.App.4th at p. 993.) Section 19853 therefore prevails.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">As detailed above, attempting to harmonize the two statutes, as the trial court did below, renders subdivision (g) of section 19853 nugatory\u2014a result that should be avoided if possible. (See <em>Los Angeles County Dependency Attorneys, Inc. v. Department of General Services </em>(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 230, 237 [73 Cal.Rptr.3d 817].) Also, as previously discussed, such an interpretation reduces the Legislature\u2019s narrowing of the supersession language to an idle act and undermines its purpose in eliminating the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>holidays and premium pay. Moreover, our conclusion is consistent with the principle of reconciling statutes by giving a more specific provision precedence over a more general provision. <em>(In re Greg F, </em>supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 407.) Section 3517.6, subdivision (a), generally governs conflicts between MOU\u2019s and over 100 statutes. Section 19853, subdivision (g), governs conflicts between MOU\u2019s and section 19853.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">For all the reasons set forth above, we conclude that section 19853 supersedes the expired MOU\u2019s at issue here and that the trial court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The judgments granting CAPS\u2019s, CAPT\u2019s, and SEIU\u2019s requests for declaratory relief and petitions for writs of mandate are hereby reversed. The judgment denying CalHR\u2019s request for declaratory relief as to section 19853 is reversed and affirmed in all other respects. The cases are remanded to the trial court with directions to (1) deny declaratory relief and vacate its writs issued in favor of CAPS, CAPT, and SEIU, and instead to issue orders denying such relief and the petitions and (2) grant declaratory relief to CalHR as to section 19853, stating that the list of holidays set forth in subdivision (a) of section 19853 supersedes the expired MOU\u2019s between the state and members of State Bargaining Units 1, 3, 4, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20 and 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">The state shall recover its costs on appeal.

Our Supreme Court held that even if the Governor lacked such authority, the Legislature\u2019s 2009 enactment of Senate Bill No. 3X 2 (2009-2010 3d Ex. Sess.), which revised the 2008 Budget Act, operated to ratify the use of the two-day-a-month furlough program as a permissible means of achieving the reduction of state employee compensation mandated by the act. (50 Cal.4th at pp. 1000, 1005.)
