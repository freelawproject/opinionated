Code, \u00a7 523)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and found a prior prison term allegation (\u00a7 667.5) to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Sentenced to county jail pursuant to section 1170, subdivision (h), for an aggregate term of four years, defendant appeals. He contends (1) insufficient evidence supports his conviction, (2) he was entitled to day-for-day conduct credit, (3) the trial court imposed an unauthorized sentence when it issued an order restraining defendant from contacting the victim, and (4) the minute order erroneously reflects he was sentenced as a two-strike offender. We conclude defendant\u2019s demand for a job constituted a demand for property for purposes of the extortion statute. Accordingly, there is sufficient evidence supporting defendant\u2019s conviction. As to the conduct credit, restraining order, and sentencing minutes, defendant\u2019s contentions have merit. Defendant is entitled to day-for-day credits. The restraining order must be vacated because there is no authority for such a restraining order. And the sentencing minutes must be corrected to delete reference to defendant as a two-strike offender. Thus, we order the trial court to provide day-for-day credits, vacate the restraining order, and delete the incorrect two-strike offender reference in the sentencing minutes. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">On September 14, 2011, defendant applied for a job at Susanville Towing, giving a completed job application to Brian Phillips, the owner of the towing company. In his application, defendant stated he desired a mechanic or shop hand position that paid \u201c$8.15.\u201d Defendant also gave Phillips an envelope. Phillips told defendant his application would be kept on file and if a job became available, defendant would be contacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Phillips opened the envelope and found a four-page letter signed by defendant. Defendant began by thanking Phillips for considering him for employment and stated: \u201cIt is important that we acknowledge the fact that this is not a typical situation.\u201d Defendant described his prior vandalism conviction for sanding paint off of a car, which he claimed he had committed in the presence of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">On the second page, defendant acknowledged the tight job market and commented, \u201cYou need not waste your time or mine with the standard; [mc] \u2018Thank you for completing the application .... We\u2019ll keep it on-file and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>notify you should anything develop.\u2019 \u201d Defendant said he could pass a drug screen and stated, \u201cI hardly believe that it is unreasonable to ask that you start me at the minimum wage, part-time if you like.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Defendant reminded Phillips that defendant\u2019s parole agent, Robert Flartner, had made the job referral. Defendant stated he included the personal cell phone number of his parole agent on his job application without the agent\u2019s authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Defendant continued: \u201cI intend to visit your office today at five o\u2019clock p.m. in order to determine whether or not I am employed by your company, [szc] Susanville Towing,\u201d commenting that he believed he would more than meet expectations. Defendant then threatened, \u201cRegretfully, if not however [sic], I will be armed with a piece of eighty-grit sandpaper that we both know I will not hesitate to use. [f] I know how detrimental it would be to your business if the paint on a customers\u2019 [sic] vehicle were to be abraded during this endeavor; [sic] and would like to avoid this at all costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Defendant told Phillips he could \u201cavert this situation by informing Mr. Hartner\u2014preferably sometime before five\u2014that I have attempted to extort a job from you,\u201d which would require Phillips \u201cto waste an entire day\u201d testifying against defendant, which was another \u201csituation I would like to avoid.\u201d Defendant concluded, \u201cplease believe me when I say that I am a true professional, that will be a valuable asset to your company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">After Phillips read this letter, he called agent Hartner to express his concern. Agent Hartner contacted defendant who admitted he had written and given the letter to Phillips. Defendant stated he intended \u201cto carry out the threat of sandpapering the vehicles.\u201d Agent Hartner arrested defendant and found on him a piece of 80-grit sandpaper.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">Defendant testified at trial. He claimed his prior act of vandalism and his threat in the present case resulted in \u201cself-imposed arrest[s]\u201d because he \u201cdecided to take three hots and a cot in lieu of not being able to locate a steady source of income through employment.\u201d Upon release from prison on September 6, 2011, he was unable to find employment or acceptable housing. He claimed Hartner had referred him to some housing that was \u201cdilapidated,\u201d \u201cdeplorable,\u201d and associated with \u201cdrug use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">An abandoned vehicle in which defendant lived had been towed by Phillips\u2019s tow truck company. On September 13, 2011, defendant asked Phillips for a job. Phillips gave defendant a job application. The next day, when defendant returned the application, Phillips told defendant he would keep the application on file. Defendant handed Phillips the demand letter \u201cas a last resort.\u201d He added, \u201c[A]t that point, of course, I knew I would be coming to jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Defendant had hoped the letter would persuade the victim to hire him. Defendant said the letter was not \u201cintended to be taken at face value\u201d and \u201c[t]he part about extorting a job, that was kind of humorous, also.\u201d Although he wanted to be hired, he \u201cfigured that [the result] would be an arrest.\u201d He was stopped while trying to secure his belongings in anticipation of being arrested. He had the sandpaper because, \u201cin a worst case scenario, if [Phillips] did take the letter as a joke, I might have to brand-ish <em>[sic] </em>the sandpaper and make a little noise in order to complete the self-imposed arrest.\u201d He explained, \u201c[T]his isn\u2019t my normal routine, I don\u2019t run around, you know, delivering ultimatums to prospective employers. I was trying to get a job.\u201d Defendant thought the entire situation had been \u201centirely blown out of proportion here\u201d and he did not attempt to extort money or property but instead requested a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">In rebuttal, agent Hartner testified the living arrangements defendant rejected provided safe, drug-free environments.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\n<em>Insufficient Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Defendant contends insufficient evidence supports his conviction for delivering a letter with intent to extort because his demand for a job was not a demand for money or property within the meaning of section 523.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The People respond that defendant\u2019s handwritten letter expressly demanded money, namely minimum wage. In his job application submitted with the letter, defendant wanted a position that paid $8.15 an hour. Thus, defendant\u2019s demand for a job was a demand for a paycheck, i.e., money. The People further respond that defendant\u2019s demand for a job was a demand for property. We conclude defendant\u2019s demand for a job constituted a demand for \u201cproperty\u201d as that term is broadly construed in cases and statutes. Thus, we conclude sufficient evidence supports his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">\u201cEvery person who, with intent to extort any money or other property from another, sends or delivers to any person any letter or other writing, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>subscribed or not, expressing or implying, or adapted to imply, any threat such as is specified in Section 519, is punishable in the same manner as if such money or property were actually obtained by means of such threat.\u201d (\u00a7 523.) \u201cFear, such as will constitute extortion, may be induced by a threat, either: [][] 1. To do an unlawful injury to the person or property of the individual threatened or of a third person . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 519.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Certain words used in the Penal Code are defined \u201cunless otherwise apparent from the context.\u201d (\u00a7 7.) \u201cThe word \u2018property\u2019 includes both real and personal property.\u201d (\u00a7 7, subd. 10.) \u201cThe words \u2018real property\u2019 are coextensive with lands, tenements, and hereditaments.\u201d (\u00a7 7, subd. 11.) \u201cThe words \u2018personal property\u2019 include money, goods, chattels, things in action, and evidences of debt.\u201d (\u00a7 7, subd. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u201c[Subdivision 12 of section 7 does not create an exclusive list of personal property limited to those specifically named.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kozlowski </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 853, 865 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 504] <em>(Kozlowski).) </em>In construing the term \u201cproperty\u201d for purposes of the extortion statute, \u201ca broad interpretation is appropriate . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 866.) \u201cProperty\u201d for purposes of theft-related crimes means \u201cthe exclusive right to use or possess a thing or the exclusive ownership of a thing. [Citations.] The term is all-embracing, including every intangible benefit and prerogative susceptible of possession or disposition. [Citation.] The right to own property implies the right to possess or use a thing to the exclusion of others. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\"><em>Kozlowski </em>found that a PIN code as a means of access to a bank account was property within the meaning of the extortion statute because a PIN code is intangible property, and intangible property is specifically included in the definition of property. <em>(Kozlowski, supra, </em>96 Cal.App.4th at p. 867; see <em>People v. Baker </em>(1978) 88 Cal.App.3d 115, 119 [151 Cal.Rptr. 362] [the right to prosecute a protest with alcohol licensing agency is property]; <em>People v. Cadman </em>(1881) 57 Cal. 562, 563-564 [the right to prosecute an appeal is property].) Relying upon <em>People v. Kwok </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1236 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 40] <em>(Kwok), Kozlowski </em>reasoned that \u201c[t]he intangible property taken\u2014the PIN codes\u2014were the means to obtain the more tangible property\u2014the bank funds\u2014contained in those accounts\u201d and destroyed the victims\u2019 \u201cintangible benefit of being able to control access to the bank accounts.\u201d (96 Cal.App.4th at p. 869.) In <em>Kwok, </em>the court determined that a house key is property and the defendant\u2019s unauthorized copying of the victim\u2019s house key constituted theft because defendant\u2019s conduct deprived the victim of something valuable, that is, her right to have exclusive access to her home. (63 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1240-1245, 1248-1251.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Here, defendant demanded a job or employment. Neither party cites a case directly on point that states a job or employment is tangible or intangible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>property for purposes of the extortion statute. Defendant simply argues that \u201cEmployment provides only the opportunity to earn money in exchange for labor\u201d and a job \u201cdoes not give the employee access to the assets of the employer.\u201d The People cite cases from other jurisdictions that conclude employment is property for purposes of extortion. We find persuasive the reasoning in <em>People </em>v. <em>Spatarella </em>(1974) 34 N.Y.2d 157 [356 N.Y.S.2d 566, 313 N.E.2d 38] <em>(Spatarella) </em>and conclude property for purposes of the extortion statute includes a business owner\u2019s right to determine whom to employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">In <em>Spatarella, </em>the defendant threatened a refuse-business competitor to stop servicing a restaurant customer or face a visit to the hospital. The competitor complied with the defendant\u2019s demand, removing his containers from the restaurant. <em>(Spatarella, supra, </em>313 N.E.2d at p. 39.) The defendant was convicted of grand larceny by extortion. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 38.) The defendant contended that a business customer was not property within the meaning of the extortion statute, which provided: \u201c \u2018A person obtains property by extortion when he [or she] compels or induces another person to deliver such property to himself or to a third person by means of instilling in him a fear that, if the property is not so delivered, the actor or another will: (i) Cause physical injury to some person in the future.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 39.) <em>Spatarella </em>rejected the defendant\u2019s contention, concluding the defendant\u2019s business competitor \u201cpossessed an advantageous business relationship,\u201d which the defendant obtained through intimidation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 40.) <em>Spatarella </em>relied upon case law that determined an employer\u2019s business was property. <em>(Ibid.) </em>In particular, <em>Spatarella </em>cited <em>People ex rel. Short v. Warden of City Prison </em>(N.Y.App.Div. 1911) 145 A.D. 861 [130 N.Y.S. 698, 26 N.Y. Cr. 285] <em>(Short) </em>in which Short committed extortion when he obtained a position for a painter and thereafter threatened the painter with the loss of his job unless he paid Short 50 cents a day from his weekly salary. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 862-863.) <em>Short </em>determined the threat to have the painter discharged was a threat to injure the painter\u2019s business, \u201can injury to his property.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 864.) Although <em>Short </em>and the other cases construed the term property \u201cfor the purpose of defining the kind of property which can be threatened,\u201d <em>Spatarella </em>concluded there was no reason \u201cto construe the term differently in defining the sort of property which can be demanded under pain of injury to the person or other property within the contemplation of the statute. Surely the extortionist\u2019s demand for the business itself, or a part of it, is, if anything, more egregious than the demand simply for money.\u201d <em>(Spatarella, supra, </em>313 N.E.2d at p. 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Here, defendant did not apply for a job in the normal course and allow the employer to evaluate his application when a job became available. Defendant demanded to be employed by the business owner or face vandalism to vehicles at the business. Defendant\u2019s threat to be employed or subject the business to vandalism was a demand for part of the employer\u2019s business, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>i.e., part of the intangible benefit and prerogative of being able to control whom to employ in one\u2019s business. (See <em>Kwok, supra, </em>63 Cal.App.4th at p. 1251.) Based on our conclusion that a demand for a job is a demand for property, sufficient evidence supports defendant\u2019s conviction. <em>(People v. Carpenter </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 312, 387 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 935 P.2d 708].)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">II-IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The judgment is modified to provide 91 days of conduct credit for a total of 182 days of presentence custody credit and to vacate the restraining order. The trial court is directed to correct the sentencing minutes to delete reference to defendant as a two-strike offender. As modified the judgment is affirmed. The trial court is directed to prepare an amended abstract of judgment and to forward a certified copy to the county sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Nicholson, Acting P.
