J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aaj\">Defendant and appellant, Monica Mercado, appeals the judgment entered following her conviction for second degree murder and attempted murder, with enhancements for inflicting great bodily injury and inflicting injury knowing the victim was pregnant (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 187, 12022.7, 12022.9.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She was sentenced to state prison for a term of 32 years to life. In a related habeas corpus petition, Mercado claims she was denied the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">We originally issued the opinion in this case, on July 21, 2011. On June 29, 2012, the United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case to us for reconsideration in light of a new opinion, <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(2012) 567 U.S._[183 L.Ed.2d 89, 132 S.Ct. 2221]. After an initial round of supplemental briefing was solicited in order to address <em>Williams, </em>a second round was solicited because the California Supreme Court subsequently issued a trio of decisions analyzing <em>Williams. </em>After giving due consideration to all these high court opinions, we now reach the same result we did before.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">The judgment is affirmed as modified. The habeas corpus petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">Viewed in accordance with the usual rule of appellate review <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ochoa </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 864 P.2d 103]), the evidence established the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>1. <em>Prosecution evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">a. <em>Porsche Davis\u2019s testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Defendant Mercado and Porsche Davis were romantically involved with the same man, Bryant Waller. Davis testified she and Mercado had been fighting over Waller for three years. Davis testified she and Waller were living together, and that she believed he had ended his relationship with Mercado.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">On April 5, 2009, Davis was eight months pregnant with Waller\u2019s child. That morning, as Davis was walking home from a McDonald\u2019s restaurant, she saw Mercado and Waller in a green Range Rover. Mercado was driving. Davis was angry because Waller had their car keys and she had been calling him because she was hungry; she felt Waller should have brought her breakfast that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">Mercado stopped the car. Davis walked to the passenger side and told Waller to give her their car keys. Waller tried to open the passenger door, but it would not open. Mercado called Davis a bitch and Davis threw a cup of orange juice into the car, splashing Waller. Mercado drove off as Davis walked away. Davis looked to make sure Mercado was gone because Mercado had tried to run her over in the past. When she saw Mercado pull into a driveway, Davis kept walking. But when she looked again, Mercado was driving right toward her. Davis heard Waller say something like \u201cwatch out\u201d or \u201cPorsche, move.\u201d Davis put her hands on the car hood, curled into a ball and held her stomach. The next thing she knew she was underneath the Range Rover: \u201cI just felt my baby go in my back and that was it. . . . And my stomach just went flat instantly.\u201d The front and back tires of the Range Rover had driven over her. Davis testified the car did not swerve before it hit her, and she never heard any sound to indicate Mercado had applied the brakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Davis was taken to a hospital. Her baby, delivered by cesarean section, was bom critically injured and did not survive. Davis suffered a cracked pelvis, broken ribs and injuries to her spine and shoulder. She was hospitalized for three and a half weeks before being transferred to a rehabilitation center.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">b. <em>Bryant Waller\u2019s testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">Waller testified he had spent the night before the incident at Mercado\u2019s home after she invited him to come over. Mercado had previously obtained a restraining order against Waller, who had a prior conviction for domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>violence, but they spent an enjoyable evening. The next morning, Mercado drove them to a Jack in the Box in her Range Rover. After leaving the restaurant, Waller saw Davis walking down the street. He told Mercado to ignore her. Mercado stopped the car. She and Waller talked about spending a day with their two boys. Mercado brought up Davis\u2019s pregnancy and said, \u201c. . . I can\u2019t believe that you\u2019re going to let her have this baby.\u201d Waller said Davis was eight months pregnant and there was nothing he could do about it. Mercado seemed upset, but not really angry.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">While he and Mercado were talking, Davis walked up and asked him for the keys to their car. When Davis used the word \u201cbitch,\u201d Mercado said, \u201c[Hjold on bitch,\u201d and Davis tossed her cup of orange juice into the car, hitting Waller in the face. Everybody started screaming. Mercado put the Range Rover into reverse and backed up. Waller told her to pull over. Mercado asked if he was going \u201cto save this bitch.\u201d Waller tried to get out of the car but he had trouble opening the door. The car started moving.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Mercado turned into a driveway, backed out, and started driving down the street. Waller was still trying to get the passenger door open. When he finally succeeded in getting it open a little, Mercado grabbed him and again asked if he intended \u201cto go help this bitch.\u201d The car swerved when Mercado grabbed him. At that moment, the Range Rover hit Davis, although Waller did not see the actual impact. After Mercado let Waller out of the car a half block away, he ran back to Davis. Mercado drove <em>off.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">After listening to a recording of his police interview from the day after the incident, Waller acknowledged that as Mercado turned her car around in the driveway she said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m going to kill this bitch.\u201d He added, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that she meant it in that form.\u201d Waller also told the police that Mercado \u201cbacks up and then she guns towards my girl. And runs her over.\u201d Asked at trial if Mercado had driven right at Davis, Waller answered no. But the recording showed Waller had told police that Mercado \u201cwent right at her.\u201d Although at trial Waller testified he could not say if Mercado had acted deliberately, he told police he had \u201cno sympathy for her\u201d because \u201cdon\u2019t nobody on God\u2019s green earth would do anything to gun a pregnant woman down.\u201d At trial, Waller agreed he had been pretty clear in his police interview that he believed Mercado acted deliberately.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Waller also acknowledged that when he subsequently spoke to Mercado in jail, he told her he would wait for her and marry her. He told her he would \u201cgive them all the information they need to help\u201d Mercado get out of jail. Waller acknowledged he did not tell police there had been any kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>\u201ctussle\u201d inside the car between him and Mercado, or that Mercado had grabbed his arm just before the car hit Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">On cross-examination by defense counsel the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">\u201cQ. Mr. Waller, looking back on everything that happened and trying to remember what all you heard, are you certain that she said, \u2018I\u2019m going to kill that bitch,\u2019 or could she have said something else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">\u201cA. If it\u2019s what I said ... in the police report, it\u2019s what was said.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIZ\">c. <em>Independent eyewitness testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Bruce Cotton, a truckdriver, was sitting on his porch that morning. He saw Davis walking down the street and arguing with Waller, who was riding in a car. Davis was yelling at him: \u201cGive me my keys, give me my keys.\u201d Mercado pulled over and parked, and Cotton heard all three of them arguing. When Mercado started driving again, Davis walked after the car yelling, \u201c[Pjlease give me my keys.\u201d Mercado turned around, headed back toward Davis and stopped right in front of her. Davis put her hand on the hood of the car and kept yelling for her keys. Waller yelled, \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t do it. Stop, don\u2019t do it.\u201d Mercado \u201chit the accelerator\u201d and rolled slowly over Davis. The car did not swerve or brake. Cotton testified Davis screamed and he heard her bones being crushed as Mercado ran over her with the car\u2019s front and back tires. It looked like Waller tried to get out of the car, but Mercado sped around the comer and Waller could not get out until she came to a stop. After Waller got out, Mercado sped off.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Jai Gilyard testified she was sitting in the living room of her mother\u2019s house that morning and she looked out the window when she heard loud voices. She saw Davis walking and a Range Rover driving by in the same direction. Then the same car drove by in the opposite direction. Gilyard heard someone in the car say, \u201cIf you don\u2019t get from in front of my car, I\u2019m going to mn you over.\u201d Gilyard saw Davis \u201crolling under the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">Meanwhile, Cotton had called 911, jumped into his car and followed Mercado. When Mercado stopped at a gas station, he pulled in behind her. Cotton testified Mercado jumped out of her car, came over to him and \u201cin a vengeful voice . . . asked me what the hell am I following her for.\u201d When Cotton told her she had just mn over a woman and left the scene of an accident, Mercado gave him a \u201clike, so what\u201d look. She jumped back into her car and sped off.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>d. <em>Medical evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Dr. Virender Rehan attended at the delivery of Davis\u2019s baby by emergency cesarean section. The baby was almost dead at birth, her heart beating only occasionally. Her skull had been fractured, she was suffering from convulsions and there was extensive internal head bleeding. It was obvious she would not survive. When life support was disconnected, the baby died within minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Deputy Medical Examiner Dr. Ogbonna Chinwah was asked what his work in the coroner\u2019s department entailed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u201cQ. What are your duties and responsibilities as a medical examiner?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">\u201cA. I examine the bodies brought into the department to determine the cause and manner of death.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">\u201cQ. What does \u2018manner of death\u2019 mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">\u201cA. Manner of death is classified in five classifications: Natural, accident, suicide, homicide, and undetermined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">Chinwah testified he performed the autopsy on Davis\u2019s baby. Because of a catastrophic skull fracture, it would have been virtually impossible to save the baby\u2019s life. Chinwah opined the cause of death had been blunt force trauma to the baby\u2019s head, and he characterized the death as a homicide. Chinwah based this homicide conclusion on information he received from a coroner\u2019s investigator indicating the baby\u2019s mother had been intentionally run over by a car.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">e. <em>Prior violent incidents involving Mercado.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">Davis testified she and Mercado had had prior angry encounters during which Mercado had done such things as spraying Mace into Davis\u2019s car, cutting her with a knife, and slashing her tires. During one of these encounters, Davis had pepper-sprayed Mercado. Mercado and Davis had a fight in January 2009, during which Mercado tried to run Davis down with her Range Rover. Waller had yelled at Davis to watch out, and Davis managed to jump out of the way. Mercado then crashed into the gates of a market and Davis threw a hammer at her. Davis got into her own car and Mercado chased her through the neighborhood. Later, Mercado drove into Davis\u2019s parked car.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Waller testified that once, in November 2007, he and a former girlfriend, Saraya Hollis, were riding in a car when Mercado drove up. Waller got out and Mercado started chasing Hollis. When Hollis returned, there was a dent in the car because Mercado had hit it. The next morning, Waller and Hollis were again driving when Mercado came up behind them and \u201cbumped\u201d their car.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Waller testified that, in addition to Davis\u2019s baby and the children he had with Mercado, he also had three children with Gwanna Hayes. In September 2007, Mercado came to Hayes\u2019s house looking for him. When Waller opened the door, Mercado \u201cran inside\u201d and \u201c[sjtarted banging up stuff.\u201d She smashed photographs of Waller and his children, and broke the window of Waller\u2019s car. Waller called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Hollis also testified about the November 2007 incident. She was sitting in a car with Waller when Mercado approached and began arguing with him. When Hollis drove off, Mercado chased her and repeatedly ran into the car. The next morning, when Hollis was dropping Waller off, she noticed Mercado behind her. Hollis got out and they had words. Mercado then tried to hit Hollis with her car. Hollis moved out of the way and Mercado hit Hollis\u2019s car. Hollis filed a police report.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">2. <em>Defense evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">Mercado\u2019s sister, Violeta, testified that when she lived with Mercado in 2007 and 2008, Davis used to drive by and look at their house five or six times a month. Once, Davis came into their yard and threw a Coke can or bottle at the windshield of Violeta\u2019s car. When Violeta yelled at her, Davis asked, \u201cWhere the fuck is your bitch ass sister.\u201d Davis, who had a wrench in her hand, also said: \u201cOh, you just watch and see, I have something for that bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Mercado\u2019s other sister, Gabriela, testified that once in March 2008 she was babysitting at Mercado\u2019s house while Mercado and Waller went out. At 2:30 a.m., she heard Mercado yelling. Running outside, Gabriela saw Mercado in her car and Davis running up to the car with a hammer. Davis started banging on Mercado\u2019s car with the hammer. Waller was there, yelling at Davis to leave. Mercado got out of the car and started fighting with Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Mercado testified in her own defense. She had prior convictions for petty theft and grand theft. Mercado and Waller had two young children. Mercado testified Waller lived with her during the \u201cwhole course of [their] relationship.\u201d Mercado first learned Waller was seeing Davis two or three years ago. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>She and Davis had been engaged in a mnning battle over Waller, and she had told Davis to leave Waller alone many times.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">On the morning of April 5, as she and Waller were driving home from Jack in the Box, Waller suddenly told her, \u201cMan, just go straight and avoid the bullshit.\u201d When Mercado pulled over and asked what he was talking about, Waller said Davis was pregnant. Mercado started crying and asked why Davis was having the baby. Waller said there was nothing he could do because she was eight months pregnant. Mercado said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe that she\u2019s going to have your baby.\u201d Just then, Davis appeared and said, \u201cYou\u2019re still fucking with this bitch. Give me my keys. Give me my keys.\u201d When Waller told her to hold on a minute, Davis threw her orange juice into the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Mercado decided to drive home, so she pulled into a driveway. Before backing up, she looked in both directions and saw Davis on the sidewalk. As Mercado put the car into reverse, Waller tried to get out. Mercado was upset. She pulled on him and Waller pushed her; they were screaming at each other. After turning around in the driveway, Mercado was going 20 or 25 miles per hour. Waller was still trying to get the car door open and Mercado was pulling on his arm. Mercado never saw Davis standing in the street. When she felt the impact, she got scared and drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Mercado denied intentionally hitting Davis. She denied having said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t move, I\u2019m going to run you over,\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill this bitch.\u201d She testified Waller never said, \u201cNo, don\u2019t do it, don\u2019t run her over.\u201d Mercado also denied trying to run Hollis down, but admitted hitting the car Hollis had been sitting in.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">1. The trial court misinstructed the jury when it asked a question while deliberating.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">2. Defense counsel was ineffective for not obtaining a report of Mercado\u2019s psychological examination until after the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">3. The medical examiner\u2019s testimony characterizing the baby\u2019s death as a homicide violated the confrontation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">4. There was cumulative error.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">5. There was sentencing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">1. <em>Trial court properly answered the jury\u2019s question during deliberations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Mercado contends her convictions must be reversed because the trial court gave an incorrect answer when, during deliberations, the jury asked a question about the murder and voluntary manslaughter instructions. This claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">a. <em>Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">The jury was given CALCRIM No. 520, defining murder. This instruction stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">\u201cThe defendant is charged in Count I with murder. To prove the defendant is guilty of this crime, the People must prove that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\">\u201cNumber one, the defendant committed an act that caused the death of another person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">\u201cTwo, when the defendant acted she had the state of mind called malice aforethought;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-12\">\u201cAnd three, she killed without lawful excuse or justification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-13\">The jury was also given CALCRIM No. 570, defining voluntary manslaughter, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-14\">\u201cA killing that would otherwise be murder is reduced to voluntary manslaughter if the defendant killed someone because of a sudden quarrel or in heat of passion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-15\">\u201cThe defendant killed someone because of sudden quarrel or in heat of passion if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-16\">\u201cNumber one, the defendant was provoked;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-17\">\u201cNumber two, as a result of the provocation the defendant acted rashly and under influence of intense emotions that obscured her reasoning or judgment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-18\">\u201cAnd three, the provocation would have caused a person of average disposition to act rashly and without due deliberation, that is, from passion rather than judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>While deliberating, the jury sent the following note to the trial court: \u201cDefinition of \u00a7 520/570 contains 3 points; In both Sections does all 3 criteria have to be met in order to meet verdict of the \u00a7 520 or \u00a7 570?\u201d The trial court responded with a one-word answer: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">b. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Mercado contends: \u201cWhile the three elements of murder, of course, all had to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order for the jury to return a verdict of guilty of murder, the three \u2018criteria\u2019 contained in CALCRIM 570, the voluntary manslaughter instruction, did not have to be \u2018met\u2019 in order for the jury to return a voluntary manslaughter verdict. Rather, the prosecution had to disprove, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of passion/quarrel and provocation as defined by the three criteria in the instructions, in order for the jury to find Ms. Mercado guilty of murder, [f] The court\u2019s error erroneously shifted the burden of proof on the issue of provocation and passion/quarrel and relieved the prosecution of proving an essential element of malice\u2014the absence of provocation and passion/quarrel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Noting that \u201c[ajbsence of a sudden quarrel or heat of passion is a fact the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt when murder and voluntary manslaughter are under joint consideration\u201d <em>(People v. Najera </em>(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 212, 223 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 244]), Mercado argues: \u201cBy informing jurors that the elements of passion/quarrel had to be \u2018met\u2019 in order for the jury to return a voluntary manslaughter verdict, <em>and by treating these elements as analogous or comparable to the elements of murder, </em>the trial court erred.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">Mercado\u2019s argument appears to be predicated on a misreading of the record. For instance, she poses the issue this way: \u201cThe deliberating jury asked the court whether the elements of murder had to be met in order to return a murder verdict, and whether the three criteria establishing provocation/passion had to be met in order to return a voluntary manslaughter verdict. The court answered \u2018yes.\u2019 \u201d But this formulation misconstrues the essence of the jury\u2019s question, which was: As to both instructions, do <em>all three elements </em>have to be satisfied? The proper answer to this question was indeed \u201cyes.\u201d By focusing on the \u201chad to be met\u201d language, rather than on the \u201call three elements\u201d language, Mercado makes it sound like the jury was asking about the burden of proof. As we read the jury\u2019s question, however, it had to do with whether <em>all three elements </em>of each instruction, both CALCRIM No. 520 and CALCRIM No. 570, were necessary elements, i.e., whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>elements were conjunctive or disjunctive. The trial court properly answered by saying the elements were conjunctive.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Moreover, the jury was given the following clear direction as part of the voluntary manslaughter instruction: \u201cThe People have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant did not kill as a result of a sudden quarrel or in heat of passion, [f] If the People have not met this burden, you must find the defendant not guilty of murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Hence, the trial court\u2019s answer was correctly directed at the actual question the jury asked. We agree with the Attorney General that, given all the instructions, it is not reasonably likely the jury \u201cmisapplied the trial court\u2019s . . . response in a manner that shifted the burden of proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The trial court did not err in responding to the jury\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">2. <em>Failure to obtain Mercado\u2019s psychological report from expert did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Mercado contends she was denied effective assistance because defense counsel arranged for her to be interviewed by a psychologist, but then failed to obtain the psychologist\u2019s report in time to use it at trial. This claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">a. <em>Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">On the day voir dire commenced, the trial court asked defense counsel about the proposed testimony of Dr. Sandra Baca, who had been engaged as a defense expert. Baca, a licensed marriage and family therapist, and an expert on domestic violence, had interviewed Mercado five days earlier. Defense counsel replied, \u201cI\u2019ll know when I get a report. This is an expert in domestic violence. We do know that Miss Mercado has been a victim of continuous domestic violence by Mr. Waller.\u201d When the trial court questioned the relevance of such psychological evidence since Waller had not been the victim, defense counsel said, \u201cI won\u2019t know until I get the report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">Three days later, just prior to opening statements, the trial court remarked the defense theory had evolved from self-defense to accident and asked if Baca were being dropped as a witness. Defense counsel said he intended to have her testify, although he still did not have her report. The trial court ruled Baca\u2019s testimony would be excluded unless the defense could make a more specific offer of proof. There was no further offer of proof and Baca did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>After Mercado\u2019s conviction, defense counsel included a copy of Baca\u2019s report, which was not written until after Mercado had been convicted, as part of a sentencing memorandum. The report said Mercado told Baca that, when she was a child, her father had been physically abusive. Mercado tried to protect her two younger sisters when her parents argued, and she tried to protect her mother from her father. The report said Mercado had two sons by a man named George Jenkins, and that these boys had been removed from Mercado\u2019s house in 2009 because of Waller\u2019s violence. Mercado described having been badly beaten by both Jenkins and Waller.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Baca\u2019s report concluded, \u201cthe following susceptibility risk factors may help explain [Mercado\u2019s] actions on the day\u201d of the incident: Mercado had been \u201cexposed to high levels of violence in the home when she was growing up\u201d at the hands of \u201can alcoholic and drug addicted father,\u201d and Mercado subsequently \u201crepeated what she observed in her family home and became involved with men who used and abused her.\u201d Baca opined that, because \u201cMercado\u2019s case of repeated activation of her stress-response from the vicarious trauma she endured at [a] young age began when her brain was still developing, it may have caused an altered sensitivity and dysfunction throughout her brain. Ms. Mercado\u2019s impulse problems might be due to a change in the organization of her stress response in her neural networks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Defense counsel subsequently filed a new trial motion. At the hearing on this motion, counsel said he did not receive Baca\u2019s report until after trial and that when he read it he realized he had not adequately represented Mercado. Counsel said he had been unaware Mercado\u2019s history of abuse included her relationship with Jenkins and her childhood. The new trial motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">b. <em>Legal principles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has two components: \u201c \u2018First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\u2019 [Citation.] To establish ineffectiveness, a \u2018defendant must show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u2019 [Citation.] To establish prejudice he \u2018must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>Taylor </em>(2000) 529 U.S. 362, 390-391 [146 L.Ed.2d 389, 120 S.Ct. 1495].) \u201c[T]he burden of proof that the defendant must meet in order to establish [her] entitlement to relief on an ineffective-assistance claim is preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>(People v. Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 218 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839].)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">An appellate court \u201cneed not determine whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient before examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as a result of the alleged deficiencies.\u201d <em>(Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 697 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 104 S.Ct. 2052].)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">c. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Mercado contends she was prejudiced because defense counsel \u201cproceeded to trial without having obtained a report from Dr. Baca, the expert he . . . retained]\u2014and, therefore, without considering whether expert testimony about the matters Dr. Baca wrote about in her report would have assisted Ms. Mercado\u2019s case.\u201d Mercado asserts the lack of this psychological evidence compromised her heat-of-passion attempted voluntary manslaughter defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">But Mercado has not cited any authority allowing the admission of this kind of psychological evidence to establish the objective element of a heat-of-passion voluntary manslaughter defense. As <em>People </em>v. <em>Steele </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1230 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 47 P.3d 225], explained: \u201cThe heat of passion requirement for manslaughter has both an objective and a subjective component. [Citation.] The defendant must actually, subjectively, kill under the heat of passion. [Citation.] But the circumstances giving rise to the heat of passion are also viewed objectively. As we explained long ago . . . \u2018this heat of passion must be such a passion as would naturally be aroused in the mind of an ordinarily reasonable person under the given facts and circumstances,\u2019 because \u2018no defendant may set up his own standard of conduct and justify or excuse himself because in fact his passions were aroused, unless further the jury believe that the facts and circumstances were sufficient to arouse the passions of the ordinarily reasonable man.\u2019 [Citation.] [f] Defendant\u2019s evidence that he was intoxicated, that he suffered various mental deficiencies, that he had a psychological dysfunction due to traumatic experiences in the Vietnam War, and that he just \u2018snapped\u2019 when he heard the helicopter, may have satisfied the subjective element of heat of passion. [Citation.] But it does not satisfy the objective, reasonable person requirement, which requires provocation by the victim. [Citation.] \u2018To satisfy the objective or \u201creasonable person\u201d element of this form of voluntary manslaughter, the accused\u2019s heat of passion must be due to \u201csufficient provocation.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018[E]vidence of defendant\u2019s extraordinary character and environmental deficiencies was manifestly irrelevant to the inquiry.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (I<em>d. </em>at pp. 1252-1253.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Here, even without the kind of testimony Baca might have provided, there was already more than enough evidence establishing the subjective element of heat-of-passion provocation, i.e., that Mercado assaulted Davis in a jealous rage after learning Davis was pregnant with Waller\u2019s child. What was missing from Mercado\u2019s heat-of-passion defense was the objective element and, as <em>Steele </em>explained, the kind of testimony Baca might have provided is irrelevant to the objective element. As the Attorney General argues, \u201cSince Dr. Baca\u2019s report concludes that appellant\u2019s responses were unique based on her alleged history of abuse, Dr. Baca\u2019s testimony would not have supported a voluntary manslaughter verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is no reasonable probability the psychological evidence at issue here would have made any difference in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Because there was no prejudice flowing from defense counsel\u2019s failure to obtain Baca\u2019s psychological report in time for use at trial, there was no ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">3. <em>Medical examiner\u2019s testimony about the baby\u2019s \u201cmanner of death\u201d does not warrant reversal of Mercado\u2019s conviction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Mercado contends her conviction must be reversed because her confrontation clause rights were violated when the deputy medical examiner, Dr. Chinwah, testified Davis\u2019s baby died as a result of a homicide. This claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">a. <em>Background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">After testifying his autopsy findings led him to conclude the baby\u2019s <em>cause of death </em>had been blunt force trauma to the head, Chinwah was asked if he had determined the baby\u2019s <em>manner of death:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-9\">\u201cQ. Did you determine the manner of death based on your autopsy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-10\">\u201cA. Homicide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-11\">\u201cQ. Why did you conclude homicide?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-12\">\u201cA. The circumstances under which this occurred was [sic] taken into consideration, and from the information I got was that this mother was intentionally run over by the operator of the vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>The prosecutor\u2019s direct examination ended at this point. On cross-examination, Chinwah was immediately asked where that information had come from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-5\">\u201cA. The coroner\u2019s office has an investigator that goes to the scene of anything that is brought into the coroner\u2019s office. [&lt;0 And the investigator interviews different people and make [szc] report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-6\">\u201cQ. Do you know if the investigator interviewed the people that have testified in this trial about what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-7\">\u201cA. I have no idea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">\u201cQ. So it is a flash report that you received, a flash report, a report based on one investigator\u2019s going to a scene and making a report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">\u201cQ. Without follow-up of any other witnesses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">\u201cA. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">Chinwah said, \u201cthe information that I received was that the operator of this vehicle in anger moved away, rode, drove away, and made a U-tum and stated some word to the effect that I\u2019m going to kill this\u2014I don\u2019t want to use the word that was written in the report. [][] And then this operator of the vehicle accelerated and ran over the pregnant mother.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">Defense counsel then asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-14\">\u201cQ. A car running over a person creates a massive force; isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-15\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-16\">\u201cQ. And your opinion of a massive force remains the same on whether it\u2019s an accidental hitting or a deliberate hitting. The massive force is still there, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-17\">Chinwah agreed the massive force injury could have been caused either intentionally or accidentally.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-18\">\u201cQ. . . . You\u2019re basing your opinion upon the investigation report, isn\u2019t that right, as to how this happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\u201cA. That\u2019s what I said. That\u2019s the circumstance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Asked if new information \u201cthat contradicted the investigator\u2019s report\u201d might change his mind, Chinwah testified: \u201cExcept that information is totally unrelated to the original information that I got. For example, if I got an information [szc] that this incident happened when there was no altercation, that this driver was not even at the scene of this altercation, and this driver was just driving by, then I would say maybe, maybe that\u2019s true, [f] But the information that I got was so convincing and compatible to the finding that all the other information to me would be, maybe making up a story.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Asked if any additional information would make a difference, Chinwah testified: \u201cI would say it has to be very, very, very strong to make, to contradict the original story on this thing here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">On redirect examination, the prosecutor simply asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">\u201cQ. Doctor, the information you received was that the driver sped up and ran over the woman, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">\u201cQ. And the injuries that you observed to the baby, were they consistent with the driver speeding up and running over the mother who was carrying that baby?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">b. <em>Legal principles.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">Mercado contends Chinwah\u2019s testimony \u201cthat, in his opinion, the manner of death was homicide, and that his opinion was based upon a report by the coroner\u2019s investigator who interviewed witnesses at the scene, who told the investigator that \u2018this mother was intentionally run over by the operator of the vehicle,\u2019 \u201d violated the confrontation clause and requires a reversal of her conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">As we have explained, <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(2004) 541 U.S. 36 [158 L.Ed.2d 177, 124 S.Ct. 1354] established a new confrontation clause test focusing \u201con the \u2018testimonial or nontestimonial nature\u2019 of the out-of-court statement. <em>Crawford </em>held that \u2018[w]here testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, out-of-court <em>testimonial </em>statements are admissible only when the witness is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>unavailable and there has been a prior opportunity for cross-examination of that witness, [f] <em>Crawford </em>declined to define the term \u2018testimonial\u2019 [citation], but gave examples of testimonial statements. <em>Crawford </em>listed as testimonial: (1) plea allocutions showing the existence of a conspiracy; (2) grand jury testimony; (3) prior trial testimony; (4) ex parte testimony at a preliminary hearing; and (5) statements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cervantes </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 162, 172 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 774].)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In <em>Williams v. Illinois, supra, </em>567 U.S._ [132 S.Ct. 2221], the United States Supreme Court\u2019s most recent case discussing <em>Crawford, </em>a prosecution DNA expert \u201ctestified that a DNA profile produced by an outside laboratory, Cellmark, matched a profile produced by the state police lab using a sample of petitioner\u2019s blood. On direct examination, the expert testified that Cellmark . . . provided the police with a DNA profile. The expert also explained the notations on documents admitted as business records, stating that, according to the records, vaginal swabs taken from the victim were sent to and received back from Cellmark. The expert made no other statement that was offered for the purpose of identifying the sample of biological material used in deriving the profile or for the purpose of establishing how Cellmark handled or tested the sample. Nor did the expert vouch for the accuracy of the profile that Cellmark produced. Nevertheless, petitioner contends that the expert\u2019s testimony violated the Confrontation Clause as interpreted in <em>Crawford, </em>[f] Petitioner\u2019s main argument is that the expert went astray when she referred to the DNA profile provided by Cellmark as having been produced from semen found on the victim\u2019s vaginal swabs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. _ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2227] (plur. opn. of Alito, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">The fundamental question posed by these facts was this: \u201c[D]oes <em>Crawford </em>bar an expert from expressing an opinion based on facts about a case that have been made known to the expert but about which the expert is not competent to testify?\u201d <em>(Williams v. Illinois, supra, </em>567 U.S at p.__[132 S.Ct. at p. 2227] (plur. opn. of Alito, J.).) Justice Alito\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>Williams </em>(joined by three other justices),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> concluded this testimony did not present a confrontation clause problem because (a) the extrajudicial statements had not been offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted, but only as the basis for the testifying witness\u2019s opinion, and, (b) even if asserted for its truth, the primary purpose of the Cellmark report had not been to aid in the defendant\u2019s prosecution: \u201cThe Cellmark report is very different from the sort of extrajudicial statements, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, and confessions, that the Confrontation Clause was originally understood to reach. The report was produced before any suspect was identified. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The report was sought not for the purpose of obtaining evidence to be used against petitioner, who was not even under suspicion at the time, but for the purpose of finding a rapist who was on the loose.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p._[132 S.Ct. at p. 2228] (plur. opn. of Alito, J.).) In the plurality\u2019s view, to qualify as \u201ctestimonial\u201d the extrajudicial statement must have had \u201cthe primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p._[132 S.Ct. at p. 2243] (plur. opn. of Alito, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence, while agreeing there was no confrontation clause violation, rejected both grounds of the plurality\u2019s rationale. He concluded that, although the evidence had indeed been admitted for its truth, and although the plurality\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose\u201d analysis was incorrect, there was no confrontation clause violation \u201csolely because Cellmark\u2019s statements lacked the requisite \u2018formality and solemnity\u2019 to be considered \u2018 \u201ctestimonial\u201d \u2019 for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Illinois, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p._[132 S.Ct. at p. 2255] (conc. opn. of Thomas, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">Justice Thomas explained: \u201c. . . I have concluded that the Confrontation Clause reaches \u2018 \u201cformalized testimonial materials,\u201d \u2019 such as depositions, affidavits, and prior testimony, or statements resulting from \u2018 \u201cformalized dialogue,\u201d \u2019 such as custodial interrogation. [Citations.] [][] Applying these principles, I conclude that Cellmark\u2019s report is not a statement by a \u2018wit-nests]\u2019 within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause. The Cellmark report lacks the solemnity of an affidavit or deposition, for it is neither a sworn nor a certified declaration of- fact. Nowhere does the report attest that its statements accurately reflect the DNA testing processes used or the results obtained. . . . [Citation.] And, although the report was produced at the request of law enforcement, it was not the product of any sort of formalized dialogue resembling custodial interrogation.\u201d <em>(Williams v. Illinois, supra, </em>567 U.S at p._[132 S.Ct. at p. 2260], fn. omitted (conc. opn. of Thomas, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">Justice Kagan\u2019s dissenting opinion (joined by three other justices)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> disagreed with both the plurality and Justice Thomas, and would have found the confrontation clause had been violated. Most pertinent to our analysis, the dissent characterized the primary purpose test as \u201ca statement meant to serve as evidence in a potential criminal trial.\u201d <em>(Williams v. Illinois, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p._[132 S.Ct. at p. 2275] (dis. opn. of Kagan, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">The California Supreme Court has given its initial analysis of <em>Williams </em>in a trio of cases: <em>People v. Dungo </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 608 [147 Cal.Rptr.3d 527, 286 P.3d 442], <em>People v. Lopez </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 569 [147 Cal.Rptr.3d 559, 286 P.3d 469], and <em>People v. Rutterschmidt </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 650 [147 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Cal.Rptr.3d 518, 286 P.3d 435]. <em>Lopez </em>summed up <em>Williams </em>this way: \u201cAlthough the high court has not agreed on a definition of \u2018testimonial,\u2019 a review of [its] decisions indicates that a statement is testimonial when two critical components are present. [][] First, to be testimonial the out-of-court statement must have been made with some degree of formality or solemnity. [Citations.] The degree of formality required, however, remains a subject of dispute in the United States Supreme Court. [Citations.] [f] Second, all nine high court justices agree that an out-of-court statement is testimonial only if its primary purpose pertains in some fashion to a criminal prosecution, but they do not agree on what the statement\u2019s primary purpose must be.\u201d <em>(People v. Lopez, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at pp. 581-582.)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Justice Chin\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Dungo </em>(joined by three other justices), contains an amplified explanation of how to harmonize the views expressed in Williams: \u201c \u2018When a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, \u201cthe holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds ....\u2019\u201d [Citation.] This rule does not work particularly well, if at all, unless \u2018one opinion can be meaningfully regarded as \u201cnarrower\u201d than another,\u2019 that is, unless \u2018one opinion is a logical subset of other, broader opinions.\u2019 [Citation.] Here, neither the plurality opinion nor Justice Thomas\u2019s concurring opinion can be viewed as a logical subset of the other. Indeed, to some extent they are contradictory.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 628 (conc. opn. of Chin, J.).) Nevertheless, \u201c[w]e know what the <em>result </em>was in <em>Williams . . . : </em>The testimony at issue did not violate the confrontation clause. This is because a majority of the court so concluded. Four justices (the plurality) found no violation for their reasons. One justice (Justice Thomas) found no violation for his different reasons. This means that a majority of the <em>Williams </em>court would find no violation of the confrontation clause whenever there was no violation under the plurality\u2019s <em>and </em>under Justice Thomas\u2019s reasoning.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Of the three California cases decided in the aftermath of <em>Williams, </em>the decision in <em>Dungo </em>is the most pertinent to the facts of the case at bar. \u201cAt. . . Dungo\u2019s murder trial, a forensic pathologist testifying for the prosecution described to the jury objective facts about the condition of the victim\u2019s body as recorded in the autopsy report and accompanying photographs. Based on those facts, the expert gave his independent opinion that the victim had died of strangulation. Neither the autopsy report, which was prepared by another pathologist [(Dr. Bolduc)] who did not testify, nor the photographs were introduced into evidence.\u201d <em>(People v. Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 612.) The <em>Dungo </em>court held \u201cthe expert\u2019s testimony did not give rise to a right by defendant to question the preparer of the autopsy report.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>As <em>Dungo </em>explained: \u201cWe begin with the issue of formality. An autopsy report typically contains two types of statements: (1) statements describing the pathologist\u2019s anatomical and physiological observations about the condition of the body, and (2) statements setting forth the pathologist\u2019s conclusions as to the cause of the victim\u2019s death. The out-of-court statements at issue here\u2014pathologist Bolduc\u2019s observations about the condition of victim Pina\u2019s body\u2014all fall into the first of the two categories. These statements, which merely record objective facts, are less formal than statements setting forth a pathologist\u2019s expert conclusions. They are comparable to observations of objective fact in a report by a physician who, after examining a patient, diagnoses a particular injury or ailment and determines the appropriate treatment. Such observations are not testimonial in nature. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dungo, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at pp. 619-620.)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">As for the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d factor, <em>Dungo </em>reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">\u201cThe preparation of an autopsy report is governed by California\u2019s Government Code section 27491, which requires a county coroner to \u2018inquire into and determine the circumstances, manner, and cause\u2019 of certain types of death. Some of these deaths (such as deaths from alcoholism, \u2018sudden infant death syndrome,\u2019 and \u2018contagious disease\u2019) result from causes unrelated to criminal activities, while other deaths (such as deaths resulting from \u2018criminal abortion,\u2019 deaths by \u2018known or suspected homicide,\u2019 and \u2018deaths associated with a known or alleged rape\u2019) result from the commission of a crime. [Citation.] With respect to all of the statutorily specified categories of death, however, the scope of the coroner\u2019s statutory duty to investigate is the same, regardless of whether the death resulted from criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u201cThe usefulness of autopsy reports, including the one at issue here, is not limited to criminal investigation and prosecution; such reports serve many other equally important purposes. For example, the decedent\u2019s relatives may use an autopsy report in determining whether to file an action for wrongful death. And an insurance company may use an autopsy report in determining whether a particular death is covered by one of its policies. [Citation.] Also, in certain cases an autopsy report may satisfy the public\u2019s interest in knowing the cause of death, particularly when (as here) the death was reported in the local media. In addition, an autopsy report may provide answers to grieving family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u201cIn short, criminal investigation was not the <em>primary </em>purpose for the autopsy report\u2019s description of the condition of Pina\u2019s body; it was only one of several purposes. The presence of a detective at the autopsy and the statutory requirement that suspicious findings be reported to law enforcement do not change that conclusion. The autopsy continued to serve several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>purposes, only one of which was criminal investigation. The autopsy report itself was simply an official explanation of an unusual death, and such official records are ordinarily not testimonial. [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u201cIn summary, Dr. Lawrence\u2019s description to the jury of objective facts about the condition of victim Pina\u2019s body, facts he derived from Dr. Bolduc\u2019s autopsy report and its accompanying photographs, did not give defendant a right to confront and cross-examine Dr. Bolduc. <em>The facts that Dr. Lawrence related to the jury were not so formal and solemn as to be considered testimonial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s confrontation right, and criminal investigation was not the primary purpose for recording the facts in question. </em>In holding that defendant\u2019s confrontation right was violated here, the Court of Appeal erred.\u201d <em>(People v.

Although the <em>Williams </em>plurality concluded expert basis testimony does not constitute hearsay because it is not admitted for its truth, both Justice Thomas and the <em>Williams </em>dissenters rejected that analysis, concluding the evidence at issue had been admitted for its truth. (See <em>People v. Westmoreland </em>(2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 602, 621 [153 Cal.Rptr.3d 267] [\u201cA majority of the justices in <em>Williams, Dungo, </em>and <em>Lopez </em>determined that the challenged out-of-court statements admitted during the expert testimony in each of those cases were admitted for the truth of the facts asserted in the statements, at least for confrontation clause purposes.\u201d].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">However, in light of Dungo\u2019s analysis of <em>Williams, </em>we conclude the extrajudicial statements relied on by Dr. Chinwah in reaching his conclusion about the baby\u2019s manner of death were not \u201ctestimonial\u201d under <em>Crawford. </em>Mercado mounts a series of arguments against this conclusion, but we do not find them persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Mercado argues <em>Dungo </em>is fundamentally different from the case at bar: \u201cAlthough like the statements at issue in <em>Dungo, </em>the statements at issue here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>relate to the cause and manner of death, the similarity ends there. The statements at issue here, rather than being objective scientific facts, were the observations and conclusions of lay witnesses. These eyewitness statements are in no way \u2018comparable to observations of objective fact in a report by a physician who, after examining a patient, diagnoses a particular injury or ailment and determines the appropriate treatment.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">We disagree. <em>Dungo </em>was contrasting the \u201cformality\u201d of an expert\u2019s medical conclusions with the \u201cinformality\u201d of the factual background material the expert relied on in reaching those conclusions. It is well established that \u201c[ajn expert witness . . . may base an opinion on reliable hearsay, including out-of-court declarations of other persons.\u201d <em>(In re Fields </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 1063, 1070 [275 Cal.Rptr. 384, 800 P.2d 862].) Thus, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Shattuck </em>(1895) 109 Cal. 673 [42 P. 315], where a defense medical expert testified the defendant\u2019s brain tumor had rendered her liable to become insane if she were greatly excited, the trial court was found to have erred by precluding the expert from giving a clinical history of the case because that history had come from the defendant herself. Noting the expert had testified it was \u201c \u2018necessary to refer to [her] previous condition in order to explain why I treated her, and why I came to the conclusion,\u2019 \u201d our Supreme Court held: \u201cSuch declarations and statements, when they constitute in part the basis upon which the opinion of an expert is based, and are by him declared to be necessary to enable him to form an opinion as to the nature of the disease, are admissible. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 678-679.) Here, the extrajudicial witness statements relayed to Chinwah by the coroner\u2019s investigator constituted factual information that Chinwah relied on in reaching his \u201cofficial conclusion\u201d about the manner of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Hence, we conclude the extrajudicial statements Chinwah relied on in reaching his \u201chomicide\u201d determination did not qualify as testimonial because they failed both the formality and the primary purpose tests. That is, we conclude there was no confrontation clause violation under either the <em>Williams </em>plurality or Justice Thomas\u2019s <em>Williams </em>concurrence. Certainly the extrajudicial statements of the coroner\u2019s investigator would not qualify under Justice Thomas\u2019s \u201cformality\u201d test because they were \u201cnot the product of any sort of formalized dialogue resembling custodial interrogation.\u201d <em>(Williams v. Illinois, supra, </em>567 U.S. at p. _ [132 S.Ct. at p. 2260] (conc. opn. of Thomas, J.).) Indeed, those statements were apparently gleaned from a very informal interview process conducted by the coroner\u2019s investigator. And given Dungo\u2019s conclusion that criminal investigation is not the primary purpose for preparing an autopsy report, the disputed evidence here would also fail the plurality\u2019s \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">There was no <em>Crawford </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>(2) <em>Any </em>Crawford <em>error was harmless.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Moreover, even assuming arguendo there was <em>Crawford </em>error, we conclude the error was undoubtedly harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Pearson </em>(2013) 56 Cal.4th 393 [154 Cal.Rptr.3d 541, 297 P.3d 793], our Supreme Court resolved a <em>Crawford </em>autopsy report issue by skirting the substantive constitutional claim because it was apparent any error was harmless: \u201c[W]e need not decide whether, following our decision in <em>Dungo, </em>the evidence here is testimonial because any error in the admission of the autopsy reports and Dr. Peterson\u2019s testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

That is to say, the issue is \u201cwhether the . . . verdict actually rendered in this trial was surely unattributable to the error.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v.

The manner of death is homicide, [f] He told us he had five choices, one of them being accident. And he chose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>homicide. [][] And [defense] counsel cross-examined him pretty extensively on that. He said it took massive force to create this amount of injury. The various scenario [s] and sort of hypotheticals that the defense attorney tried to give do not correspond to the injuries the doctor saw. [f] The information he received from the coroner\u2019s investigator was so convincing and compatible with the findings. I\u2019m not telling you to convict her of murder because the coroner said it\u2019s homicide, but it\u2019s something you should take into consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">But this entire argument took up barely half a page of reporter\u2019s transcript out of a total prosecution closing argument of about 35 pages. And, as the Attorney General points out, \u201cthe prosecutor specifically argued to the jury that it could <em>not </em>convict appellant of murder just because Dr. Chinwah said it was homicide.\u201d (Italics added.) We find this single, fleeting reference to the matter during closing argument to have been inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Contrary to Mercado\u2019s assertion, Chinwah did not actually vouch for the eyewitnesses\u2019 credibility. Indeed, he testified he had no idea whom the investigator had interviewed. Mercado argues Chinwah vouched for their credibility when he testified, \u201cthe information that I got was so convincing and compatible to the finding that all the other information to me would be, maybe making up a story.\u201d But this suggestion, that Chinwah\u2019s use of the word \u201cstory\u201d somehow demonstrates he was automatically prepared to denigrate any contrary information, is meritless. Chinwah also described the information he received from the coroner\u2019s investigator as \u201cthe original <em>story </em>on this thing here.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Moreover, given Chinwah\u2019s acknowledgment that his <em>cause of death </em>finding was compatible with the <em>manner of death </em>having been either homicide or accident, and that he did not actually know whether the driver had intentionally hit the baby\u2019s mother, awareness of the extrajudicial statements could not have affected the jury\u2019s verdict. As Mercado herself acknowledges: \u201cThis hearsay formed the sole basis of Chinwah\u2019s opinion that the manner of death was homicide. (Dr. Chinwah acknowledges that the skull fracture suggesting blunt force trauma could have been caused either by an intentional striking of Davis with the vehicle, or by an accidental striking of Davis with the vehicle.) As <em>a matter of common sense and logic as well, it is implausible that an autopsy could reveal whether the defendant had accidentally or deliberately struck a person with her </em>vehicle.\u201d (Italics added.) Regardless of whether Mercado\u2019s final assertion would hold true in every conceivable situation, we agree it was certainly true in this case that the jury would have realized the autopsy procedure was not going to answer the question whether she ran over Davis intentionally or accidentally.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>What did answer that question was the overwhelming evidence showing Mercado intentionally struck Davis with her car. Waller\u2019s initial trial testimony was a transparent attempt to exculpate Mercado for personal reasons. By the end of his testimony, Waller acknowledged he had heard Mercado threaten to kill Davis just prior to driving the Range Rover right toward her, and that it was clear Mercado had struck Davis intentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">But the most damning testimony probably came from the two entirely independent eyewitnesses. Bruce Cotton testified he saw Mercado turn around, head back toward Davis and stop right in front of her. He saw Davis put her hand on the hood of the car and he heard Waller yell, \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t do it. Stop, don\u2019t do it.\u201d Mercado then \u201chit the accelerator\u201d and rolled slowly over Davis. The car did not swerve or brake. Jai Gilyard testified she heard someone in the car, a person who logically could only have been Mercado, say: \u201cIf you don\u2019t get from in front of my car, I\u2019m going to run you over.\u201d The witness statements collected by the coroner\u2019s investigator at most merely corroborated the testimony of Cotton and Gilyard.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In addition, there was evidence of a long feud between Mercado and Davis over Waller\u2019s affections, and evidence that once before, in January 2009, Mercado had tried to run down Davis but she managed to jump out of the way because Waller yelled out a warning. There was also evidence of Mercado\u2019s past violent conduct in connection with Waller\u2019s other girlfriends, which included a November 2007 incident in which Mercado tried to drive a car into Saraya Hollis.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">In the face of this overwhelming evidence of Mercado\u2019s guilt, the exclusion of Dr. Chinwah\u2019s testimony, that he concluded the baby\u2019s \u201cmanner of death\u201d had been homicide based on information received from the coroner\u2019s investigator, would not have changed the verdict.

Because we have found at most one possible error, her claim of cumulative error fails. (See <em>People v.
