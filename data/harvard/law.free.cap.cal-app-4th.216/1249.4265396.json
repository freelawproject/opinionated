(Brisbane), appeals from a summary judgment entered in favor of respondents Webcor Builders, Inc., and Webcor Builders (collectively, Webcor). The construction contract executed by the parties included a clause which provided that all causes of action relating to the contract work would accrue from the date of substantial completion of the project. This contract provision clearly and unambiguously abrogated the so-called delayed discovery rule, which would otherwise delay accrual of a cause of action for latent construction defects until the defects were, or could have been, discovered. The trial court concluded the clause was valid and enforceable, noting that the agreement \u201cwas one between sophisticated parties seeking to define the contours of their liability.\u201d Summary judgment was then granted for Webcor after finding that Brisbane\u2019s action for latent construction defects was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-13\">In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude that public policy principles applicable to the freedom to contract afford sophisticated contracting parties the right to abrogate the delayed discovery rule by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>agreement. Under the clear language of the parties\u2019 contract, Brisbane\u2019s action was untimely. The time for bringing Brisbane\u2019s claims against Webcor started to run upon substantial completion of the project, and Brisbane\u2019s lawsuit was brought more than four years after the agreed-upon accrual date, which was outside the applicable limitations period. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 337, 337.1.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">In the nonpublished portion of the opinion, we consider Brisbane\u2019s alternative arguments: (1) the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the disputed clause was in direct conflict with other provisions of the contract; (2) Webcor\u2019s acceptance of responsibility for mating repairs to its defective work more than four years after substantial completion of the project raised a triable issue of fact .as to whether Webcor itself believed that the parties had not waived the delayed discovery rule; (3) even if the delayed discovery rule was abrogated by contract, Webcor\u2019s postcompletion conduct indicated it waived its right to rely on this provision; and (4) a new statute of limitations period began from the point in time when Webcor participated in making repairs after the project had been completed. We reject these alternative arguments as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">On July 12, 1999, Brisbane and Webcor entered into a contract for the design and construction of a 210-room, eight-story hotel, to be known as the Sierra Pointe Radisson Hotel (the Radisson). Before execution, the agreement had been extensively negotiated between the parties. For example, on March 8, 1999, Brisbane wrote to Webcor: \u201cIt is understood and agreed that negotiation of contract documents and satisfaction of customary closing conditions and due diligence must be satisfactory in form and substance to the parties and their respective counsel.\u201d Revisions were made by both parties to early contract drafts by striking out unacceptable provisions and by inserting additional terms. The form of agreement with \u201cmutually acceptable language\u201d was approved by Brisbane.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-8\">The final contract contained the 1997 American Institute of Architects (AIA) \u201cStandard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Contractor (Cost Plus Fee), the AIA Document A201 General Conditions\u201d (AIA A201), and several attachments relating to design requirements, construction allowances, the \u201cRadisson Hotel Design Standards,\u201d and standard specifications required by Brisbane\u2019s parent company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>One of the provisions of the AIA A201 addressed the commencement of the statutory limitations period for work completed prior to substantial completion of the project:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-5\">\u201c13.7 Commencement of Statutory Limitation Period</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-6\">\u201c13.7.1 As between the Owner and Contractor:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1075-7\">\u201c.1 Before Substantial Completion. As to acts or failures to act occurring prior to the relevant date of Substantial Completion, any applicable statute of limitations shall commence to run and any alleged cause of action shall be deemed to have accrued in any and all events not later than such date of Substantial Completion . . . .\u201d (AJA A201, Art. 13.7.1.1, original boldface, capitalization omitted (Article 13.7.1.1).)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">It is undisputed that the Radisson was substantially completed on July 31, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-10\">In early 2005, Brisbane learned that there was a kitchen sewer line break which caused waste to flow under the Radisson. It notified Webcor of the problem and undertook temporary repairs to address the issue. By late March 2005, Webcor visited the site. It determined that the plumbing problem was a latent defect, and that Therma Corporation (Therma), the plumbing contractor, was responsible for the problem. Therma made repairs to the kitchen sewer line in July 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-11\">About two years later, additional problems with the plumbing system arose. In October 2007, Brisbane again informed Webcor and Therma of the situation. Both Webcor and Therma returned to the Radisson to inspect the problem. Webcor thereafter notified Brisbane that it preferred to have Therma perform the necessary exploratory work to identify the source of the leakage in the kitchen sewer system. Therma did not make repairs, but did run a camera through a different portion of the kitchen drainage pipe. The camera fell out of the pipe, indicating the pipe had become disconnected. Therma failed to provide this information to Brisbane. In January 2008, Webcor notified Brisbane that both Webcor and Therma considered the issue closed. Brisbane took issue with that statement and responded that the matter \u201cis certainly not closed.\u201d Ultimately, Brisbane discovered, among other things, that Therma had used ABS pipe material rather than cast iron pipe for the sewer line, in violation of the Uniform Plumbing Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-12\">In May 2008, Brisbane filed a complaint against Webcor for breach of contract, negligence, and breach of implied and express warranties. Webcor moved for summary judgment contending that the action was barred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>Article 13.7.1.1. It argued that, pursuant to that provision, the statute of limitations for Brisbane\u2019s causes of action began to mn on the date of substantial completion. Brisbane opposed the motion, contending (1) it had never agreed to waive its right to sue for latent defects; (2) Article 13.7.1.1 was too vague to be interpreted as a waiver of the provisions of section 337.15, which sets a maximum 10-year period to sue for latent defects; and (3) a clause purporting to abrogate the discovery rule would be against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">The trial court ruled as a matter of law that Article 13.7.1.1 clearly and unambiguously abrogated the delayed discovery rule and the provisions of section 337.15 which apply to claims arising out of latent construction defects. Under Article 13.7.1.1, the latest date upon which Brisbane could have commenced suit on its claims against Webcor was July 31, 2004, four years after substantial completion of the project (\u00a7\u00a7 337, 337.1). Brisbane commenced its action on May 27, 2008, nearly four years later, making Brisbane\u2019s action untimely as a matter of law, and subject to dismissal on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">HI.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">A. <em>Standards of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1076-8\">We review a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>(Dore </em>v. <em>Arnold Worldwide, Inc. </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 384, 388-389 [46 Cal.Rptr.3d 668, 139 P.3d 56].) \u201cIn performing our de novo review, we must view the evidence in a light favorable to [the] plaintiff as the losing party [citation], liberally construing [its] evidentiary submission while strictly scrutinizing [the] defendant\u2019s] own showing, and resolving any evidentiary doubts or ambiguities in [the] plaintiff\u2019s favor.

Moreover, the question of whether a contract provision is illegal or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>contrary to public policy \u201cis a question of law to be determined from the circumstances of each particular case.

Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Actions, \u00a7 493, p. 633.) To ameliorate the harsh effects of that mle, a number of exceptions have developed by statute and judicial decision, \u201c[t]he most important\u201d one being the delayed discovery rule. (3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Actions, \u00a7 497, p. 635; see <em>Norgart </em>v. <em>Upjohn Co. </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 383, 397 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 453, 981 P.2d 79].) A cause of action accrues under the discovery rule when the \u201c \u2018plaintiff either (1) actually discovered his injury and its negligent cause or (2) could have discovered injury and cause through the exercise of reasonable diligence . . . .\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Leaf v. City of San Mateo </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 398, 407 [163 Cal.Rptr. 711], italics omitted <em>(Leaf).) </em>The delayed discovery rule has been applied in \u201ccases where it is manifestly unjust to deprive plaintiffs of a cause of action before they are aware that they have been injured.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 406-407.) The rule protects a plaintiff who is \u201c \u2018blamelessly ignorant\u2019 \u201d of his cause of action. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 408.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-8\">\u201cThis discovery rule takes into account the policy of deciding cases on the merits as well as the policies underlying the statute of limitations (to prevent stale claims and to require diligent prosecution). \u2018Because a plaintiff is under a duty to reasonably investigate and because a <em>suspicion </em>of wrongdoing, coupled with a knowledge of the harm and its cause, will commence the limitations period, suits are not likely to be unreasonably delayed, and those failing to act with reasonable dispatch will be barred. At the same time, plaintiffs who file suit as soon as they have reason to believe that they are entitled to recourse will not be precluded.\u2019 [Citation].\u201d <em>(Goldrich v.

[Citation.] This statute provides that recovery for death, injury, or damage caused by a <em>\u2018patent </em>deficiency\u2019 (\u00a7 337.1, subd. (a), italics added) in the design, supervision, or construction of an improvement to realty must be sought within <em>four </em>years after substantial completion of the improvement.

However, under section 337.1, the building industry remained liable indefinitely for undiscovered defects. (31 Cal.4th at p. 375.) In 1971, the Legislature enacted section 337.15, placing an outside 10-year limit on actions arising out of latent construction defects. <em>(Lantzy, </em>at pp. 375-377.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">\u201c[F]aced with a developing body of common law on the subject, [the Legislature] carefully considered how to provide a fair time to discover construction defects, . . . while still protecting a vital industry from the damaging consequences of indefinite liability exposure. For latent deficiencies, the lawmakers rejected shorter periods in favor of a limit in the upper range of those previously adopted by other jurisdictions.\u201d <em>(Lantzy, supra, </em>31 Cal.4th at p. 377.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">In relevant part, section 337.15 provides: \u201c(a) No action may be brought to recover damages from any person .. . who develops real property or performs or furnishes the design, specifications, surveying, planning, supervision, testing, or observation of construction or construction of an improvement to real property more than 10 years after the substantial completion of the development or improvement for any of the following: [][] (1) Any latent deficiency in the design, specification, surveying, planning, supervision, or observation of construction or construction of an improvement to, or survey of, real property. [][] (2) Injury to property . . . arising out of any such latent deficiency. [][] (b) As used in this section, \u2018latent deficiency\u2019 means a deficiency which is not apparent by reasonable inspection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">Section 337.15 is an \u201cordinary, procedural statute of limitation[s],\u201d and when read together with sections 337 and 338, \u201c[it] enacts ... a two-step limitation: actions founded upon a latent defect in the development of real property must be filed within three or four years of discovery, depending on whether the action rests on breach of warranty or negligence, but in any case within ten years of the date of substantial completion of the improvement.\u201d <em>(Regents of University of California v.

It has been recognized that \u201c[f]or the construction industry the standard form contract\u2014particularly the AIA Standard Document set\u2014has in several respects served as a surrogate for a commercial code. The ALA contract developed gradually over the generations in company with an expanding body of experience in the field and in the courts, and was adopted verbatim, adapted, or parroted in a vast percentage (perhaps the majority) of private commercial contracts. It offers industry actors a degree of coherence, certainty and uniformity. Depending on one\u2019s point of view, it may also serve as a backdrop for performance which more or less reflects commercial realities and competing participant concerns.\u201d (Stipanowich, <em>Reconstructing Construction Law: Reality and Reform in a Transactional System </em>(1998) Wis. L.Rev. 463, 485.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">While the enforceability of the 1997 AIA standard contract\u2019s accrual waiver presents a question of first impression in California, numerous out-of-state authorities have examined this same clause and without exception have concluded the provision altered the normal rules governing accrual of causes of action, including the delayed discovery rule, and was valid and enforceable. (See, e.g., <em>Old Mason\u2019s Home v. Mitchell </em>(Ky.Ct.App. 1995) 892 S.W.2d 304, 305-307; <em>College of Notre Dame v. Morabito </em>(2000) 132 Md.App. 158 [752 A.2d 265, 271-276]; <em>Northridge Homes, Inc. v. John W. French &amp; Associates, Inc. </em>(Mass.Super.Ct. 1999) 10 Mass.L.Rptr. 690 [1999 WL 1260285]; <em>Oriskany Central School Dist. v. Edmund J. Booth Architects </em>(N.Y.App.Div. 1994) 206 A.D.2d 896 [615 N.Y.S.2d 160], affd. (1995) 85 N.Y.2d 995 [630 N.Y.S.2d 960, 654 N.E.2d 1208]; <em>Gustine Uniontown v. Anthony Crane Rental (2006) 2006 </em>PASuper 12 [892 A.2d 830, 836-837].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">The reasoning of these out-of-state cases is fairly consistent and is ably represented by <em>Harbor Court Associates v. Leo A. Daly Co. </em>(4th Cir. 1999) 179 F.3d 147 <em>(Harbor). </em>That case involved a lawsuit by the developer of a condominium tower, office building, hotel, health club, and parking garage against the project\u2019s architect for tort and breach of contract claims alleging defective design work by the architect. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 148.) The court, applying Maryland law, enforced a contractual provision which specified that a cause of action between the owner and contractor commenced to run upon substantial completion of the work in accordance with the applicable statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>limitations. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court observed that Maryland, like California, had adopted the delayed discovery rule for purposes of establishing an accrual date \u201cto relieve the \u2018blamelessly ignorant,\u2019 [citation], of the \u2018often harsh and unjust results which flow from [such] a rigid application of the statute of limitations.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 150.) However, the federal appeals court noted that neither the courts nor the Legislature of Maryland had ever stated that the discovery rule could not be waived by contract. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">The <em>Harbor </em>court observed that Maryland had expressed \u201cconsiderable reluctance to strike down voluntary bargains on public policy grounds.\u201d <em>(Harbor, supra, </em>179 F.3d at p. 150.) Therefore, \u201c[i]n light of this established judicial commitment to protecting individuals\u2019 efforts to structure their own affairs through contract, we cannot conclude that the Maryland Court of Appeals would decline to allow parties to contract around the state\u2019s default rule establishing the date on which a relevant statute of limitations begins to run. This is especially true where, as here, the parties to the agreement are <em>sophisticated business actors who sought, by contract, to allocate business risks in advance. </em>That is, rather than rely on the \u2018discovery rule,\u2019 which prolongs the parties\u2019 uncertainty whether or if a cause of action will lie, the parties to this contract sought to limit that period of uncertainty by mutual agreement to a different accrual date.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 150-151, italics added.) In concluding that Maryland law would allow the parties to waive the delayed discovery rule by contract, it noted that all other states which had addressed the precise issue, including Kentucky, New York, and Wisconsin, had similarly allowed the delayed discovery rule to be waived or modified by contract. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">Although we are not bound to follow these out-of-state authorities, they reflect a broad consensus as to the proper interpretation of the AIA standard agreement\u2019s accrual provision under circumstances identical to the circumstances present in this case\u2014that is, where the provision was freely entered into by parties represented by legal counsel, engaged in a sophisticated commercial construction project.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">Since latent defects in construction are usually the types of defects an owner may not learn about until years after completion, litigation often results over exactly when the owner discovered, or should have discovered, the defect. (See, e.g., <em>Creekridge Townhome Owners Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>C. Scott Whitten, Inc. </em>(2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 251, 257-259 [99 Cal.Rptr.3d 258]; <em>Renown, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hensel Phelps Construction Co. </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 413, 420-421 [201 Cal.Rptr. 242]; <em>Leaf, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.3d at pp. 407-408.) By tying the running of the applicable statute of limitations to a date certain, the parties here negotiated to avoid the uncertainty surrounding the discovery rule for the security of knowing the date beyond which they would no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>be exposed to potential liability. Like the out-of-state courts that have considered this provision, we conclude that sophisticated parties should be allowed to strike their own bargains and knowingly and voluntarily contract in a manner in which certain risks are eliminated and, concomitantly, rights are relinquished.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">3. <em>Is the Accrual Provision Adopted by the Parties Void as Against California Public Policy?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Notwithstanding the consistent line of out-of-state authorities enforcing the contract provision adopted by the parties here, Brisbane argues that the contract provision should not be enforced because it violates California\u2019s public policy. Specifically, Brisbane argues Article 13.7.1.1 is void as against public policy because it \u201cserved to preclude Brisbane from relying on the delayed discovery doctrine in pursuing its claims for the latent defects in Webcor\u2019s work that did not manifest themselves until years after the construction project was complete.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">In advancing this argument, Brisbane assumes a heavy burden. A party seeking to avoid enforcement of a contract on public policy grounds has the burden \u201c ' \u201c \u2018to show that its enforcement would be in violation of the settled public policy of this state, or injurious to the morals of its people.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Bovard </em>v. <em>American Horse Enterprises, Inc. </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 832, 839 [247 Cal.Rptr. 340].) Courts have been cautious not to \u201c \u2018 \u201cblithely apply[] public policy reasons to nullify otherwise enforceable contracts.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Dunkin v. Boskey </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 171, 183-184 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 44] <em>(Dunkin); </em>see <em>VL Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>Unisen, Inc. </em>(2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 708, 713 [61 Cal.Rptr.3d 818].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">While Brisbane argues \u201cthe delayed discovery doctrine has been long recognized under California law as being necessary to further California public policy,\u201d it offers little insight into exactly which public policies would be violated by enforcement of Article 13.7.1.1 under the facts and circumstances here. Indeed, the delayed discovery rule has most often been described as an equitable doctrine designed to achieve substantial justice in situations where one party has an unfair advantage and it would be inequitable to deprive \u201c \u2018an \u201cotherwise diligent\u201d plaintiff in discovering his cause of action.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Bernson v.

Arcadia Unified School Dist. </em>(2009) 172 Cal.App.4th 1229, 1241 [92 Cal.Rptr.3d 1] [\u201c[c]ourts equitably may apply the delayed discovery doctrine to a cause of action arising out of childhood sexual abuse\u201d].) It is normally applied in situations where there is a \u201cfiduciary, confidential or privileged relationship\u201d\u2014basically, where individuals hold \u201cthemselves out as having a special skill, or are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>required by statute to possess a certain level of skill\u201d and it is manifestly unfair to deprive the plaintiffs of their cause of action before they are aware that they have been injured. <em>(Moreno v. Sanchez </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 1415, 1424 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 684] (Moreno); <em>Leaf, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.3d at pp. 406-407.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Further undercutting Brisbane\u2019s assertion that Article 13.7.1.1 is void as against public policy is our Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion, stated almost a century ago, that \u201cstatutes [of limitations] are regarded as statutes of repose, carrying with them, not a right protected under the rule of public policy, but a mere personal right for the benefit of the individual, which may be waived. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Tebbets </em>v. <em>Fidelity and Casualty Co. </em>(1909) 155 Cal. 137, 139 [99 R 501]; accord, <em>Hambrecht &amp; Quist Venture Partners v. American Medical Internal, Inc. </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1532, 1548 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 33] <em>(Hambrecht).)</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">Similarly, the California Legislature itself has expressly recognized that statutory limitations periods are not imbued with any element of nonwaivable \u201cpublic policy,\u201d and that private agreements waiving a defense based on the statutes of limitations are valid and enforceable. For example, section 360.5 specifically allows statutes of limitations generally to be waived by written agreement. By enacting this statute, the Legislature has recognized that parties have a contractual right to opt out of the statutorily mandated limitations periods. (See <em>Cowan </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 367, 372 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 458, 926 P.2d 438] [permitting criminal defendant to waive statute of limitations].) Additionally, California courts have overwhelmingly granted contracting parties substantial freedom to <em>shorten </em>an otherwise applicable statute of limitations, so long as the time allowed is reasonable. (See, e.g., <em>Hambrecht, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1547-1548 [noting California\u2019s broad rule allowing waiver and citing cases upholding the shortening of the four-year statute of limitations governing breach of a written contract to as little as three months].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">The foregoing legal authorities reflect the broader, long-standing established public policy in California which respects and promotes the freedom of private parties to contract. <em>(Carma Developers (Cal.), Inc. v. Marathon Development California, Inc. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 342, 363 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>826 P.2d 710], quoting <em>In re Garcelon </em>(1894) 104 Cal. 570, 591 [38 P. 414] [public policy requires \u201c ' \u201cthat men of full age and competent understanding shall have the utmost liberty of contract, and that their contracts when entered into freely and voluntarily shall be held sacred, and shall be enforced by courts of justice\u201d \u2019 \u201d].) Parties represented by counsel have even been allowed to waive the protection of Civil Code section 1542, thereby giving up the right to bring suit on unknown or unsuspected claims at the time the contract is executed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See, e.g., <em>Winet v. Price </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 1159, 1166-1169 [6 Cal.Rptr.2d 554] <em>(Winet); Salehi </em>v. <em>Surfside III Condominium Owners Assn. </em>(2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1146, 1160-1161 [132 Cal.Rptr.3d 886] <em>(Salehi) </em>[waiver of unknown claims extended to plumbing problems in condominium complex].) This is true even if the parties claim to have intended something else. (See <em>Salehi, </em>at p. 1159 [evidence of undisclosed subjective intent irrelevant to determining meaning of contractual language]; <em>Winet, </em>at p. 1167 [same].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Consequently, we disagree with Brisbane\u2019s position that public policy supports an ironclad, universal rule that in all cases involving latent defects, the applicable statute of limitations cannot begin to run until the defects were or should have been discovered, notwithstanding a contractual agreement to the contrary. Instead, we believe that where the parties are on equal footing and where there was considerable sophisticated give-and-take over the terms of the contract, those parties should be given the ability to enjoy the freedom of contract and to structure risk shifting as they see fit without judicial intervention. While Brisbane now decries the unfairness of a contract provision that may result in the loss of entitlement to sue for damages it did not discover in a timely fashion, this is precisely the arrangement to which it agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">We also point out that the Legislature itself has limited the scope and effect of the delayed discovery rule, even where it has not been waived by the parties. In enacting section 337.15, the Legislature provided that if damage is caused by a latent defect in construction, the claim must be brought no later than 10 years after the construction is substantially completed, <em>regardless of whether the plaintiff actually discovers the injury within the 10-year period. </em>(See <em>A &amp; B Painting &amp; Drywall, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 349, 355 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 418] [\u00a7 337.15 imposes an absolute 10-year bar \u201c <em>\u2018regardless of discovery\u2019 \u201d </em>(italics added)].) The parties herein, seeking to protect themselves \u201c \u2018from the damaging consequences of indefinite liability exposure,\u2019 \u201d simply agreed to shorten this 10-year period to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>a period equivalent to the applicable statute of limitations-\u2014in this case up to four years. <em>(Inco Development Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1014, 1021 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 872].) This is not unreasonable. (See, e.g., <em>Moreno, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at p. 1434 [four-year period to discover latent defects in order to allege causes of action against home inspector would be reasonable].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">We have been warned that the power of this court to void a contract provision as contravening public policy should be exercised only where the case is free from doubt. <em>(City of Santa Barbara v. Superior Court </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 747, <em>777, </em>fn. 53 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 527, 161 P.3d 1095]; <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Goldman </em>(2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 734, 746 [124 Cal.Rptr.3d 555].) This is not such a case. The equitable concerns underpinning the delayed discovery rule, even if supported by public policy, are simply not present here. There is no indication that Brisbane and Webcor had a unique confidential or fiduciary relationship in which Webcor undertook a duty to inform Brisbane of any vital information, relieving Brisbane of its normal duty of inquiry. Nor has Brisbane alleged that the parties\u2019 contract was induced by misrepresentations or undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">\u201c \u2018Before labeling a contract as being contrary to public policy, courts must carefully inquire into the nature of the conduct, the extent of public harm which may be involved, and the moral quality of the conduct of the parties in light of the prevailing standards of the community.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Dunkin, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at p. 183.) In considering the criteria specified in <em>Dunkin, </em>we can think of no public policy considerations that would protect a party such as Brisbane from enforcement of a fairly and honestly negotiated contract provision setting a reasonable fixed time period for discovery of latent construction defects. Consequently, this court has no difficulty concluding that the parties\u2019 decision to forego the potential uncertainty created by the delayed discovery rule in favor of an established accrual date does not rise to the level of being so contrary to public policy that it would trump the parties\u2019 freedom to contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">4. <em>This Contract Falls Outside the Reasoning Guiding the Court in </em>Moreno</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-7\">Brisbane calls our attention to <em>Moreno, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th 1415, a case in which the court refused to enforce contractual language that had the effect of not only shortening the limitations period, but also waiving the delayed discovery rule. Brisbane claims <em>Moreno </em>stands for the proposition that \u201ca contractual provision which purports to eliminate the delayed discovery doctrine is not enforceable.\u201d We do not believe <em>Moreno </em>can be so broadly interpreted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>In <em>Moreno, </em>a couple hired a home inspector to look at a home the couple was considering buying. <em>(Moreno, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at p. 1419.) Although Business and Professions Code section 7199 provides for a four-year limitations period accruing from the date of inspection, the parties\u2019 preprinted home inspection contract set forth a shortened one-year limitations period running from the date of inspection. <em>(Moreno, </em>at p. 1420.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-5\">After the buyers purchased the home, they became ill. <em>(Moreno, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at p. 1420.) An environmental evaluation of the house revealed that the air ducts in the home were insulated with asbestos. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1421.) In addition, an unsealed air return was discovered that permitted dust, dirt, and rust to enter the heating system. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Fourteen months after the inspection, the buyers sued the home inspector for breach of contract, negligence, and negligent misrepresentation. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The trial court sustained the home inspector\u2019s demurrer, based on the one-year limitation of actions provision in the home inspection contract. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">The appellate court reversed in a two-to-one decision. The court acknowledged the \u201c \u2018well-settled proposition of law that the parties to a contract may stipulate therein for a period of limitation, shorter than that fixed by the statute of limitations, and that such stipulation violates no principle of public policy, provided the period fixed be not so unreasonable as to show imposition or undue advantage in some way. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Moreno, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at p. 1430, fn. omitted.) Nevertheless, the court concluded that in order for a contractual agreement establishing an accrual date for lawsuits against home inspectors to be enforceable, a homeowner\u2019s cause of action against a home inspector cannot commence to run from the date of inspection (as provided by the Legislature when it enacted Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 7199), but instead, had to run from the date when the homeowner discovers, or with the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the breach. <em>(Moreno, </em>at pp. 1428-1429.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">The court based its ruling on the judicial concern for protection of homeowners, and the fact that the homeowners must rely on the greater expertise of home inspectors to discover latent defects in the home. The court stated that although the delayed discovery rule originated in cases involving the acts of licensed professionals, the rule may also be applied to tradespeople who hold themselves out as having a special skill, or who are required by statute to possess a certain level of skill. <em>(Moreno, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at p. 1424.) The court reasoned, \u201cAlthough not as regulated as some fields, the Legislature has recognized the significance of the role home inspectors occupy in this state\u2019s economy, as well as the potential hazards of fraudulently or negligently performed inspections. As with other forms of professional malpractice, specialized skill is required to analyze a residence\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>structural and component parts. Because of the hidden nature of these systems and components a potential homeowner may not see or recognize a home inspector\u2019s negligence, and thus may not understand he has been damaged until long after the inspection date.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1428, fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">The <em>Moreno </em>court believed that public policy required the application of the delayed discovery rule as a contractual requirement in all home inspection contracts. In the court\u2019s words: \u201c[CJauses of action for breach of a home inspector\u2019s duty of care should accrue in all cases, not on the date of the inspection, but when the homeowner discovers, or with the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered, the inspector\u2019s breach.\u201d <em>(Moreno, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1428-1429.) The court \u201cattached] no special significance\u201d to the fact that the Legislature itself did not provide for a rule of delayed discovery when it enacted Business and Professions Code section 7199, which set a maximum four-year outside limitations period for actions against home inspectors measured from the date of inspection. <em>(Moreno, </em>at p. 1430.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">While <em>Moreno </em>has been followed in subsequent cases,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we believe its analysis, even if correct, is inapplicable here, and does not compel the conclusion that Article 13.7.1.1 is void as against public policy. Significantly, \u201c \u2018[w]hether a contract is illegal or contrary to public policy is a question of law to be determined <em>from the circumstances of each particular cased </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Dunkin, supra, </em>82 Cal.App.4th at p. 183, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">Unlike the parties here, the plaintiffs in <em>Moreno </em>were persons unsophisticated in construction matters (indeed, that is why they hired the home inspector in the first place). The importance of the special relationship between the parties, where the home inspector was a professional in possession of special skills and knowledge upon whom the homeowners relied completely for counsel and advice, was emphasized throughout the court\u2019s opinion in <em>Moreno. </em>(See <em>Parsons v. Tickner </em>(1995) 31 Cal.App.4th 1513, 1526 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 810] [stressing \u201c \u2018importance of the relationship between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>defendant and plaintiff\u2019 \u201d in cases applying the discovery rule of accrual and noting that most involve confidential or fiduciary relationships].) By contrast, Brisbane and Webcor occupied positions of equal bargaining strength and both parties had the commercial and technical expertise to appreciate fully the ramifications of agreeing to a defined limitations period. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that both parties had the participation and advice of legal counsel during contract negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">Furthermore, unlike this case, <em>Moreno </em>involved a contract clause that not only waived the delayed discovery rule, but also reduced the statute of limitations from four years to one. In our case, Brisbane had the benefit of the full statute of limitations period, up to four years, to conduct any inspections believed necessary to uncover latent defects\u2014a period of time the <em>Moreno </em>court itself acknowledges would be reasonable. <em>(Moreno, supra, </em>106 Cal.App.4th at p. 1434.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">Lastly, we note that one court, <em>In re Brocade Communications Systems, Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 2009) 615 F.Supp.2d 1018 <em>(Brocade), </em>has found the reasoning in <em>Moreno </em>to be unpersuasive in circumstances similar to those presented here where \u201can agreement between sophisticated parties\u201d was entered into \u201cthat defines the contours of their liability.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1040.) The court distinguished <em>Moreno, </em>which \u201cmerely stands for the limited proposition that a cause of action may not accrue in a suit against a home inspector until the injury is discovered. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court believed <em>\u201cMoreno </em>simply cannot be extended far enough to relieve [the corporation] of the indemnification it agreed to provide . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>We find the reasoning of <em>Brocade </em>persuasive and agree that this distinction makes <em>Moreno </em>inapposite and inapplicable to control the result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">Therefore, based on our review of relevant case authorities, both in California and uniformly throughout the nation, we conclude that Article 13.7.1.1 of the Brisbane/Webcor contract was a valid, enforceable provision freely entered into by sophisticated parties engaging in a commercial construction project. Accordingly, the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment after finding that Brisbane\u2019s claims against Webcor were time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">5.-7.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">The judgment is affirmed.

On this \u00a1point, the court in <em>Hambrecht, supra, </em>38 Cal.App.4th at page 1548, footnote 16, noted: \u201cAlthough Tebbets\u2019s waiver analysis has withstood the test of time, subsequent Supreme Court cases have commented that the statutes of limitations do serve public policies.
