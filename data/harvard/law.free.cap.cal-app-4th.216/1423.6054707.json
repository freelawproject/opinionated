The restaurant closed after six months of operation and the parties filed lawsuits against each other. A jury ruled in favor of plaintiffs Julius Castle Restaurant, Inc. (JCRI), Charles Stinson, and John Bonjean on their claim of fraud. It also ruled in favor of defendants James Frederick Payne and Top of the Rock Castle, LLC (TOTRC), on their cross-complaint for breach of contract. Defendants have filed three consolidated appeals claiming that (1) the trial court committed prejudicial error in allowing plaintiffs to introduce parol evidence in support of their fraud claim, (2) the amount of damages awarded to them on their cross-complaint is insufficient, (3) the court erred in awarding damages to plaintiffs upon the termination of a preliminary injunction, and (4) the court erred in awarding attorney fees to plaintiffs. In light of the recent Supreme Court decision in <em>Riverisland Cold Storage, Inc. v. Fresno-Madera Production Credit Assn. </em>(2013) 55 Cal.4th 1169 [151 Cal.Rptr.3d 93, 291 P.3d 316] <em>(Riverisland), </em>we conclude the judgment for fraud must be affirmed. We also conclude the court erred in awarding damages with respect to the preliminary injunction. As to the claim of inadequate damages for breach of contract, defendants have failed to demonstrate error and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment on the cross-complaint. Finally, we affirm the award of attorney fees to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-8\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-9\">This lawsuit concerns a restaurant property known as \u201cJulius\u2019 Castle,\u201d an official historical landmark in the City and County of San Francisco (the City). Payne is the managing member of TOTRC. He purchased the property in June 2006. The restaurant that had been operating on the site closed shortly thereafter. Plaintiffs Stinson and Bonjean desired to reestablish the restaurant, planning to realize a profit at a later date by selling the business for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>approximately $1 million. According to their complaint, the two men are \u201cvery well qualified restaurateurs with well over 38 years of successful operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\">On April 20, 2007, Stinson and Bonjean (through JCRI), entered into a long-term lease (the Lease) with defendants. Section 10 of the Lease concerns the condition of the premises and provides: \u201cTenant acknowledges that as of the date of this Lease, Tenant has inspected the Premises and all improvements on the Premises and that the Premises and improvements are in good order, repair, and condition.\u201d Section 34 contains the agreement\u2019s integration clause and provides: \u201cThis instrument constitutes the sole agreement between Landlord and Tenant respecting the Premises, the leasing of the Premises to Tenant, and the specified lease term, and correctly sets forth the obligations of Landlord and Tenant. Any agreement or representations respecting the Premises or their leasing by Landlord to Tenant not expressly set forth in this instrument are void. This agreement, however, is to be read and interpreted in a manner consistent with the contract of Tenants with [TOTRC], entered into contemporaneously herewith, and through which Tenants are acquiring the fixtures, goodwill, website, liquor license, and trade name of Julius\u2019 Castle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">On May 3, 2007, JCRI entered into a bulk sales agreement (the BSA) with TOTRC for the purchase of all the restaurant\u2019s business assets, including its fixtures, equipment, trade name, leasehold improvements, and liquor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">On August 16, 2007, escrow closed on the BSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-8\">On November 21, 2007, Payne sent JCRI a notice of default. The notice alleged plaintiffs had failed to timely make installment payments on the BSA and had made unauthorized and improper deductions from one or more of the payments that had been made. Payne demanded immediate payment of the entire principal owing on the BSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-9\">On November 26, 2007, Payne sent Stinson and Bonjean a demand for guarantor\u2019s performance based on their personal guaranty of the Lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">On March 18, 2008, plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint (FAC) against defendants. The FAC alleges causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) breach of warranty, (3) fraudulent misrepresentation, (4) negligent misrepresentation, (5) fraudulent concealment, (6) rescission,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (7) fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>and deceit, (8) unfair business practices, (9) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, (10) injunctive relief, (11) intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (12) negligent infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The FAC alleges that both the Lease and the BSA omitted certain material facts, including that defendants had made substantial improvements to the property without having obtained the proper permits. It also alleges Payne had orally misrepresented that the facility was in good condition and falsely assured them that he would make it good if it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-4\">On April 3, 2008, defendants filed a cross-complaint against plaintiffs, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, declaratory relief, and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">On July 3, 2008, the trial court issued a preliminary injunction, restraining plaintiffs from selling, transferring, or disposing of the restaurant\u2019s liquor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">On September 30, 2009, defendants filed seven pretrial motions in limine. Motion in limine No. 2 sought to exclude the introduction of parol evidence. Defendants noted plaintiffs\u2019 claims for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation were based on the assertion that Payne had told them the property was in good condition. The FAC also alleges Payne assured them an inspection was not necessary, \u201c \u2018and guaranteed that he would fix anything that was not working or in proper running order.\u2019 \u201d Defendants claimed these alleged statements should be excluded because they contradict the terms of the parties\u2019 written agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-7\">On March 12, 2010, defendants filed a supplement to their motion in limine No. 2. In it, they argued the fraud exception to the parol evidence rule (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1856, subd. (g))<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cdoes not apply where parol evidence is offered to show a fraudulent promise directly at variance with the terms of the written agreement.\u201d They relied on <em>Bank of America etc. Assn. v. Pendergrass </em>(1935) 4 Cal.2d 258, 263 [48 P.2d 659] (Pendergrass).</p>\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">On March 30, 2010, the trial court denied in part and granted in part defendants\u2019 motion in limine No. 2. At the hearing, the court stated: \u201cWell, I think the jury can consider whether [plaintiffs] were, in fact, fraudulently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>induced to sign the Lease and the contract based on statements that are not part of the contract. And if they believe that the statements were made and if they believe that that\u2019s what fraudulently induced [plaintiffs] to sign the Lease and/or to sign the [BSA], then they may consider that, and for that limited purpose only.\u201d The court later clarified; \u201cStatements made which could be construed as fraud in the inducement to get them to sign the Lease and the [BSA] will be permitted for that limited purpose only, but not after the signing of either of those agreements, in which case it would clearly be an attempt to utilize parol evidence to modify the terms of the written contract.\u201d Thereafter, defendants asked the court to give a limiting instruction stating that this evidence could be considered only as to plaintiffs\u2019 claim that they were fraudulently induced into executing the contracts, and not for any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">I. <em>The Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">A. <em>The Decision to Lease Julius\u2019 Castle</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">At the time of trial, Stinson had been in the restaurant business for over 35 years as the owner and operator of Sinbad\u2019s Pier Two restaurant in the City. He had also recently opened a restaurant and yogurt shop in Hayward. Bonjean had worked at Sinbad\u2019s for many years. Payne was a casual customer of Sinbad\u2019s for at least 10 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-8\">One evening, Payne came to Sinbad\u2019s and told Stinson and Bonjean that he had purchased the Julius\u2019 Castle restaurant and had made extensive renovations to the property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The restaurant is located on Telegraph Hill and has been in existence since the early 1920\u2019s. It is a destination location, often used for special occasions. Stinson and Bonjean expressed interest, and Payne asked them to look at the property and decide if they wanted to take part in reopening the restaurant, which had been closed for about nine months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-9\">Subsequently, the parties did a walk-through tour of Julius\u2019 Castle. They went through each floor of the building, and Payne explained some of the improvements he had made. In the kitchen area, all of the equipment had been cleaned and appeared to be in good condition, though nothing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>operating at the time. Payne testified he assumed everything worked because the former owner, who had operated the restaurant, did not say that anything was wrong.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-4\">Because the restaurant had been closed for almost a year, Stinson was concerned as to whether the equipment and the plumbing were in working order. He testified Payne assured him that everything worked. Payne also said if anything was not working, he would fix it. He told Stinson and Bonjean that he had spent about $600,000 on building renovations. They did not test the equipment because they \u201ctook Mr. Payne for his word that if anything is not working he would fix it.\u201d Additionally, it appeared all the utilities were turned off, making it impossible to test the equipment under realistic working conditions. They depended on and accepted Payne\u2019s verbal commitment, that he would make everything workable. They did not ask for an opportunity to test the equipment, nor did they hire a third party to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-5\">Payne denied telling Stinson and Bonjean that he would repair the equipment or fix anything else on the premises. He did not guarantee the equipment\u2019s condition. He did say the equipment was in full operation when he bought the property. They did not ask to test anything in the kitchen. The utilities were turned on at that time, and he would have been willing to provide them access to any part of the premises for inspections or testing. They also never said they intended to sell the restaurant at any point. Had he known this, he would not have gone forward with the Lease. Prior to signing the Lease, Payne did not know he could be cited by the City\u2019s planning department (the Department) for his renovation work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-6\">B. <em>The Parties Negotiate the Lease and the BSA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1144-7\">The parties entered into extensive negotiations for the' Lease and for the purchase of the restaurant\u2019s assets. Bonjean testified, \u201cNobody wants to go into business without a lease. It\u2019s very important.\u201d Stinson and Bonjean worked with Gordon Wong, who was Payne\u2019s broker and executor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They expressed their concerns about the equipment to Wong: \u201cWe mentioned that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1431\">*1431</page-number>to him many times, because you can\u2019t operate any type of a specialty restaurant business unless you have equipment that\u2019s workable. Whenever there\u2019s downtime and something breaks, something has to be fixed, it\u2019s not only expensive, but you cannot fulfill your obligation to your customer.\u201d Wong reassured them that Payne would fix any major problems with the building and the equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-5\">The final version of the Lease was signed on April 20, 2007, after Stinson and Bonjean\u2019s Nevada corporation (JCRI) was finalized. They had approximately five to seven meetings with Wong before they signed the Lease. Wong would report their negotiations to Payne who would talk to his attorney, a process that resulted in numerous drafts. The drafts \u201cnever came back the way that we had agreed to in our conversation\u201d so the process was \u201ca back-and-forth type thing.\u201d With a few exceptions, the final Lease was in accordance with what they had discussed. Bonjean testified that the final version did not include a personal guaranty. The parties went through every page of the Lease together to ensure they were all satisfied with the document. They also made edits reflecting that Stinson and Bonjean were acting through their Nevada corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-6\">The BSA allowed JCRI to purchase the restaurant\u2019s assets from TOTRC, including the equipment, the liquor license, and the restaurant\u2019s Web site. The total payment for the BSA was $240,000, which Bonjean thought was a fair price.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Lease payment was set at $15,000 per month for 10 years, and the payments on the BSA were set at $10,000 a month. After signing the Lease, plaintiffs gave Payne a $25,000 check as a deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">On cross-examination, Bonjean stated the drafting of the Lease took several weeks. He and Stinson asked many questions so that they would feel confident and satisfied with the final version. They did not feel mshed. He acknowledged the Lease does not reflect Payne\u2019s alleged promise to fix anything that did not work. Bonjean never asked that such a provision be included. He also never asked for any changes to section 10 of the Lease, which states that he and Stinson had inspected the premises and improvements and found them to be in good order, repair, and condition. He agreed the provisions of the Lease pertaining to repairs and maintenance do not call for Payne to fix the equipment and improvements. He conceded having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>everything in working order is very important to operating a restaurant. He also acknowledged the Lease\u2019s integration clause states that any agreements or representations made outside of the written contract are void.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-4\">At trial, Stinson said he did not agree with the integration clause because there were \u201cimplied provisions\u201d that everything was in working order. When asked why he did not modify the Lease to reflect that Payne was going to maintain the equipment and the premises despite the contradictory language in the agreement, Stinson said it was not necessary because the obligation was already implied and Payne had already promised to make any needed repairs. Payne did fix some things prior to the close of escrow but stopped thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-5\">C. <em>The Restaurant Opens</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1146-6\">After the Lease was executed, plaintiffs took steps to get the restaurant running, such as putting in new carpet, planning for promotion, creating a menu and a wine list, hiring kitchen help, and purchasing inventory. About three months later, Bonjean received an inventory list of equipment and fixtures purchased through the BSA. They did not actually receive all of the items listed. For example, an espresso machine was missing, and a refrigerator had been misrepresented as a freezer, causing them to have to buy their own freezer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Meanwhile, they had continual problems operating much of the equipment, including the salamander (a type of broiler), the ovens, and the refrigerators.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Additionally, the phone system did not work properly because Payne had cut the cables during his renovations. The credit card machines broke down and employees had to run customers\u2019 cards by hand because of the faulty phone lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">In May 2007, Stinson received a fax from the Department that included a notice of violation. The violation related to alterations allegedly done without building permits or a certificate of appropriateness (Certificate), which was required because of the property\u2019s status as a historic landmark. On the day the restaurant opened it was granted a temporary health permit. The permit was conditioned on filing for a Certificate. Previously, Bonjean and Stinson had not known there were any permitting issues. They never received a regular health permit. Because Payne had made major changes to the building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>without having obtained a Certificate, Stinson believed the Department could have revoked the permit and closed the restaurant. However, they operated off the temporary health permit for several months, and no one from any public agency ever told them to shut the restaurant down or tried to interfere with its operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-5\">Reza Khoshnevisan, Payne\u2019s architectural consultant, testified that Payne received a conditional Certificate in December 2008. During the approval process, no one threatened to shut down the restaurant. A competent contractor could have completed the required alterations in two weeks to a month. He acknowledged that, considering the politics of doing construction in the City, it was both surprising and unwise for Payne to have made renovations to the premises without first obtaining permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-6\">After the restaurant was open for a few months, business \u201cshot up big\u201d and it performed almost twice as well as Stinson had anticipated.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He .and Bonjean decided to sell the restaurant sooner than they had planned. They entered into a contract to sell Julius\u2019 Castle through the BTI Group, a company specializing in restaurant sales. A business broker with the BTI Group tried to market the restaurant. He intended to sell it for between $500,000 and $1 million. No written offers were received. He had one interested buyer but the transaction did not progress because the buyer learned there was pending litigation, which could have interfered with transferability of the Lease to a new owner. At that point, BTI ceased its marketing efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-7\">According to Stinson, they were unable to market the restaurant because they misplaced their copy of the Lease. A flood downstairs at Julius\u2019 Castle had forced them to move their business records and they lost track of the document. When they received a copy of the Lease from Payne\u2019s attorney, Stinson was distressed because the document was a draft, and not the correct final version. The document also included a personal guaranty that Stinson and Bonjean had never signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-8\">A real estate agent specializing in retail leasing who testified on behalf of defendants stated that for a restaurant like Julius\u2019 Castle, she would expect the tenants to have set aside six months\u2019 worth of operating expenses. She would also expect prospective tenants to have an operating budget. Potential buyers of a restaurant would want to see a good long-term lease in addition to longevity and stability. They would also want to view profit-loss statements covering no less than two to three years. She had never seen a restaurant in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>the City that had been in operation for only eight months be successfully sold to a new buyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-4\">D. <em>Disputes Arise Between the Parties</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-5\">The parties soon had conflicts over repairs. In general, Payne was slow at making repairs, causing plaintiffs to spend their own money to keep the restaurant operational. For example, Bonjean had to hire someone to install temporary phone lines. They sent the bill for the installation to Payne because they felt it was his duty to fix the problem. Payne often refused to reimburse them for repairs. He also billed them for a plumbing problem involving a large pipe that had to be removed. At one point, Payne also locked Stinson and Bonjean out of an apartment on the property that they had planned to use as an office.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">According to Payne, Bonjean approached him several times to fix the equipment when Payne was working on unrelated projects in the building. It never appeared that Stinson and Bonjean had hired a maintenance person of their own. He did not believe he had an obligation to fix these problems, but he had workers with him at the time and it was not hard for him to provide assistance. He also wanted the restaurant to be successful. On July 10, 2007, he sent a letter to them stating that he would no longer undertake such repairs. They did not immediately object or assert that he had promised to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-7\">On October 24, 2007, Stinson sent a letter to Payne and his attorney complaining that Payne was neglecting his obligations to keep the building and the equipment in working order. Payne sent a letter in reply. He did not respond to Stinson\u2019s complaints. Instead, he told them they were in violation of a valet zoning permit. Around this time, he also sent a three-day notice to pay rent or quit when they were one day late on the rent. They paid the rent that month, including a $1,500 late charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-8\">Plaintiffs made the $10,000 monthly BSA payment in July, August and September of 2007. After September, they did not pay the full amount due. Instead, they reduced the amount by taking deductions for repair costs, paying just $3,418 in October, $800 in November, and $375 in December.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> They did not make any payment in January.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> At trial, Stinson could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1435\">*1435</page-number>recall all of the repairs that he relied on to justify the deductions he made from the BSA payments. One problem was that the ice machine never worked properly. Additionally, a walk-in refrigerator was never cold enough. They had to install new fans, motors, and condensers in the refrigerators. The salamander and the ovens also did not work. Payne said he would replace them in the first three months. He did bring in some new equipment, but \u201cslow rolled\u201d it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-5\">After Stinson and Bonjean started deducting money from their monthly payments, Payne asked his attorney to notify them that they were in default on the Lease and the BSA. He filed notices against them to pay or quit. They did not leave within the noticed periods, nor did they pay. He never filed an actual eviction lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">In November 2007, Payne sent plaintiffs a 10-day notice to pay or quit. The notice said they had defaulted on the payments owed under the BSA. At that point, Stinson told the BTI Group that they could not sell the restaurant. He also contacted an attorney to handle the notice. He and Bonjean left Julius\u2019 Castle in January 2008 after closing their affairs. In Stinson\u2019s view, they had been evicted. They did not make any payments in January 2008 because they had been evicted. Stinson informed their vendors that JCRI would be unable to make payments on its accounts due to an unlawful eviction and explained he would be filing a lawsuit to recoup the monies owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">On cross-examination, Stinson admitted he did not have a written business plan or a written budget when he started the restaurant. Initially, he and Bonjean each invested $25,000 in the restaurant, along with a $20,000 line of credit. They obtained a $100,000 loan shortly after the restaurant opened. They paid about half of that off before they closed the restaurant, at which point they stopped making payments. They also stopped paying sales taxes that were owed. He believed the restaurant made a profit just about every month it was in business. A document prepared by his bookkeeper showed gross sales increased from $25,757 in June 2007 to $190,445 in December 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">Bonjean testified that he had anticipated a profit of at least $500,000 upon the sale of the restaurant. When asked on cross-examination why he and Stinson didn\u2019t pay Payne the arrearages on the BSA payments so that they could realize the future profit from selling the business, Bonjean stated they did not have a concrete purchase offer at that time. Though the restaurant did very well in December 2007, they did not consider making good on the BSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1436\">*1436</page-number>payments because they were served with the eviction notice. The instant lawsuit was filed on December 5, 2007, before plaintiffs had vacated the premises.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">E. <em>Proceedings After Close of Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">The trial court granted defendants\u2019 motion for nonsuit on the claim for breach of warranty. The court denied their motion for nonsuit on the fraud claim, stating, \u201cthe parol evidence that\u2019s been adduced is admissible for the jury to consider on the issue of whether there was fraud in the inducement.\u201d Defendants proposed the following special jury instruction; \u201cYou may consider the alleged representations that James Payne would fix anything at the restaurant that did not work right only with respect to plaintiffs\u2019 claim that they were fraudulently induced into entering into the Lease and not for any other purpose or for any other claims made by the plaintiffs in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">During closing arguments, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel asserted her clients were not able to test the equipment before they entered into the Lease. Instead, Payne offered to repair anything that was not working. She argued he intentionally lulled them into complacency by fixing equipment until the BSA went through escrow, covering just enough time for the transaction to close. She claimed he knew the Department was investigating him when he first approached her clients and that he tricked them into opening the restaurant. Plaintiffs sought damages for the lost business opportunity of selling the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-7\">Defense counsel noted Payne\u2019s alleged promise to make repairs is not set forth in the agreements. Instead, the agreements place the burden on plaintiffs to maintain the premises and equipment. Additionally, he pointed out the Lease\u2019s integration clause states any promises not contained in the Lease are void. He argued the restaurant had failed because the business was undercapitalized. He further asserted that the deductions from the BSA were made because plaintiffs were running out of money, not because they were incurring repair expenses. He also claimed the Certificate was a nonissue, as the Department had not threatened to shut down the restaurant and had given Payne three years to \"return the building to its prior condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1437\">*1437</page-number>F. <em>Verdict</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1151-5\">The jury found against plaintiffs on their breach of contract claim, finding they had failed to substantially perform. It found in favor of them on the intentional misrepresentation claim, specifically finding that Payne had made a false representation of material fact, intending their reliance.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The jury also concluded they reasonably relied on the representations to their detriment. The jury also returned a verdict in favor of their negligent misrepresentation cause of action. Economic damages were set at $294,000.

Beydoun </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 336, 343 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 97, 83 P.3d 497] <em>(Casa Herrera).) </em>Under the rule, \u201cthe terms of a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement cannot be contradicted by evidence of either a prior agreement or a contemporaneous oral agreement.\u201d <em>(Singh v. Southland Stone, U.S.A., Inc. </em>(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 338, 352 [112 Cal.Rptr.3d 455].) The parol evidence rule is a long-standing, well-known principle that promotes fairness and predictability by encouraging parties to specify the entirety of their agreements in writing. The policy is \u201cbased on the assumption that written evidence is more accurate than human memory\u201d and \u201cthe fear that fraud or unintentional invention by witnesses interested in the outcome of the litigation will mislead the finder of facts.\u201d <em>(Masterson v. Sine </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 222, 227 [65 Cal.Rptr. 545, 436 P.2d 561].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">The parol evidence rule is not an evidentiary rule. <em>(Casa Herrera, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th 336, 343.) \u201cThus, \u2018[u]nder [the] rule[,] the act of executing a written contract. . . <em>supersedes </em>all the negotiations or stipulations concerning its matter which preceded or accompanied the execution of the instrument.\u2019 [Citation.] And \u2018[ejxtrinsic evidence cannot be admitted to prove what the agreement was, not for any of the usual reasons for exclusion of evidence, but because as a matter of law the agreement is the writing itself. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Such evidence is legally irrelevant and cannot support a judgment.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 344.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">We conclude the evidence of Payne\u2019s alleged guarantee as to the quality of the restaurant\u2019s equipment is inconsistent with the express representation in the Lease that plaintiffs had relied upon their own inspection in finding the premises and improvements to be in \u201cgood order, repair, and condition.\u201d Payne\u2019s alleged promise to repair any faulty equipment is also inconsistent in that it does not appear in the Lease or the BSA. Indeed, the Lease provides that the tenant agrees \u201cat Tenant\u2019s own expense, to keep the Premises ... in good condition and repair . . . .\u201d Under the Lease, Payne\u2019s repair obligation is limited to being responsible for \u201cmaintaining the roof and the structural integrity of the building premises.\u201d Further, the Lease provides that JCRI agreed to waive all statutory provisions or any other laws requiring Payne to maintain or repair the property or permitting JCRI to make needed repairs and deduct the repair costs from the rent. Payne\u2019s alleged oral statements are thus directly at variance with the terms of the Lease and the BSA. Accordingly, we agree with defendants that the contested oral statements constitute parol evidence. However, the recent Supreme Court decision in <em>Riverisland </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>overruling <em>Pendergrass, supra, 4 </em>Cal.2d 258 establishes that the evidence is admissible under the statutory exception for fraud found in section 1856, subdivision (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">II. <em>The Exception for Fraudulent Inducement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">\u201cSection 1856, subdivision (f) establishes a broad exception to the operation of the parol evidence rule: \u2018Where the validity of the agreement is the fact in dispute, this section does not exclude evidence relevant to that issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Riverisland; supra, </em>55 Cal.4th 1169, 1174.) Section 1856, subdivision (g), expressly states: \u201cThis section does not exclude other evidence . . . to establish illegality <em>or fraud.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) With respect to fraudulent inducement, \u201c \u2018It is . . . settled that parol evidence of fraudulent representations is admissible as an exception to the parol evidence rule to show that a contract was induced by fraud.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Pacific State Bank </em>v. <em>Greene </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 375, 389 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 739]; accord, <em>Edwards v. Centex Real Estate Corp. </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 15, 42 [61 Cal.Rptr.2d 518]; <em>Ron Greenspan Volkswagen, Inc. v. Ford Motor Land Development Corp. </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 985, 995 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 783].) Fraud in the inducement occurs \u201c \u2018when \u201c \u2018the promisor knows what he is signing but his consent is <em>induced </em>by fraud, mutual assent is present and a contract is formed, which, by reason of the fraud, is voidable.. ..\u2019 \u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pacific State Bank, supra, </em>at p. 389, fn. 7, quoting <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Great Western Fin. Securities Corp. </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 394, 415 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 875, 926 P.2d 1061].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">As noted above, at trial defendants relied on <em>Pendergrass, supra, 4 </em>Cal.2d 258, 263-264, in which the Supreme Court held that parol evidence is inadmissible to prove a fraudulent promis\u00e9 directly at variance with the terms of a written agreement. In that case, the court announced: \u201cOur conception of the rule which permits parol evidence of fraud to establish the invalidity of the instrument is that it must tend to establish some independent fact or representation, some fraud in the procurement of the instrument or some breach of confidence concerning its use, and <em>not a promise directly at variance with the promise of the writing.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 263, italics added.) One noted impact of the <em>Pendergrass </em>holding was that the parol evidence rule effectively immunized against liability for <em>both </em>prior and contemporaneous statements at variance with the written contract, and it implied that the alleged wrongdoer is innocent of fraud. <em>(Casa Herrera, supra, </em>32 Cal.4th 336, 347.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>In briefing this appeal, defendants also relied heavily on <em>Pendergrass. </em>After the parties submitted their briefs, but prior to oral argument, we asked them to submit letter briefs on the impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent <em>Riverisland </em>decision. Defendants argue that even under <em>Riverisland, </em>\u201cthe fraud exception to the parol evidence rule is not applied to agreements entered into by sophisticated parties after extensive negotiations.\u201d In support of their argument, they assert the Supreme Court relied on authorities holding forth a rule \u201cthat sophisticated parties can rarely invoke the fraud exception.\u201d While the court may have cited to authorities that discuss a potential exception for sophisticated parties, defendants\u2019 premise is unsupported by the language of the opinion itself. To the contrary, the court decisively overruled Pendergrass: \u201c[W]e conclude that <em>Pendergrass </em>was <em>an aberration. </em>It purported to follow section 1856 [citation], but its restriction on the fraud exception was inconsistent with the terms of the statute, and with settled case law as well.\u201d <em>(Riverisland, supra, </em>55 Cal.4th 1169, 1182, italics added.) In so concluding, the court reaffirmed \u201cthe venerable maxim stated in <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Koch </em>[(1928) 204 Cal. 342, 347 [268 P. 342]]: \u2018[I]t was never intended that the parol evidence rule should be used as a shield to prevent the proof of fraud.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Also <em>Pendergrass </em>\u201cdeparted from established California law at the time it was decided\u201d without acknowledging or justifying \u201cthe abrogation.\u201d (Riv<em>erisland, supra, </em>at p. 1172.) With such blunt language, the court did not shield sophisticated parties from the reach of its holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">Defendants also argue that <em>Riverisland </em>and the authorities it cites \u201crequire that the circumstances of each case and the bargaining power of [each party] be considered.\u201d Defendants also claim that \u201cinquiry into the relative sophistication of the parties is simple.\u201d Perhaps. In our view, however, our high court sought the opposite result, namely, to create certainty and consistency by eliminating altogether the judicially created exception to section 1856, subdivision (g). We also note that the plaintiffs in <em>Riverisland </em>appear to have been relatively sophisticated business people. While the defendant in that case was an established lender, the plaintiffs operated a corporation and thus had experience with business contracts. In light of these facts, distinguishing sophisticated business parties who should be barred from introducing parol evidence of fraud from those who should be permitted to introduce such evidence is not as simple as defendants suggest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">In the <em>post-Riverisland </em>world, parties would be better served in addressing the heightened burden of proving fraud in a civil action. Fraud demands specialized pleading. <em>(Small v. Fritz Companies, Inc. </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 167, 182 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 490, 65 P.3d 1255]; <em>Lazar v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>Cal.4th 631, 645 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 909 P.2d 981].) Credibility of the parties who negotiated the agreement and their relative bargaining positions will be assessed. Attention will now focus on the justifiable reliance element of fraud. <em>(Seeger v. Odell </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d409, 415 [115 P.2d 977, 136 A.L.R. 1291]; <em>Blankenheim v. E. F. Hutton &amp; Co. </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 1463, 1474 [266 Cal.Rptr. 593].) Among the questions to ask are: What are the plausible reasons for the alleged discrepancy between the claimed oral promises and the signed writing? Is there compatibility between the oral representations and the written document? What is the evidence relating to whether the document was read and considered before signing? (Sweet, <em>Promissory Fraud and the Parol Evidence Rule </em>(1961) 49 Calif. L.Rev. 877, 905.) Again, we decline to carve out an exception to the <em>Riverisland </em>holding that the court itself did not endorse.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">Finally, defendants note one of the justifications for the <em>Riverisland </em>decision was to avoid shielding fraudulent practices. They argue, however, that \u201cAlthough this is a valid concern, <em>Riverisland </em>is strong medicine and must be applied only when the circumstances call for it: with contracts of adhesion where there is a disparity in bargaining power.\u201d Again, the court did not limit its holding to contracts of adhesion and we decline to read such a limitation into the decision. Accordingly, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s overruling <em>Pendergrass, supra, 4 </em>Cal.2d 258 in <em>Riverisland, </em>we conclude the parol evidence was properly admitted at trial under the statutory exception for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">Our conclusion that parol evidence is admissible as to fraud claims involving sophisticated parties does not create any injustice. A party claiming fraud in the inducement is still required to prove they relied on the parol evidence and that their reliance was reasonable.  In the present case, the burden was on plaintiffs to prove that, notwithstanding both the Lease\u2019s integration clause and the \u201cas is\u201d language with respect to the restaurant equipment, they reasonably relied on Payne\u2019s prior oral assurances in entering into the agreements. The jury concluded they met this burden, and substantial evidence supports the jury\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">III.-VII.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">The judgments on the complaint and the cross-complaint are affirmed.
