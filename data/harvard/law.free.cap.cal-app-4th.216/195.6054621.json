Code, \u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> one count of assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury, and one count of simple assault (\u00a7 240), a lesser included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>offense. The jury found the weapons use allegations not true as to Maritza and Karina. The jury found true allegations that Chavez personally used a deadly weapon as to counts one, two, five and six.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">As to both Maritza and Karina, the trial court found unusual circumstances, suspended imposition of sentence, and placed them on five years\u2019 formal probation on the six felony counts and three years\u2019 informal probation on the misdemeanor count under specified terms and conditions, including county jail time.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Maritza contends there was insufficient evidence to support her convictions. Maritza also makes related arguments concerning two evidentiary rulings. She contends that the trial court erred prejudicially in admitting evidence of her lack of cooperation with the police, i.e., that she failed to keep at least one appointment or otherwise talk to the police about the charged offenses prior to her arrest. She further contends that the trial court erred in admitting evidence concerning the date of her arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Karina contends there was insufficient evidence to support her convictions on all but count three, the count in which she was found guilty of a lesser included misdemeanor simple assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude that Maritza has forfeited the argument that she invoked her right to remain silent by failing to object on that specific ground in the trial court. We further conclude that any error related to the admissibility of defendant\u2019s precustody/pre-Miranda silence <em>(Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602]) reflected by her failure to keep interview appointments with a police investigator was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude there was sufficient evidence to support defendants\u2019 convictions on the theory of aiding and abetting, and that any error concerning Maritza\u2019s arrest was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">The three defendants and others participated in the assault on six people when the victims returned to Sacramento after a birthday bus trip to a club in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>San Francisco. Although it was alleged that defendants personally used a deadly weapon in counts one through six, the prosecution did not seek to prove that Maritza or Karina personally used weapons. Except as to count three, where Karina was the actual perpetrator, the prosecution asserted that defendants were criminally liable on theories of aiding and abetting and natural and probable consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Defendants were charged by amended information with six counts of violating section 245, subdivision (a)(1), assault with a deadly weapon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The seventh count alleged assault by means of force likely to produce great bodily injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Together with her friends Anita Meneses and Vanessa Uclaray, Maritza organized a party bus trip to San Francisco, which took place on the night of November 15, 2008. The occasion was a birthday celebration for Meneses and Maritza. The bus left Sacramento from Uclaray\u2019s house sometime after 8:00 p.m. with 22 to 28 passengers. Some were strangers to Maritza, who had been invited by Meneses because they needed more passengers to make the trip affordable. However, Maritza did know Castillo. Maritza and Castillo had had prior verbal disputes. Neither Karina nor Chavez accompanied the partygoers on the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">According to Meneses, during the trip to San Francisco, Maritza was upset because there were too many people on the bus, she did not get to sit where she wanted, and things were not going as she had planned. At one point Meneses and Maritza had a \u201clittle heated talk\u201d about the situation. Meneses went to the back of the bus to avoid Maritza. Maritza sat toward the front with her friends, including her boyfriend and Uclaray. There was a dancing pole in the back of the bus where Meneses and her group sat. On the way to San Francisco, the passengers drank, danced, and socialized.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">The partiers planned to go to a nightclub that allowed free admission for those who entered before 11:00 p.m., but they arrived too late. This upset Maritza. Instead, they went to a nearby bar suggested by Meneses, the Holy Cow. The groups separated inside the bar. According to Meneses, Maritza still looked upset while they were in the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Sometime around 1:15 a.m., the group emerged from the Holy Cow. Because some of them lingered outside instead of boarding the bus, Maritza, who did not want to pay overtime charges for the bus, yelled at them to board the bus. In doing so, Maritza called some of the women \u201choes.\u201d One of the women took exception and exchanged words with Maritza. Others joined in the argument. They called Maritza a \u201cbitch\u201d and told her, \u201cfuck you.\u201d Castillo was one of the women arguing with Maritza. The verbal argument quickly became physical. After Castillo and others pushed Maritza, Maritza\u2019s boyfriend grabbed Castillo by the neck and slammed her on a bus seat, while Maritza\u2019s friend Jasmine Edwards threw a bottle at another woman. A second fight, including shoving and hair pulling, then erupted between Maritza and Castillo.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Maritza demanded that some people be kept off the bus, but Meneses, who rented the bus on her credit card, thought it was her decision to make. Meneses testified that Maritza, Uclaray, their boyfriends, and Edwards then refused to get on, even after Meneses told them to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Vaughn, the bus driver, had decided independently not to let Maritza back on because she appeared an \u201cout-of-control type of mad.\u201d He thought if she got on the bus, there would probably be another fight. In a phone conversation, his boss told him that the decision on who could ride was up to the cardholder. According to Vaughn, Meneses picked out several people, including Maritza, who should not get back on.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Thus, whether on their own volition or because they had been banished from the bus, Maritza, Uclaray, their boyfriends, and Edwards remained behind when the bus started back to Sacramento around 2:15 a.m. Maritza looked \u201cpissed off.\u201d As the bus pulled away, she was using her cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">Uclaray testified for the defense that she called a cousin in San Francisco. The cousin and her boyfriend drove separate cars to the scene, leaving one for the stranded group. They drove it to Sacramento, getting back before the bus. Maritza made calls before and after the group left San Francisco, but Uclaray claimed she did not know who Maritza called. Sacramento Police Officer David Putman interviewed Uclaray shortly after the crimes occurred. He testified Uclaray told him that while they were traveling back to Sacramento, Maritza told someone over the phone how unhappy and mad she was about the way the night had unfolded.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">On the way back to Sacramento, Cynthia Ballesteros and two of Maritza\u2019s other friends stayed together in the front of the bus. Ballesteros testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Maritza called her from Sacramento and asked her to search the bus for Maritza\u2019s purse, which Ballesteros could not find.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The bus pulled up in front of Uclaray\u2019s house in Sacramento around 4:20 a.m. As the bus arrived, Meneses saw people coming from Uclaray\u2019s house, including Maritza, Karina, Karina\u2019s boyfriend Chavez, Edwards, and at least two Hispanic men Meneses did not recognize.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> All were wearing sweatshirts and sweatpants, and Maritza and Karina had their hair pulled up in ponytails. Castillo believed that Maritza and Karina had come to \u201cjump\u201d the passengers and had put up their hair to keep it from being pulled. Some of the men were carrying small bats; one had what appeared to be a pipe. According to Meneses, the group was walking behind Maritza, who was smiling for the first time that night. Meneses had known Maritza a long time and she construed Maritza\u2019s smile as vindictive\u2014\u201clike she was going to show us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Ballesteros and Maritza\u2019s other friends got off the bus, hugged Maritza, and left. Edwards hit the side of the bus and challenged people to come out and fight, while the men in the group confronted male passengers getting off. According to Amanda Moore, one of the partygoers on the bus, the woman who was hitting the side of the bus pointed at Castillo and yelled \u201cthat bitch\u201d and \u201cget off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Meneses saw four men, including Mendoza, Bernhard, Merical, and Adam Tellier, being attacked. Meneses identified codefendant Chavez as one of the people who attacked Bernhard and Mendoza.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Bernhard testified that as he was getting off the bus he saw Maritza and two men come around the front of the bus and assume a position on the right side of the bus. One of the men was holding a small wooden bat and the other a piece of PVC pipe. One of the men told Bernhard he should leave, and Bernhard said he would leave after the other people with whom he had come got off the bus safely. Shortly thereafter, the man with the bat hit Bernhard in the forehead with the bat, then repeatedly struck him in the head and stomach until he started to fall. When Merical tried to help, he was attacked in turn. Another passenger saw a circle of men beating and kicking Bernhard and Merical on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Mendoza testified that when he got off the bus, he was surrounded by a \u201ccrowd of guys\u201d who said, \u201cWhy did you guys leave them behind?\u201d and, \u201cYou left them behind.\u201d Mendoza was struck several times in the head by one of the men with a small bat and lost consciousness for a minute or two. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>he woke up, he was lying on the ground. Mendoza said Chavez was part of the group that was accusing him of leaving people behind, but he could not say which man hit him with the bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">Meneses warned the passengers at the back of the bus, including Castillo and Murray, that they would get jumped if they got off the bus. Because there was no rear exit, they were trapped.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Karina boarded the bus followed by Chavez, who had a small wooden bat in his hand. Walking past one of the other passengers, Karina headed straight for Castillo. Karina said to Castillo, \u201cYou want to fuck with my sister?\u201d and grabbed Castillo\u2019s hair. Chavez struck Castillo on the back of the head with the bat, knocking her face-first into the bus seat. Karina scratched Castillo\u2019s face and stabbed her in the back of the head with a set of keys. After Castillo wrested the keys away, Chavez punched Castillo in the jaw.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">As the assault on Castillo proceeded, a man told Murray he was going to \u201cfuck [her] up\u201d and hit her on the forehead with a small wooden bat. Meanwhile, Maritza<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Edwards boarded the bus and yelled at the remaining passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">After Edwards got Meneses down onto the bus floor, a Hispanic man asked Edwards: \u201cIs she one of them?\u201d Edwards said yes. The man hit Meneses in the side of the head with a bat or club.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Vaughn, the bus driver, pulled the assailant off Meneses, allowing her to escape and call 911. That assailant then struck Vaughn twice in the forehead. Vaughn described the object with which this man hit him and Meneses as a wooden dowel that looked like a cut-down closet hanger bar. Another man then punched Vaughn in the jaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">Someone said the police were coming. Maritza said to Karina and Chavez, \u201cCome on you guys. Come on you guys. Let\u2019s go.\u201d The assailants scattered. Meneses saw Maritza\u2019s car and a big truck drive off. The police did not find defendants at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>Two days later, Karina phoned Meneses. Karina asked how the police knew who she was. Karina knew Meneses had given the police her name and asked Meneses not to testify against her because Meneses was the only one who knew her identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">During his investigation, Sacramento Police Detective Amel Aquino contacted Maritza, whom Aquino described as uncooperative and argumentative. She told Aquino she did not want to talk about the incident and refused to give a statement in person or over the phone. During one of the three phone conversations Aquino had with Maritza, she agreed to come talk to him, but she did not keep the appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Jessica Jimenez testified during the defense case. During the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal case, Jimenez was impeached with a statement she had previously provided to Aquino. Aquino testified that Jimenez said when the bus returned, \u201ca bunch of people came out of the house.\u201d Maritza and \u201canother girl\u201d were wearing sweatshirts and had their hair pulled back in ponytails. They \u201clooked like they were ready for a fight.\u201d The girl who had been with Maritza assaulted Castillo, saying something about \u201cnot fucking with my sister.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Defendants did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">I. Insufficient Evidence Contention<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">II. Evidentiary Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">Maritza contends the trial court erred prejudicially by admitting two pieces of evidence over her objection. First, she complains the court wrongly overruled her Evidence Code section 352 objection to the testimony of Detective Aquino that before her arrest she was uncooperative and refused to give a statement. Second, she complains the court wrongly overruled her relevance objection to Aquino\u2019s testimony regarding the date of her arrest. We conclude that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">A. Lack of Cooperation with the Police and Invocation of the Right to Remain Silent</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">Detective Aquino testified that after obtaining the names of the three bus trip organizers, he first contacted Meneses and Uclaray, who were cooperative, then Maritza, who was uncooperative. Maritza\u2019s counsel objected and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>asked to approach the bench. Thereafter, the trial court heard argument outside the jury\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Defense counsel told the court, \u201cMy understanding is [the prosecutor] is going to ask\u2014. . . is going to inquire of Officer Aquino if my client, Maritza Ramos, was contacted by him where she indicated she would come in and talk to him and give a statement but she did not do so. And I believe this happened on two occasions that Officer Aquino contacted Maritza or perhaps Maritza\u2019s sister or a friend of Maritza, somehow conveying a message to Maritza that she needs to come in and talk to Officer Aquino about the events that happened on November 16th. [][] It\u2019s my contention that Maritza, under California law, has no duty to report any crimes or to come in and talk to police officers, certainly when she\u2019s most likely going to be a suspect, as she is here today a defendant, [f] I believe the fact that she broke appointments with Officer Aquino or did not show up as she indicated is no indication of a consciousness of guilt. Rather, it is an indication of her knowledge of her right not to speak to the police officer, not to report any crimes, to exercise her Fifth Amendment right to not provide any testimony against herself should her statements ever be used against her. [f] Therefore, I would say that this line of questioning regarding Miss Ramos\u2019[s] failure to contact Officer Aquino is irrelevant, and I would ask the Court to not permit it under Evidence Code section 352 as it is overly prejudicial and adds no probative value to the facts that we\u2019re looking at here today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Without directly responding to the Fifth Amendment argument, the prosecutor replied, \u201cfirst of all, the defendants were arrested on warrants after those contacts occurred. And these are phone contacts. There\u2019s certainly no <em>Miranda </em>issues or anything like that. [][] And it seems that her level of cooperation in the investigation is extremely relevant to her consciousness of guilt and the fact that she was argumentative and defensive with him throughout their conversations. She said that she would meet with the officer and then failed to do so, as opposed to the other witnesses who cooperated with the investigation, I think just goes to show, like I said prior at side bar, consciousness of guilt. [f] There are no issues\u2014legal issues that would exclude these statements or prohibit these statements at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">The trial court overruled Maritza\u2019s Evidence Code section 352 objection and allowed the testimony. Before the court made its ruling, neither defense counsel nor the prosecutor informed the court of the specific responses Maritza had given to Aquino\u2019s requests or questions. The defense did not request an Evidence Code section 402 hearing to be held outside the presence of the jury. The court made its ruling solely on defense counsel\u2019s offer of proof and objection to evidence that Maritza had failed to keep appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Detective Aquino testified to the jury that he spoke to Maritza at least three times on the telephone. She was consistently argumentative and uncooperative. But she also refused to give a statement over the telephone or in person. Aquino testified that Maritza \u201cwould not talk to me about the incident at all\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t want to talk to me about anything at all.\u201d In one conversation, she agreed to come in at a later date, but never did. No objection was made to the testimony indicating Maritza had refused to give a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">On cross-examination, Maritza\u2019s counsel asked: \u201cAre you aware of any rule that says someone has to come in and talk to the police?\u201d Detective Aquino conceded he was not. However, in response to defense counsel\u2019s followup question of whether Aquino considered someone not coming in to talk to him uncooperative, Aquino replied, \u201cwhen I\u2019m talking about a violent offense, I would assume that people would be cooperative if\u2014if they\u2019re going to help me do my job. And if someone is not willing to cooperate with me, yeah, I consider that uncooperative, and not really something a good person would want to come do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Although Maritza asserts no error related to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, we note that the prosecutor argued Maritza\u2019s conduct could be considered evidence of consciousness of guilt.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, the trial court\u2019s instructions did not reference Maritza\u2019s lack of cooperation as potential consciousness of guilt evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">In his closing argument, Maritza\u2019s counsel said: \u201cWell, this is probably not the forum to get into why it\u2019s not a good idea to cooperate with the police all the time. But sometimes it\u2019s in a person\u2019s best interest .... You know, Maritza is a suspect.... I don\u2019t think it\u2019s consciousness of guilt not to go in and talk to Officer Aquino. I think it\u2019s prudent behavior. And smart. But, then, again, I\u2019m a defense attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Maritza asserts in her briefing (1) Detective Aquino\u2019s testimony had no probative value and could only have biased the jury emotionally against her and (2) the admission of this testimony flouted \u201cthe policies behind\u201d <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California </em>(1965) 380 U.S. 609 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 85 S.Ct. 1229], which held that the use of a defendant\u2019s refusal to testify at trial against him violates the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Without conceding a Fifth Amendment violation, the People commendably cite an appellate decision not cited by Maritza in her opening brief, which held that substantive use of <em>precustody/pre-Miranda </em>silence in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief may violate the Fifth Amendment. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Waldie </em>(2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 358, 365-366 [92 Cal.Rptr.3d 688] <em>(Waldie).)</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Waldie, </em>a detective was allowed to testify in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief that the defendant never participated in a police interview, even after a dozen phone calls. The trial court instructed the jury that defendant\u2019s statement promising to call back tended to show consciousness of guilt. In closing argument, the prosecutor commented that the defendant did not cooperate with the police investigation. <em>(Waldie, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.4th at p. 364.)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Unlike in <em>Waldie, </em>defendant here did not simply miss appointments; nor did she simply remain silent. When asked to submit to an interview, she told the investigator she did not want to talk about what had happened and refused to give a statement in person or over the telephone. At oral argument, both parties agreed that Maritza expressly invoked her right to remain silent. The concession by the People was appropriate. The Fifth Amendment provides in pertinent part, \u201cNo person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a' witness against himself . . . .\u201d By refusing to talk, defendant invoked this right. A defendant need not be in custody or <em>Mirandized </em>to invoke the right against self-incrimination. The right to remain silent derives from the Constitution, not from the <em>Miranda </em>warnings themselves. <em>(U.S. v. Velarde-Gomez </em>(9th Cir. 2001) 269 F.3d 1023, 1030.) That right can be invoked any time. And \u201ca person\u2019s invocation of his or her right to remain silent cannot be used as evidence of guilt.\u201d <em>(People v. Lopez </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 1508, 1525 [29 Cal.Rptr.3d 586] [colorful <em>post-Miranda </em>invocation was erroneously admitted].)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">While there appear to be no published California cases involving use in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief of precustody/pre-Miranda words that effectively invoke the right to remain silent,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> there are federal cases that prohibit such evidence. <em>(Coppola v. Powell </em>(1st Cir. 1989) 878 F.2d 1562, 1563, 1565 [right against self-incrimination attaches precustody/pre-Miranda, making the following express refusal to speak inadmissible: \u201c \u2018Let me tell you something. I\u2019m not one of your country bumpkins. I grew up on the streets of Providence, Rhode Island. And if you think I\u2019m going to confess to you, you\u2019re crazy.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>U.S. ex rel. Savory v. Lane </em>(7th Cir. 1987) 832 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>1011, 1015-1018; see <em>U.S. ex rel. Savory, </em>at p. 1015 [admission of defendant\u2019s prec<em>ustody/pre-Miranda </em>statement \u201c \u2018he didn\u2019t want to talk about it, he didn\u2019t want to make any statements\u2019 \u201d violated right against self-incrimination].) And where precustody silence is used for impeachment purposes, California courts have held such impeachment is impermissible if the trial court finds the silence was an invocation of Fifth Amendment rights. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Givans </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 793, 801 [212 Cal.Rptr. 762]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Free </em>(1982) 131 Cal.App.3d 155, 166 [182 Cal.Rptr. 259].) At a minimum, the same rule should apply to substantive use of precustody/pre<em>Miranda </em>silence in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Here, Maritza said she did not want to talk to Detective Aquino, thus invoking her Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">However, Maritza did not object to the evidence that she expressly invoked her right to remain silent. She objected on relevance and Evidence Code section 352 grounds to evidence that defendant \u201cbroke appointments\u201d and \u201cdid not show up,\u201d contending that conduct was an \u201cindication of her <em>knowledge </em>of her right not to speak to the police officer, not to report any crimes, to exercise her Fifth Amendment right to not provide any testimony against herself should her statements ever be used against her.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Maritza contended at oral argument that trial counsel\u2019s generic reference to the Fifth Amendment was sufficient to preserve an argument that she expressly invoked her right to remain silent. We disagree. A generic objection on Fifth Amendment grounds is insufficient. Like any objection, a defendant must state in the trial court the <em>specific grounds </em>for an objection to the admissibility of her statements. <em>(People v. Tully </em>(2012) 54 Cal.4th 952, 992 [145 Cal.Rptr.3d 146, 282 P.3d 173] [objection on grounds that the defendant invoked his right to counsel does not preserve an objection that the statement was involuntary]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rundle </em>(2008) 43 Cal.4th 76, 115-116 [74 Cal.Rptr.3d 454, 180 P.3d 224], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Doolin </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 390, 421, fn. 22 [87 Cal.Rptr.3d 209, 198 P.3d 11] [generic motion to suppress statements made to police without stating specific grounds does not preserve claim that defendant invoked his right to remain silent]; <em>Rundle, supra, </em>43 Cal.4th at pp. 120-121 [contention on appeal that statements made to psychiatrist were involuntary and his <em>Miranda </em>waiver was invalid were not preserved by objection grounded on claims defendant invoked his right to remain silent in a prior police interview and invoked his right to counsel during the interview with the psychiatrist]; see <em>Rundle, </em>at pp. 122-123 [additional theory of involuntariness grounded on claim related to the \u201c \u2018extensiveness of the interrogations\u2019 \u201d was not preserved because defendant also failed to assert this ground in the trial court].)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>At oral argument, counsel for Maritza contended that <em>People </em>v. <em>Partida </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 428 [35 Cal.Rptr.3d 644, 122 P.3d 765] provides a theory by which a contention that she expressly invoked her right to silence could be preserved. <em>Partida </em>is of no help to Maritza. Our high court in <em>Partida </em>emphasized the well-settled rule that a defendant may not argue on appeal that the trial court should have excluded the evidence for a reason <em>not </em>asserted at trial. <em>(Partida, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at pp. 431, 433-434.) A specific objection is required so that the trial court has \u201c \u2018a concrete legal proposition to pass on\u2019 \u201d <em>(Partida, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 434) and \u201c[a] party cannot argue the [trial] court erred in failing to conduct an analysis it was not asked to conduct\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 435; accord, <em>People v. Holford </em>(2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 155, 169 [136 Cal.Rptr.3d 713]). Thus, the Partida rule can apply only when \u201c \u2018the new arguments do not invoke facts or legal standards different from those the trial court itself was asked to apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Homick </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 816, 856, fn. 25 [150 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 289 P.3d 791], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyer </em>(2006) 38 Cal.4th 412, 441, fn. 17 [42 Cal.Rptr.3d 677, 133 P.3d 581].)  Deciding whether precustody/pre-Miranda silence violates the Fifth Amendment requires the application of different legal principles than deciding whether there has been an express invocation of the right to remain silent. Indeed, as <em>Waldie </em>illustrates, the legal principles related to precustody/pre<em>Miranda </em>silence are not settled and may require a case-by-case analysis of a variety of facts. (See fn. 14, <em>post.) </em>Moreover, facts different from those presented to the trial court before its ruling are implicated in the invocation theory and Maritza suggests we should find error based on evidence the trial court was never ask to exclude.  \u201cWhen a trial court rules on an objection to evidence, it decides only whether that <em>particular evidence </em>should be excluded.\u201d <em>(Partida, supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 436, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">As we have noted, when defendant\u2019s midtrial objection was argued, the trial court was not told what specific responses Maritza made to Aquino\u2019s requests or questions. Indeed, defense counsel made the offer of proof as to what Aquino would say about defendant\u2019s failure to interview with him and the court made its ruling based on that proffer. We must assess the trial court\u2019s ruling refusing to preclude evidence based on the facts made known to the court when it was asked to make the ruling. <em>(People v. Hartsch </em>(2010) 49 Cal.4th 472, 491 [110 Cal.Rptr.3d 673, 232 P.3d 663]; <em>People v. Hernandez </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 417, 425 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 747].) \u201cTo do otherwise would require us to hold the trial court to an impossible standard.\u201d <em>(Hernandez, supra, </em>71 Cal.App.4th at p. 425.) Defendant did not object when Aquino testified to Maritza\u2019s express refusal to talk about what had happened. To preserve any objection to the evidence based on a deviation from the offer of proof, it was incumbent upon defendant to object at the time the evidence was introduced. <em>(People v. Champion </em>(1995) 9 Cal.4th 879, 919 [39 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 547, 891 P.2d 93] [by failing to object at trial, defendant forfeits objection to the prosecution\u2019s trial evidence that did not conform to the prosecution\u2019s pretrial offer of proof upon which the trial court based its ruling].) Consequently, we must regard any objection that Maritza expressly invoked her right to remain silent as forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">That said, defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred by refusing to preclude evidence of her failure to keep interview appointments with Aquino was adequately preserved. Without deciding defendant\u2019s Evidence Code section 352 argument or agreeing with the analysis related to precustody/pre<em>Miranda </em>silence in <em>Waldie,</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we conclude any error in admitting Aquino\u2019s testimony was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In <em>Waldie, </em>the court found the error there harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under <em>Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824] because the properly admitted evidence against the defendant was extremely strong. <em>(Waldie, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.4th at pp. 366-367.) Likewise, the evidence of Maritza\u2019s guilt as an aider and abettor was overwhelming. As we have discussed, in the unpublished portion of this opinion, the evidence established that Maritza was angry that her birthday party had been ruined. She had been disrespected, thrown off the bus, and stranded in San Francisco. Thus, she had a strong motive to aid and abet the armed perpetrators of the assault. The evidence supports the inference that she instigated the mob and led them in the assault. She and her sister were dressed for the battle. With a vindictive expression on her face, she led two of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the armed assailants to the right side of the bus where passengers exited. The mob allowed Maritza\u2019s friends to escape and targeted specific individuals who had \u201cfucked with\u201d and stranded Maritza. Maritza told Karina and Chavez it was time to go when it became known that the police were coming, and they all then fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Further, we observe that, unlike <em>Waldie, </em>the trial court did not instruct the jury that Maritza\u2019s prearrest conduct could be considered evidence of consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">We conclude any error here was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">B. Evidence of Arrest Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Outside the jury\u2019s presence, the prosecutor told the court he intended to ask Detective Aquino whether and when he had had warrants issued for defendants\u2019 arrest. Maritza\u2019s counsel objected that this evidence was irrelevant. The prosecutor explained that he wanted to show the length of the investigation to show how long Maritza had failed to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The trial court ruled: \u201cAs I understand it, I think it is relevant. I understand it. His theory is that [Maritza] was uncooperative, and that she had until this date [(the date of her arrest)] to cooperate, and she failed to do so.\u201d Counsel repeated his relevance objection \u201cto preserve the record.\u201d The court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Detective Aquino thereafter testified that, after his unsuccessful attempts to obtain a statement from Maritza, an arrest warrant was issued for her sometime during the first half of December.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">Maritza asserts that this evidence had no tendency in reason to prove any disputed fact of consequence, and that the prosecution introduced it in an improper \u201ceffort to imply or suggest to the jurors that [Maritza] had a greater obligation to talk to the police because she had not yet been arrested.\u201d The relevance of this evidence is tied to defendant\u2019s refusal to give a statement. In essence, the prosecutor sought to establish the length of Maritza\u2019s precustody silence. We conclude that any error in admitting this evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt given the compelling evidence we have already discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Raye, P.

Tom </em>(2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 480 [139 Cal.Rptr.3d 71], review granted June 20, 2012, S202107.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\"> The <em>Waldie </em>court noted a split of authority in the federal circuits, some of which have concluded that substantive use of precustody silence (as opposed to an express invocation) by the prosecution is constitutional. While these cases were rejected in <em>Waldie (Waldie, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.4th at pp. 365-366), the <em>Waldie </em>court\u2019s holding appears to provide less than a bright line and seems to allow for the use of precustody silence in some situations. The <em>Waldie </em>court noted that its conclusion was \u201c[b]ased on the particular circumstances\u201d of that case. <em>(Waldie, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.4th at p. 364.) Then the court discussed those circumstances. \u201cHere, the . . . detective testified that defendant did not follow up on his promise to call when the detective was attempting to investigate the case. But the detective went beyond saying the defendant did not call him back. In fact, the detective described <em>repeated attempts to contact defendant\u2014more than a dozen times\u2014making it appear that defendant was evading the police. </em>The prosecutor also placed emphasis on defendant\u2019s continuing failure to call the police. We conclude the evidence and argument violated the Fifth Amendment because defendant was deprived of any meaningful right to refuse to talk to the police. If the police are allowed to call a suspect persistently and then offer his unwillingness to respond as evidence of guilt, a defendant would never be able to claim the protection of freedom from incrimination. A <em>different result might be indicated if the detective had called defendant only one time or a few times. But testimony about repeated phone calls and apparent evasiveness by defendant is constitutionally </em>infirm.\u201d <em>(Waldie, supra, </em>at p. 366, italics added.) Because we decide any error is harmless, we need not endorse the <em>Waldie </em>analysis or decide whether the trial court\u2019s ruling concerning the <em>precustody/pre-Miranda </em>silence here was admissible on the theory that the detective called only \u201ca few times.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b192-12\"> Although Maritza contends the court erroneously admitted evidence of the date of her arrest, the prosecutor did not actually ask Aquino about that date and no evidence of the date was admitted. The prosecutor only asked about when an arrest warrant was issued.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
