This motion was heard at chambers, and taken under advisement, and on January 18, 1893, an order was signed by the judge, denying said motion, which order was sent to the clerk\u2019s office of the court in the fifth division for record, and was filed and entered of record therein on January 21, 1893. On January \u00ab30, 1893, an execution was issued by the clerk, but retained by him till January 31, 1893, and was received by a deputy United States marshal on the same day, but no levy was made, under and by virtue of the same, until February 2, 1893. On the 2d day of February aforesaid a citation was duly issued, a writ of error duly filed, and a supersedeas bond duly approved and filed. A bill of exceptions had been settled, signed, and filed before the latter day. A motion is now made to quash the execution, and sot aside all proceedings that may have been done under the samo.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-14\">Draper.

No execution could issue until a final judgment is rendered. The judgment became final at the time when the motion for a new trial was determined. See Woods v. Lindvall, 48 Fed. Rep. 73, 1 C. C. A. 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-17\">Although the order denying the motion for a new trial was signed by the judge in vacation, and at chambers, upon January 18, 1893, it was not effective, so that the judgment became final, until the order was filed of record in the clerk\u2019s office in the division in which the judgment was entered, which was on January 21, 1893.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-18\">Under section 1007, Rev. St. U. S., as interpreted by the United States supreme court, (Doyle v. Wisconsin, 94 U. S. 52,) the legislative intent is to be determined by looking at the old law as it existed before the revision; and when this is done it is found that, until the expiration of the term of 10 days, \u201cexecution shall not issue in any case where a writ of error may be a supersedeas;\u201d and the term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>10 days also excludes Sundays. See, also, Kitchen v. Randolph, 93 U. S. 86, and Danville v. Brown, 128 U. S. 503, 9 Sup. Ct. Rep. 149. Motion to quash execution is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
