Crawford was convicted following a jury trial of possession with intent to deliver 50 to 225 grams of cocaine. MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(iii); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(iii). He claims error in the admission of evidence of his prior conviction for delivery of 225 to 650 grams and conspiracy to commit the same offense. Specifically, he contends that the evidence of his prior conviction should have been excluded under MRE 404(b) as improper evidence of his character or propensity to commit the charged offense. We agree that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction was improperly admitted in this case and that his conviction, therefore, should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">On September 22, 1992, Oak Park police officer Rene Gobeyn was patrolling Eight Mile Road. He noticed a man, later identified as the defendant, placing something in the trunk of a car in the parking lot of the Embassy Motel. The motel\u2019s reputation apparently caused Officer Gobeyn to suspect that criminal activity might be afoot.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Officer Gobeyn did not immediately confront the defendant, however. Instead, he watched as the car left the motel parking lot and headed west on Eight Mile Road. Gobeyn estimated that the car drove off at a speed in excess of the posted speed limit, and he tried to catch up in his patrol car. Before he could do so, he saw the defendant turn left at a \u201cturn around lane\u201d and head south on an intersecting street. There was a stop sign in the turn around lane, but the defendant did not heed it. Officer Gobeyn decided to stop the defendant for this violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">On request, the defendant presented his driver\u2019s license, registration, and proof of insurance. Gobeyn returned to his patrol car to verify those documents. As Gobeyn sat in his patrol car, he observed the defendant leaning over to the passenger side of his car. All he could see was the top left portion of the defendant\u2019s shoulder. Fearing that the defendant might be reaching for a gun, Gobeyn radioed for backup assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">When a second officer arrived, the two ordered the defendant to get out of the car with his hands in plain view. A patdown search produced only a beeper. Gobeyn asked the defendant if there were any drugs or weapons in the vehicle. The defendant responded, \u201cNo, go ahead and look.\u201d While the second officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>detained the defendant outside, Gobeyn looked around the car\u2019s front-seat area, and found a jacket in which he found a plastic baggie that contained several smaller baggies. Gobeyn thought, and this was later confirmed by stipulation at trial, that the large baggie contained cocaine residue. Further, as Gobeyn was leaving the car, he noticed a box beneath the driver\u2019s seat. Inside the box he found a digital scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Gobeyn arrested the defendant on the basis of the discovery of the suspected cocaine residue in the baggie. Defendant was taken to the Oak Park police station and his car was towed and impounded there. An Oak Park police officer searched the defendant\u2019s car early the next morning and found a yellow baggie that contained more than one hundred grams of cocaine hidden in the dashboard adjacent to the glove compartment. A subsequent, more careful search, found another baggie with a smaller amount of cocaine in the same area.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Defendant was charged with possession with intent to deliver 50 to 225 grams of cocaine. Before trial, the prosecutor advised defense counsel by letter of his intent to introduce evidence of a prior drug crime on an MRE 404(b) \u201cother bad acts\u201d theory.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant moved to suppress the evidence, citing <em>People v Golochowicz, </em>413 Mich 298; 319 NW2d 518 (1982),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>arguing that it was irrelevant and that, if found to be relevant, it was unfairly prejudicial. In response, the prosecutor argued that the prior conviction was relevant to show defendant\u2019s knowledge of the presence of the cocaine and his intent to deliver it, and that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The trial judge agreed and ruled that the prosecution could introduce evidence of defendant\u2019s prior conviction, and announced his intention to read a limiting instruction to cushion the prejudicial effect on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">A four-day jury trial was held on May 17-21, 1993. Officer Gobeyn described the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s arrest. The officer who located the cocaine in the dashboard of the car described how he made that discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Over defense objection, a third officer testified in great detail about the defendant\u2019s 1988 crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He testified that he had waited with a codefendant in that earlier case until the defendant and a codefendant appeared on the scene. He said that the defendant and the third man got out of their car and entered an apartment building. The defendant was carrying a distinctive plastic bag. After a few moments, the officer was invited into the apartment. Cocaine was taken from the bag and handed to the officer. After field testing it, the officer handed $5,000 to the defendant. He then gave a prearranged signal that brought in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>other officers to arrest all the participants. The defendant was discovered hiding in a bedroom closet.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The defendant did not testify, but his wife did. She said that both she and the defendant were employed. They were engaged but not yet married when the defendant was arrested. The defendant had been living in the Embassy Motel temporarily, after being evicted by a grandparent with whom he had been living. Further, she provided the testimonial basis for the defense theory that the defendant had been unaware of the cocaine hidden in the car\u2019s dashboard. She testified that she had never seen the defendant use or sell drugs. He had purchased the old car in which he was arrested just five to ten days before his arrest and had loaned the car to others during that time. She had ridden in the car, but had never noticed anything hanging down from behind the dashboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">The only other defense witness was an Oak Park police officer who searched the glove compartment and trunk of the defendant\u2019s car while it was impounded. He found no incriminating evidence. The trunk contained several garbage bags full of men\u2019s clothing. His testimony, therefore, was consistent with the defense theory that the defendant had been residing at the Embassy Motel temporarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">The jury found the defendant guilty as charged of possessing with intent to deliver 50 to 225 grams of cocaine. The trial judge imposed a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole on June 17, 1993. The Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished memorandum opinion, holding merely that under <em>People v Mouat, </em>194 Mich App 482; 487 NW2d 494 (1992), \u201cthe trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the prosecution to present evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>prior convictions involving cocaine delivery where defendant\u2019s intent to deliver cocaine in the instant case was an issue.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant has appealed to this Court. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">In this case we once again consider the admissibility of other acts evidence under MRE 404(b). The general rule is more easily stated than applied: evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts of an individual is inadmissible to prove a propensity to commit such acts. MRE 404(b). Such evidence may be admissible, however, for other purposes under MRE 404(b)(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-7\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, scheme, plan, or system in doing an act, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident when the same is material, whether such other crimes, wrongs, or acts are contemporaneous with, or prior or subsequent to the conduct at issue in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">The decision whether such evidence is admissible is within the trial court\u2019s discretion and will only be reversed where there has been a clear abuse of discretion. <em>People v Bahoda, </em>448 Mich 261; 531 NW2d 659 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The character evidence prohibition is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence. Far from being a mere technicality, the rule \u201creflects and gives meaning to the central precept of our system of criminal justice, the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>sumption of innocence.\u201d <em>United States v Daniels, </em>248 US App DC 198, 205; 770 F2d 1111 (1985). Underlying the rule is the fear that a jury will convict the defendant inferentially on the basis of his bad character rather than because he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime charged. Evidence of extrinsic bad acts thus carries the risk of prejudice, for it is antithetical to the precept that \u201ca defendant starts his life afresh when he stands before a jury . . . .\u201d <em>People v Zackowitz, </em>254 NY 192, 197; 172 NE 466 (1930). As the United States Supreme Court recently noted in <em>Old Chief v United States, </em>519 US 172, 181; 117 S Ct 644; 136 L Ed 2d 574 (1997), the problem with character evidence generally and prior bad acts evidence in particular is not that it is irrelevant, but, to the contrary, that using bad acts evidence can \u201c \u2018weigh too much with the jury and ... so overpersuade them as to prejudge one with a bad general record and deny him a fair opportunity to defend against a particular charge.\u2019 \u201d Quoting <em>Michelson v United States, </em>335 US 469, 476; 69 S Ct 213; 93 L Ed 168 (1948). The fundamental principle of exclusion, codified by MRE 404(b), is woven into the fabric of Michigan jurisprudence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">There can be little doubt that an individual with a substantial criminal history is more likely to have committed a crime than is an individual free of past criminal activity. Nevertheless, in our system of jurisprudence, we try cases, rather than persons, and thus a jury may look only to the evidence of the events in question, not defendant\u2019s prior acts in reaching its verdict. See <em>United States v Mitchell, </em>2 US (2 Dall) 348, 357; 1 L Ed 410 (1795). <em>[People v Allen, </em>429 Mich 558, 566-567; 420 NW2d 499 (1988).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>This Court\u2019s most recent formulation of the MRE 404(b) test appears in <em>People v VanderVliet, </em>444 Mich 52; 508 NW2d 114 (1993). In that case, we rejected a rigid, bright-line approach to other acts evidence and directed the bench and bar to employ the evidentiary safeguards already present in the Rules of Evidence, as identified by the United States Supreme Court in Huddleston:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-4\">First, that the evidence be offered for a proper purpose under Rule 404(b); second, that it be relevant under Rule 402 as enforced through Rule 104(b); third, that the probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice; fourth, that the trial court may, upon request, provide a limiting instruction to the jury. <em>[VanderVliet, supra </em>at 55.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Under this formulation, the prosecution bears the initial burden of establishing relevance of the evidence to prove a fact within one of the exceptions to the general exclusionary rule of MRE 404(b). Where the only relevance is to character or the defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the crime, the evidence must be excluded. Where, however, the evidence also tends to prove some fact other than character, admissibility depends upon whether its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect, taking into account the efficacy of a limiting instruction in cushioning the prejudicial effect of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Thus, the first question that must be addressed is whether the prosecutor has articulated a proper noncharacter purpose for admission of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>ant\u2019s prior drug conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The prosecutor offers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>two theories of admissibility to support the admission of the defendant\u2019s 1988 drug conviction. The first is to show that the defendant knew the cocaine was hidden in the dashboard of his car. The second is to show that he intended to deliver drugs in 1992. \u201cKnowledge\u201d and \u201cintent\u201d are indeed included among MRE 404(b)\u2019s laundry list of proper purposes. However, a common pitfall in MRE 404(b) cases is the trial courts\u2019 tendency to admit the prior misconduct evidence merely because it has been \u201coffered\u201d for one of the rule\u2019s enumerated proper purposes. Mechanical recitation of \u201cknowledge, intent, absence of mistake, etc.,\u201d without explaining how the evidence relates to the recited purposes, is insufficient to justify admission under MRE 404(b). If it were, the prosecutor could routinely admit character evidence by simply calling it something else. Relevance is not an inherent characteristic, <em>Huddleston, supra </em>at 689, nor are prior bad acts intrinsically relevant to \u201cmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan,\u201d etc. Relevance is a relationship between the evidence and a material fact at issue that must be demonstrated by reasonable inferences that make a material fact at issue more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. <em>United States v Sampson, </em>980 F2d 883, 888 (CA 3, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>1992). In order to ensure the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, courts must vigilantly weed out character evidence that is disguised as something else. The logical relationship between the proffered evidence and the ultimate fact sought to be proven must be closely scrutinized.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Logical relevance, the \u201ctouchstone\u201d of the admissibility of prior acts evidence, is determined by the application of Rules 401 and 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">MRE 401 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">\u201cRelevant evidence\u201d means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">MRE 402 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of Michigan, these rules, or other rules adopted by the Supreme Court. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">Pursuant to MRE 401, evidence is relevant if two components are present, materiality and probative value. Materiality is the requirement that the proffered evidence be related to \u201cany fact that is of consequence\u201d to the action. \u201cIn other words, is the fact to be proven truly in issue?\u201d Wade &amp; Strom, Michigan Courtroom Evidence (rev ed), Rule 401, p 71. A fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>that is \u201cof consequence\u201d to the action is a material fact. <em>People v McKinney, </em>410 Mich 413; 301 NW2d 824 (1981). \u201cMateriality looks to the relation between the propositions for which the evidence is offered and the issues in the case. If the evidence is offered to help prove a proposition which is not a matter in issue, the evidence is immaterial.\u201d 1 McCormick, Evidence (4th ed), \u00a7 185, p 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">It is well established in Michigan that all elements of a criminal offense are \u201cin issue\u201d when a defendant enters a plea of not guilty. <em>People v </em>Mills, 450 Mich 61, 69; 537 NW2d 909 (1995). Because the prosecution must carry the burden of proving every element beyond a reasonable doubt, regardless of whether the defendant specifically disputes or offers to stipulate any of the elements, the elements of the offense are always \u201cin issue\u201d and, thus, material. See <em>Old Chief, supra. </em>The elements of the charge of possession with intent to deliver cocaine, as applied to this case, are as follows: (1) the defendant knowingly possessed a controlled substance; (2) the defendant intended to deliver this substance to someone else; (3) the substance possessed was cocaine and the defendant knew it was cocaine; and (4) the substance was in a mixture that weighed between 50 and 225 grams. See also CJI2d 12.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Because the prosecution was obligated under the statute to prove that the defendant knowingly possessed cocaine and that he did so with the specific intent of distributing it, knowledge and intent were \u201cin issue.\u201d The first step on the ladder of relevance, materiality, is thus reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The probative force inquiry asks whether the proffered evidence tends \u201cto make the existence of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d The threshold is minimal: \u201cany\u201d tendency is sufficient probative force. MRE 401. See <em>Beaubien v Cicotte, </em>12 Mich 459, 484 (1864), and <em>Collins v Beecher &amp; Marquette &amp; Pacific Rolling Mill Co, </em>45 Mich 436, 438; 8 NW 97 (1881). In the context of prior acts evidence, however, MRE 404(b) stands as a sentinel at the gate: the proffered evidence truly must be probative of something <em>other </em>than the defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the crime. If the prosecutor fails to weave a logical thread linking the prior act to the ultimate inference, the evidence must be excluded, notwithstanding its logical relevance to character.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Turning to the present case, the question becomes whether the prosecutor carried its burden of demonstrating that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction establishes some intermediate inference, other than the improper inference of character, which in turn is probative of the ultimate issues in this case, the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the presence of cocaine and his intent to deliver it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We agree with the defendant that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>no such intermediate inference has been established.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">To establish the probativeness of the evidence, the prosecutor invokes the \u201cdoctrine of chances,\u201d also known as the \u201cdoctrine of objective improbability.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>This theory, which is attributed to Professor Wig-more, is widely accepted, although its application varies with the issue for which it is offered. Where material to the issue of mens rea, as here, it rests on the premise that \u201cthe more often the defendant commits an actus reus, the less is the likelihood that the defendant acted accidentally or innocently.\u201d Imwinkelried, Uncharged Misconduct Evidence, \u00a7 3:11, p 45. Consequently, the forbidden intermediate inference to defendant\u2019s subjective character is not implicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">[T]his theory of logical relevance does not depend on a character inference. The proponent is not asking the trier of fact to infer the defendant\u2019s conduct (entertaining a particular mens rea) from the defendant\u2019s personal, subjective character. The intermediate inference is an objective likelihood under the doctrine of chances rather than a subjective probability based on the defendant\u2019s character. <em>[Id., </em>\u00a7 5:05, P 12.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>However, Imwinkelried cautions against the routine admission of prior misconduct evidence under the doctrine of chances because the theory is prone to abuse and may result in the admission of character evidence in disguise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-4\">[The doctrine of chances theory] can easily be abused. . . . [I]ntent is an essential element of every true crime. Whenever the prosecutor has evidence of an uncharged crime similar to the charged offense, the prosecutor can attempt to invoke Wigmore\u2019s doctrine of chances; the prosecutor can always argue that a similar uncharged crime triggers the doctrine of chances and is, therefore, logically relevant on a noncharacter theory both to disprove accident and thereby to prove mens rea. If the courts accept these arguments uncritically, the prosecutor may be able to introduce bad character evidence in disguise. ... To counter this tendency, the courts should clearly enunciate and rigorously enforce the foundational requirements applicable when the prosecutor relies on the doctrine of chances to establish mens rea. [Imwinkelried, <em>The use of evidence of an accused\u2019s uncharged misconduct to prove mens rea: The doctrines which threaten to engulf the character evidence prohibition, </em>51 Ohio St L J 575, 595 (1990).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Elaborating on the foundational requirements for triggering the doctrine of chances to prove mens rea, Imwinkelried explains that the prosecutor must \u201cmake persuasive showings that each uncharged incident is similar to the charged offense and that the accused has been involved in such incidents more frequently than the typical person.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 602. We find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>this reasoning to be sound. The applicability of the doctrine of chances depends on the similarity between the defendant\u2019s prior conviction and the crime for which he stands charged.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We conclude that there is an insufficient factual nexus between the prior conviction and the present charged offense to warrant admission of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>under the doctrine of chances. The arresting officer from the 1988 offense testified at length about how he had waited with a codefendant in that earlier case until the defendant and a codefendant appeared on the scene. He said that the defendant and the third man got out of their car and entered an apartment building. The defendant was carrying a distinctive plastic bag. After a few moments, the officer was invited into the apartment. Cocaine was taken from the bag and handed to the officer. After field testing it, the officer handed $5,000 to the defendant. He then gave a prearranged signal that brought in other officers to arrest all the participants.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In this case, however, the defendant was not caught in the act of selling drugs. Rather, he was stopped for a routine traffic violation, which ultimately led to the discovery of cocaine hidden in the dashboard of his car. There was evidence at trial that the defendant had purchased the car just five to ten days before his arrest, and that the car had been in the possession of others during that time, lending support to the defense theoiy that the prior owner or someone else left the drugs in the car, unwittingly or in an attempt to frame the defendant. The plausibility of this defense was to be determined by the jury on the basis of its assessment of the credibility of the witnesses. However, the factual relationship between the 1988 crime and the charged offense was simply too remote for the jury to draw a permissible intermediate inference of the defendant\u2019s mens rea in the present case. The facts of the 1988 drug offense simply do not bear out the prosecutor\u2019s contention that the defendant \u201cobviously knew\u201d the drugs were in his dashboard and that he intended to deliver them. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>prior conviction only demonstrates that the defendant has been around drugs in the past and, thus, is the kind of person who would knowingly possess and intend to deliver large amounts of cocaine. To the extent that the 1988 conviction is logically relevant to show that the defendant was also a drug dealer in 1992, we believe it does so solely by way of the forbidden intermediate inference of bad character that is specifically prohibited by MRE 404(b). Thus, the defendant\u2019s prior conviction was mere character evidence masquerading as evidence of \u201cknowledge\u201d and \u201cintent.\u201d Because MRE 404(b) expressly prohibits the use of prior bad acts to demonstrate a defendant\u2019s propensity to form a certain mens rea, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction and reverse and remand the case for a new trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Even if we were to find that the evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction had some logical relevance distinct from the impermissible character inference, we would nevertheless conclude that it should have been excluded by MRE 403 because the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed whatever <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>marginal probative value it might have had. Rule 403 does not prohibit prejudicial evidence; only evidence that is unfairly so. Evidence is unfairly prejudicial when there exists a danger that marginally probative evidence will be given undue or preemptive weight by the jury. In the context of prior bad acts, that danger is prevalent. When a juror learns that a defendant has previously committed the same crime as that for which he is on trial, the risk is severe that the juror will use the evidence precisely for the purpose that it may not be considered, that is, as suggesting that the defendant is a bad person, a convicted criminal, and that if he \u201cdid it before he probably did it again.\u201d <em>People v Johnson, </em>27 F3d 1186, 1193 (CA 6, 1994).

Thus, the specter of impermissible character evidence is likely to have significantly overshadowed any legitimate probative value.

The suggested stipulation about the prior conviction also was read to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b463-10\"> Issued October 10, 1995 (Docket No. 165956).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b465-7\"> <em>Huddleston v United States, </em>485 US 681; 108 S Ct 1496; 99 L Ed 2d 771 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b466-4\"> The dissent vociferously objects to the proposition that the prosecutor must bear the burden of articulating a proper noncharacter purpose for the admission of prior acts evidence under MRE 404(b). However, the principle that the proponent of evidence bears the burden of establishing relevance and admissibility is a matter of basic hornbook law. See 22 Wright &amp; Graham, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 5166, pp 65-76. Instead of fashioning an argument why the prosecutor should be relieved of this burden in MRE 404(b) cases, the dissent accuses the majority of somehow shifting or heightening the prosecutor\u2019s burden under MRE 404(b). Our requirement that the prosecutor articulate a proper noncharacter purpose comports not only with the plain language of MRE 404(b), but also with the approach utilized by the majority of federal circuits. In <em>United States v Sampson, </em>980 F2d 883 (CA 3, 1992), for example, the Third Circuit reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded the case for a new trial because the government had failed to meet its burden of establishing a sufficient noncharacter purpose for admission of the defendant\u2019s prior drug convictions. After expressing its concern that, although the proponents of Rule 404(b) evidence \u201cwill hardly admit it, the reasons proffered to admit prior act evidence may often be [P]otemkin village, because the motive, we suspect, is often mixed between an urge to show some other consequential fact as well as to impugn the defendant\u2019s character,\u201d <em>Sampson </em>at 886, the court described the contours of the government\u2019s burden when seeking the admission of prior crimes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-5\">If the government offers prior offense evidence, it must clearly articulate how that evidence fits into a chain of logical inferences, no link of which can be the inference that because the defendant committed drug offenses before, he therefore is more likely to have committed this one. . . . Thus, the burden on the government is not onerous. All that is needed is some showing of a proper relevance. Whereupon the trial court must judge the government\u2019s proffered reason, the potential for confusion and abuse, and the significance of the evidence, and decide whether its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect. <em>[Id. </em>at 887-888.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Federal circuits similarly requiring the government to articulate, in a clear and logical manner, at least one proper noncharacter purpose for admission of prior acts evidence include: <em>United States v Rackstraw, </em>7 F3d 1476, 1478-1479 (CA 10, 1993) (\u201cWhen offering 404(b) evidence, the government \u2018must articulate precisely the evidential hypothesis by which a fact of consequence may be inferred from the evidence of other acts.\u2019 . . .

However, the term \u201cinclusionary\u201d can be deceptive. The distinction between MRE 404(b) as a rule of \u201cinclusion\u201d as opposed to a rule of \u201cexclusion\u201d does not signify a shift to a more liberal policy toward the admission of prior act evidence. The \u201cinclusionary\u201d theory merely recognizes that similar acts can be admissible despite the inference to character so long as there is at least one proper noncharacter-based inference linking the prior act to the ultimate inference, and that, contrary to the position taken at common law, Rule 404(b)\u2019s list of proper purposes is nonexclusive. As Wright and Graham explain in their influential treatise on the Federal Rules of Evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">The common law rule has been described as \u201can unctuous, but easily circumvented rule of exclusion.\u201d Wigmore stated it this way: \u201cThe doing of another criminal act, not a part of the issue, is . . . not admissible as evidence of the doing of the criminal act charged, except when offered for the specific purpose of evidencing Design, Plan, Motive, Identity, Intent, or other relevant fact . . . distinct from Moral Character.\u201d While the general rule of exclusion is often applauded- \u2014 and occasionally enforced \u2014 it is the exceptions that are of most practical significance. Courts have found it difficult to distinguish the rule from the exceptions and Professor Stone, in two influential articles, argued that the true rule was the reverse of the one stated by Wigmore; i.e., evidence of other crimes is admissible except when it proves nothing but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>propensity of the defendant to engage in criminal conduct. Professor Stone\u2019s version of the rule \u2014 -usually referred to as the \u201cinclusionary\u201d or \u201cpositive\u201d rule as against Wigmore\u2019s \u201cexclusionary\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d formulation \u2014 has been favored by many commentators and adopted by some courts, but the majority rule at common law took the form stated by Wigmore. [22 Wright &amp; Graham, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 5239, pp 428-432.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">The \u201cinclusionary\u201d theory thus recognizes the rule\u2019s restrictive application to evidence offered solely to prove criminal propensity, a point that was settled before <em>VanderVliet, </em>but does not require courts to err on the side of admission, or to admit evidence that would not have been admissible before <em>VanderVliet. </em>See <em>United States v Figueroa, </em>618 F2d 934, 939, n 2 (CA 2, 1980) (\u201cThe exclusionary approach to similar act evidence obliges the trial court to determine whether the issue sought to be proved is among the traditional exceptions to the rule barring prior act evidence; the inclusionary approach permits the evidence to be used to prove any issue other than propensity, but the trial court is still obliged to ask, \u2018Is the evidence in any way relevant to a fact in issue otherwise than by merely showing propensity?\u2019 \u201d Stone, <em>The rule of exclusion of similar fact evidence: America, </em>51 Harv L R 988, 1004 [1938]).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b471-14\"> Imwinkelried, whom the dissent, <em>post </em>at 417, ironically accuses the majority of citing selectively, expressly rejects, as contrary to the plain language of the rule, the dissent\u2019s contention that \u201can intermediate noncharacter inference is required only where the prior act is offered to prove conduct\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-15\">The second sentence of Rule 404(b) refers to \u201cidentity\u201d as a permissible use of uncharged misconduct evidence. However, no one would suggest that Rule 404(b) permits the prosecutor to invite the jury to reach the conclusion of identity through an intermediate inference of character. The second sentence also alludes to \u201cintent.\u201d By parity urging of reasoning, the rule should be construed as prohibiting the prosecutor from urging the jury to reach that conclusion through an intermediate inference of the defendant\u2019s disposition of a certain mens rea. The better-reasoned cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>require the prosecutor to reach the ultimate inference of mens rea without relying on an intermediate inference of character. [Imwinkelried, Uncharged Misconduct Evidence, \u00a7 5:01.50, p 4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Under the dissent\u2019s view, prior convictions offered to prove a defendant\u2019s state of mind are admissible as a matter of course, subject only to MRE 403 balancing. Given that MRE 403 already applies to all offers of evidence, however, it strains logic to suggest that MRE 404(b) erects no barrier to the admission of such evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\"> The rationale for the exclusion of character evidence to establish mens rea, as described by Imwinkelried, is twofold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">One is that if the jury must consciously focus on the issue of the defendant\u2019s character, there is a grave risk that at a subconscious level, they will be tempted to punish the defendant for his or her uncharged misconduct. That risk is certainly present when the jury addresses the question of whether the defendant has a propensity for forming a mens rea. The jury might be repulsed by the defendant\u2019s \u201ccriminal mind.\u201d The other probative danger underpinning the character evidence prohibition is the risk that the jurors will overestimate the probative value of character as a predictor of conduct. That risk is also applicable when the jury reasons from the defendant\u2019s propensity for a mens rea to the conclusion that the defendant had a guilty state of mind on the charged occasion. The cognitive and volitional aspects of conduct account in large part for the unpredictability of human behavior. [Imwinkelried, n 9 <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5:01.50, pp 3-4. See <em>People v Schweitzer, </em>23 Mich 301, 304 (1871).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b472-10\"> We infer the prosecution\u2019s reliance on the doctrine of chances from his opening and closing statements. In his opening statement, the prosecutor explained the relevance of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-11\">An additional piece of evidence that you\u2019re going to hear, ladies and gentlemen, will be testimony from other officers, other officers who came into contact with the Defendant in 1988. And at that time, you will hear testimony from Oakland County Narcotics Enforcement Team officers who purchased one-half kilogram or 500 grams of cocaine from the Defendant in June of 1988. . . . [T]hat evidence is going to show that the Defendant obviously knew that the cocaine was in his car, that somebody didn\u2019t leave this valuable amount, this much cocaine in his car without his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>knowing it. And it will show that the defendant, at the time he possessed this cocaine, intended to deliver it, that he intended to deliver the cocaine in 1988.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">And in closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">[D]id [Defendant] know the cocaine was there? In 1988, he delivered a half kilogram of cocaine to Deputy Moore at the Diplomat Towers Apartments in Southfield, Michigan. It\u2019s common sense, ladies and gentlemen. Based upon these facts that are admitted into evidence, they clearly show that the Defendant knew the cocaine was there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">And later:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-11\">[T]he fact that he was convicted in 1988 for delivery of a half kilogram of cocaine, 500 grams of cocaine, inescapably leads to the conclusion that he knew the cocaine was there.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b474-6\"> Weinstein states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">In each individual case, the trial judge must decide whether the proffered evidence tends to make the consequential fact more or less probable. If the connection between the other crime and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>charged crime is strong, admission may be appropriate. If the connection is weak, exclusion is generally sound. If enough time has passed, the other crime may be of such attenuated probative value as to warrant exclusion. [2 Weinstein, n 7 <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 404.21(2)(c), pp 404-54 to 404-55.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\"> A simple analogy will prove the point. If the prosecutor were \u201coffering\u201d evidence of a prior arson conviction to prove that the defendant knowingly possessed cocaine with the intent to deliver, even the dissent would likely concede that the offer would fail the initial test of relevancy on the ground that the two acts were too dissimilar. Under this scenario, the evidence is inadmissible even though it is \u201coffered\u201d for a \u201cproper purpose\u201d under Rule 404(b), that is, to prove knowledge and intent. If, however, defendant\u2019s prior crime involved the concealment of drugs in the dashboard of his car, that evidence would likely be admissible under the doctrine of chances because of the stark similarity of the two crimes. There is, then, a continuum upon which each proffered prior act must be placed; the more similar the prior act to the charged crime, the closer the evidence to the admissibility threshold. Cases cited by the prosecution and the dissent that have admitted prior crimes to prove knowledge and intent have similarly required a close factual nexus between the prior and charged crimes. See, e.g., <em>United States v Rackstraw, </em>n 6 <em>supra </em>at 1479 (\u201cWe have long recognized the relevance of prior crimes in the context of narcotics violations where the uncharged misconduct is close in time and similar in method to the charged scheme and where knowledge . . . was at issue\u201d); <em>United States v Garcia, </em>983 F2d 1160, 1173 (CA 1, 1993) (\u201cIn this case, there is a close nexus between the past act and the current charges\u201d); <em>United States v Hernandez, </em>84 F3d 931, 935 (CA 7, 1996) (\u201cwe agree that Hernandez\u2019 prior conviction satisfied the similarity/proximity requirements\u201d); <em>United States v Adrian, </em>978 F2d 486, 493 (CA 9, 1992) (\u201cIt does not appear from the record whether the prior convictions were similar enough and proximate enough in time to the present offenses to make them highly relevant to appellee\u2019s intent\u201d); see also <em>United States v Hernandez-Miranda, </em>601 F2d 1104, 1108 (CA 9, 1979) (\u201cWhen a prior criminal act is relied upon to prove intent or knowledge, similarity between the two events must be shown to establish the threshold requirement of relevance\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b477-7\"> Rather than attempting to explain the specific logical progression that makes either knowledge or intent more likely in light of the defendant\u2019s prior crime, the dissent simply argues that the involvement of cocaine in defendant\u2019s 1988 conviction alone \u201cmakes [it] more probable than not that defendant knowingly possessed drugs with the intent to distribute them\u201d in the present case. <em>Post </em>at 414. This is a poorly disguised propensity argument, which is precisely what Rule 404(b) expressly forbids. <em>United States v Betts, </em>16 F3d 748, 759 (CA 7, 1994); <em>People v Beasley, </em>809 F2d 1273 (CA 7, 1987); <em>Arias-Montoya, </em>n 6 supra; <em>United States v Lynn, </em>856 F2d 430 (CA 1, 1988); <em>United States v Mehrmanesh, </em>689 F2d 822 (CA 9, 1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b478-6\"> The dissent urges us to defer to the trial court\u2019s balancing of prejudicial effect versus probative force because our \u201crejection of the trial court\u2019s balancing under Rule 403\u201d is simply a substitution of our \u201cjudgment for that of the trial court.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 439. However, the trial court\u2019s misapplication of MRE 404(b) caused it to overvalue the probativeness of the evidence. Having held that the evidence had no relevance apart from the impermissible character inference, we refuse to abdicate our responsibility to review the circuit court\u2019s balancing under MRE 403 and to reverse that ruling where necessary to prevent injustice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b479-8\"> The prosecutor and dissent argue that any undue prejudice was offset by the following cautionary instruction given by the judge at the conclusion of the trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">You have heard evidence that was introduced to show that the Defendant committed a crime for which he is not on trial. If you believe this evidence, you must be very careful only to consider it for certain purposes.

Although the prior conviction was purportedly \u201coffered\u201d to prove knowledge and intent, the <em>only </em>real relevance of the prior conviction was to depict the defendant as a drug dealer. Against this, the limiting instruction was not limiting at all. See <em>United States v Wright, </em>901 F2d 68, 70 (CA 7, 1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b480-10\"> The dissent\u2019s statement that \u201c[a]ny error in admitting the prior acts evidence was slight or negligible\u201d ignores the fact that the prosecution was allowed to parade the defendant\u2019s prior conviction before the jury constantly throughout this brief trial. <em>Post </em>at 443. The jury heard detailed information about the prior arrest in the prosecution\u2019s opening and closing statements, the direct examination of the arresting officer from 1988, and in the cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s wife. This repetition greatly enhanced the danger of unfair prejudice arising from the admission of defendant\u2019s prior conviction. The decision of the First Circuit in <em>Arias-Montoya, n 6 supra, </em>is instructive on this point. In a case that is remarkably similar to the case at bar, the court ruled that evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior drug conviction was improperly admitted, but that the admission of the evidence constituted harmless error. The court found \u201cparticularly significant\u201d the fact that, \u201caside from eliciting two lines of testimony about the 1983 conviction, the prosecutor made no further reference to it, either at trial or ... in his closing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 714.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b480-9\">Boyle, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYr\">(dissenting).

As we observed in <em>VanderVliet, supra, </em>fear of the jury conflicts with the Rules of Evidence and \u201c-with the intuitive sense that some bad acts evidence is so powerfully probative that it would pervert the truth-seeking process to prevent a jury from using what looks like ordinary common sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We restate the facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution. On September 22, 1992, ten months after his release from prison on parole from a three-to thirty-year term of imprisonment imposed in 1989 for conspiracy to deliver and delivery of cocaine, defendant was arrested and charged with possession with intent to deliver 50 to 225 grams of cocaine. A beeper was found during a \u201cpat down\u201d of defendant. Six ziplock baggies containing cocaine residue and doper fold papers were found in his jacket pocket, and there was a digital scale in a box under the car seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Further investigation revealed cocaine residue on the scale, a razor blade in the box with the scale, an additional ziplock baggie in defendant\u2019s wallet, a mobile phone, and $455 in cash (mostly in ten and twenty dollar bills) in his pants pocket. In an area behind the dashboard above the glove box, two subsequent searches of the impounded vehicle produced a large plastic bag containing cocaine weighing 173.1 grams, and a second bag containing several rocks of cocaine, one weighing 11.74 grams, and sixty-six individually packaged small rocks of crack cocaine in baggies (one rock tested weighed 0.16 grams), and additional empty baggies. Each baggie contained a twenty-dollax rock of crack, and the total street value of all the cocaine was estimated to be $36,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">At the in limine motion hearing<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the prosecutor\u2019s notice of intent to prove prior misconduct, defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>counsel contended that defendant did not know that there was cocaine concealed behind the glove box and consequently that he was not knowingly in possession and could not have had an intent to deliver.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The judge summed up the defense position by stating: \u201c[A]s I understand the controverted facts are that you say your client had no knowledge whatsoever of the \u2014 [cocaine] so he couldn\u2019t even be in possession much less have an intent to deliver. Am I correct on that?\u201d Defense attorney responded, \u201cOf the amount that was found behind the glove box. Correct.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>trial court found the prior act relevant because, if defendant was unaware that he was in possession of the bags found above the glove box, he was innocent of possession of the larger amount of cocaine. Thus, both general mens rea and the intent to deliver were in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The jurors were instructed during voir dire that the defendant had a previous conviction involving delivery of a controlled substance, and that it was \u201cvery important\u201d that the crime was not admissible to prove character.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In final instructions, the court again cautioned the jury that if it believed defendant committed another crime, it could only be considered on the question whether defendant specifically meant or intended to commit the crime charged.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant requested a charge on possession without intent to deliver and argued that he should be convicted only of possession of a lesser amount or should be acquitted because of reasonable doubt. The jury was instructed on both possession with intent to deliver and \u201csimple possession.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The jury found him guilty as charged, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>and the Court of Appeals affirmed. Unpublished memorandum opinion, issued October 10, 1995 (Docket No. 165956).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">THE MAJORITY\u2019S IMPOSITION OF A HEIGHTENED BURDEN UNDER RULE 404(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">When the cobwebs are swept away, the majority ultimately rests on one simple but far-reaching proposition: Imwinkelried\u2019s thesis that the rules should be amended to require the proponent to show that the probative value of uncharged misconduct outweighs the prejudicial danger. Imwinkelried, <em>The need to amend federal Rule of Evidence 404(b): The threat to the future of the federal Rules of Evidence, </em>30 Vill L R 1465, 1491 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Assuming arguendo that the Court has a retained common-law power to exclude the evidence<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that the common-law rule is preferable, the result is inconsistent with the language and philosophy of Rule 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">If the rules are inteipreted according to their plain meaning, they afford no basis to reintroduce the common-law approach to excluding relevant evidence by superimposing additional restrictions on the face of the language. Imwinkelried, <em>A brief defense of the Supreme Court\u2019s approach to the interpretation of the federal Rules of Evidence, </em>27 Ind L R 267, 280 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>(1993). To repeat, logically relevant evidence is admissible, except \u201cas otherwise provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">It is precisely for this reason that the United States Supreme Court in <em>Huddleston v United States, </em>485 US 681; 108 S Ct 1496; 99 L Ed 2d 771 (1988), long ago rejected the contention that the common-law foundation for admitting uncharged misconduct, i.e., clear and convincing evidence that the act occurred, applied under Rule 404(b). In unanimously rejecting the claim, the Court observed that Rule 104(b) sets out the procedure for determining preliminary facts, Rules 401 and 402 establish the broad principles of admissibility, and Rule 403 allows the trial court to exclude. The Court concluded that the text did not authorize the superimposition of the common-law rule as \u201ca level of judicial oversight that is nowhere apparent from the language of that provision, but is simply inconsistent with the legislative history behind Rule 404(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Rule 404(b) \u201cincorporates rule 403\u2019s balancing test, requiring the opponent to convince the judge that the prejudicial dangers substantially outweigh the probative value.\u201d Imwinkelried, <em>The need to amend, supra </em>at 1479-1480. The burden inquiry under Rule 403 is distinct from that of Rule 609. Imwinkelried and Margolin state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">The wording of Rule 403 has remained unchanged since its adoption in 1975. However, prior to its 1990 amendment, Rule 609(a)(1), governing conviction impeachment, included the following language:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-8\">\u201cFor the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if elicited from the witness or established by public record during cross-examination but only if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>crime . . . was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which the witness was convicted, and the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs the prejudicial effect to the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">Note the differences between the wording of the two balancing tests. Rule 403 is cast in the passive voice: \u201cits probative value is . . . outweighed by the danger[s].\u201d In contrast, the balancing test in the former version of Rule 609 is in the active voice: \u201cthe probative value . . . outweighs the prejudicial effect.\u201d In addition, Rule 403 includes the adverb \u201csubstantially,\u201d which was absent from Rule 609.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">On its face, the amendment indicates that the Rule 403 balancing test differs from the test set out in the last clause of the amendment. A committee note accompanies the amendment. The Note explicitly differentiates between the two balancing tests. On the one hand, the Note states that when the prosecution\u2019s conviction evidence is subject to Rule 609(a)\u2019s test, \u201cthe government [must] show that the probative value of [the] convictions as impeachment evidence outweighs their prejudicial effect.\u201d On the other hand, the Note declares that if conviction evidence is sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>ject to Rule 403\u2019s test, the opponent must \u201cpoint to a real danger of prejudice that is sufficient to outweigh substantially the probative value of the conviction for impeachment purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">The amended language of Rule 609(a) and the supporting Note should end the split of authority among the lower federal courts over the proper construction of Rule 403. It is now well established that Rule 403 assigns the party opposing the admission .... [Imwinkelried &amp; Margolin, <em>The case for the admissibility of defense testimony about customary political practices in official corruption prosecutions, </em>29 Am Crim L R 1, 29, 31-32 (1991).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The majority has thus simply amended Rule 404(b) by imposing its \u201cjudicial oversight\u201d on the discretionary decisions of the trial bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">The analysis and conclusion reveal the majority\u2019s angst regarding two of the fundamental principles underlying the Rules of Evidence \u2014 the basic premise of MRE 402<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> that all relevant evidence is admissible unless expressly precluded, and the corollary policy that the appellate court must defer to the primacy of the trial bench, constrained by the broad discretion invested in that bench under Rule 403.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> These principles have been recently reiterated and reinforced in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>Old Chief v United States, </em>519 US 172; 117 S Ct 644; 136 L Ed 2d 574 (1997), in which the Supreme Court deemed erroneous a claim that the fact to which the bad acts evidence is directed must be in dispute or the evidence is irrelevant under Rule 401. Noting that the advisory committee notes to Rule 401 state that \u201c[t]he fact . . . need not be in dispute,\u201d and that relevant evidence is evidence having any probative value, the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\">If, then, relevant evidence is inadmissible in the presence of other evidence related to it, its exclusion must rest not on the ground that the other evidence has rendered it \u201cirrelevant,\u201d but on its character as unfairly prejudicial, cumulative or the like, its relevance notwithstanding. <em>[Id. </em>at 179.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">The majority accomplishes its result by holding that evidence of defendant\u2019s prior misconduct, conviction of conspiracy to deliver, and delivery of 225 to 600 grams of cocaine was not \u201crelevant\u201d to an issue \u201cother than the defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the crime\u201d and by asserting that it is the prosecutor\u2019s burden \u201cto weave a logical thread linking the prior act to the ultimate inference.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 390. The majority purports to concede that defendant\u2019s knowledge of the presence of cocaine is logically relevant to the element of possession of cocaine and intent to deliver. <em>People v Wolfe, </em>440 Mich 508, 519; 489 NW2d 748 (1992). <em>Ante </em>at 389. However, the majority concludes that because there was an insufficient factual nexus between the prior conviction and the present charged offense to warrant admission under the doctrine of chances, \u201c[t]he prior conviction <em>only </em>demonstrates that the defendant has been around drugs in the past and [was] the kind of person who would knowingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>possess and intend to deliver large amounts of cocaine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396-397 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The evidence does not simply demonstrate that the defendant has been around drugs in the past; it makes more probable than not that defendant knowingly possessed drugs with the intent to distribute them. While the rationale for the majority\u2019s conclusion is not evident, it seems to rest on two propositions: the first, that it is the prosecutor\u2019s burden to \u201carticulate [] a proper noncharacter purpose for admission of the defendant\u2019s prior drug conviction\u201d and explain \u201chow the evidence relates to the recited purposes,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>ante </em>at 385-386, 387, and the second, that there is an insufficient factual nexus between the prior act and the charged offense. The rationale is, in either event, logically flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">A. THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S BURDEN</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">To the extent that the first rationale focuses on language in <em>People v Golochowicz, </em>413 Mich 298; 319 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>NW2d 518 (1982), that might have been read to require the formulaic approach of <em>United States v Sampson, </em>980 F2d 883 (CA 3, 1992),<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> we expressly rejected the concept that the key to admissibility under Rule 404 rests on the incantation of magic words in <em>VanderVliet, supra </em>at 65-67. To be sure, the proponent of evidence who fails to demonstrate relevance runs the risk that the trial court will exclude the evidence. However, and quite obviously, if the evidence is admitted, the question on review is not what the prosecutor said, but whether it was error to admit the evidence. If the rule were otherwise, the prosecutor\u2019s inarticulate formulation of a theory would cause reversal on appeal though the evidence was properly admitted. <em>People v Engelman, </em>434 Mich 204, 223, n 27; 453 NW2d 656 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">1. THE LEGAL PRECEDENT: THE INCLUSIONARY APPROACH</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Rule 403 places the burden on the opponent of the admissibility of logically relevant evidence to effectuate the liberal philosophy of Rule 402 favoring admission of all relevant evidence. Thus, the construction of Rule 404(b) \u201cas a sentinel at the gate,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 390, ignores that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">the prosecution [should not be deprived] of evidence with multiple utility; if, indeed, there were a justification for receiving evidence of the nature of prior acts ... to prove \u201cmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident,\u201d .... Rule 404(b) guarantees the opportunity to seek its admission. <em>[Old Chief, supra </em>at 190.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>To hold otherwise is to effectively resurrect the common-law rule of exclusion and reject the approach that \u201c[t]he exclusion of relevant evidence under rule 403 is an extraordinary remedy, and therefore courts should exercise the power to exclude cautiously and sparingly.\u201d hnwinkehied, <em>The need to amend, supra </em>at 1478.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The majority\u2019s suggestion that the prosecutor\u2019s failure to carry its burden to demonstrate a proper theory deprives the evidence of probative force conflicts with the policy of Rule 402 that expressly declares this Court\u2019s support of inclusionary admissibility. The majority\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he general rule is more easily stated than applied,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 383, is also a distortion of the language of the rule and of our prior precedent. The \u201cgeneral rule\u201d is not that such evidence is inadmissible. The general rule, as most recently recognized in <em>People v Starr, </em>457 Mich 490; 577 NW2d 673 (1998),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> is that, like all other evidence, such evidence is admissible if relevant under Rules 401 and 402. The majority\u2019s initial premise thus misconstrues both Rules 403 and 404 and rests on a premise that has been expressly overruled. <em>VanderVliet, supra </em>at 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">If the majority seriously contends that the prior acts evidence was irrelevant to the proposition whether it is more or less likely that defendant did not possess the drugs with knowledge, or that he did not intend to distribute them, the majority\u2019s conclusion is, as noted, nothing less than remarkable. The majority purports to recognize that all evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>is logically relevant, that is, that makes more probable than not a fact in issue, is admissible, but nevertheless concludes that the prior act was \u201cmere character evidence masquerading as evidence of \u2018knowledge\u2019 and \u2018intent.\u2019 \u201d However, it is possible that the majority simply does not understand the theory it employs. Evidence supporting this explanation for the majority\u2019s conclusion can be found in the statements that the question is whether there is some \u201cintermediate inference\u201d and that \u201cno such intermediate inference has been established.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 391-392. The reason prior acts evidence relevant to state of mind is so universally admitted<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> is that it does not require any ultimate inference regarding the defendant\u2019s conduct (the ultimate inference), and it does not require any inference regarding propensity (the intermediate inference). What the majority seemingly fails to understand is that, as recognized in <em>People v Engleman, supra, </em>and <em>VanderVliet, supra </em>at 85, an intermediate noncharacter inference is required only where the prior act is offered to prove conduct. As noted by 22 Wright &amp; Graham, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 5242, pp 487-488, in the case of intent, the use of other crimes evidence can be defended on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>two grounds, it does not require inference to propensity and involve any inference to the defendant\u2019s conduct. To the extent that the majority believes that Rule 404 always precludes other acts evidence unless an intermediate inference to noncharacter is demonstrated, it is incorrect. Either ground allows other acts evidence to escape the common-law prohibition. Plainly put, Rule 404(a) is avoided when the ultimate inference is not to conduct, or the ultimate inference is to conduct but the intermediate inference is to non-character.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">However, because every federal circuit interpreting the rule repudiates the analysis employed by the majority regarding intent,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> as has this Court, we are unable to conclude that the analysis employed is simply an honest mistake. Moreover, the majority\u2019s references to <em>Allen, supra, </em>suggest that the explanation for its holding is not a matter of misunderstanding. To effectuate the directive of liberal admissibility and nonintervention in trial court discretion, the proper inquiry on review is not whether there are multiple inferences, but whether the jury can make one inference that does not include character as a necessary link. What the majority is actually doing when it says that the evidence demonstrated only the \u201cdefendant\u2019s propensity to form a certain mens rea,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 397, is to heighten the burden of admissibility under Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>404(b) to relevance \u201cplus.\u201d Given the directive of Rule 403, that it is the opponent\u2019s burden to overcome the admission of relevant evidence, the conclusion is inescapable that the majority\u2019s actual purpose is to retake ground ceded by the rules to the jury and the trial bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The Court made the rule. Moreover, there is no claim made here that what the Court made it cannot \u201cunmake.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> What cannot be honestly claimed, however, is that the majority is faithfully applying the inclusionary approach of our Rules of Evidence.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">2. MULTIPLE UTILITY: AVAILABLE INFERENCES</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">Authority admitting such evidence is legion. However, we begin detailed analysis of the majority\u2019s contention that there is no inference other than to character with an extensive quotation from the en banc decision of the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, <em>United States v Crowder (Crowder </em>I), 318 US App DC 396, 402; 87 F3d 1405 (1996), on reconsideration of its original holding excluding the evidence of a prior sale of drugs in a drug case, vacated in light of <em>Old Chief, supra, </em>by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">In <em>United States v Crowder (Crowder II), </em>329 US App DC 418, 423-426; 141 F3d 1202 (1998), the court noted the multiple utility of Rule 404(b) and reversed the prior decision holding that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>defendant\u2019s offer to stipulate to an element of an offense does not render the government\u2019s other crimes evidence inadmissible under Rule 404(b) to prove that element, even if the defendant\u2019s proposed stipulation is unequivocal, and even if the defendant agrees to a jury instruction of the sort mentioned in our earlier opinion. See <em>[Crowder I </em>at 402. The court observed that] [o]ther rules of evidence may bear on the admissibility of evidence satisfying Rule 404(b) .... For now it is enough to repeat the words of the advisory committee on Rule 404(b): if evidence is offered for a purpose Rule 404(b) permits, such as proving knowledge or intent, Rule 404(b) \u201cdoes not require that the evidence be excluded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-7\">The Supreme Court made these points to distinguish between \u201cstipulations to the status element of a crime, which can be forced upon the prosecution, and stipulations to other elements of a crime, which the prosecution should remain free to reject.\u201d . . . Proof of status, the Court said, concerns an element that is \u201cwholly independent]] of the concrete events\u201d of the charged crime. <em>Old Chief </em>[519 US 190]. In contrast, the elements of intent and knowledge are at the core of the offenses charged in the cases before us. Replacing proof of these elements with stipulations creates \u201ca gap in the story of a defendant\u2019s subsequent criminality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>[at 191]. To be sure, other crimes evidence will typically relate to events more or less removed in time from the charged offense. But that is true of many other kinds of evidence. A husband\u2019s prior physical abuse of his wife while he was in a jealous rage may suggest his motive for murdering her; an incriminating statement made after the offense may reveal intent; tangible evidence found later may suggest identity. Evidence about what the defendant said or did at other times can be a critical part of the story of a crime, and may be introduced to prove what the defendant was thinking or doing at the time of the offense. This is true regardless whether the defendant\u2019s actions on those other occasions were in themselves criminal. <em>Old Chief </em>estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>lishes that the prosecution cannot be forced to stipulate away the force of such evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">The government\u2019s proof of Crowder\u2019s other crime also had legitimate probative force with respect to matters beyond those encompassed in his proposed stipulation. A \u201cpiece of evidence,\u201d the Court wrote in <em>Old Chief, </em>\u201cmay address any number of separate elements, striking hard just because it shows so much at once,\u201d <em>[id. </em>at 187]. Rule 404(b) evidence will often have such multiple utility, showing at once intent, knowledge, motive, preparation and the like. Proof of an individual\u2019s intent to commit an act may itself serve as proof that the individual committed the act, as the Supreme Court recognized more than a century ago. See <em>Mutual Life Ins Co v Hillmon, </em>145 US 285, 296; 12 S Ct 909, 912-913; 36 L Ed 706 (1892). In proving that a defendant intended to distribute crack cocaine, for instance, the government might simultaneously be showing the defendant\u2019s motive to possess the crack, which Rule 404(b) permits. Intent would thereby serve as an intermediate fact from which the jury could infer another intermediate fact\u2014 motive \u2014 from which it could in turn infer the element of possession. Thus, other-offense evidence of intent would have probative value not just on the intent element, but also on the possession element of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">The familiar language of Rule 403 is: \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice . . . .\u201d In these cases, the concern about \u201cprejudice\u201d focused on the danger of the jury using the other crimes evidence in a way the rules do not permit \u2014 to conclude that because the defendant committed some other crime, he must have committed the one charged in the indictment. This danger, of course, will be present in every Rule 404(b) case. But that alone cannot give rise to a per se rule of exclusion, as Crowder and Davis argued when we first heard their cases en banc. In adopting the Federal Rules of Evidence, Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>gress \u201cwas not nearly so concerned with the potential prejudicial effect of Rule 404(b) evidence as it was with ensuring that restrictions would not be placed on the admission of such evidence.\u201d <em>Huddleston [v United </em>States], 485 US [681] 688-689 [108 S Ct 1496; 99 L Ed 2d 771 (1988)]; see also H. R. Rep No. 93-650 at 7 (1973) (noting that Rule 404(b)\u2019s second sentence is intended to place emphasis on admissibility). As to Rule 403, each case will turn on the discretionary judgment of the trial court and its assessment, not of relevance, but of the evidentiary value of the government\u2019s Rule 404(b) evidence. On the same side of the balance, the trial court will take into account the effect of a limiting jury instruction to protect the rights of the accused. See Fed R Evid 403, advisory committee notes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The majority\u2019s analysis of Rule 404(b) is fundamentally at odds with the inclusionary approach expressed in <em>Crowder, </em>unanimously endorsed by this Court in <em>VanderVliet, </em>and by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Old Chief, supra. </em>Rule 404(b) guarantees the opportunity to seek the admission of evidence relevant to an issue other than character, <em>Old Chief, supra </em>at 190. The admissibility of the evidence is to be determined by the trial court on a sensitive case-by-case balancing under Rule 403. The exercise is necessarily ad hoc, reversible on appeal only for an abuse of discretion. The majority\u2019s approach repudiates these fundamental propositions and undermines the trial court\u2019s authority to gauge the likely effect of the evidence in the particular context presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">3. MULTIPLE UTILITY: ANALYSIS OF AVAILABLE INFERENCES</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">The majority does not question that a general denial allows proof of the extrinsic act.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Crawford <em>raised </em>a mere presence defense that specifically challenged the prosecution\u2019s proofs of constructive possession with intent to distribute by creating a material issue that put his state of mind at issue. <em>United States v Adrian, </em>978 F2d 486 (CA 9, 1992).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s denial by affirmative evidence that he knew the cocaine was in the car was a direct challenge to two mental states essential to sustain a conviction. It was a direct denial of the element of knowing possession and intent to distribute in the principal charge. Under the cognate charge of possession, it was also a direct challenge to whether he intended to distribute some or all the drugs. <em>United States v Thomas, </em>58 F3d 1313 (CA 8, 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The instant case, like <em>United States v Rubio-Estrada, </em>857 F2d 845 (CA 1, 1988), is a \u201cfairly typical instance\u201d of a drug offense. While the majority professes not to know how the evidence of defendant\u2019s prior act made more likely his intent and knowledge in the instant case, the analysis is not complex. Evidence of defendant\u2019s experience in dealing drugs was probative of knowledgeable possession and of intent to distribute. For example, in a case where the defendant contested whether he knew drugs were in the freezer room or under the chicken coop of the farmhouse where he lived, the court identified the inference as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>one who fives on a farm with marijuana in the freezer room and under the chicken coop and has a prior possession conviction is more likely to know about the presence of marijuana than one who lives on such a farm and does not have a past possession conviction. . . . The jury might have thought a past possessor is more likely to associate with those who use and keep and talk freely about nearby marijuana; it might have thought a past possessor is more likely to spot marijuana under a chicken coop; it might have thought a past possessor is less likely to throw away marijuana if he comes across it. None of these inferences \u2014 all supporting a conclusion of \u201cknowledge\u201d \u2014 depends entirely upon the \u201cbad character/propensity\u201d chain of reasoning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">. . . Thus, they escape the absolute bar of the Rule\u2019s first sentence. <em>[United States v Moccia, </em>681 F2d 61, 63 (CA 1, 1982).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Similarly, in <em>United States v </em>Nickens, 955 F2d 112, 124 (CA 1, 1992), the defendant, allegedly a respectable citizen traveling for recreational and medical reasons, claimed to be an innocent bystander duped by two young men who had offered to help him when he had difficulty on a trip to Ecuador. He contended that the young men, while purporting to help him, switched his suitcases for ones that contained concealed cocaine. The court recognized that a permissible inference that could be drawn from admission of a prior sale of cocaine was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">a person who has had experience in selling cocaine was more likely than one without such experience to know how drug traffickers operate. Such a person, the jury might infer, is more likely to be familiar with how to conceal cocaine and with false bottom suitcases, and is less likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>to have been fooled by seemingly friendly young men eager to come to the aid of a complete stranger.[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Because the juiy might have drawn the permissible inference that a person who has had experience in selling cocaine was more likely than one without such experience to know how drug traffickers operate, the evidence was admissible under Rule 404(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">As the district court recognized, the two acts \u201cmerely involve[d] different steps in the narcotics distribution chain.\u201d While there is a possibility that jurors may draw impermissible inferences about defendant\u2019s character or propensity from the fact of his prior conviction, such a possibility is irrelevant to the first step of the admissibility analysis and to Rule 404(b)\u2019s absolute ban. <em>[Nickens, supra </em>at 125.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">In <em>United States v Sampson, supra, </em>in which the defendant contended that he did not have knowledge of drugs found in his jacket, the court cited cases from every federal circuit, <em>id. </em>at 887, for the principle that where the defendant is charged with a drug offense, drug convictions are admissible to show that the defendant\u2019s acts were not without knowledge and intent. Finally, a classic formulation of the probative noncharacter inference is that of Judge Breyer in <em>Rubio-Estrada, supra, </em>where the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>charged with possession to distribute cocaine found in his house and in which he claimed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">\u201cThere is no real showing here . . . that this defendant knew that that substance was concealed up under his stairs.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 847.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">In words highly relevant to the case at bar, Judge Breyer observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">[A] person previously convicted of cocaine distribution is more likely than one not so convicted to know that electronic scales are used to measure cocaine for sale .... [S]uch a person is more likely to think that a white powder around the scales might be a substance used to cut cocaine . . . [and] a person . . . entering the downstairs closet to find his clothes (as the jury might have thought this defendant sometimes did), ... is more likely than one not previously involved to think that some kind cocaine distribution operation is taking place in his house. . . . Any one of these sets of inferences make it logically somewhat more likely that defendant did know about the cocaine in his house and did intend to distribute it than one who did not have a prior conviction \u2014 or so the jury might reasonably believe. . . . The authority supporting admission of evidence of a past bad act, under circumstances such as those present here, is legion. <em>[Id. </em>at 847-848.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Thus, in the instant case, the jury might have inferred that because the defendant had been convicted of cocaine distribution, he was more likely to have recognized that the visible scale, white powder, and a razor blade were tools of the narcotic trade than one who had not been so convicted. <em>United States v Nickens, supra. </em>It might have inferred that a person with such a prior conviction who discovered tools of the trade in his own car might be more likely to suspect that his car was being used for cocaine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>distribution than one who had not. <em>United States v Rubio-Estrada, supra. </em>It might have inferred that a past possessor was more likely to associate with those who talked freely about the location of hidden cocaine. <em>Moccia, supra. </em>It might have inferred that a person with such knowledge would be more likely to be familiar with how to conceal cocaine in cars, <em>Nick-ens, supra, </em>and it might have inferred that a person with a prior conviction and such knowledge was more likely than one not previously involved to think that cocaine might be present in his car, more likely to look for it in a hidden spot and less likely to get rid of it if he came across it. <em>Moccia, supra. </em>Any one of these sets of inferences make it basically somewhat more likely that defendant did know about the cocaine in his car and did intend to distribute it than one who did not have a prior conviction, \u201cor so the jury might reasonably believe.\u201d <em>Rubio-Estrada, supra </em>at 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">B. DOCTRINE OF CHANCES/FACTUAL NEXUS</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Citing Imwinkelried,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the majority concludes that even if the evidence was relevant to mens rea, it fails <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>of admission under \u201cthe doctrine of chances.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 395. Initially we observe that the majority does not acknowledge that the principal holding of <em>VanderVliet </em>is that when the issue is intent, the test of admissibility is whether the prior act is \u201csufficiently similar to be relevant to intent under the theory of improbability,\u201d <em>VanderVliet, supra </em>at 85, and \u201cthe improbability that the other acts are an unlikely coincidence is relevant to negate a claim of innocent intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85, n 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Because the majority continues to ignore the defendant\u2019s theory of defense, it also bears repeating that the defendant\u2019s theory actually contested intent to distribute by requesting a charge on mere possession. This fact alone would make the mental state in issue, intent to distribute, a basis for admitting the identical state of mind to show intent to distribute. The majority ignores this defense and concludes that it is not admissible on the issue of knowledge or intent to distribute because there is an insufficient nexus between the other acts evidence and the charge in question.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The majority concludes that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>fact that defendant was a drug dealer in 1988 was too remote and too dissimilar from the instant charge to make it more likely than it would otherwise be that he knew of the drugs constructively possessed in the instant case, or that as to the drugs he possessed with knowledge, that he had no intent to distribute.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The proofs established constructive possession of all the drugs, and the defense was a species of accident, that is, although the defendant was in constructive possession of the drugs, his possession was innocent and unknowing because he merely happened to be where the drugs were. Therefore, the principal argument was focused on knowledge of the hidden amount, and the secondary argument was that if defendant possessed some drugs, he did not intend to distribute them.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Mens rea or the mind at fault is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>opposite of innocent intent, which the defense asserted. Where the defendant denies any knowledge of the presence of drugs and asserts a mere presence defense, he is challenging both that he knew he was in possession and that he intended to distribute. <em>United States v Tomberlin, </em>130 F3d 1318, 1320-1321 (CA 8, 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Although the majority quotes Imwinkelried selectively for the proposition that courts should not routinely admit uncharged evidence on the issue of intent, Imwinkelried\u2019s discussion of other acts evidence to negate a claim of accident on a noncharacter theory merits more extensive quotation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">Suppose that the accused is [charged] with possession of a contraband drug. To be wrongful, the possession must be knowing. On the occasion alleged in the indictment, the police discovered cocaine secreted in the trunk of a car driven by the accused. The accused admits the presence of the cocaine in his vehicle but denies mens rea \u2014 he claims that he did not know that the trunk contained cocaine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">At trial, the prosecutor proffers testimony that on two earlier occasions when the accused\u2019s vehicle was stopped by the police, the police found illegal drugs in the car. Under the doctrine of chances, the testimony is relevant to meet the accused\u2019s claim that his state of mind was ignorant and innocent. It is true that innocent persons sometimes find themselves enmeshed in suspicious circumstances. However, everyday experience indicates that that rarely occurs. The more frequently the accused is involved in such circumstances, the less plausible the claim of ignorance. The coincidence defies common sense and reduces <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the likelihood that the accused had an innocent mental state on all these occasions. Considered collectively, the charged and uncharged incidents strengthen the inference that the accused knew of the presence of the cocaine on the charged occasion. In short, just as uncharged misconduct can tend to show an actus reus, the evidence may be logically relevant to prove the existence of the requisite mens rea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">The doctrine of chances does not ask the jury to forecast behavior on the basis of any assumption about character. Instead, the doctrine asks the jurors to do what the pattern jury instructions in many jurisdictions direct them to do, namely, employ their common sense and knowledge of the ways of the world to assess the relative plausibility of competing versions of the disputed events. [Imwinkelried, <em>A small contribution to the debate over the proposed legislation abolishing the character evidence prohibition in sex offense prosecutions, </em>44 Syracuse L R 1125, 1132-1138 (1993).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The doctrine of chances focuses on the trial court\u2019s assessment of the improbability that an individual would be innocently involved in similar activity. This theory of logical relevance does not depend on the intermediate inference of character, but, rather, rests on the objective assessment of the likelihood of fortuitous involvement. The majority correctly observes that Imwinkelried cautions against routine resort to the doctrine of chances<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> to admit misconduct evidence on the issue of intent. However, what the majority fails to acknowledge is that because hnwinkelried\u2019s view is that one prior act is sufficient, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>as the previous quotation illustrates, it does not support the conclusion that illegal drugs found in the trunk would be inadmissible in a charged offense involving illegal drugs in a car. Imwinkeliied\u2019s definition of the doctrine of chances offers a four-part test for admissibility. The test requires assessment of improbability, similarity but not identity of conduct, a temporal relationship between the prior act and the act charged, and a bona fide need for the evidence. Imwinkelried, <em>The use of evidence of an accused\u2019s uncharged misconduct to prove mens rea: The doctrines which threaten to engulf the character evidence prohibition, </em>51 Ohio St L J 575, 597-600 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Imwinkelried states that in terms of logical relevance, even one act can be material.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The decisions should be made case by case, focusing on relative frequency rather than the absolute number of incidents. Imwinkelried, Uncharged Misconduct Evidence, \u00a7 5:06, p 14. The trial court must conclude that the evidence alters the probability that the defendant had the requisite state of mind at the time of the charged offense. However, \u201c[i]f the ordinary incidence of innocent involvement in such situations would be only once per decade and the defendant has been involved in such situations twice within a decade that <em>extraordinary </em>coincidence triggers the doctrine of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>chances.\u201d <em>Id., </em>1992 cum supp, \u00a7 5:06, p 125 (emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">C. FEDERAL AUTHORITY: PRIOR ACTS FOR INTENT AND KNOWLEDGE</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The federal circuits follow a roughly similar four-part test that appears to apply a limiting gloss without explicit reference to the doctrine of chances. The prior act or acts 1) must be relevant to a material issue other than propensity, 2) there must be sufficient evidence that defendant committed the other crime, 3) the probative value must not be substantially outweighed by prejudice, and 4) the other acts must be similar to and not too remote in time<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> from the crime charged. <em>United States v Curry, </em>79 F3d 1489, 1495 (CA 7, 1996); <em>United States v Wiley, </em>29 F3d 345, 350 (CA 8, 1994); <em>United States v Rubio-Villareal, </em>927 F2d 1495, 1503 (CA 9, 1991); <em>United States v Perez-Garcia, </em>904 F2d 1534, 1539 (CA 11, 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">For example, in <em>United States v Hernandez, </em>84 F3d 931, 935 (CA 7, 1996), the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit considered a case in which the defendant, on deplaning at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare Airport from Los Angeles, denied that a suitcase containing two kilograms of cocaine and one hundred grams of heroin belonged to him. The gov-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>eminent offered evidence of prior misconduct for purposes of knowledge, intent, and absence of mistake. In the prior act, the defendant was arrested at the border for possession of forty-three pounds of marijuana in his car. The court agreed that the evidence was admissible. Although different drugs were involved and different methods employed, the similarity requirement was met for Rule 404(b) purposes because both incidents concerned distribution amounts of drugs and illegal transport. The court also stated that the temporal element was a \u201cgimme\u201d because of prior holdings in the circuit indicating that seven years was sufficiently close for Rule 404(b) purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The court concluded that the forty-three pounds of marijuana hidden in the automobile \u2014 clearly a distribution amount \u2014 was relevant to show intent to distribute the other distribution amount found in his suitcase, stating that the prior possession tended to show that Hernandez was \u201cnot some hapless fool mistakenly caught up in an overzeaious law enforcement action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 935.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Similarly, in <em>United States v Ferrer-Cruz, </em>899 F2d 135 (CA 1, 1990), the defendant claimed that the evidence showed only that he was present where cocaine was found, but that it did not show that he knew there was cocaine at that location. The trial court admitted a prior conviction of possession of cocaine and marijuana on the basis of the government\u2019s claim that the evidence showed Ferrer had knowledge that the bags in the car contained drugs and his intent to consummate a drug sale. On appeal, through Judge Breyer, the Court of Appeals agreed, noting that one who has previous experience with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>drugs is more likely to see car switching as part of a drug sale technique and to recognize and know that the contents of the bags in the car contained drugs than someone without that experience.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The majority finds an insufficient nexus between the prior conviction and the charged offense. However, if not an \u201cunlikely coincidence,\u201d <em>VanderVliet, supra, </em>it is surely an \u201cextraordinary coincidence\u201d that someone else left drugs in defendant\u2019s car within ten months of his release from prison for similar misconduct.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The relationship between the offenses was neither too dissimilar nor too remote to preclude the inference of nonaccidental possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In sum, the majority simply declines to recognize that its analysis is inconsistent with the Imwinkelried test and with all federal courts applying Rule 404(b). Further, the majority\u2019s conclusion is at odds with the holding of this Court in <em>People v VanderVliet. </em>Rule 404(b) does not require a high level of similarity between the proffered other acts evidence and the acts charged with respect to the issue of intent. The majority resorts to similarity in support of the notion that Rule 404(b) is a \u201csentinel at the gate.\u201d However disguised, the majority\u2019s conclusion is a repudiation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>of the principle that particular numbers need not be spun, or particular pigeonholes filled, before the door to admissibility swings open. The majority\u2019s doctrine of chances analysis is simply a reassertion of the notion that Rule 404(b) is a rule of exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">ABUSE OF DISCRETION</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">We also disagree with the majority that the evidence was substantially more prejudicial than probative under the Rule 403 balancing test.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> This is not to say that in a given case the trial court could not conclude that other proofs, such as admissions or other tools of the trade such as a beeper, scale, baggies, and cocaine residue were so probative that the bona fide need for the other evidence was minimal. The inference of general mens rea or specific intent from other evidence in the case may render the \u201cbad\u201d acts cumulative under Rule 403. Imwinkelried, Uncharged Misconduct Evidence, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5:09, p 23. Stated otherwise, had the jury found possession and knowledge, the amount of the drugs itself would provide convincing evidence of intent to distribute. However, as the court observed in <em>Nickens, supra, </em>\u201cAlthough the government\u2019s case was strong without the prior conviction, who is to say that it would have carried the day had the conviction been left out?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>defendant\u2019s defense of intermittent possession of the car during the week he owned it appears to impress the majority and could have created a doubt regarding control sufficient to constitute possession of the hidden drugs. Had the jury concluded defendant had possession of some or all the drugs, as the defendant claimed on the cognate charge, it might have concluded he did not intend to distribute them. There was no direct evidence of state of mind, such as an admission by defendant, testimony of uninterrupted possession, or of a witness directly connecting defendant to placing the drugs in the car that would have had the same probative value as the prior act. The size of the cache as well as the tools of the trade might have been as probative of intent to deliver as was the prior act. They did not have substantially equivalent probative force with respect to the issue of possession or knowledge of the hidden cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">When reviewing evidentiary decisions under MRE 401 and 403, our review is limited to whether the decision was an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s decision to admit other acts evidence under Rule 404(b) is not reviewed under a de novo standard. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>we observed in <em>People v Bahoda, </em>448 Mich 261, 289; 531 NW2d 659 (1995):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\">\u201c[C]lose questions arising from the trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion on matters concerning the admission of evidence do not call for appellate reversal because the reviewing justices would have ruled differently. Reversal is warranted only if the resolution of the question by the trial court amounted to an abuse of discretion. The decision upon a close evidentiary question by definition ordinarily cannot be an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>[People v Golochowicz, supra </em>at 322.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">While there is no doubt that all prior misconduct carries the potential for unfair prejudice, appellate courts are properly reluctant to overturn the decisions of the trial courts if the activity was not so inflammatory as to unduly divert attention from the case<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> or involved conduct any more sensational or disturbing than the narcotics charge that the defendant was currently facing.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s claim that the trial court overvalued the probativeness of the evidence, <em>ante </em>at 398, n 15, the majority\u2019s failure to acknowledge that the evidence was probative of both knowledge and specific intent results in the undervaluing of its probative force.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The majority\u2019s rejection of the trial court\u2019s balancing under Rule 403 and its assertion of a \u201cheightened need for the careful application of the principles set forth in MRE 403,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 398, substitutes the appellate judgment for that of the trial court. The evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>was admissible under a noncharacter theory,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> and we must assume the jury used it for its proper purpose. <em>People v Hana, </em>447 Mich 325, 351; 524 NW2d 682 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">HARMLESS ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Even if persuaded that the trial court abused its discretion in admitting the other bad acts evidence, we would find that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">In <em>People v Mateo,</em><footnotemark><em>40</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we recognized that MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> was not a usurpation of our authority and that a \u201cmiscarriage of justice must affirmatively appear on review of nonconstitutional preserved error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221. We further noted that review for nonconstitutional error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and that those courts denying relief where the preserved error had \u201conly slight or negligible influence on the verdict have proceeded cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>rectly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We did not adopt a definitive standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">In federal courts, the prosecutor must show, after pondering all that happened and without stripping the erroneous action from the whole, that the verdict was not substantially swayed by nonconstitutional error. <em>Kotteakos v United States, </em>328 US 750; 66 S Ct 1239; 90 L Ed 1557 (1946). Substantial rights must be affected, and reversal of the verdict is required only if the nonconstitutional error resulted in actual prejudice because it \u201c \u2018had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v Lane, </em>474 US 438, 449; 106 S Ct 725; 88 L Ed 2d 814 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">By contrast, whether error is preserved or not, the Michigan statute under any definition requires that a miscarriage of justice affirmatively appear. MCL 769.26; MSA 28.1096.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> It follows that Justice Weaver correctly held, concurring in both Mateo<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and <em>Geams, </em>that there is a presumption that the error is harmless and that the \u201cdefendant should have the burden of showing why the judgment should be overturned.\u201d <em>People v Gearns, </em>457 Mich 170; 577 NW2d 422 (1998). Since the statute must be applied completely, including the allocation of the burden, the level of confidence cannot be that defined in <em>Kot</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number><em>teakos, </em>i.e., that prejudice did not occur. Rather, the court must be persuaded that prejudice, as defined in <em>Kotteakos, </em>was caused by the error. In short, the defendant must show by at least a preponderance of the evidence that the preserved error <em>did </em>have a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Despite our disagreement, we recognize that four justices in two separate opinions,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> have recently held that the prosecution must show it is highly probable that the evidence did not contribute to the verdict. <em>People v Gearns, supra. </em>Applying this standard, we would find that the error is harmless because it is highly probable that the disputed evidence did not affect the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The following inculpatory evidence was properly admitted at trial: routine pat down of the defendant revealed a beeper, a ziplock baggie in defendant\u2019s wallet, and $455, mostly in ten and twenty dollar denominations. The car owned by the defendant contained a mobile phone and a digital scale. A razor blade was found within the box holding the digital scale, which had cocaine residue on it.

So long as the evidence makes a fact of consequence more or less likely, it is relevant.

The decision is instructive, <em>ante </em>at 400, n 17, but for different reasons. The facts of the case are not \u201cremarkably similar\u201d to the present case. In <em>Arias, </em>the charge involved a traffic violation in Rhode Island for speeding. The defendant claimed that he had left his driver\u2019s license at home and gave the officers a false name and address. He informed the officers that the car belonged to a friend in New York and provided registration indicating the same. A search of the vehicle revealed a kilogram of cocaine taped and wrapped in plastic bags in the trunk of the car. The prior act that was admitted was a ten-year-old conviction for possession of cocaine in Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">The majority fails to state that the court reviewed and applied the precedent developed in <em>United States v Moccia, </em>681 F2d 61 (CA 1, 1982) (drugs were discovered in the defendant\u2019s own home), <em>United States v Rubio-Estrada, </em>857 F2d 845 (CA 1, 1988) (scales, white powder and cash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>found in the defendant\u2019s home support the inference that the defendant knew drugs were for distribution), and <em>United States v Ferrer-Cruz, </em>899 F2d 135 (CA 1, 1990) (cocaine was found on the front floor of the defendant\u2019s car). The court reviewed the facts in <em>Arias </em>noting that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">[h]ad the car belonged to defendant, <em>or </em>were there evidence that he had used it for an extended period of time <em>or </em>on more than one occasion, we might be willing to presume he would have had reason to open its trunk and, so, to know that a kilogram of cocaine was hidden there. Arguably, the fact of defendant\u2019s prior possession coupled with his access to and use of the trunk would make it more likely for him to have come across the cocaine <em>or </em>recognized the cavity in the trunk as a good place to hide it. <em>[Arias, supra </em>at 712.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Defendant Crawford was driving his own car and testimony indicated that he used it more than once over a two-week time frame. His access to and use of the car plus his prior possession and distribution conviction makes it more likely for him to have recognized the area behind the dashboard as a good place to hide a distribution amount of cocaine. The decision in <em>Arias </em>is factually inconsistent with the majority\u2019s assertions and does not support its position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b483-8\"> The majority\u2019s citation of the holding in <em>United States v Sampson, </em>980 F2d 883 (CA 3, 1992), <em>ante </em>at 386, n 6, supports this assumption, while failing to acknowledge that the method of analysis employed in <em>Sampson </em>was rejected in <em>VanderVliet.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\"> The conclusion that the act had no probative value other than to show propensity, although intent to deliver was an element of the charged act and the included offense and the prior crime was delivery, is, of course, belied by the inconsistent observation that it demonstrated defendant\u2019s intent to deliver large amounts of cocaine. <em>Ante </em>at 396-397.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b485-9\"> See appendix, <em>post </em>at 444, for hearing transcript</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b486-7\"> The defense attorney apparently conceded that the defendant was not contesting knowledge of the small amount of cocaine, less than a sixth of a gram, that the police found in the defendant\u2019s coat pocket. Even this amount was sufficient for a charge of possession and the defendant could have been found to be in possession solely on the basis of the cocaine residue found in his pocket and on the scale. Obviously, if the jury was persuaded that defendant only possessed the lesser amount, it might have concluded that there was no intent to deliver.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The reason for defendant\u2019s emphasis on the amount was that he was facing a mandatory life sentence for a second drug offense for possession in any amount over 50 grams. The penalty for a second offense if the amount was under 50 grams is significantly less.

The passive voice of Rule 403 suggests that the statute allocates the burden to the opponent of the admission of logically relevant evidence to convince the judge that the probative dangers outstrip the probative worth of the evidence. In addition, the presence of the word \u201csubstantially\u201d in Rule 403 indicates that the opponent must convince the judge that the dangers outweigh the probative value of the evidence by a wide margin. That interpretation of Rule 403 is sound. Allocating the burden to the opponent reflects a Congressional decision to \u201cplace priority on the principle of [logical] relevance .... Relevance in terms of the search for truth is . . . the predominant interest.\u201d When the proponent of evidence can demonstrate its relevance, the probative value of the evidence is \u201cunquestioned.\u201d However, the dangers listed in Rule 403 are largely speculative risks \u2014 the risk, for example, that a juror will overestimate the probative value of an item of evidence. Since \u201cprobative value is a reality\u201d but \u201cprejudicial danger . . . only a risk,\u201d the scale should be biased in favor of admitting relevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">hi addition, this interpretation finds support in the legislative history of the Federal Rules. One of the themes running throughout the legislative history is that the Rules favor the admission of logically relevant evidence. In the early hearings on the then proposed Rules before the House of Representatives, the chair of the drafting committee, Albert Jenner, Jr., asserted that \u201cthe overall philosophy and thrust of the rules\u201d is to \u201cplace the burden upon he who seeks the exclusion of relevant evidence.\u201d Thus, there were strong policy and statutory interpretation arguments for construing Rule 403 to require the judge to admit relevant evidence unless the party opposing the admission of the evidence sustained the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>convincing the judge that the incidental probative dangers significantly outweighed the probative value of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">These arguments persuaded many courts to allocate the burden to the party resisting the introduction of relevant evidence. Yet other courts tended to apply Rule 403 as if it merely codified the general common-law view that the proponent of the admission of evidence has the burden of showing that the probative value of evidence exceeds the attendant probative dangers. However, that tendency should soon end.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">In 1989, the Supreme Court rendered its decision in <em>Green v Bock Laundry Machine Co </em>[490 US 504; 109 S Ct 1981; 104 L Ed 2d 557 (1989)]. In that case, the Court dealt with the application of the balancing tests in Rules 403 and 609 to convictions offered to impeach civil witnesses. Although the Court did not elaborate on the balancing tests under the two statutes, the Court seemed to assume that the two tests differed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">In early 1990, the Judicial Conference\u2019s Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure formally proposed an amendment to Rule 609 to revise the application of Rule 609\u2019s balancing test to convictions offered in civil cases. The amendment took effect December 1, 1990. The amended version of Rule 609(a)(1) now reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\u201cFor the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, . . . evidence that a witness other than the accused has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted, subject to Rule 403, if the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under which the witness was convicted, and evidence that an accused has been convicted of such a crime shall be admitted if the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused.\u201d [Imwinkelried &amp; Margolin, <em>The case for the admissibility of defense testimony about customary political practices in official corruption prosecutions, </em>29 Am Crim L R 1, 29-31 (1991).]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b492-10\"> Rule 402 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the State of Michigan, these rules, or other rules adopted by the Supreme Court.

The court found evidence of prior acts probative of the issue of knowledge. The defendant claimed to be a naive unsophisticated mechanic who had merely undertaken to deliver a car, unaware that it contained cocaine. The evidence of prior drug sales showed that he was intimately familiar with drug running in general and with dealers Williams\u2019 and Fisher\u2019s drug operation in particular. Thus, \u201c[t]he evidence suggested that it was highly unlikely that Rackstraw was unaware that he was smuggling crack.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\"> The doctrine of chances or the objective-improbability approach endorsed by Imwinkelried as applied to the use of bad acts evidence for mens rea is a variation of that employed by the majority of federal circuits addressing the issue. The federal courts appear to apply a roughly similar limiting gloss to whether the prior act is admissible for purposes of knowledge and intent where the defendant presents an innocent explanation for his presence, i.e., innocent bystander, mere presence, or wrong place/wrong time, and denies knowing that drugs were, for example, in a room, <em>United States v Garcia, </em>983 F2d 1160 (CA 1, 1993); <em>United States v Tomberlin, </em>130 F3d 1318 (CA 8, 1997), a motor vehicle, <em>United States v Buchanan, </em>70 F3d 818 (CA 5, 1995); <em>United States v Santa-Cruz, </em>48 F3d 1118 (CA 9, 1995); <em>United States v Rackstraw, </em>n 25 <em>supra, </em>a boat, <em>United States v Molinares Charris, </em>822 F2d 1213 (CA 1, 1987); <em>United States v Perez-Garcia, </em>n 19 <em>supra </em>or other location in proximity to the defendant, <em>United States v Curry, </em>79 F3d 1489 (CA 7, 1996); <em>United States v Rogers, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>287 US App DC 1; 918 F2d 207 (1990). The consensus in the circuits allows prior misconduct evidence to be admitted to show knowledge in these circumstances, without explicit discussion of the doctrine of chances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\"> The majority cites a number of federal opinions in its support of the proposition that federal courts require a close factual nexus between the prior and charged crimes. <em>Ante </em>at 395, n 13. Analysis of the cases does not support the majority\u2019s position that the nexus in this case is insufficient as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The question of similarity is a question of relevance, which turns on the precise facts of any given case. For example, in <em>United States v Rackstraw, </em>n 25 <em>supra </em>at 1479, the court found persuasive the fact that all the crack sales were within months of each other and that the sales in Fort Worth were similar to the crack sales in Colorado because the method of transportation was similar, the same drug was involved, and the defendant was the middleman for drugs supplied by the same dealers. In this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>case, the facts of both offenses were very similar. In <em>United States v Hernandez, </em>84 F3d 931, 935 (CA 7, 1996), the court found that a March 1993 (1995 WL 23003 [ND Ill, 1995]) arrest for possession of forty-three pounds of marijuana hidden in an automob\u00fce and discovered when the defendant attempted to enter the United States at a border crossing was sufficiently similar to a March 1994 charge of possession of two kilograms of cocaine and one hundred grams of heroin hidden in a suitcase brought in by plane from Los Angeles to Chicago, to aHow the prior act\u2019s admission. These acts were less similar than those in <em>Rackstraw. </em>The fact that both courts found sufficient siimlarity on both sets of facts indicates the diverse spectrum of facts that appeHate courts must review and the case-by-case analysis they necessarily employ.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In <em>United States v Hernandez-Miranda, </em>601 F2d 1104, 1107 (CA 9, 1979), the court found that there was no logical relevance between a prior conviction for smuggling marijuana across the border from Mexico in a backpack and a current charge of importing heroin from Mexico that was discovered at a border crossing concealed in the defendant\u2019s car under the fender well of the trunk\u2019s spare tire. Although the court found the admission of this evidence to be error, it did not find it prejudicial and affirmed the conviction on the strength of the other evidence presented. Hemandez-Miranda claimed that he had just purchased the vehicle; however, the court noted that he was in possession of his own car and inferentiaUy everything else in it. AdditionaUy, there was no evidence that someone else had hidden the heroin in the car, and the large amount of money that the heroin was worth negated the possibility that it had been placed in the car by accident or mistake. This case is, however, nearly twenty-years old and not in accord with more recent Ninth Circuit Court cases, see for example, <em>United States v Arambula-Ruiz, </em>987 F2d 599 (CA 9, 1993); <em>United States v Santa-Cruz, </em>n 26 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In the final case cited by the majority, <em>United States v Adrian, supra, </em>the district court denied the government\u2019s motion to admit the defendant\u2019s prior convictions, finding that the prior act only proved criminal disposition and that the prejudicial value outweighed the probative value. On interlocutory appeal, the United States Circuit Court for the Ninth Circuit disagreed, stating that intent was a material issue in a conspiracy with intent to distribute and possession with intent to distribute charge. The court stated that the \u201cgovernment [is] permitted to prove knowledge through proof of prior bad acts where knowledge [is] an element of the crime at issue. . . . Intent in prosecutions for possession of and intent to distribute narcotics may be demonstrated through evidence of prior possession and sale of narcotics. . . . Thus, the district court erred in holding that evidence of appeHant\u2019s prior narcotics convictions tended only to prove a criminal disposition.\" <em>Id. </em>at 492. However, the court found the record insufficient regarding the similarity of the prior offense to the charged offense and was therefore unable to determine whether the district court had abused its discretion in excluding the evidence by finding that the danger of unfair prejudice was substantiaHy outweighed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>probative value of the evidence. The court determined that the wiser course was to remand the case to allow the government to develop the record and to permit the district court to weigh the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 493.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\"> The fact that the evidence is admissible for one purpose, but not another, does not make it inadmissible.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">[TJhere is no rule of evidence which provides that testimony admissible for one purpose and inadmissible for another purpose is thereby rendered inadmissible; quite the contrary is the case. [For example], [i]t would be a strange rule of law which held that relevant, competent evidence which tended to show bias on the part of a witness was nonetheless inadmissible because it also tended to show that the witness was a liar. <em>[United States v Abel, </em>469 US 45, 56; 105 S Ct 465; 83 L Ed 2d 450 (1984).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Therefore, even if the majority concluded that the other acts evidence did not reflect a permissible inference of knowledge, the evidence was admissible because it was relevant with respect to a proper noncharacter theory of intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">Nor is relevant evidence rendered irrelevant by the presence of other evidence probative of the same issue. <em>Old Chief, supra </em>at 178-179.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b510-13\"> Defense counsel in essence conceded during the motion in limine that defendant knew about the drugs.

The defense attorney\u2019s closing argument urged the jury not to find the defendant guilty merely because he associated with people who used drugs and may have left drugs in his car.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b512-7\"> The doctrine should be cautiously employed because uncritical acceptance of the argument that uncharged misconduct is relevant to mens rea would rationalize admission as a matter of course.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\"> While noting that some courts and commentators have adopted the position that the proponent may not resort to the doctrine of chances to prove mens rea with evidence of only one similar act, Imwinkelried states that in terms of logical relevance, the contrary view, that even one act can be material \u201cis more sound.\u201d The decisions should be made case by case, focusing on relative frequency rather than the absolute number of incidents. The proponent must convince the court that the evidence alters the probability that the defendant had the requisite state of mind at the time of the charged offense.
