Defendant Sexton and two other young men were at the scene of the crime when the police arrived. After initial questioning, they agreed to go to the police station and give statements about the incident.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Detective Melvin Marchlones questioned the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to testimony given at the suppression hearing, Marchlones told the defendant that he was not under arrest and could leave at any time. In the defendant\u2019s first statement, taken about 2:23 P.M., defendant denied all culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">Sexton\u2019s statement was not consistent with those of the other men. Upon being confronted with the inconsistencies, he gave another statement about 4:00 P.M., claiming that the gun slipped through the victim\u2019s fingers, fell to the floor, and discharged. He testified that he asked to telephone his father before making the second statement and was told that he could do so \u201clater.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Defendant agreed to take a polygraph test. Marchlones reminded him that he was not under arrest and reviewed the Miranda<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> warnings. Defendant indicated that he understood and agreed to waive his rights. Before going to Southfield for the polygraph test, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>defendant gave a third statement, claiming that the gun discharged accidentally.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Defendant was taken to the Southfield police station for a polygraph examination. Before the test began at 7:10 P.M., the polygraph examiner reviewed the <em>Miranda </em>rights. Mr. Sexton again stated that he understood the rights and would waive them.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In the meantime, at approximately 4:45 P.M., the defendant\u2019s father arrived at the Hazel Park police station and attempted to see his son. His request was denied. At approximately 5:00 P.M., the senior Mr. Sexton contacted his attorney, Neil Miller. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Miller called the Hazel Park Police Department, identified himself as defendant Sexton\u2019s attorney, and left a message asking that \u201cwhoever was holding\u201d the defendant to return his call. Mr. Miller first arrived at the police station at approximately 7:00 P.M., where he informed the desk officer that he represented the defendant, that he wanted to see his client, and that he wanted all questioning stopped. Mr. Miller was told that the defendant was not at the police station, but was not told where he was. The desk officer refused to contact Marchlones. Miller left the police station and wrote a statement reiterating that he was defendant Sexton\u2019s lawyer and that he wanted all questioning stopped. He returned to the police station at 10:20 P.M. and delivered the statement to the desk officer, who paged Marchlones and told him that there was a lawyer at the station who wanted to speak with Corey Sexton.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>After the polygraph was completed, the examiner advised Sexton that in his opinion defendant\u2019s answers had not been truthful. Defendant\u2019s response was monitored and he admitted that he intentionally shot Phillips. Sexton was then placed under arrest and again advised of his constitutional rights. Defendant stated that he understood the rights and did not want to talk to a lawyer before further questioning. Defendant gave a recorded statement in which he again admitted that he intentionally shot his cousin. This final statement was given at 11:35 P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">The defendant was charged with first-degree murder, MCL 750.316(l)(a); MSA 28.548(l)(a), and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, MCL 750.227b; MSA 28.424(2). The defense filed a motion to suppress the defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements, but the trial court found that the statements were freely, knowingly, and voluntarily made, and denied the motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Defendant pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, MCL 750.317; MSA 28.549, conditioned on a right to challenge the admissibility of the confessions on appeal. Sexton was sentenced to twenty to forty years for the offense, plus two years for the felony-firearm violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">While defendant\u2019s appeal was pending, this Court decided <em>People v Bender, supra. </em>In an unpublished opinion per curiam, issued December 20, 1996 (Docket No. 177061), the Court of Appeals reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>the decision of the trial court, concluding that suppression was mandated regarding all statements made after 5:30 P.M.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>We granted the prosecutor\u2019s application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\n<em>PEOPLE v DAVIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Defendant Clifton Davis was charged with first-degree murder, MCL 750.316(l)(a); MSA 28.548(l)(a), and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, MCL 750.227b; MSA 28.424(2), in connection with the shooting death of Allen Murriel on March 10, 1993.\u00ae</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">When the police arrived, the defendant and his brother were arrested. Defendant\u2019s mother retained Elliot Margolis to represent her sons. Mr. Margolis and Mrs. Davis agreed to meet at police headquarters at 8:10 P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">According to testimony given at the suppression hearing, the defendant signed a waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and agreed to be interviewed at 7:45 P.M. Sergeant Deborah Monti began questioning him at police headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Mrs. Davis and Mr. Margolis met at the front door of police headquarters at 8:10 P.M. Mrs. Davis paid Margolis the agreed retainer fee, and he immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>went upstairs to locate the defendant and his brother. Margolis told the desk officer that he had been retained to represent the Davis brothers. The officer told Margolis that he was not certain of the location of Sergeant Monti or the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">According to the testimony of Sergeant Monti, she began taking defendant\u2019s statement at 8:20 P.M. and finished at 9:20 P.M. Mr. Margolis\u2019 version of the facts differs slightly. He testified that he saw Monti move Edward Davis from one room to another at 8:45 P.M. According to Margolis, Monti told Margolis at that time that she had already taken a confession from the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">At trial, the defendant moved to suppress the confession, contending that suppression was required because the police failed to tell defendant that his counsel wanted to see him. The trial court granted the motion to suppress pursuant to <em>People v Wright, </em>441 Mich 140; 490 NW2d 351 (1992). The trial court acknowledged the possibility that the defendant had given at least part of his statement before the attorney arrived, but suppressed the entire statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The Court of Appeals granted the prosecutor\u2019s interlocutory application for leave to appeal. While that appeal was pending, this Court decided <em>Bender. </em>The Court of Appeals issued a peremptory affirmance of the trial court order. We granted the plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">\n<em>PEOPLE v YOUNG</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">James Curenton was with a group of friends on the evening of September 7, 1991. Dondrea Smith and Joseph Broom, two of Curenton\u2019s friends, testified that a man wearing a ski mask and carrying a gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>came out of an alley. Mr. Smith testified that he thought nothing of this pedestrian until the gunman started shooting.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> At that point, the witness and the rest of the friends ran. The gunman chased Curenton and shot at him. After Curenton was on the ground, the perpetrator took a gold chain from the victim\u2019s neck and rummaged through his pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">On September 9, 1991, defendant was arrested for the murder of James Curenton. Defendant was placed in a holding cell for the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">At approximately 9:20 A.M. the next morning, Mr. Young was questioned about the shooting by Sergeant Lee Caudill of the Detroit Police homicide unit. According to testimony given at the evidentiary hearing, defendant was apprised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and voluntarily agreed to waive them before questioning. At the initial interview, defendant denied all involvement in the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">At 2:00 P.M., defendant was taken from the police station to the police crime laboratory for a polygraph examination. The defendant was again advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and agreed to take the polygraph examination. During the examination, Caudill received a telephone call indicating that an attorney was at the police station requesting to see Bryce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Young.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The defendant was not notified of this and the examination continued. At 6:40 P.M., defendant confessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the statement was denied. After a two-day bench trial, defendant was convicted of second-degree murder, MCL 750.317; MSA 28.549, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, MCL 750.227b; MSA 28.424(2). Defendant was sentenced to twelve to thirty years for the murder conviction and two years for the felony-firearm violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction. 212 Mich App 630; 538 NW2d 456 (1995). We remanded the case for reconsideration in light of <em>Bender, </em>and for a determination whether that decision should be applied retroactively to this case. 453 Mich 976 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">On remand, the Court of Appeals held that <em>Bender </em>was to be given complete retroactive effect because it could not be said that <em>Bender </em>overruled clear and uncontradicted case law or that it was unexpected or indefensible in light of <em>People v Wright, supra. </em>222 Mich App 498; 565 NW2d 5 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">The issue in this case is whether our decision in <em>People v Bender, supra, </em>should have retroactive application. As a question of law, the standard of review is de novo. <em>People v Carpentier, </em>446 Mich 19; 521 NW2d 195 (1994). Resolution of the matter in turn rests on the decisional basis of the holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>In <em>Bender, </em>we held that the police must inform a suspect when retained counsel is available for consultation, failing which any statement made by the defendant after the attorney\u2019s arrival would be suppressed. However, the ultimate holding of the Court was not that the rule was required by either Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or \u00a7 20.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In an opinion by Chief Justice Brickley, joined by Justices Levin, Cavanagh, and Mat,t,ett, the majority expressly refrained from justifying <em>Bender </em>by interpreting constitutional provisions. Rather, the majority felt that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">would be more appropriate to approach the law enforcement practices that are at the core of this case in the same manner as the United States Supreme Court approached the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>constitutional interpretation task in <em>Miranda </em>. . . ; namely, by announcing a prophylactic rule. <em>[Bender </em>at 620-621.]1<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">This new per se rule of criminal procedure was implemented to insure that \u201cour system of criminal justice remains accusatorial and not inquisitorial in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">In <em>Griffith v Kentucky,</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions \u201capplie[s] retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a \u2018clear break\u2019 with the past.\u201d However, <em>Griffith </em>is not applicable to the cases at bar because it applies only to rules of criminal procedure that are grounded on the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">In <em>Griffith, </em>the issue was whether the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Batson v </em>Kentucky<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> should be applied retroactively. In <em>Batson, </em>the Court held that a state criminal defendant could establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination violative of the Fourteenth Amendment on the basis of a prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges to strike members of the defendant\u2019s race from the jury. Once the defendant made the prima facie showing, the burden shifted to the state to establish a racially neutral explanation for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>exclusions. Thus, <em>Griffith </em>dealt with the retroactive application on direct review<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of a rule of criminal procedure that was constitutionally mandated.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The Court explicitly accepted Justice Harlan\u2019s view of \u201cdistinguishing between cases that have become final and those that have not, and for applying new rules retroactively to cases in the latter category . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Court stated that \u201cfailure to apply a newly declared constitutional rule to criminal cases pending on direct review violates basic norms of constitutional adjudication.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">This Court\u2019s holding in <em>Bender </em>is not a rule of criminal procedure that is mandated by the United States Constitution. To the contrary, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Moran v Burbine, </em>475 US 412; 106 S Ct 1135; 89 L Ed 2d 410 (1986), specifically held that failure of the police to inform a defendant of a lawyer\u2019s efforts to contact him does not violate either the Fifth Amendment right to silence or the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">The conclusion that <em>Griffith </em>mandates retroactive application only with respect to rules that emanate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>from the federal constitution is in accord with the approach adopted in both federal and state courts.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">In <em>Commonwealth v Waters,</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the issue before the Massachusetts Supreme Court was whether a new rule announced in <em>Commonwealth v Allen, </em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>should be applied retroactively. In <em>Allen, </em>the court announced a rule requiring a judicial determination of voluntariness whenever the issue was raised, even if the statement in question was made to a private citizen. Declining to apply <em>Allen </em>to a case pending on direct review at the time the opinion was issued, the court in <em>Waters </em>held that <em>\u201cGriffith </em>does not require this court to give retroactive application to rules that are not based on the Federal Constitution.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In <em>People v </em>Erickson,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> one of the issues before the Illinois Supreme Court was whether the decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>Daley v Hett,</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>should have retroactive application. The defendant\u2019s position was that <em>Hett </em>prohibited death penalty questioning of prospective jurors where the sentencing jury is waived before trial. The court held that the issue was left open in <em>Hett. </em>Declining to address the unanswered issue, the court found that even if <em>Hett </em>stood for the defendant\u2019s proposition, it would not be applied retroactively to the defendant\u2019s case. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-5\">Our reading of <em>Griffith </em>leads us to conclude that retroactivity is triggered when two factors are present: (1) the case to which the new rule is to be applied was not final or was pending on direct review when the rule was declared and (2) the rule to be applied retroactively is of constitutional dimension.[<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The court reasoned that the right to a sentencing jury in a capital case was a statutory rather than a constitutional right, and stated that because <em>\u201cGriffith </em>addresses a rule which pertains to a constitutional right and the defendant herein seeks retroactive application of a rule which pertains to a statutory right, we do not deem <em>Griffith </em>controlling.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> After finding <em>Griffith </em>inapplicable, the court applied a three-part test of retroactivity first adopted by the Illinois Supreme Court in <em>People v Laws.</em><footnotemark><em>28</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The three-part test applied in Erickson<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> is substantively indistinguish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>able from the test of retroactivity we applied in <em>People v Hampton.</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Because <em>Griffith </em>is not controlling, this Court is free to prescribe the parameters of retroactivity. The United States Supreme Court held in <em>Great Northern R Co v Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that \u201cthe Federal Constitution has no voice upon the subject. A state in defining the limits of adherence to precedent may make a choice for itself between the principle of forward operation and that of relation backward.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A3b\">While we acknowledge the reasoning and rationale of <em>Griffith</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we decline to apply it to the cases before us today.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Instead, we find the analysis in <em>Stovall v Denno,</em><footnotemark><em>34</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to be more persuasive.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>In <em>Stovall, </em>the United States Supreme Court addressed the retroactivity of <em>United States v Wade.</em><footnotemark><em>36</em></footnotemark><em> Wade </em>required the exclusion of an in-court identification that was based on a prior lineup conducted without counsel unless the in-court identification had an independent origin or was harmless error. The <em>Stovall </em>Court cited the \u201cunusual force of the countervailing considerations\u201d in holding that the <em>Wade </em>rule was to have total prospective application. The Court made no distinction between final, convictions, convictions on direct review, and convictions at various stages of trial, holding that the \u201cfactors of reliance and burden on administration of justice\u201d were paramount.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In addressing the equity argument, the Court observed that \u201c[i]nequity arguably results from according the benefit of a new rule to the parties in the case in which it is announced but not to other litigants similarly situated in the trial or appellate process who have raised the same issue. But we regard the fact that the parties involved are chance beneficiaries as an insignificant cost for adherence to sound principles of decision-making.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">In determining the scope of prospective application, Professors LaFave and Israel submit that reliance is a critical factor.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">If non-retroactive application is to be geared to reliance, the critical point for application of the new ruling must be the operative event regulated by that ruling, rather than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>finality of the conviction. Where the new ruling was directed at a police practice, it would be applied only to police action occurring after the date of the new ruling.!<footnotemark>39</footnotemark>1</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">In holding that <em>Bender </em>is to be given prospective application only, we agree with the <em>Stovall </em>Court that no distinction should be made between final convictions, convictions on direct review, and convictions at various stages of trial.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> We simply decline to extend <em>Bender\u2019s </em>\u201ccourt-made exclusionary rule to cases in which its deterrent purpose would not be served.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">rv</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">In <em>Hampton, supra, </em>we recognized a three-part test of retroactivity that assesses (1) the purpose of the new rules;<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> (2) the general reliance on the old rule, and (3) the effect of retroactive application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>new rule on the administration of justice.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> We hold that the application of these three factors to the rule in <em>Bender </em>precludes retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">As noted above, the purpose of the <em>Bender </em>rule is to provide \u201cprophylactic\u201d protection against potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>Miranda </em>violations by mandating suppression as a deterrence to police misconduct.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The <em>Bender </em>majority held that \u201c [i]f it is deemed to be important that the accused be informed that he is entitled to counsel, it is certainly important that he be informed that he has counsel.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not constitutionally mandated. Rather, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Miranda </em>created a prophylactic set of warnings to ensure protection of Fifth Amendment rights.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has further held that <em>Miranda </em>is to have prospective application only.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Furthermore, the <em>Bender </em>rule is not relevant to the ascertainment of guilt or innocence and does not implicate the integrity of the fact-finding process. In <em>People v Young,</em><footnotemark><em>48</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Court considered whether the Court of Appeals had correctly applied <em>People v Fountain</em><footnotemark><em>49</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which required that a prosecutor who knows of a defendant\u2019s prior felony record proceed against the defendant as an habitual offender in the adjudication of the current felony offense, failure of which reverses the defendant\u2019s conviction as an habitual offender. The Court observed that the rule was based on \u201cthis Court\u2019s supervisory powers over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>practices and procedures used in our courts\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">When a decision of this Court involves a rule which concerns the ascertainment of guilt or innocence, retroactive application may be appropriate. <em>People v Hampton, supra. </em>Conversely, a new rule of procedure adopted by this Court which does not affect the integrity of the fact-finding process should be given prospective effect.]<footnotemark>51</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Because the doctrinal foundation for the <em>Bender </em>rule is prophylactic and aimed at preventing police misconduct that does not affect the truth-finding process, it is amenable to prospective application. Because the police acted in full compliance with the law as it existed at the time, the purpose of preventing police misconduct will in no way be served by retroactive application. The rule, by its nature, can only have a prospective effect on police conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">Because the amount of past reliance will often have a profound effect on the administration of justice, the second and third factors are often dealt with together.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">When a decision overrules settled law, more reliance is likely to have been placed in the old rule than in cases in which the law was unsettled or unknown.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Judicial decisions are generally given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>complete retroactive effect unless the decisions are unexpected or indefensible.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The defendants in this case argue that <em>Bender </em>was foreshadowed by <em>People v Wright, supra. </em>Because of the holding in <em>Wright, </em>the defendants argue, the decision in <em>Bender </em>cannot be deemed to be unexpected. In <em>Wright, </em>four members of the Court held that the defendant\u2019s confession could not be admitted into evidence. Justice Mallett, joined by Justice Levin, held that the Michigan Constitution, art 1, \u00a7 17, required the police to inform the defendant of in-person efforts by his retained attorney to contact him.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Chief Justice Cavanagh agreed with Justice Mallett\u2019s inteipretation of the Michigan Constitution, but wrote separately to further cite defendant\u2019s right to assistance of counsel under Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Chief Justice Cavanagh also held that the rale should not be limited to apply only to in-person efforts to contact.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Justice Brickley concurred that the confession should be suppressed. However, Justice Brickley wrote separately to base his conclusion on a rationale distinct from that of Justices Mallett, Levin, and Cavanagh.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Justice Brickley did not reference any provision of our constitution, but relied on a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis to find that the coercive nature of the defendant\u2019s interrogation precluded a voluntary waiver of the right to remain silent.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Given that the majority in <em>Wright </em>did not agree that failure to allow retained counsel access to the client-mandated exclusion of the statements as a matter per se it cannot be said that <em>Wright </em>foreshadowed <em>Bender. </em>In announcing a rule of exclusion per se, <em>Bender </em>is a complete break with past precedent. As this Court held in <em>People v </em>Anderson:<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">The clear rale in Michigan is that a majority of the Court must agree on a ground for decision in order to make that binding precedent for future cases. If there is merely a majority for a particular result, then the parties to the case are bound by the judgment but the case is not authority beyond the immediate parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Therefore, even after <em>Wright, </em>there was no established rule that mandated the exclusion of evidence when the police failed to apprise a defendant of retained counsel\u2019s attempts at contact. <em>Bender </em>could not have been foreshadowed by <em>Wright </em>where the case established no precedential value under the principle of stare decisis.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">While the police could not rely on <em>Wright, </em>they could rely on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Moran v Burbine, supra. </em>As noted in <em>Moran, </em>the Court held that a defendant\u2019s knowledge of his attorney\u2019s presence is irrelevant to the voluntariness of a waiver. Under <em>Moran, </em>the proper focus is on the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s decision to speak with the full awareness and comprehension of all the information <em>Miranda </em>requires the police to convey.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Whether a statement is deemed voluntary is to be determined using a totality-of-the-circumstances analysis. As this Court said in <em>People v </em>Cipriano:<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">In determining whether a statement is voluntary, the trial court should consider, among other things, the following factors: the age of the accused; his lack of education or his intelligence level; the extent of his previous experience with the police; the repeated and prolonged nature of the questioning; the length of the detention of the accused before he gave the statement in question; the lack of any advice to the accused of his constitutional rights; whether there was an unnecessary delay in bringing him before a magistrate before he gave the confession; whether the accused was injured, intoxicated or drugged, or in ill health when he gave the statement; whether the accused was deprived of food, sleep, or medical attention; whether the accused was physically abused; and whether the suspect was threatened with abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">In view of the earlier reliance on <em>Moran </em>and <em>Cipriano </em>and the lack of foreshadowing by <em>Wright, </em>before <em>Bender </em>the police could legitimately rely on the fact that an inculpatory statement would not be automatically excluded when they failed to inform a suspect of the presence of counsel hired by a third party. This legitimate reliance was reinforced through subsequent decisions of the Court of Appeals, which held that <em>Wright </em>did not establish a binding principle regarding rationale.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Furthermore, subsequent Court of Appeals decisions expressly refused to impose a requirement per se that the police inform a suspect of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>counsel\u2019s presence. These opinions correctly employed a traditional totaiity-of-the-circumstances analysis in determining whether the defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">In <em>Bender, </em>the Court announced for the first time that police <em>must </em>inform a suspect of an attorney\u2019s attempted contact, failing which the suspect\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver is invalid per se and the resulting statement suppressed. Because <em>Bender </em>is a new rule of law, it is uniquely susceptible to prospective application.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">As to the third factor, we find that retroactive application of <em>Bender </em>would be extremely disruptive to the administration of justice. Convictions would be called into question and evidence excluded that was obtained in full compliance with the law extant at the time the statement was given. The ultimate result might undermine the validity of a large number of convictions and burden the criminal justice system with numerous retrials. Accordingly, we hold that the decision in <em>Bender </em>is to be given prospective application only.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Defendants Sexton and Young also claim that their inculpatory statements should have been suppressed because they were not voluntary. As noted above, whether a statement is deemed voluntary is to be determined using a totality-of-the-circumstances anal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>ysis.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> While the voluntariness of a confession is a question for the trial court, an appellate court must examine the entire record and make an independent determination of voluntariness.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The decision of the trial court will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">As to defendant Young, review of the record shows that the trial court did not err in finding Bryce Young\u2019s statement voluntary under the circumstances. Defendant maintains that his statement was involuntary because he was not informed that counsel was attempting to contact him and because he was deprived of food and sleep for twenty-one hours. As noted above, defendant\u2019s not being informed of the presence of counsel is merely a factor in the determination of voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Defendant was arrested at 9:00 P.M. on September 9. He was given a soft drink and a snack cake at approximately noon on September 10, which was the first and only occasion defendant complained about being hungry. According to defendant\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing, he specifically requested a soft drink. He further testified that he spoke with his lawyer for approximately an hour and then ate a hot meal. Any delay in eating due to speaking with counsel is certainly not attributable to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Furthermore, defendant\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing reveals that his lack of sleep was principally attributable to his \u201cbeing scared\u201d rather than any coercive tactics on the part of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Under the totality of the circumstances, we hold that defendant Young\u2019s statement was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">As to defendant Sexton, the matter was not addressed by the appellate court. Therefore, we remand the issue to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">In all three cases before us, the inculpatory statements of the defendants were ordered suppressed pursuant to <em>Bender. </em>Because we hold that the decision in <em>Bender </em>is to apply only to interrogations that occurred after July 23, 1996, the inculpatory statements of the defendants should not be suppressed. Accordingly, we reverse the decisions of the Court of Appeals and remand the cases for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-8\">Mallett, C.J., and Weaver and Taylor, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-12\"> These three cases do not furnish an opportunity for this Court to revisit the holding of <em>Bender. </em>The issue before us today is simply whether the <em>Bender </em>decision should have retroactive application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b126-10\"> The police questioned the defendant and two other men while sitting in a patrol car.

First, I believe that the time has come for us to reevaluate our retroactivity jurisprudence and align it with the current federal model. Second, I believe that the majority\u2019s retroactivity analysis is in error for two reasons: retroactivity may not even be an issue in this case because the rule set forth in <em>People v Bender, </em>452 Mich 594; 551 NW2d 71 (1996), was clearly foreshadowed by <em>People v Wright, </em>441 Mich 140; 490 NW2d 351 (1992), and even if I agreed with the majority regarding the applicable case law, I disa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>gree with its analysis and conclusion regarding whether the <em>Bender </em>rule should be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The majority articulates two grounds for its apparent disinclination to apply current United States Supreme Court precedent regarding retroactivity. First, it asserts that the rule set forth in <em>Bender </em>does not have constitutional implications, and, second, federal retroactivity precedent only applies to rules of criminal procedure emanating from the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">The majority implies throughout its analysis that the rule set forth in <em>Bender </em>has no basis in our constitution. While the <em>Bender </em>rule is prophylactic in nature like Miranda,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that fact does not detract from its constitutional underpinnings. Its very purpose is to protect a suspect\u2019s right to counsel and the privilege against self-incrimination. To deny the constitutional import of this rule is to ignore the plain language set forth in <em>Bender.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">The right to counsel and the right to be free of compulsory self-incrimination are part of the bedrock of constitutional civil liberties that have been zealously protected and in some cases expanded over the years. Given the focus and protection that these particular constitutional provisions have received, <em>it is difficult to accept and constitutionally justify a rule of law that accepts that law enforcement investigators, as part of a custodial interrogation, can conceal from suspects that counsel has been made available to them and is at their disposal. </em>If it is deemed to be important that the accused be informed that he is enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>tied to counsel, it is certainly important that he be informed that he has counsel. <em>[Id. </em>at 621 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ar3\">In my view, the rule we adopt today requiring police to inform suspects that counsel has been retained for them insures that our system of criminal justice remains accusatorial and not inquisitorial in nature. <em>Perhaps more importantly, it demonstrates that eocperience has taught us that the good will of state agents is often insufficient to guarantee a suspect\u2019s constitutional rights. [Id. </em>at 623 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The constitutional undeipinnings of <em>Bender </em>are obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The majority asserts that it \u201cassume[s] that the <em>Bender </em>majority employed the term \u2018prophylactic\u2019 as it is used in <em>Miranda, </em>that is, \u2018procedural safeguards\u2019 that are not themselves constitutionally based.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 62, n 44. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assumption, I assume that the <em>Bender </em>majority meant precisely what it stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">As Justice Souter explained in <em>Withrow v Williams, </em>507 US 680, 691; 113 S Ct 1745; 123 L Ed 2d 407 (1993): \u201c \u2018Prophylactic\u2019 though it may be, in protecting a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination <em>Miranda </em>safeguards \u2018a fundamental trial right.\u2019 \u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 621.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">In addition, the majority contends that \u201cthe <em>Bender-rule </em>is not relevant to the ascertainment of guilt or innocence and does not implicate the integrity of the fact-finding process.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 62. Again, the plain language set forth by the <em>Bender </em>majority indicates otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">\u201cNor does the Fifth Amendment \u2018trial right\u2019 protected by <em>Miranda </em>serve some value necessarily divorced from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>correct ascertainment of guilt. \u2018 \u201c[A] system of criminal law enforcement which comes to depend on the \u2018confession\u2019 will, in the long run, be less reliable and more subject to abuses\u201d than a system relying on independent investigation.\u2019 <em>Michigan v Tucker </em>[417 US] [433] 448, n 23 [94 S Ct 2357; 41 L Ed 2d 182 (1974)] (quoting <em>Escobedo v Illinois, </em>378 US 478, 488-489 [84 S Ct 1758; 12 L Ed 2d 977] [1964]). [Some citations omitted.]\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 622.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">By its adoption of the <em>Bender </em>rule, this Court clearly sought to protect a \u201cfundamental trial right\u201d rooted in the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to counsel. Accordingly, the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[b]ecause the doctrinal foundation for the <em>Bender </em>rule is prophylactic and aimed at preventing police misconduct that does not affect the truth-finding process, it is amenable to prospective application\u201d is unsupported by the foundation laid for the rule set forth in <em>Bender. Ante, </em>p 63. By deeming <em>Bender </em>prospective only, the majority fails to heed its own counsel that \u201cthe good will of state agents is often insufficient to guarantee a suspect\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Bender </em>at 623. Thus, I find the majority\u2019s conclusion that <em>Bender </em>does not implicate a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights wrong and without any viable legal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">As an additional matter, I am not persuaded that merely because the underpinnings of <em>Bender </em>are grounded in the Michigan Constitution and do not emanate from the federal constitution that we should summarily dismiss a body of law that has undergone decades of cautious and in-depth examination, culminating in the rule set forth in <em>Griffith v Kentucky, </em>479 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>US 314; 107 S Ct 708; 93 L Ed 2d 649 (1987).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has carefully analyzed the public policy involved in retroactive application of new rules of criminal procedure, producing a rule that protects both the constitutional rights of defendants and the state\u2019s interest in the finality of judgments. This rule is set forth in <em>Griffith, </em>which holds that newly declared constitutional rules must be applied retroactively to all cases pending on direct review with no exception for cases in which the new rule is a \u201c \u2018clear break\u2019 with the past.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328. The failure to do so \u201cviolates basic norms of constitutional adjudication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 322. Moreover, the \u201cintegrity of judicial review requires that we apply that rule to all similar cases pending on direct review\u201d and the failure to do so \u201cviolates the principle of treating similarly situated defendants the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323. The failure to give the appropriate measure of consideration to these important concerns and the resulting decision not to accord the <em>Bender </em>rule retroactive effect also violates the \u201cbasic norms of constitutional adjudication\u201d and the \u201cintegrity of judicial review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The majority also fails to give appropriate consideration to the analysis set forth in <em>Shea v Louisiana, </em>470 US 51; 105 S Ct 1065; 84 L Ed 2d 38 (1985), in which the Supreme Court held that the rule of <em>Edwards v Arizona, </em>451 US 477; 101 S Ct 1880; 68 L <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>Ed 2d 378 (1981), would be applied retroactively to cases not yet final, that is, those cases pending on direct review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Edwards, </em>the Supreme Court held that once an accused has asserted the right to counsel, \u201cthe interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485. The protection set forth in <em>Edwards </em>is clearly rooted in <em>Miranda-.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">[W]hen an accused has invoked his right to have counsel present during custodial interrogation, a valid waiver of that right cannot be established by showing only that he responded to further police-initiated custodial interrogation even if he has been advised of his rights. <em>[Id. </em>at 484]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">Likewise, <em>Bender </em>is also rooted in Miranda-like protections and should be afforded retroactive effect just as was <em>Edwards. </em>Even if the majority was correct in its assessment that the <em>Bender </em>rule is not rooted in the protection of constitutional rights, the same rule of retroactivity applies where a \u201cprophylactic\u201d rule is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">The analyses set forth in <em>Shea </em>and <em>Griffith </em>are based on <em>United States v Johnson, </em>457 US 537; 102 S Ct 2579; 73 L Ed 2d 202 (1982), which examined the difficulties and inconsistencies in the long evolution of retroactivity jurisprudence. The majority relies heavily on our decision in <em>People v Hampton, </em>384 Mich 669; 187 NW2d 404 (1971), which is based on <em>Linkletter v Walker, </em>381 US 618; 85 S Ct 1731; 14 L Ed 2d 601 (1965), and also on the analysis set forth in <em>Stovall v Denno, </em>388 US 293; 87 S Ct 1967; 18 L Ed 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>1199 (1967). However, the Supreme Court noted in Johnson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">Because the balance of the three <em>Stovall </em>factors inevitably has shifted from case to case, it is hardly surprising that, for some, \u201cthe subsequent course of <em>Linkletter </em>became almost as difficult to follow as the tracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended victim.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 544.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">These factors have also been \u201cattacked as being both difficult to apply and easy to manipulate to reach a desired result.\u201d Moody, <em>Retroactive application of law-changing decisions in Michigan, </em>28 Wayne L R 439, 455 (1982). The reliance factor \u201cmerits little protection when, as is the case where the retroactivity of constitutional procedural rights is at issue, a criminal defendant\u2019s life or liberty is at stake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the administration of justice factor has also been labeled as \u201ceasily subject to misuse and distortion so as to justify a court\u2019s predetermined non-retroactivity result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The factors utilized by the majority have been called into question again and again. I believe that the time has come for us to reexamine retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">After examining the numerous opinions authored by Justice Harlan on the issue of retroactivity, the Supreme Court agreed that \u201c \u2018[r]etroactivity\u2019 must be rethought.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>at 548. The Court concluded, in accordance with Justice Harlan\u2019s view, that a decision from it construing the Fourth Amendment is to be applied to all convictions not yet final at the time the decision was rendered. <em>Id. </em>at 562.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The Court looked approvingly on two statements of Justice Harlan in particular:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201cWe do not release a criminal from jail because we like to do so, or because we think it wise to do so, but only because the government has offended constitutional principle in the conduct of his case. And when another similarly situated defendant comes before us, we must grant the same relief or give a principled reason for acting differently.\u201d <em>Desist v United States, </em>394 US [244, 258; 89 S Ct 1030; 22 L Ed 2d 248 (1969)] (dissenting opinion). Applying <em>Payton [v New York, </em>445 US 573; 100 S Ct 1371; 63 L Ed 2d 639 (1980)] to convictions that were not yet final when <em>Pay-ton </em>issued would accomplish the first step toward \u201cturning our backs on the ad hoc approach that has so far characterized our decisions in the retroactivity field and proceeding to administer the doctrine on principle.\u201d <em>Jenkins v Delaware, </em>395 US [213, 224; 89 S Ct 1677; 23 L Ed 2d 253 (1969)] (Harlan, J., dissenting). <em>[Id. </em>at 561-562.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">I agree with Justice Harlan\u2019s assessments regarding retroactivity. Not only does fairness require that similarly situated defendants be treated the same, but the majority offers no \u201cprincipled reason\u201d for doing otherwise. We, too, should take this opportunity to \u201cturn our backs on the ad hoc\u201d and inconsistent retroactivity jurisprudence and to mind Justice Moody\u2019s observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">Selective application of the benefit, and perhaps also the burden, of the change to one party and not to others similarly situated is difficult to justify in view of the fact that it is often pure happenstance that leads a court to select one case rather than another as a vehicle for an overruling or first-impression decision. [Moody, <em>supra </em>at 446.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">The test employed by the majority \u201cfails to consider the \u2018hardship and inequity suffered by those who are denied the benefit of the new rule and compelled to bear the burden of what is now admittedly recognized as an unjust rule.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>More important, this Court has already examined and adopted the more recent retroactivity analysis set forth by the Supreme Court. Contrary to the majority\u2019s analysis, we have previously utilized federal retroactivity analysis <em>post-Linkletter, </em>and our own jurisprudence did not stagnate with the <em>Hampton </em>decision. Not only is there a failure to undertake the task of determining whether we should apply current federal retroactivity precedent in this case, there is a disregard of other decisions of this Court doing so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The fact that we did not cease utilizing federal retroactivity precedent after the adoption of <em>Linkletter </em>in <em>Hampton </em>is evidenced by several decisions from this Court. In <em>People v Gay, </em>407 Mich 681, 705; 289 NW2d 651 (1980), we noted our adoption of <em>Linkletter; </em>however, we proceeded to state that \u201cthe United States Supreme Court has since determined that the question whether a double jeopardy holding should be given retroactive effect is \u2018not readily susceptible of analysis under the <em>Linkletter </em>line of cases.\u2019 \u201d Citing <em>Robinson v Neil, </em>409 US 505, 508; 93 S Ct 876; 35 L Ed 2d 29 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The issue presented in <em>Gay </em>was the retroactive application of <em>People v Cooper, </em>398 Mich 450, 460-461; 247 NW2d 866 (1976), in which we held that limitations existed under the Michigan Constitution on the state\u2019s ability to prosecute a defendant in a state court following a conviction in federal court for crimes arising out of the same acts. <em>Gay </em>still used the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Linkletter </em>factors in its analysis in accordance with Supreme Court dictates. However, the <em>Gay </em>Court noted that \u201cmany of the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in recent years demonstrate a growing limitation upon the concept of dual prosecution originally approved [by it].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 707. Thus, previous reliance on the dual sovereignty concept was recognized as \u201cdubious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 708. We concluded that \u201cretrospective application of the <em>Cooper </em>rule is required to assure the fair distribution of a fundamental right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">As noted above, the majority characterized the <em>Bender </em>rule as safeguarding \u201ca fundamental trial right\u201d in spite of its prophylactic nature. <em>Bender </em>at 621. As in <em>Gay, Bender </em>involves a fundamental right mandating retroactive application and the fact that <em>Bender, </em>like <em>Gay, </em>is grounded in the protection of state constitutional rights does not control whether we should apply the current federal retroactivity model.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Next, in <em>People v Woods, </em>416 Mich 581; 331 NW2d 707 (1982), we decided whether our decision in <em>People v Wright, </em>408 Mich 1; 289 NW2d 1 (1980), based on <em>Sandstrom v Montana, </em>442 US 510; 99 S Ct 2450; 61 L Ed 2d 39 (1979), was retroactive. <em>Wright </em>and <em>Sandstrom </em>held that due process is violated when the jury is instructed that the law presumes that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts where a reasonable juror would inteipret the presumption as conclusive or as shifting the burden of persuasion to the defendant on the issue of intent. <em>Woods </em>at 612. In deciding whether to apply these cases retroactively, we utilized the analysis set forth in <em>Johnson, supra, </em>\u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s most recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>opinion on retroactivity,\u201d in spite of that decision\u2019s express limitation of its analysis to Fourth Amendment violations. <em>Woods </em>at 616.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Still utilizing the <em>Linkletter </em>factors, we first concluded that, given the reliance by lower courts on unreversed cases approving these jury instructions, \u201cthe effect full retroactivity would have on Michigan\u2019s system of justice is unacceptable. Since this Court long approved of such instructions, the number of cases where this instruction was used is surely enormous. Taking this into consideration with the purpose of the <em>Sandstrom </em>rule, we feel full retroactivity is unwarranted.\u201d <em>Woods </em>at 621. However, we went on to hold:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">[R]etroactive application to those defendants whose cases were pending on direct appeal when <em>Sandstrom </em>was decided is required if the issue was properly raised and preserved. <em>United States v Johnson, supra, </em>which allowed retroactive application of <em>Payton, supra, </em>to cases pending on direct appeal, was specifically limited to decisions involving the Fourth Amendment. <em>However, it clearly manifested a preference for limited retroactivity since it is consonant with the Court\u2019s original understanding of retroactivity in </em>Linkletter, <em>does justice to \u201ceach litigant on the merits of his own case,\u201d and furthers the goal of giving similar treatment to defendants similarly situated. </em>We find these reasons equally applicable to this case. <em>[Id. </em>at 621-622 (citations omitted; emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>We essentially applied the same rule set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Johnson, Shea, </em>and <em>Griffith, </em>that is, a new rule applied retroactively to all cases pending on direct appeal at the time of decision where the issue was properly raised.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Unlike the present situation, the decision in <em>Woods </em>was applied retroactively, despite the fact that this Court had \u201clong approved\u201d such instructions. As will be discussed in more detail below, the police conduct denounced in <em>Bender </em>has not been \u201clong approved\u201d by this Court, at the very least not since our decision in <em>Wright.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">I find that the majority erred in its retroactivity analysis for two reasons. First, although it engaged in a \u201cforeshadowing\u201d analysis in the context of the second and third factors of <em>Hampton, </em>the majority misapprehends one of the primary purposes of this type of analysis. The majority acknowledges that judicial decisions are to be given complete retroactive effect. <em>People v Doyle, </em>451 Mich 93, 104; 545 NW2d 627 (1996). However, it fails to note that \u201c \u2018[c]omplete prospective application has generally been limited to decisions which overrule clear and uncontradicted case law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Hyde v Univ of Michigan Bd of Regents, </em>426 Mich 223, 240; 393 NW2d 847 (1986). Moreover, <em>only if </em>the decision is \u201cunexpected\u201d or \u201cindefensible\u201d in light of the law in place at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>of the conduct in question does retroactive application of the new decision even become problematic. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Thus, before any question of the retroactive application of a decision arises, \u201cit must be clear that the decision announces a new principle of law.\u201d <em>People v Phillips, </em>416 Mich 63, 68; 330 NW2d 366 (1982). A rule of law is \u201cnew\u201d for purposes of retroactivity analysis \u201ceither when an established precedent is overruled or when an issue of first impression is decided which was not adumbrated by any earlier appellate decision.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Albeit for different reasons, four members of this Court, in <em>Wright, </em>found the police officers\u2019 failure to inform a suspect of an attorney\u2019s presence to be impermissible police conduct. I cannot conclude that after <em>Wright, </em>the police did not have reason to be aware that withholding information regarding the presence of an attorney from a suspect was impermissible. Therefore, <em>Bender </em>is not a \u201cnew rule\u201d within the meaning of <em>Phillips.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Simply because <em>Wright </em>did not create an exclusionary rule per se does not lead to the conclusion that it did not foreshadow <em>Bender. </em>The majority evidently equates foreshadowing with the principle of stare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>decisis. However, had <em>Wright </em>created the exclusionary rule per se that the majority seems to think was necessary,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> not only would retroactivity of the <em>Bender </em>rule not be an issue, it need not have been decided at all (because <em>Wright </em>already would have done so). Therefore, equating foreshadowing with stare decisis renders the foreshadowing analysis pointless.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Presumably, the majority would conclude that the police are not sufficiently aware of the impermissibility of engaging in any relevant factor utilized in the totality-of-the-circumstances test for vohmtariness simply because the violation of any one factor might not result in an exclusion of evidence per se. However, official awareness of an exclusionary rule per se is <em>not </em>the same as official awareness that certain conduct is simply not allowed. Police misconduct is police misconduct, regardless of the consequences. The majority overlooks such misconduct simply because the police were unaware that the fruit of their misconduct would be absolutely inadmissible at trial. I submit that conduct so clearly contrary to <em>Wright </em>should not be rewarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Accordingly, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that <em>Bender </em>was not clearly foreshadowed by <em>Wright, </em>and, thus, <em>Bender </em>cannot be properly characterized as a \u201cnew rule.\u201d The majority\u2019s foreshadowing analysis is quite similar to the government\u2019s argument soundly rejected in <em>Johnson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>[T]he only Fourth Amendment rulings worthy of retroactive application are those in which the arresting officer violated pre-existing guidelines clearly established by prior cases. <em>But as we have seen above, cases involving simple application of clear, pre-existing Fourth Amendment guidelines raise no real questions of retroactivity at all. </em>Literally read, the Government\u2019s theory would automatically eliminate all Fourth Amendment rulings from consideration for retroactive application. <em>[Id. </em>at 560 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">This is precisely what the majority seeks to do here: Unless settled principles are applied, the decision should not be retroactive. In doing so, the majority distorts retroactivity jurisprudence and effectively renders engaging m retroactivity analysis in the future an exercise in futility by disallowing retroactive application of any rule that could possibly be characterized as \u201cunsettled\u201d in any infinitesimal way.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The majority\u2019s second error lies in its analysis of the <em>Hampton/Linkletter </em>factors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The three factors applied by the majority are set out in <em>Hampton </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>analyze: (1) the purpose of the new rule, (2) the general reliance on the old rule, and (3) the effect of retroactive application of the new rule on the administration of justice. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertions<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> regarding the purpose of the <em>Bender </em>rule, the <em>Bender </em>majority found the <em>Bender </em>rule necessary to protect \u201ca fundamental trial right\u201d that serves a value not \u201cnecessarily divorced from the correct ascertainment of guilt.\u201d <em>Bender </em>at 620-621.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the <em>Bender </em>rule is fully amenable to retroactive application, even under the law as so narrowly viewed by the majority.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The majority\u2019s assertions that the \u201cpolice acted in full compliance with the law as it existed at the time\u201d and that \u201cthe purpose of preventing police misconduct will in no way be served by retroactive applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>tion\u201d axe inconsistent with the plain import of <em>Wright </em>and with its admission that the Court of Appeals, subsequent to <em>Wright, </em>\u201ccorrectly employed a traditional totality-of-the-circumstances analysis in determining whether the defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">First, if <em>Wright </em>had established such a rule, <em>Bender </em>not only would have been an unnecessary decision, it could not possibly implicate retroactivity. Second, if failure to inform a suspect that an attorney was waiting to speak with him is an appropriate factor to be utilized in the test for vohmtariness, then how could the police possibly be unaware that such behavior was inappropriate? Third, the violation of <em>any </em>factor utilized in the totahty-of-the-circumstances test simply cannot be characterized as \u201cfull compliance with the law.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Fourth, the prevention of police misconduct certainly will be furthered by retroactive application of <em>Bender </em>because no legitimate reason existed for the police to ignore <em>Wright </em>and any reliance placed elsewhere is simply unjustified.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>In applying the third <em>Hampton </em>factor, the majority asserts that if <em>Bender </em>was applied retroactively, \u201c[c]onvictions would be called into question and evidence excluded that was obtained in full compliance with the law extant at the time the statement was given.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 67. There is no burden on the administration of justice where we require the police to follow the rules set forth by this Court that are designed to protect fundamental constitutional rights, i.e., <em>Wright. </em>Again, the majority\u2019s decision permits the police to ignore the plain significance of our decision in <em>Wright </em>simply because <em>Wright </em>did not adopt an exclusionary rule per se. It is this ultimate conclusion that I find illogical, legally unjustifiable, and constitutionally offensive.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">In sum, I believe we should take the significant step of adopting the consistent, simple, and clear approach to retroactivity utilized by the federal courts. In addition, the majority\u2019s retroactivity analysis is in error for two reasons: <em>Bender </em>is not a \u201cnew rule\u201d of law because it was foreshadowed by <em>Wright, </em>and application of the <em>Hampton/Linkletter </em>factors mandates retroactive application of <em>Bender. </em>Accordingly, I conclude that retroactive application of <em>Bender </em>is appropriate, no matter the test applied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b166-8\">Cavanagh and Kelly, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-8\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\"> The majority observes that the \u201cconclusion that <em>Griffith </em>mandates retroactive application only with respect to rules that emanate from the federal constitution is in accord with the approach adopted in both federal and state courts.\u201d See <em>ante, </em>pp 55-56. I agree; it is a fairly basic principle of law that United States Supreme Court precedent does not <em>control </em>decisions based on state law, constitutional or otherwise. The issue presented in this case is not whether we <em>must </em>apply <em>Griffith, </em>but whether we <em>should.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b154-9\"> <em>Edwards </em>was not applied retroactively to cases pending on collateral review. See <em>Solem v Stumes, </em>465 US 638; 104 S Ct 1338; 79 L Ed 2d 579 (1984). This comports with the distinction outlined in <em>Griffith </em>between those cases pending on direct review and those on collateral review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b157-7\"> While I do not believe that we should blindly apply federal retroactivity precedent to cases involving principles of state law, I also do not believe that we should blindly ignore it. We have a tradition of reviewing federal courts for guidance in this area. Undertaking an analysis of the current applicable federal retroactivity precedent is appropriate and consistent with our own jurisprudence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b159-6\"> Apparently we took notice of Justice Moody\u2019s observation that the \u201csimplicity and clarity of the limited retroactivity rule adopted by the <em>Johnson </em>Court stands in stark contrast to the relative inconsistency, in analysis and result, in Michigan retroactivity decisions. More importantly, however, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s agreement with Justice Harlan\u2019s statement in <em>Desist </em>that retroactivity needs to be rethought will, hopefully, provide further impetus for such rethinking in Michigan.\u201d Moody at 509, n 359. Unfortunately, the majority retreats from our foray into simplicity, clarity, and consistency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\"> For purposes of \u201climited retroactivity,\u201d the phrase \u201cpending on appeal\u201d is construed to include only those cases pending on timely direct appeal from the trial court to the Court of Appeals or on timely application to the Michigan Supreme Court from the Court of Appeals. Moody at 470.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\"> The majority refers to the definition of \u201cnew rule\u201d found in <em>Teague v Lane, </em>489 US 288, 301; 109 S Ct 1060; 103 L Ed 2d 334 (1989). See <em>ante, </em>p 61, n 42. However, this Court currently uses the definition articulated in <em>Phillips, supra. </em>If it is the desire of the majority to overrule <em>Phillips, </em>it may certainly do so. In this vein, much of the disagreement between the majority and the dissent in this case lies in the answer to the question when should we apply federal precedent. Both could endlessly throw stones about which position is most true to federal jurisprudence for every nuance of every issue presented in this case, and both may even be right. However, the underlying premise of my view is that, with regard to the issue of retroactivity, we should follow federal precedent instead of continuing to apply the confusing, heavily criticized, and easily manipulated test utilized by the majority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b162-8\"> \u201cGiven that the majority in <em>Wright </em>did not agree that failure to allow retained counsel access to the client-mandated exclusion of the statements as a matter per se it cannot be said that <em>Wright </em>foreshadowed <em>Bender.\" Ante, </em>p 65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\"> I find the majority\u2019s retroactivity analysis analogous to the retroactivity test found to be an \u201cabsurdity\u201d by the Supreme Court in <em>Johnson. </em>Long before the decision regarding arrests without warrants, whose retroactive application was at issue in <em>Johnson, </em>the Court had \u201cquestioned the constitutionality of warrantless home arrests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560. The Court, in rejecting the government\u2019s argument that only <em>settled </em>Fourth Amendment issues should be applied retroactively, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-9\">Official awareness of the dubious constitutionality of a practice would be counterbalanced by official certainty that, so long as the Fourth Amendment law in the area remained unsettled, evidence obtained through the questionable practice would be excluded only in the one case definitively resolving the unsettled question. Failure to accord any retroactive effect to Fourth Amendment rulings would \u201cencourage police or other courts to disregard the plain purport of our decisions and to adopt a let\u2019s-wait-until-it\u2019s-decided approach.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 561.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Given that a majority of this Court in <em>Wright </em>clearly expressed the \u201cdubious constitutionality\u201d of the failure to inform a suspect of the presence of an attorney, I believe that the police had sufficient notice that such a practice was impermissible. The majority\u2019s decision gives the police little incentive to err on the side of a defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. It permits the police to disregard our decisions, adopting a let\u2019s-wait-until-we-absohitely-cannot-get-the-evidence-in-when-we-violate-adefendant\u2019s-constitutional-rights approach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b164-8\"> As already noted, the majority asserts that the \u201cpurpose of the <em>Bender </em>rule is to provide \u2018prophylactic\u2019 protection against potential <em>Miranda </em>violations by mandating suppression as a deterrence to police misconduct.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>pp 61-62. In addition, \u201cthe <em>Bender </em>rule is not relevant to the ascertainment of guilt or innocence and does not implicate the integrity of the fact-finding process.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 62.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b164-9\"> It is true that <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not mandated by the federal constitution. See <em>ante, </em>p 62. However, <em>Bender </em>is rooted in the protection of Michigan constitutional rights, and what this Court held in <em>Bender </em>is controlling, not what the United States Supreme Court has stated about <em>Miranda. </em>As the majority points out, federal law does not control the issues presented in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b164-10\"> \u201c \u2018When a decision of this Court involves a rule which concerns the ascertainment of guilt or innocence, retroactive application may be appropriate.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 63, quoting <em>People v Young, </em>410 Mich 363, 367; 301 NW2d 803 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b165-6\"> The majority says that the <em>\u201cessence </em>of the totahfy-of-the-eireumstances approach is the antithesis of an approach identifying any specific factor as illegal.\u201d See <em>ante, </em>p 60, n 42. There is a decided difference between violating a factor in the totality of the circumstances and creating an exclusionary rule per se. However, the majority\u2019s logic means that the police do not know that violating any factor so utilized is impermissible conduct unless and until a court has determined, after the fact, that a defendant\u2019s statement was involuntary. Essentially, the police may then violate a certain quantum of factors before the behavior becomes \u201cillegal.\u201d The consequences of one\u2019s actions do not necessarily determine whether the action taken is itself legal. If the majority was correct, whatever would be the purpose of articulating the factors to be used in a totality-of-thecireumstances test? None by themselves are \u201cillegal.\u201d In my view, the purpose of articulating the factors is to place the police on notice of what behavior is appropriate and what behavior is not. Here, the police were on clear notice, and, thus, their behavior was not \u201clegal\u201d as the term is used by the majority.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
