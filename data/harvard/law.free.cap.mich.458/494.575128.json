We conclude that the commission exceeded its authority in this case and that the magistrate is the proper person to make additional fact findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">Plaintiff-appellant William D. Layman is a journeyman lineman who worked without physical restrictions for approximately thirty-five years, despite having a preexisting condition of spinal arthritis. In July 1991, his union hall assigned him to a job with defendant-appellee Newkirk Electric Associates, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">On October 17, 1991, plaintiff was participating in a Newkirk project that involved tearing down large electrical cables. The assignment required him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>work on utility poles from the elevated bucket of a bucket truck. He spent six to eight hours in that position. Because the distance between the utility poles was short, he remained in the bucket while the truck was moved from pole to pole.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The brakes on the bucket truck were malfunctioning, causing him to be thrown about inside the bucket whenever the truck stopped. Plaintiff was unable to anticipate which way the truck would lunge. As a result, his waist was repeatedly banged against the rim of the bucket. He was also unable to protect himself because his hands were occupied with preventing an overhead cable from falling on light fixtures and pedestrians.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Plaintiff finished the work day, but he had difficulty getting out of bed the following Monday morning because of soreness in his back. He never returned to work at Newkirk. Newkirk voluntarily paid worker\u2019s compensation benefits to plaintiff from October 1991, through March 1992, but not afterward, because its insurer disputed Newkirk\u2019s liability for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Plaintiff worked for defendant-appellee Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc., from June 29, 1992, to August 12, 1992. This job required him to climb utility poles with a hook and belt. Plaintiff was unable to perform all his duties. Other workers did some of the work for him, and it was necessary for him to take several aspirin each day in order to tolerate his pain. He turned down the jobs he was offered following his employment with Henkels &amp; McCoy.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Plaintiff filed a claim for worker\u2019s compensation benefits on March 24, 1992. The case proceeded to a hearing before Magistrate B. Lloyd Blair in Detroit on July 21, 1993. At the hearing, plaintiff testified that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>no longer was able to perform the jobs he had done in the past. He said he had difficulty even walking, and it was necessary for him to stop and rest whenever he walked as much as half a mile.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The medical testimony generally supported the conclusion that plaintiff has a bad back, but there was disagreement concerning the cause and the severity of his condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In a decision mailed August 16, 1993, the magistrate awarded open-ended benefits to plaintiff. He found that plaintiff was a believable witness, that his account of the October 17, 1991, incident was unrebutted, and that he suffered a work-related aggravation of a preexisting back condition on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Defendant Newkirk appealed to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission. On June 14, 1995, the commission reversed the magistrate\u2019s decision, and denied plaintiff\u2019s claim for benefits. 1995 Mich ACO 1389.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">The Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This Court granted plaintiff\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">H. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">This Court is asked to review a decision of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission. According to the Michigan Constitution, \u201cFindings of fact in workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud unless otherwise provided by law.\u201d Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 28. Additionally, MCL 418.861a(3); MSA 17.237(861a)(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Beginning October 1, 1986 findings of fact made by a worker\u2019s compensation magistrate shall be considered conclusive by the commission if supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence on the whole record. As used in this subsection, \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d means such evidence, considering the whole record, as a reasonable mind will accept as adequate to justify the conclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">This Court recently stated in <em>Goff v Bil-Mar Foods, Inc (After Remand):</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">[W]here a party claims that the wcac has exceeded its power by reversing the magistrate, meaningful review must begin with the magistrate\u2019s decision, because if competent, material, and substantial evidence based on the whole record supports the magistrate\u2019s decision, the wcac need go no further. If it does, the wcac is exceeding its authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">A. THE MAGISTRATE\u2019S FINDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The magistrate recognized that Newkirk had voluntarily paid worker\u2019s compensation benefits to plaintiff between October 1991, and March 1992, and was contesting plaintiff\u2019s disability only after March 1992. After reviewing plaintiff\u2019s testimony and that of the medical experts, the magistrate found an October 17, 1991, injury date and a continuing disability from the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">John S. Warner, D.C., a chiropractor who began treating plaintiff before the incident with Newkirk,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> testified that plaintiff suffered from either a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>pressed nerve root or a herniated disc at the L5-S1 interval. He said plaintiff should avoid bending and twisting and should lift no more than ten pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Chiropractor Wallace Ross examined plaintiff on February 25, 1992, pursuant to a request by CNA Insurance Company. Dr. Ross detected arthritis throughout the spine. He estimated that the condition had been present for approximately ten years. He opined that the October 17, 1991, incident could have caused muscle strain, but that the condition would have been resolved after several weeks. He said plaintiff should not lift more than thirty-five pounds, and that his condition would improve if he obeyed restrictions and performed strengthening exercises.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Christopher Schaiberger, M.D., a neurologist, examined plaintiff on June 3, 1992, pursuant to a referral for a neurological examination of plaintiffs lower back and extremities. He found degenerative arthritis in the lumbar region, with spurring at L5-SI, and he expressed the opinion that these problems existed before the incident on October 17, 1991. He felt the injury could have originated with trauma or could have developed spontaneously. He recommended no bending, no twisting, and no lifting over fifty pounds without help.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Harvey Andre, M.D., who examined plaintiff on March 25, 1993, found degenerative arthritis at L3 and L4-5. He said plaintiff could perform only light work and that he should avoid stooping, bending, twisting, pushing and pulling, and should lift no more than five pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The magistrate found plaintiff believable, his account of the accident unrebutted, and ruled that plaintiff suffered a work-related aggravation of a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>existing back condition on October 17, 1991. The magistrate explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\">There is agreement between Drs. Ross and Schaiberger that plaintiff has arthritic changes in his entire spine which predated October 17, 1991. I so find. And, although Dr. Schaiberger acknowledged that plaintiff\u2019s problems stemming from his arthritis could have originated spontaneously, I find that they did not. The theory of spontaneous initiation in this case flies in the face of plaintiff\u2019s activities of October 17, 1991. To find spontaneous origin here, one would have to completely ignore plaintiff\u2019s undisputed testimony that he was banged around waist height in the bucket of a bucket truck which turned out to have had an improperly functioning master brake cylinder. Accordingly, I find the experience of October 17, 1991, combined with plaintiff\u2019s arthritic condition and resulted in his current low-back disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">All the experts agree plaintiff is disabled by arthritis and should be restricted from various activities which his job as a lineman would demand. I therefore find an injury date of October 17, 1991, and continuing disability from said injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">I do not find that work plaintiff did for Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc. subsequent to leaving defendant, Newkirk Electric Associates, Inc., changed plaintiff\u2019s basic underlying condition. No specific injury or occurrence was alleged. Plaintiff was \u201ccarried\u201d by co-workers and could only tolerate what little work he did by taking 12 to 16 aspirins per day. He definitely was disabled when he went to work for Henkels &amp; McCoy, Inc., but this job did not contribute to or aggravate his underlying condition. I find no July, 1992 injury date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">On the basis of his findings, the magistrate awarded open-ended benefits to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">B. THE COMMISSION\u2019S REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Defendant Newkirk appealed to the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission. Among other mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ters, Newkirk argued that the magistrate committed legal error requiring reversal by not applying the significant-manner standard of MCL 418.301(2); MSA 17.237(301)(2). The standard provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">Mental disabilities and conditions of the aging process, including but not limited to heart and cardiovascular conditions, shall be compensable if contributed to or aggravated or accelerated by the employment in a <em>significant manner. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Plaintiff argued that the magistrate based his finding of injury on MCL 418.301(1); MSA 17.237(301)(1). It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">An employee, who receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment by an employer who is subject to this act at the time of the injury, shall be paid compensation as provided in this act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The commission noted that there was \u201cno dispute that plaintiff suffers from a type of arthritis which is a condition of the aging process. As such, the significant contribution test of MCL 418.301(2) [MSA 17.237(301)(2)] applies.\u201d 1995 Mich ACO 1391. It concluded that the magistrate had clearly erred in failing to apply the significant-manner test. The commission then disregarded some of the magistrate\u2019s factual findings and made its own findings. The panel said that an omission by the magistrate made it appropriate for it to exercise its limited fact-finding powers under <em>Holden v Ford Motor Co, </em>439 Mich 257; 484 NW2d 227 (1992), and <em>Woody v Cello-Foil Products </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>(On Remand), </em>204 Mich App 259; 514 NW2d 228 (1994).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">The panel then undertook to determine whether plaintiff\u2019s work-related injury was a significant factor in causing his disability. It found that plaintiff\u2019s work was not a significant factor in causing his disability for the following reasons: Dr. Warner\u2019s testimony was equivocal at best in regard to the significance of the work incident in relation to plaintiff\u2019s overall condition. Dr. Schaiberger\u2019s testimony \u201cfell far short of opining that work was a significant factor.\u201d 1995 Mich ACO 1394. Dr. Ross \u201ctestified that plaintiff\u2019s work incidents at most caused a temporary symptomatic aggravation, as opposed to a permanent pathological aggravation . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1395. The commission concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">We are not persuaded that the workplace incidents plaintiff complained of were of such a nature that they would have significantly contributed to plaintiff\u2019s already existing complaints caused by his degenerative arthritic condition. Certainly, when the record below is reviewed as a whole, it does not support a finding of a significant or pathological aggravation of plaintiff\u2019s longstanding arthritic condition. Accordingly, we reverse the Magistrate\u2019s open award of benefits. [J&amp;]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">m. impermissible fact finding by the commission</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">The commission engaged in improper fact finding, initially, when it concluded that plaintiff\u2019s arthritis was a condition of the aging process. A review of the magistrate\u2019s opinion shows that he found \u201carthritic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>changes in [Mr. Layman\u2019s] entire spine which predated October 17, 1991.\u201d This does not equate with a finding that the arthritis was a condition of the aging process. While arthritis may be related to the aging process, it is certainly not always aging-related. <em>Taber\u2019s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary. </em>Arthritis is often caused by repetitive stress on a certain part of a person\u2019s body, and can occur at any time in a person\u2019s lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">The magistrate did not make a specific finding regarding whether plaintiff\u2019s arthritis was part of the aging process. Whether a plaintiff\u2019s arthritis is part of the aging process is the type of medical factual inquiry that is reserved for the magistrate\u2019s fact-finding powers. Without a finding by the magistrate, the commission is not entitled to invoke the significant-manner test.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The commission cites this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Holden </em>and the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Woody </em>as justification to exercise its limited fact-finding powers and to then apply the significant-manner test. However, we have since reversed the <em>Woody </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">In <em>Woody v Cello-Foil Products, </em>we examined (1) whether the magistrate made sufficient findings of fact regarding work-related causation, and (2) whether those findings were supported by substantial, material, and competent evidence on the whole record. The Court of Appeals had ruled that, because the magistrate made no findings regarding the origin of the plaintiff\u2019s sensitivity, the commission was free to make a factual finding of its own. <em>Woody, </em>204 Mich App 262. In reversing the decision of the Court of Appeals, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The magistrate did not make findings of fact that were sufficiently detailed for us to separate the facts found from the law applied. Further, the conclusory findings are inadequate because we need to know the path taken through the conflicting evidence, the testimony adopted, the standards followed, and the reasoning used to reach his conclusion. <em>[Woody v Cello-Foil Products (After Remand), </em>450 Mich 588, 597; 546 NW2d 226 (1996).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We remanded the case to the magistrate \u201cfor further proceedings and detailed findings of fact regarding whether the plaintiff\u2019s injury was caused by her exposure to mek at defendant company.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Kostamo v Marquette Iron Mining Co, </em>405 Mich 105, 138; 274 NW2d 411 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">In the case at bar, it is not clear whether the magistrate based his decision on subsection 1 or subsection 2 of MCL 418.301; MSA 17.237(301). The commission stated: \u201cA review of the Magistrate\u2019s opinion reveals that he failed to apply the \u2018significant manner\u2019 test, <em>apparently </em>applying a less stringent \u2018causal relationship\u2019 standard . . . .\u201d 1995 Mich ACO 1392. Plaintiff argues that evidence that the magistrate applied the significant-manner test is shown by the magistrate\u2019s use of terms like \u201coriginated,\u201d \u201cinitiation,\u201d and \u201cresulted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">For the commission to find that those terms clearly convey the magistrate\u2019s application of the significant-manner test requires the commission \u201cto speculate regarding the facts and the legal reasoning that the magistrate relied on to reach his conclusion,\u201d which it cannot do. <em>Woody, </em>450 Mich 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">The commission also cited this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Holden, supra, </em>to support its decision to enter into the fact-finding arena. It remarked that, in both the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>case at bar and in <em>Holden, </em>the magistrate had failed to make certain findings of fact essential to a legal determination regarding causation. In <em>Holden, </em>the wcac ruled that the magistrate\u2019s findings and conclusions were not supported by substantial evidence on the whole record, and then proceeded to make its own findings. This Court found that the commission did not exceed its legislatively prescribed reviewing function.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Any interpretation of <em>Holden </em>as permitting the commission to make original fact finding on issues overlooked by the magistrate is refuted by our subsequent decision in <em>Woody. </em>We hold in the instant case, as we did in <em>Woody, </em>that the proper person to make findings of fact is the magistrate. On remand, the magistrate must be given the task of providing comprehensive findings of fact while applying the proper legal standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The Legislature intended that the magistrate have the final word regarding most fact finding and that the commission play a much more limited role:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">A primary purpose of [1985 PA 103] is to make the decisions of the magistrates final in most cases. While an appeal can be filed, it is intended that relatively few appeals will be successful. The number of members of the workers\u2019 compensation appellate tribunal has been reduced because the appellate role has been reduced from factfinder to a limited review for error. The decision of the magistrates will in most cases constitute the final decision. <em>[Civil Service Comm v Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>424 Mich 571, 621; 384 NW2d 728 (1986), amended by 425 Mich 1201 (1986).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">We agree with plaintiff that the commission went beyond its legislatively prescribed function of reviewing the magistrate\u2019s decision and substituted its inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>pretation of the evidence for the findings of the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In <em>Goff, supra </em>at 538, this Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">If the magistrate\u2019s decision is reasonably supported in the record by any competent, material, and substantial evidence, then it is conclusive and the WCAC must affirm. If it does not, it is exceeding the scope of its reviewing power and <em>impermissibly substituting its judgment </em>for the magistrate\u2019s. In reviewing the magistrate\u2019s decision, the WCAC must do so with sensitivity and deference toward the findings and conclusions of the magistrate in its assessment of the record. If in its review the wcac finds that the magistrate did not rely on competent evidence, it must carefully detail its findings of fact and the reasons for its findings grounded in the record. If after such careful review of the record the wcac finds that the magistrate\u2019s determination was not made on the basis of substantial evidence and is therefore not conclusive, then it is free to make its own findings. In such circumstances, the findings of fact of the wcac are conclusive if the commission was acting within its powers. Ultimately, the role of the Court of Appeals and this Court is only to evaluate whether the wcac exceeded its authority. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">We hold that the commission exceeded its authority when it made impermissible findings of fact in the absence of findings by the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">A reviewing court should not identify alternative findings that could be supported by substantial evidence and supplant the agency\u2019s findings with them. <em>Arkansas v Oklahoma, </em>503 US 91, 113; 112 S Ct 1046; 117 L Ed 2d 239 (1992), and see <em>In re Payne, </em>444 Mich 679, 692; 514 NW2d 121 (1994). In the instant case, the commission \u201cgave only passing lip service\u201d to the requirement that the commission be aware of the deference due the magistrate. <em>Goff supra </em>at 536, citing <em>Holden, supra. </em>The commission justified impos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ing its own factual conclusions because the magistrate did not use the magic words \u201csignificant manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">It essentially turned the substantial-evidence standard on its head when it embarked on its own fact-finding journey. <em>Arkansas, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">MCL 418.861a(12); MSA 17.237(861a)(12) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-7\">The commission or a panel of the commission may remand a matter to a worker\u2019s compensation magistrate for purposes of supplying a complete record if it is determined that the record is insufficient for purposes of review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Where a magistrate\u2019s findings are insufficient for appellate review, nothing in the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act prevents this Court or the Court of Appeals from remanding the case to the magistrate for additional fact finding. <em>Woody, </em>450 Mich 588. The office of the magistrate is the appropriate place for additional fact finding because only the magistrate has the opportunity to observe live testimony and argument.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">The commission engaged in impermissible fact finding in the absence of findings by the magistrate. The findings that the magistrate did make were made on the basis of competent, material, and substantial evidence. The magistrate did find an injury date of October 17, 1991, and continuing disability from that date. Unfortunately, the magistrate did not clearly delineate which standard he applied to find the injury. Additionally, it is not clear that the magistrate found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>that plaintiffs arthritis is a condition of the aging process, thus requiring the application of the significant-manner test. The commission was in error when it stated that the magistrate found that plaintiff suffers from a preexisting aging condition. The magistrate did not make that finding. A determination on the issue must be made on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">We conclude that the commission erred in disregarding certain of the magistrate\u2019s findings and reversing the award of benefits. Where a factual finding needs to be made, but has not been rendered by the magistrate, the case should be remanded to the magistrate. When the commission finds that the magistrate has failed to make necessary fact findings, it should remand the case to the magistrate for that purpose. See <em>Woody, </em>450 Mich 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">We hold that the commission must remand this case, and other cases where fact findings are incomplete, to the magistrate for the requisite fact finding. To hold otherwise would deprive parties of any meaningful review of factual findings by the commission. The commission must review the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by competent, material, and substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">We vacate the June 14, 1995, decision of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission. We remand this case to the magistrate to determine whether plaintiff\u2019s arthritis is a condition of the aging process, and, if so, to determine whether the significant-manner test of MCL 418.301(2); MSA 17.237(301)(2) applies to this case. The magistrate shall then reconsider whether plaintiff\u2019s work-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>injury contributed to or aggravated or accelerated his disability in a significant manner. In order to facilitate subsequent appellate review, the magistrate is directed to analyze the evidence and make detailed findings under the significant-manner test, even if he determines that the test is not applicable in this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b590-5\">Mallett, C.J., and Brickley and Cavanagh, JJ., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-11\"> Unpublished order, entered December 14, 1995 (Docket No. 187340).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-12\"> 456 Mich 891 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b579-10\"> 454 Mich 507, 513; 563 NW2d 214 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b579-11\"> Plaintiff consulted with Dr. Warner about his back pain on May 22, 1990.

I also agree that, given the absence of such findings, the record is inadequate for review and the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission is not free to make its own findings. In <em>Goff v Bil-Mar Foods, Inc (After Remand), </em>454 Mich 507; 563 NW2d 214 (1997), we observed that, if the WCAC finds on review that the magistrate did not rely on competent evidence, the WCAC must detail its findings and their basis in the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the wcac properly applies this standard, \u201cit is free to make its own findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538. However, if the wcac does not base its decision on the evidence in the record as a whole and misapplies the substantial evidence standard, it exceeds its statutory authority. Requiring the wcac to carefully detail its findings of fact and the reasons for its findings grounded in the record<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>consistent with limited judicial review, and the Legislature\u2019s elimination of de novo administrative review.

The commission then reversed the award of open benefits because it found that the plaintiffs work-related injury did not contribute to his disabled status in a significant manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">I agree with the majority that the magistrate failed to specifically find that plaintiffs arthritis was a condition of the aging process. I write separately, however, because I disagree with its conclusion that the magistrate is the only proper person to make additional fact findings in this and \u201cother cases where fact findings are incomplete.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 509.

THE COMMISSION\u2019S FACT-FINDING AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">I agree with the majority that the magistrate failed to make a specific fact finding regarding whether plaintiff\u2019s arthritis was a condition of the aging process. <em>Ante </em>at 504. However, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s assertion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">[w]hether a plaintiff\u2019s arthritis is part of the aging process is the type of medical factual inquiry that is reserved for the magistrate\u2019s fact-finding powers. Without a finding by the magistrate, the commission is not entitled to invoke the significant-manner test. <em>[Id,.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">That the Legislature has provided the commission with fact-finding powers cannot be disputed. MCL 418.861a(14); MSA 17.237(861a)(14) clearly refers to the commission\u2019s role as factfinder by providing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\"><em>The findings of fact made by the commission acting within its powers, in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Further evidence of the commission\u2019s role as finder of fact appears in subsections 861a(10) and (12), which state in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">(10) The commission . . . may adopt, <em>in whole or in part, </em>the order and opinion of the worker\u2019s compensation magistrate as the order and opinion of the commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\"># H* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">(12) The commission . . . <em>may remand </em>a matter to a worker\u2019s compensation magistrate <em>for purposes of supplying a complete record </em>if it is determined that the record is insufficient for purposes of review. [MCL 418.861a(10), (12); MSA 17.237(861a)(10), (12) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Subsection 10 allows the commission to adopt any part of the magistrate\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This provision would impliedly allow the commission to both disagree with and make additional findings where so required. Further, subsection 12 vests discretion regarding the sufficiency of the record with the commission. Under this subsection, remands are appropriate only where the record is incomplete or insufficient for review. Where requisite facts exist on the record, there is no need to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">The commission\u2019s fact-finding role was acknowledged by this Court in <em>Holden </em>and <em>Goff, supra, </em>and <em>Woody v Cello-Foil Products (After Remand), </em>450 Mich 588; 546 NW2d 226 (1996). <em>Holden </em>has neither been expressly overruled nor limited in regard to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>recognition of the commission\u2019s statutorily prescribed fact-finding function. The majority is, therefore, incorrect in its assertion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-4\">[a]ny interpretation of <em>Holden </em>as permitting the commission to make original fact finding on issues overlooked by the magistrate is refuted by our subsequent decision in <em>Woody. [Ante </em>at 506.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the <em>Woody </em>majority did not hold that the commission is without authority to make fact findings in the absence of initial findings by the magistrate. Rather, it held that, where the magistrate\u2019s opinion is so unclear that administrative appellate review becomes a guessing game,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the commission should remand for clarification from the magistrate instead of speculating.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This is a far cry from the majority\u2019s interpretation of Woody\u2019s holding that would always disallow original fact finding by the commission even where, as here, the magistrate\u2019s opinion is clear and intelligible, but incomplete.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Because the commission in this case did not have to engage in speculation, this case is factually distinguishable from <em>Woody. </em>Indeed, in this case, the magistrate\u2019s opinion is clear, but incomplete because the magistrate did not make any finding regarding the relationship of plaintiff\u2019s condition to the aging process. Such a determination was necessary given the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>uncontested evidence of plaintiffs preexisting arthritic condition. In light of the magistrate\u2019s failure, the commission in this case, as in <em>Farrington v Total Petroleum, Inc, </em>442 Mich 201; 501 NW2d 76 (1993), had the authority to make the requisite fact findings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Furthermore, the majority\u2019s claim that the magistrate is in a better position to make fact findings because the majority can observe \u201clive testimony and argument\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is disingenuous and inapplicable to the facts of this case, in which three of the four experts to testify did so by deposition. See 439 Mich 286. In <em>Weiss v Jewish Home for the Aged, </em>the companion case to <em>Holden, supra, </em>this Court affirmed the commission\u2019s finding of fact and explained that \u201cthe magistrate is not in a better position than the [commission] to assess the evidence,\u201d which in that case, as in the instant case, primarily consisted of expert medical testimony by deposition. <em>Id. </em>at 286. Just as in <em>Weiss, </em>where the magistrate\u2019s failure to make factual findings did not preclude the commission from making such requisite findings, so too in the instant case, the magistrate\u2019s failure to make a finding regarding whether plaintiff\u2019s arthritis was a condition of the aging process does not preclude the commission from making such findings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>n. THE COMMISSION\u2019S FINDINGS IN THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">It is well established that findings of fact made by the commission are conclusive upon appellate review and may not be set aside by this Court if supported by <em>any </em>competent evidence. MCL 418.861a(14); MSA 17.237(861a)(14); <em>Holden, supra </em>at 263. In the absence of findings by the magistrate, the commission found that plaintiff suffered from the type of arthritis that is a \u201ccondition[] of the aging process\u201d and that plaintiffs claim failed to survive the significant-manner test of subsection 301(2). This Court reviews these factual findings by the commission for \u201cany competent evidence.\u201d MCL 418.861a(14); MSA 17.237(861a)(14). Because the commission\u2019s findings are supported by competent evidence, this Court should affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The record in this case contains testimony from four doctors, all of whom recognized plaintiff\u2019s preexisting, arthritic condition and indicated that it was related to aging. From this deposition testimony, the commission concluded, \u201cThere is no dispute that plaintiff suffers from a type of arthritis which is a condition of the aging process.\u201d 1995 Mich ACO 1389, 1391.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Specifically, in support of this conclusion, the commission quoted the following facts and findings of the magistrate.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-6\">\u201cDr. Christopher Schaiberger, M.D., saw plaintiff on June 3, 1992 on referral for a neurological examination of plaintiff\u2019s lower back and extremities. The examination proved normal. However, the doctor found significant \u201clumbar degenerative arthritic\u201d changes, which in his opinion, preexisted October 17, 1991. Spurring at L5-S1 was observed. Dr. Schaiberger said that trauma could have initiated plaintiff\u2019s problems; but, he also noted that they could have developed spontaneously. Plaintiff, the physician said, should be limited to no bending, twisting and no lifting over 50 pounds without help. The doctor was surprised that plaintiff expressed a desire to return to work. Dr. Schaiberger admitted that plaintiff had degenerative changes throughout his entire spine. He would encourage plaintiff to lose weight. Plaintiff was said to be approximately 70 pounds overweight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">\u201cDr. Harvey Andre, M.D., in a report based upon an examination of March 25, 1993 found degenerative changes at L3, L4-5. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">\u201cThere is agreement between Drs. Ross and Schaiberger that plaintiff has arthritic changes in his entire spine which predated October 17, 1991. I so find.\u201d [1995 Mich ACO 1391.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">The record provides further evidence that plaintiffs arthritic condition was age related. Indeed, two of the three experts quoted by the commission found arthritic degeneration of the whole spine, not just of the area that was directly injured in the October 1991 incident. Dr. Schaiberger found the degeneration to be significant, and he implied that plaintiffs overweight condition was a factor. Dr. Ross estimated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>significant degeneration to have started approximately ten years before, a date that was not associated with a prior injury or discovery of arthritis. Dr. Schaiberger testified that a majority of individuals plaintiffs age, in their mid-fifties, would have similar arthritic changes. Drs. Warner and Ross also testified and shared the opinion that plaintiff suffered from degenerative changes common in individuals of plaintiffs age.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">I would find that these facts serve as competent evidence that plaintiffs arthritis was a condition of age. Therefore, because the record itself contains sufficient facts from which to make the requisite findings, there is neither any need nor statutory requirement that this Court, or the commission, remand to the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">In the absence of any finding by the magistrate, the commission found that the plaintiffs condition was related to the aging process and applied the significant-manner test of subsection 301(2) to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-8\">[Plaintiff\u2019s work was not a significant factor in causing his disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-9\">We are not persuaded that the workplace incidents plaintiff complained of were of such a nature that they would have significantly contributed to plaintiff\u2019s already existing complaints caused by his degenerative arthritic condition. Certainly, when the record below is reviewed as a whole, it does not support a finding of a significant or pathological aggravation of plaintiff\u2019s longstanding arthritic condition. [1995 Mich ACO 1393, 1395.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The commission started its review by noting a critical fact to which the magistrate failed to give much attention \u2014 plaintiff was treated by one of the experts, his chiropractor Dr. Warner, \u201cfor the same lower back pain on several occasions,\u201d five to be exact, before the 1991 injury. 1995 Mich ACO 1393. The commission then found Dr. Schaiberger\u2019s testimony failed to prove significant aggravation. Rather, it considered both Drs. Schaiberger\u2019s and Warner\u2019s testimony to be equivocal regarding the cause of plaintiff\u2019s increased pain after the 1991 injury. Indeed, Dr. Warner testified that the pain was greater immediately following the 1991 injury, but also found plaintiff\u2019s persisting pain was caused by his degenerative arthritic condition. Dr. Warner further testified that plaintiff suffered from stenosis, which is most commonly a degenerative change fairly common to individuals who, like plaintiff, are in their mid-fifties. Further, the doctor acknowledged that, because he did not review any pre-1991 medical examinations or reports, he could not measure the degree or extent of plaintiff\u2019s degenerative condition. Dr. Warner did testify, however, that he treated plaintiff for back pain that plaintiff claimed to have suffered from for twenty years or so.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">In contrast to this, the commission found Dr. Ross\u2019 testimony to be unequivocal in its conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s work-related injury \u201cat most caused a temporary symptomatic aggravation.\u201d 1995 Mich ACO 1395. Indeed, Dr. Ross\u2019 medical report projected that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">[t]he hypertrophy of the facets and the degenerative joint disease changes will continue to predispose this patient to lower back complaints. However, these findings are preexisting prior to patient\u2019s work related injury of October 17, 1991.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>Drs. Ross and Warner noted that plaintiff had been improving until he visited a chiropractor for an independent medical examination on December 2, 1991, at which time plaintiff claimed he was reinjured by a Dr. Hamilton. Finally, Dr. Ross concluded that plaintiff had \u201creached pre-accident status\u201d when he saw him, and that \u201cthe patient\u2019s present diagnosis [was] not related to his work injury . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">The significant-manner test under subsection 301(2) further required the commission to consider the totality of both occupational and nonoccupational factors, such as plaintiff\u2019s weight, age, diet, and prior injuries. <em>Farrington, supra </em>at 217, n 17. There is competent evidence in the record to suggest weight and age, as previously discussed, were significant causes of plaintiff\u2019s current arthritic condition. Indeed, Dr. Schaiberger recognized that plaintiff was overweight by roughly seventy pounds and that this \u201cexcess baggage\u201d increased both the level of symptoms, or pain, and the deterioration of plaintiff\u2019s spine. Dr. Ross also indicated that some of plaintiff\u2019s back problems were caused by his excess weight. Furthermore, there is also competent evidence that an independent, subsequent injury could have caused or significantly contributed to plaintiff\u2019s on-going back complaints. Dr. Warner testified that plaintiff was reinjured during a December 2, 1991, independent medical examination. This examination, according to Dr. Warner, resulted in \u201capproximately 13 additional orthopedic findings\u201d of injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">I would find that these facts and the evidence on the record constitute the requisite competent evidence to support the commission\u2019s factual finding that plaintiff\u2019s injury did not contribute to or aggra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>vate his arthritic condition in a significant manner as required by subsection 301(2) of the act. Accordingly, I would affirm the commission\u2019s reversal of the magistrate\u2019s open award under subsection 301(2).</p>\n<judges id=\"b604-6\">Taylor, J., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-5\"> The magistrate acknowledged that plaintiff had arthritic changes throughout his spine that predated the 1991 injury.

Subsection 301(1) of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act requires that an employee \u201cwho receives a personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment by an employer\u201d subject to the act \u201cshall be paid compensation</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-8\"> Subsection 301(2), which sets forth the significant-manner test, imposes a higher burden of proof and requires a closer causal nexus than an award under subsection 301(1). <em>Farrington v Total Petroleum, Inc, </em>442 Mich 201; 501 NW2d 76 (1993). Subsection 301(2) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">Mental disabilities and <em>conditions of the aging process, </em>including but not limited to heart and cardiovascular conditions, <em>shall be compensable if contributed to or aggravated or accelerated by the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number><em>employment in a significant manner. </em>[MCL 418.301(2); MSA 17.237(301)(2) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\"> I partially concurred and partially dissented in <em>Goff, supra. </em>While I recognize the majority\u2019s opinion to be controlling law, I am compelled to reaffirm my adherence to the principles, interpretations, and findings set forth in my partial concurrence and dissent in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">I also note that, while I disagreed with the majority in <em>Goff, </em>it at least recognized the commission\u2019s fact-finding authority.
