They entered into a contract<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with defendant Tri County Dairy Equipment for the purchase of a milking machine. Tri County is a dealer for Dec International, a company that manufactures parts for milking systems. The equipment was delivered from defendant DEC to defendant Tri County on July 26 and 28, 1989. Defendants allege that the equipment was then delivered to plaintiffs\u2019 farm on or before July 31, 1989. Plaintiffs dispute this date, but concede that the component parts were delivered more than four years before suit was filed. Tri County, assisted by dec, installed the milking system. Defendants contend, and plaintiffs dispute, that the machinery was installed and operational on September 8, 1989. The Michigan Department of Agriculture tested, approved, and licensed the milking system on September 12, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">On September 10, 1993, plaintiffs filed suit against Tri County and dec, claiming that the milking system was defective and had damaged their dairy operation. Defendants filed a motion for summary disposition for the breach of warranty claims, alleging that the four-year period of limitation<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> had run, and the suit was time barred. The trial court granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded. It held that tender of delivery did not occur until installation of the milking system was complete and that a genuine issue of fact existed regarding when installation was complete. 218 Mich App 248; 553 NW2d 667 (1996) . We granted leave to appeal. 456 Mich 901 (1997) .</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">All parties agree that the warranty provisions of Michigan\u2019s version of the UCC are controlling and that the appropriate statute of limitations is MCL 440.2725; MSA 19.2725.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">Section 2725 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-11\">(1) An action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within 4 years after the cause of action has accrued. By the original agreement the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than 1 year but may not extend it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-12\">(2) A cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party\u2019s lack of knowledge of the breach. A breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-13\">There have been no allegations of a warranty extending to future performance of the goods.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the cause of action accrued at the tender of delivery. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>\u201cTender of delivery\u201d is defined at MCL 440.2503(1); MSA 19.2503(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the buyer\u2019s disposition and give the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Whether a good is a \u201cconforming good\u201d is defined in MCL 440.2106(2); MSA 19.2106(2). The statute describes a good as conforming when it is \u201cin accordance with the obligations under the contract.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A3kb\">The Uniform Commercial Code comment following MCL 440.2503; MSA 19.2503 observes that the term \u201ctender\u201d has two different meanings within the section. The first contemplates an \u201coffer coupled with a present ability to fulfill all the conditions resting on the tendering party and must be followed by actual performance if the other party shows himself ready to proceed.\u201d This is the preferred meaning unless \u201cthe context unmistakably indicates otherwise . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The second meaning refers to an offer of goods \u201cunder a contract as if in fulfillment of its conditions even though there is a defect when measured against the contract obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>We are persuaded that the latter definition of \u201ctender of delivery\u201d is more appropriate under these facts. Under MCL 440.2507; MSA 19.2507, tender of delivery is a condition to both the buyer\u2019s duty to accept the goods and his duty to pay for them. The first definition would be more appropriate where there is nonacceptance of the goods by the buyer. In order for the seller to be entitled to acceptance or payment, the seller must show that he is ready, willing, and able to perform before seeking remedies for breach of contract.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The second definition of tender anticipates a latent defect in the goods, though performance of the contract <em>otherwise appears </em>to be fulfilled. Professor Hawkland, discussing the two definitions of tender, observed that the term tender is occasionally used \u201c \u2018in Article 2 of the UCC as an offer by the seller to deliver what <em>he believes </em>incorrectly to be conforming goods.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Delineating tender of delivery in this manner is consistent with the policy rationale of providing \u201ca finite period in time when the seller knows that he is relieved from liability for a possible breach of contract for sale or breach of warranty,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> since a seller could not plausibly believe that mere physical delivery would constitute fulfillment of the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>where installation is required under the terms of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">There is support for the holding that the second definition is the more appropriate definition to be applied to UCC 2-725(2). In <em>Standard Alliance Industries v Black Clawson Co, </em>587 F2d 813, 819 (CA 6, 1978),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">We think that \u201ctender\u201d as used in UCC \u00a7 2-725(2) is the latter and not the former. A contrary interpretation would extend the statute of limitations indefinitely into the future since a defect at the time of delivery would prevent proper \u201cdue tender\u201d from taking place until it was corrected. Under section 2-725, a cause of action accrues upon initial installation of the product regardless whether it functions properly or not so long as the warranty does not extend to future performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">In applying the second meaning of tender to the facts of this case, tender would not have occurred until the defendant offered conforming goods. The goods would not be conforming, pursuant to MCL 440.2106(2); MSA 19.2106(2), unless the goods were in accordance with the contract obligations. If installation were a term of the contract, then mere physical delivery would not fulfill defendant\u2019s contractual obligation. Only when the component parts were fully installed could the defendant be viewed as tendering goods \u201cas if in\u201d fulfillment of its contractual responsibilities.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>We further hold that \u201ctender of deliveiy\u201d is not contingent upon inspection, testing, or acceptance in the absence of a clear contractual provision to the contrary. Our holding is consistent with many other jurisdictions\u2019 interpretations of the ucc.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In many of these cases, the buyer contends that the presence of a latent defect precludes the tender of delivery of conforming goods.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We agree that this argument must fail, because otherwise the limitation period provided in the statute would never apply until the seller tenders nondefective conforming goods.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This argument would be contrary to the purpose of the statute, which is to provide \u201ca finite period in time when the seller knows that he is relieved from liability for a possible breach of contract for sale or breach of warranty.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>in</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Under the facts of this case, the Court of Appeals erred regarding defendant dec in holding that the statute of limitations began to run after installation. Dec had no contractual obligation to install the milking machine. Dec\u2019s agreement was to sell the machinery to Tri County, who in turn sold the goods to the Bakers.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">As to defendant Tri County, there is no clear indication that installation was a material term of the contract. Whether the contract between the parties embodied installation is a question properly determined by the trier of fact.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Plaintiff contends that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>system was not fully installed until September 12, 1989. Defendant, on the other hand, maintains that the system was demonstrated to the plaintiff (necessarily implying that the system was installed) on September 8, 1989. Because there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding when the milking system was installed, the Court of Appeals was correct in reversing summary disposition in favor of defendant Tri County and remanding the issue to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals with respect to defendant Tri County. We reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order granting summary disposition to defendant dec.</p>\n<judges id=\"b337-7\">Brickley, Cavanagh, and Kelly, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-7\"> MCL 440.2725; MSA 19.2725.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b329-8\"> MCL 440.2503; MSA 19.2503.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b329-9\"> See 3 Foran, Williston on Sales (5th ed), \u00a7 25-55, p 716.

However, neither the official comments to UCC 2-503 nor other case law is discussed in reaching the holding.

I would hold that installation is not a prerequisite to tender of delivery, and that in this case tender of delivery was made when the component parts were delivered to plaintiffs\u2019 farm. Accordingly, as to defendant Tri County, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order granting summary disposition as to both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">I agree with the majority that the cause of action accrued at the time of delivery, and that \u201ctender of delivery\u201d is defined at MCL 440.2503(1); MSA 19.2503(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the buyer\u2019s disposition and give the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The majority states that tender has not occurred until the defendant offers conforming goods under MCL 440.2106(2); MSA 19.2106(2), which would require that the goods be installed. Subsection 2106(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are \u201cconforming\u201d or conform to the contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">The majority contends that \u201c [i]f installation were a term of the contract, then mere physical delivery would not fulfill defendant\u2019s contractual obligation.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">The difficulty with this reasoning is that installation is part of the defendant\u2019s <em>conduct </em>under the contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>not a definition of a characteristic of the goods.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For example, if a contract provided that defendant would install a machine and that defendant would provide a yearly service call on that machine for three years, the majority\u2019s reasoning would lead one to say that the goods were not conforming until they were both installed and serviced for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">I also find the majority\u2019s conclusion to be incorrect in light of the contract between the parties. Even if, as the majority suggests, there were an installation exception to the tender of delivery rule in the UCC, it could only be triggered by a provision in the contract that clearly provides for installation. Review of the appendix shows that there was no such provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Of course, parties to a contract involving the sale of a system requiring installation could avoid \u00a7 2725, e.g., with an express contract provision specifically designating that \u201ctender of delivery\u201d would not be complete until the system was installed, or otherwise explicitly set a different time of accrual to avoid \u00a7 2725\u2019s accrual provisions. But there is no evidence of such a contractual provision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Where a contract requires a seller both to provide goods and to install them, tender of delivery still occurs upon tender of delivery of the component parts under \u00a7 2725. Therefore, I would hold that tender of delivery does not require that the goods be installed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The majority complains that this rule \u201creach[es] \u2018the perverse conclusion that the statute of limitations began to ran <em>before the breach </em>occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 249, n 4 (emphasis added). This is a misstatement. Under the ucc, \u201cA cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party\u2019s lack of knowledge of the breach. A breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made . . . .\u201d MCL 440.2725(2); MSA 19.2725(2). Thus, although plaintiffs may not have discovered the defect at the time the statute of limitations began to ran, the breach has nevertheless occurred, according to the UCC, upon tender of delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Section 2725 specifically provides that the aggrieved party\u2019s lack of knowledge of the breach is irrelevant. The ucc limitation provision at issue, \u00a7 2725, turns on \u201ctender of delivery,\u201d not on inspection or acceptance/rejection. We should interpret \u00a7 2725 to give meaning to this choice. With respect to sales of goods that require installation, there might be merit in a statute of limitation that would not begin to run until installation or licensing of a system, but the language of \u00a7 2725 does not contemplate such a rule. The ucc will cease to be uniform if we depart from its plain language and create a rule that the limitation period does not begin to ran until a system is installed or licensed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">I recognize that there is case law supporting a rale that, with respect to sales of goods requiring installation, \u201ctender of delivery\u201d does not occur until the goods are installed. Williston criticizes one such authority as improperly \u201cmix[ing] into its reasoning the thrust of the discovery rule, stating that only after installation was completed was the buyer in a posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>tion to determine whether or not the equipment was conforming.\u201d 3 Foran, Williston on Sales (5th ed), \u00a7 25-55, p 717. White &amp; Summers state that under \u00a7 2725, \u201cthe clock ticks even though the buyer does not know the goods are defective.\u201d 1 White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (4th ed), \u00a7 11-9, p 607. White &amp; Summers also distinguish \u00a7 2725 from tort statutes of limitation that do not run until the plaintiff discovers or reasonably should have discovered the breach. <em>Id. </em>A rule that, with respect to sales of goods requiring installation, tender of delivery does not occur until goods are installed, appears to rest on the rationale that the buyer cannot inspect or test the goods until they are installed. This rationale is unpersuasive in the context of \u00a7 2725\u2019s provision that a cause of action accrues when the breach occurs (i.e., upon tender of delivery in breach of warranty actions) \u201cregardless of the aggrieved party\u2019s lack of knowledge of the breach.\u201d On this basis, I disagree with the authorities suggesting that tender of delivery does not occur until installation with respect to sales of goods that require installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">This rule is consistent with many other jurisdictions\u2019 interpretations of the ucc.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The lead case dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>cussing installation is <em>Long Island Lighting Co v Transamerica Delaval, Inc, </em>646 F Supp 1442 (SD NY, 1986). There the court held that the tender of delivery was made when the diesel engines were shipped to the buyer, not when they were installed, even though the seller had continuing responsibility for supervising the installation.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Although there is not a unanimity of result among the other courts,* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I would find those cases holding that installation is not a prerequisite to delivery repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>sent the better-reasoned line of cases. The statute of limitations adopted by the ucc is designed to provide a point of finality for businesses, after which they could destroy their business records without the fear of a subsequent breach of warranty action arising from the past. See Hawkland, Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 2-725:02.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The plaintiffs had a remedy against defendants for four years, but failed to use it in a timely manner. Plaintiffs have now asked this Court to change the clear language of the ucc because they filed their suit over a month late. I cannot write to modify the UCC language, despite my sympathy for these plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order granting summary disposition.</p>\n<judges id=\"b343-7\">Mallett, C.J., and Taylor, J., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"AkD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\"> As in <em>Neibarger v Universal Cooperatives, Inc, </em>439 Mich 512; 486 NW2d 612 (1992), the overall thrust of the dealings between the parties reveals that the transaction was a sale of goods, and that the installation and training services were incidental to the contract for the purchase of the milking system.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\"> \u201cTender of delivery\u201d is not contingent upon inspection, testing, or acceptance. <em>Cincinnati, Ohio v Dorr-Oliver, Inc, </em>659 F Supp 259 (D Conn, 1986).
