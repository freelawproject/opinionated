Plaintiffs alleged that the sheriff\u2019s department had obtained ex parte orders from the judge assigned to their respective criminal cases, seizing their bond monies for reimbursement of the expenses of their incarceration in the Macomb County jail. Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint alleged two causes of action: (1) breach of state law under the Prisoner Reimbursement to the County Act (PRCA), MCL 801.81 <em>et seq.) </em>MSA 28.1770(1) <em>et seq., </em>and (2) a violation of 42 USC 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The breach of state law count alleged that defendants had failed to commence a civil action within the prescribed period that would have potentially allowed defendants to obtain a portion of their bond monies under the PRCA. Plaintiffs thus sought return of their bond monies because their money had been converted without statutory authority. Plaintiffs also asserted that the acts and omissions of defendants had violated 42 USC 1983 because they amounted to an unconstitutional deprivation of their property in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Defendants filed a motion for summary disposition asserting several grounds. After the trial court denied the motion, defendants filed a counterclaim asserting, inter alia, a right to recoupment under the PRCA. Plaintiffs then filed a motion seeking summary disposition of defendants\u2019 counterclaim, arguing such a counterclaim was barred given that the limitation period under the prca had expired. Defendants also filed a motion for rehearing or reconsideration regarding the denial of their motion for summary disposition. The trial court subsequently granted reconsideration and entered an order summarily dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint. The trial court never ruled on plaintiffs\u2019 motion to summarily dismiss the counterclaim because the counterclaim became moot upon dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Plaintiffs appealed as of right, and the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for further proceedings. 210 Mich App 436; 534 NW2d 539 (1995). Defendants filed an application for leave to appeal, which this Court initially denied, but ultimately granted in response to defendants\u2019 motion for reconsideration. Our order granting defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal was limited to three questions: (1) whether a violation of the PRCA constituted a federal due process violation, (2) whether an action for damages was barred because the withholding of funds was pursuant to an order issued by the circuit court, and (3) whether defendants\u2019 claim for reimbursement under the PRCA could be raised by counterclaim after the time for bringing an action under the statute had expired. 454 Mich 890 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Plaintiffs were charged with unspecified criminal charges in the Macomb Circuit Court. Brown posted a $10,000 cash bond on May 17, 1988, to secure his release on bail. On October 5, 1988, while the charges were still pending against Brown, the sheriffs department requested, on an ex parte basis,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the judge assigned to Brown\u2019s criminal case, enter an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The prefatory language in the order that the court signed stated that the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit was in possession of a sum of $10,000 and that it appeared that defendant \u201chas/will\u201d have incurred reimbursement charges as a consequence of the criminal case. The introductory language further indicated that the \u201cSheriff\u2019s Reimbursement Program for the County of Macomb\u201d was requesting that the $10,000 be deposited with the department in lieu of payment toward reimbursement fees provided for under the prca. The order entered in Brown\u2019s case concluded as follows: \u201cTherefore it is ordered, that the sum of $10,000 be released forthwith, and made payable to the County of Macomb for payment of reimbursement fee(s) upon conclusion of said matter(s), or until further order of the Court.\u201d Brown was eventually sentenced to six months in jail on June 22, 1989. Defendants\u2019 counterclaim indicates that Brown received a financial history form from the sheriff on or about June 27, 1989. Thus, the ex parte order seizing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>Brown\u2019s money was apparently entered before he was convicted<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and more than eight months before he was requested to provide financial information.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The sheriff\u2019s department apparently never served a copy of the ex parte order on Brown or the attorney representing him in his criminal case. It also appears that Brown first learned that his bond monies had been subject to the October 5, 1988, ex parte order after he was sentenced and he sought return of his bond money.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>A somewhat similar scenario occurred with reference to Mudge. A cash bond of $1,100 was posted by Mudge on December 20, 1988. Apparently soon after being sentenced to four months in jail, the sheriff\u2019s department requested the judge assigned to preside over Mudge\u2019s criminal charges to enter an order on an ex parte basis. The prefatory language and the actual language in the order that was entered was identical to the order entered with reference to Brown, except that the order recited that $1,000 was in the Court\u2019s possession and that it was to be released and \u201cmade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>payable to the County of Macomb for payment of reimbursement fee(s) upon conclusion of said matter(s), or until further order of the Court.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Mudge\u2019s bond money appears to have been seized two months before she received defendants\u2019 financial status form. As with Brown, the ex parte order apparently was not served on Mudge or the attorney who was representing her in her criminal case. Mudge was released from jail on November 17, 1989. On March 21, 1990, Mudge was sent a form demand letter from the \u201cCounty of Macomb Reimbursement Department.\u201d This letter indicated that Mudge had a current balance due of $1,140 and that payment of $125 was due. The letter further stated that the account would be turned over to a collection agency unless a payment was received within ten days.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The Court of Appeals held that defendants had acted ultra vires of the PRCA when they obtained ex parte orders from the circuit court. <em>Id. </em>at 440-441. It also vacated the ex parte orders, ordered that the bond monies be returned,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and found that defendants\u2019 recoupment counterclaim was barred. The Court of Appeals went on to hold that a municipality could be sued under 42 USC 1983 for unconstitutional or \u201cillegal policies or customs\u201d and that liability could be imposed for deliberate indifference to a person\u2019s constitutional or \u201cstatutory rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 445.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Defendants assert that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that a violation of the PRCA is actionable under \u00a7 1983, because violations of state statutes are not actionable under \u00a7 1983. Defendants are correct that actions violating a state statute, that do not also violate the federal constitution or a federal statute, are not actionable under 42 USC 1983. See, e. g., <em>Huron Valley Hosp v City of Pontiac, </em>887 F2d 710, 714 (CA 6, 1989) (42 USC 1983 is limited to deprivations of federal statutory and constitutional rights; it does not cover official conduct that allegedly violates state law). Accord <em>Crawford-El v Britton, </em>523 US 574; 118 S Ct 1584; 140 L Ed 2d 759 (1998) (the very purpose of \u00a7 1983 is to provide a remedy for the violation of federal rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint alleged that defendants\u2019 conduct violated the prca. However, plaintiffs also pleaded 42 USC 1983 as a separate count, alleging defendants\u2019 actions violated their rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the federal constitution. If defendants\u2019 conduct violated the federal constitution, the fact that the conduct also violated the prca is of no moment and is not a ground allowing a court to find that plaintiffs have not alleged a cause of action under 42 USC 1983.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Zinermon v Burch, </em>494 US 113, 124-125; 110 S Ct 975; 108 L Ed 2d 100 (1990) (a plaintiff may bring a \u00a7 1983 action for an unlawful search and seizure [in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the constitution] despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the fact that the search and seizure also violated the state\u2019s constitution or statutes).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Defendants argue that plaintiffs may not assert a \u00a7 1983 claim because of the existence of postdeprivation state remedies. To determine whether this argument is correct, we turn to <em>Zinermon. </em>In Zinermon, the Court explained that there are three kinds of claims that may be brought against a state under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 125. The Court said that the first is a claim against a state for a violation of many of the rights under the Bill of Rights. The Court said that the second \u00a7 1983 claim is a bar against certain arbitrary, wrongful government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them. With regard to these two types of claims, the <em>Zinermon </em>Court stated: \u201cthe constitutional violation actionable under \u00a7 1983 is complete when the wrongful action is taken.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The Court further explained that the Due Process Clause also encompasses a third type of protection, a guarantee of fair procedure. <em>Id. </em>at 125. The Court said that the existence of state remedies is sometimes relevant to this third type of \u00a7 1983 claim. Unlike the first two types of claims, the constitutional violation under this third type is not complete when the deprivation occurs: it is not complete unless and until the state fails to provide due process. Under the third type, a statutory provision for a postdeprivation hearing, or a common-law tort remedy for erroneous deprivation, may satisfy due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">The <em>Zinermon </em>Court then clarified that the existence of a postdeprivation remedy is only relevant when the state is unable to provide predeprivation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>process because of the random and unpredictable nature of the deprivation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">In situations where the State feasiblely can provide a predeprivation hearing before taking property, it generally must do so regardless of the adequacy of a postdeprivation tort remedy to compensate for the taking. <em>[Id. </em>at 132.][<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint specifically asserted that defendants\u2019 acts and omissions had deprived them of procedural due process. Thus, we analyze plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the third type of claim that may be asserted under 42 USC 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Pursuant to <em>Zinermon, </em>plaintiffs have alleged a \u00a7 1983 claim that is not automatically barred because of the existence of postdeprivation remedies. This is because: (1) the seizing of plaintiffs\u2019 bond monies was not necessarily random or unpredictable (the fact that the ex parte orders were on preprinted forms and stated that \u201cthe Sheriff\u2019s Reimbursement Program to the County\u201d was requesting the money contradicts any argument that defendants\u2019 actions were random <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>and unpredictable),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and (2) a predeprivation hearing could have been provided. Accord <em>Hudson v Palmer, </em>468 US 517, 532-533; 104 S Ct 3194; 82 L Ed 2d 393 (1984) (postdeprivation remedies do not satisfy due process where a deprivation of property is caused by conduct pursuant to established state [here municipal] procedure, rather than random and unauthorized action), <em>Augustine v Doe, </em>740 F2d 322, 329 (CA 5, 1984) <em>(Parratt v Taylor, </em>451 US 527; 101 S Ct 1908; 68 L Ed 2d 420 [1981], applies only when the nature of. the challenged conduct would render provision of predeprivation procedural safeguards impracticable or infeasible), and <em>Alexander v Ieyoub, </em>62 F2d 709 (CA 5, 1995) (the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine did not foreclose a \u00a7 1983 claim because the \u201crandom and unauthorized\u201d element necessary for its application was absent where the challenged actions were in accordance with customary procedures).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Plaintiffs have properly alleged that they could have been provided, and therefore should have been provided, with notice and an opportunity to be heard before their bond monies were seized, or at least been provided with an opportunity to contest the matter at a show cause hearing. As the Sixth Circuit has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\">The touchstone of procedural due process is the fundamental requirement that an individual be given the opportunity to be heard \u201cin a meaningful manner.\u201d [Citations omitted.] Many procedural due process claims are grounded on violations of state-created rights, as is the case here; rights that do not enjoy constitutional standing. However, the right to a hearing prior to the deprivation is of constitutional stature and does not depend upon the nature of the right violated. <em>[Howard v Grinage, </em>82 F3d 1343, 1349 (CA 6, 1996).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Similarly, the United States Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">Although \u201c[m]any controversies have raged about the cryptic and abstract words of the Due Process Clause,\u201d as Mr. Justice Jackson wrote for the Court in <em>Mullane v Central Hanover Tr Co, </em>339 US 306 [70 S Ct 652; 94 L Ed 865] (1950), \u201cthere can be no doubt that at a minimum they require that deprivation of life, liberty or property by adjudication be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 313. ... In short, \u201cwithin the limits of practicability,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 318, a State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>must afford to all individuals a meaningful opportunity to be heard if it is to fulfill the promise of the Due Process Clause. <em>[Boddie v Connecticut, </em>401 US 371, 377-379; 91 S Ct 780; 28 L Ed 2d 113 (1971).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are sufficient to state a cause of action for violation of their due process rights, under <em>Zinermon, </em>irrespective of the prca, because they have alleged that the county, or its agents, acting within the confines of the county\u2019s prisoner reimbursement policy, seized plaintiffs\u2019 bond monies without providing for a hearing of any kind. If plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are true, defendants treated the bond monies as if they had been forfeited to the county and as if already reduced to a judgment, without affording plaintiffs procedural due process through notice and a hearing and \u201ctook\u201d any defenses<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> plaintiffs may have had to a claim for reimbursement without a hearing, show cause or otherwise.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Plaintiffs were entitled to a hearing where a court could consider their support obligations, if any. Thus, we reject defendants\u2019 claim that plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 action is barred by plaintiffs\u2019 failure to exhaust postdeprivation state remedies.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>n</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Having determined that the existence of post-deprivation remedies does not bar plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claim, we turn to the question whether the claim is barred because the withholding of funds occurred pursuant to orders issued by the circuit court. Defendants\u2019 argument regarding this issue is that plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claim should be barred because plaintiffs never asked the judge who entered the ex parte orders or the Court of Appeals to vacate or overturn the orders. Thus, defendants contend that plaintiffs were not free to file an independent \u00a7 1983 lawsuit in order to effectuate return of their bond monies, i.e., to collaterally attack the orders. Defendants assert that \u00a7 1983 should never be used as a state tort law, postjudgment, or appellate substitute. We reject defendants\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"><em>Zinermon, supra </em>at 124, quoted with approval the following language from <em>Monroe v Pape, </em>365 US 167, 183; 81 S Ct 473; 5 L Ed 2d 492 (1961):<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">It is no answer that the State has a law which if enforced would give relief. The federal remedy is supplementary to the state remedy, and the latter need not be first sought and refused before the federal one is invoked.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Given the fact that plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claim is not necessarily barred by the existence of postdeprivation remedies, the fact that plaintiffs could have asked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>circuit judge or the Court of Appeals to vacate or overturn the ex parte orders when they finally learned of them is no bar to plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 action.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In granting leave to appeal regarding this particular issue, we anticipated that defendants might argue that they cannot be held responsible for any constitutional violation that may have occurred because the direct \u201ccause\u201d of any constitutional violation was the trial court\u2019s issuance of the ex parte orders and not the sheriff\u2019s department\u2019s request that the orders be entered. See, e.g., the discussion and cases cited in <em>Mayor of the City of Lansing v Ku KLux Klan (After Remand), </em>222 Mich App 637, 643 ff; 564 NW2d 177 (1997).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We deem the issue of causation inadequately briefed and do not reach it.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As we explained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>Mitcham v Detroit, </em>355 Mich 182, 203; 94 NW2d 388 (1959):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">It is not enough for an appellant in his brief simply to announce a position or assert an error and then leave it up to this Court to discover and rationalize the basis for his claims, or unravel and elaborate for him his arguments, and then search for authority either to sustain or reject his position. The appellant himself must first adequately prime the pump; only then does the appellate well begin to flow.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Having determined that plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claim is not necessarily barred by the existence of post-deprivation remedies and that the causation issue is inadequately briefed, we turn to the question whether defendants\u2019 claim for the seldom invoked defense of recoupment under the prca may be raised by counterclaim after the time for bringing an action under the statute has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Count VI of defendants\u2019 counterclaim alleged that Mudge and Brown had incurred debts of $1,100 and $3,765 respectively under the prca and that all or a portion of plaintiffs\u2019 damages, interest, attorney fees, and claims were negated, forfeited, reduced, diminished, mitigated, and legally voided on account of plaintiffs\u2019 liabilities under the PRCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary disposition, arguing that the counterclaim should be dismissed because defendants had not filed the counterclaim within the then-applicable six-month limitation period. As previously indicated, the trial court never ruled on plaintiffs\u2019 motion because the counterclaim became moot when the court granted reconsideration and granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>tion of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s summary dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, holding that defendants\u2019 actions were in violation of the PRCA. The ex parte orders were vacated and the bond monies ordered returned. The Court of Appeals said that defendants\u2019 opportunity to seek reimbursement under the prca was lost because it had vacated the ex parte orders and because the limitation period of the PRCA had lapsed. <em>Id. </em>at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Defendants assert that the Court of Appeals erred arguing: \u201c[Virtually any otherwise valid, but time-barred, action, can always be resurrected, defensively speaking, by a counterclaim, if the legal effect of that counterclaim is to negate or to reduce the principal claim, as long as the defensive countercomplaint does not seek any more than the damages which are claimed by the plaintiff.\u201d We agree that the Court of Appeals erred in simply stating that defendants could not seek recoupment by a counterclaim under the prca merely because the then-existing six-month limitation period had expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The defense of recoupment refers to a defendant\u2019s right, in the same action, \u201cto cut down the plaintiff\u2019s demand, either because the plaintiff has not complied with some cross obligation of the contract on which he or she sues or because the plaintiff has violated some legal duty in the making or performance of that contract.\u201d 20 Am Jur 2d, Counterclaim, Recoupment, etc., \u00a7 5, p 231. Recoupment is \u201ca doctrine of an intrinsically defensive nature founded upon an equitable reason, inhering in the same transaction, why the plaintiff\u2019s claim in equity and good conscience should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>be reduced.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania R Co v Miller, </em>124 F2d 160, 162 (CA 5, 1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">As explained in <em>Warner v Sullivan, </em>249 Mich 469, 471; 229 NW 484 (1930):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">Recoupment is a creature of the common law. It presents to the court an equitable reason why the amount payable to the plaintiff should be reduced, and <em>the plaintiff will not be permitted to insist upon the statute of limitations as a bar to such a defense </em>when he is seeking to enforce payment of that which is due him under the contract out of which the defendant\u2019s claim for recoupment arises. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Accord <em>Bull v United States, </em>295 US 247, 261-262; 55 S Ct 695; 79 L Ed 1421 (1935) (the defense of recoupment is never barred by the statute of limitations as long as the main action itself is timely). See also anno: <em>Claim barred by limitation as subject of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, cross bill, or cross actions, </em>1 ALR2d 630, \u00a7 14, pp 666-667 (\u201cAlmost without exception the cases which deal with recoupments . . . ran to the effect that if a defendant\u2019s claim is in fact a recoupment the general statutes of limitation do not defeat it; on the contrary it may be availed of defensively so long as plaintiff\u2019s cause of action exists\u201d). Thus, the expiration of a limitation period does not foreclose a recoupment defense as long as the plaintiff\u2019s action is timely.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Given that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 1983 complaint was timely filed, the expiration of the limitation period for a county to bring a prca action, in and of itself, was not a bar to defendants seeking recoupment under the prca. However, as previously indicated, defendants still have to show that plaintiffs did not comply with some cross obligation or legal duty under the PRCA in order to seek recoupment.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">As an alternative basis for upholding the Court of Appeals, plaintiffs argue that defendants\u2019 recoupment counterclaim should be barred because defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>have unclean hands.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We first note that this argument was not made to the trial court. Because of this, neither plaintiffs nor defendants submitted affidavits or other documentary evidence bearing upon this question. Further, this issue was not reached by the Court of Appeals.

MCL 801.88; MSA 28.1770(8). However, the ex parte orders issued against Mudge and Brown\u2019s bond monies were not issued pending a show cause hearing, and there was no attempt to demonstrate that ex parte orders were necessary to protect the county\u2019s right to reimbursement under the act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\"> The prca only authorizes seeking reimbursement from inmates who have been convicted of a felony. MCL 801.83; MSA 28.1770(3). We disagree with the concurrence\u2019s statement, <em>post, </em>p 112, n 3, that the prca is not an exclusive remedy provision. The statutory language says the county <em>may </em>file an action if it wishes to obtain a judgment against an inmate that has been convicted of a felony. Use of the word \u201cmay\u201d merely suggests that counties are not required to pursue costs of incarceration from inmates that are convicted of felonies. We further reject the concurrence\u2019s suggestion, <em>id,., </em>p 110, n 1, that a county need not postpone seeking an ex parte order until after conviction. MCL 801.88(2); MSA 28.1770(8)(2) does not allow a county to obtain an ex parte order in the hope that an incarcerated individual will eventually be convicted of a felony rather than, e.g., being acquitted or convicted of a misdemeanor or having the charges dismissed. There is no basis for concluding that the statute allows for the issuance of ex parte orders if necessary to protect the county\u2019s <em>potential </em>rather than actual right to reimbursement. The concurrence suggests that any \u201cwell-counseled potential obligor would dispose of any assets\u201d that otherwise might be available to satisfy a judgment and suggests that any counsel that did not advise his client to dispose of assets would be incompetent. <em>Post, </em>p 111, n 1.

The order, as initially drafted, provided that $6,000 was to go to Brown and $4,000 was to go to the attorney who had represented him in the criminal case. However, the actual order entered had handwriting on it stating that the money was to be returned \u201cafter payment to Macomb County Sheriff of $3,765.\u201d Defendants argue that Brown\u2019s consent to the order returning his bond is a bar to his cause of action. The trial court rejected the argument that Brown\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>signing of the order barred his claim because Brown contested the voluntariness of his signature and the record showed different copies of the same order with significantly different information handwritten thereon. The Court of Appeals did not address this argument of the defendants. We decline to find that Brown\u2019s claim is barred by the order returning his bond money, given that the Court of Appeals did not address the issue and the fact that our order granting leave to appeal was limited to three issues and the significance of the order returning Brown\u2019s bond money was not one of them. Indeed, defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal sought to raise four issues and the fourth issue was the significance of the order Brown signed. This Court, however, only granted leave to appeal regarding the first three issues defendants raised in their application. Because it is possible that the trial court may, after further development of the record, determine that the order returning bond monies is tantamount to a consent judgment, we find that the Court of Appeals erred in ordering defendants to return Mr. Brown\u2019s bond monies.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">As for plaintiff Mudge, we find no error in the Court of Appeals ordering the return of her bond monies, given that her monies, were not taken in compliance with the prca. Contrary to the assertion of the concurrence, <em>post, </em>p 111, n 2, we have not determined that the validity of the \u201corders\u201d was inadequately briefed. Rather, we have only declined to determine the significance of the order returning bond monies that Brown signed because the Court of Appeals did not reach the question and because we did not grant leave regarding the question. Further, Mudge, unlike Brown, did not sign any order returning her bond money. The concurrence also states that the ex parte order relating to Mudge was valid unless reversed on direct appeal, <em>id., </em>but ignores the fact that the Court of Appeals did vacate the order. The concurrence is also in error when it states, <em>id., </em>that Mudge never sought to have the ex parte order reversed. Count i of Mudge\u2019s complaint sought this exact relief. We find the Court of Appeals invocation of MCR 7.216(A)(7) to vacate the circuit court\u2019s ex parte order confiscating Mudge\u2019s bond monies was proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b176-6\"> The lower court record contains two July 17, 1989, orders that referred to Mudge.

The Court of Appeals peremptorily reversed the injunction.

The majority quotes 20 Am Jur 2d, Counterclaim, Recoupment, etc., \u00a7 5, p 231, for the proposition that \u201crecoupment refers to a defendant\u2019s right, in the same action, \u2018to cut down the plaintiff\u2019s demand, either because the plaintiff has not complied with some cross obligation of the contract on which he or she sues or because the plaintiff has violated some legal duty in the making or performance of that contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 106. While such analysis would correctly apply to a cause of action asserted on a contract in which the defendant raised recoupment as a defense, this is not a cause of action in which recoupment is being asserted on the basis of a contract. However, the majority states, \u201c[Defendants still have to show that plaintiffs did not comply with some cross obligation or legal duty under the PRCA in order to seek recoupment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 108, thus substituting \u201cthe prca\u201d for the \u201ccontract\u201d in the case-law review in Am Jur.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>To avoid confusion over assertion of recoupment in the contract setting as opposed to other contexts,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the trial court ought to analyze the defendant\u2019s right to assert the defense in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of recoupment in <em>Bull v United States, </em>295 US 247, 262; 55 S Ct 695; 79 L Ed 1421 (1935):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">[RJecoupment is in the nature of <em>a defense arising out of some feature of the transaction upon which the plaintiff\u2019s action is grounded. </em>Such a defense is never barred by the statute of limitations so long as the main action itself is timely.

Recoupment beyond the statute of limitations will serve only to diminish or negate the defendant\u2019s liability in damages to the plaintiff. Because this case is not one in which the defendant asserts recoupment on a contract, the majority\u2019s reference to the rule regarding a legal duty or cross obligation under a contract is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Should the trial court resolve the issue with respect to the county\u2019s conduct in such a way as to conclude that the \u00a7 1983 claim exists wholly outside the <em>Zinermon </em>dispute because the county sanctioned the alleged due process rationale by official act or cus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>tom, the conclusion that the county\u2019s hands are unclean might be appropriate. <em>Zinermon v Burch, </em>494 US 113; 110 S Ct 975; 108 L Ed 2d 100 (1990). However, if the county merely hired an individual to implement the PRCA and that individual and the sheriff acted without the county\u2019s sanction, the county should not be found to have unclean hands where it attempted in good faith to comply with the PRCA. As noted above, if the county did not officially sanction the ex parte bond-retention procedure, under <em>Monell, </em>the county is likely not even the proper defendant. <em>Monell v New York City Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>436 US 658; 98 S Ct 2018; 56 L Ed 2d 611 (1978). Resolution of the issue now would amount to the Court\u2019s resolving that the county\u2019s official sanction was present, a conclusion not supported by this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">As the record now stands, the county hired an individual to implement a prison reimbursement program in May of 1985 on the recommendation of the sheriff and the county \u201cPrisoner Reimbursement Subcommittee.\u201d However, nothing in the record indicates that the county board of commissioners endorsed any specific policy regarding how implementation of the PRCA was to occur officially or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Instead, the record appears to indicate that the county attempted, through the sheriff\u2019s department and the individual hired to implement a reimbursement program, to utilize a procedure that would impose the legal obligations of the act, while providing inmates an opportunity to avoid the time-consuming and costly burdens of civil litigation. In its answers to interrogatories, dated April 3, 1991, the county supplied a document entitled \u201cMacomb County Jail Reimbursement Program Update Sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>mary Report \u2014 08/19/85.\u201d The document appears to be the result of the efforts of the individual hired to implement the PRCA. It notes that the procedures described therein are \u201cintended to give a general overview of typical implementation of the program.\u201d The document generally describes implementation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-5\">Under this Act, an inmate who willfully refuses to cooperate in the counties [sic] attempts to seek reimbursement may be denied a <em>lk </em>reduction of his or her sentence (under [MCL 801.257; MSA 28.1747(7)]). Inmates [sic] cooperation in this matter is highly stressed, and is enforced by the Sheriff\u2019s discretion in revoking \u201cgood time\u201d for refusal to cooperate. Refusing to make payments on the other hand, may result in civil action filed against him or her for up to six months after the sentence was served. The county could also seek a restraining order preventing the inmate from disposing [of] property pending a hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">As I read the procedures outlined in the report, the county employee, under the PRCA, designed a program whereby the county: (1) informed the prisoners of their obligation to pay reimbursement and that the county would bill the prisoners accordingly pursuant to subsection 3(1) (\u201cThe county may seek reimbursement for any expenses incurred by the county . . . [including $30] per day for the expenses of maintaining that prisoner or the actual per diem cost . . . whichever is less . . . , [the cost to] investigate the financial status of the person[, and] [a]ny other expenses incurred by the county in order to collect payments under this act\u201d); (2) developed a financial history form (subsection 3 [2], by which it sought to determine the prisoners\u2019 ability to pay); (3) informed the prisoners of their duty to cooperate in the collection process (subsection 5[1]) or be subject to penal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>ties under the act (subsection 5 [2] \u2014 denial of good time credit); \u00a7 7 \u2014 civil action seeking reimbursement expenses; and (4) referred cases to the county\u2019s corporation counsel where inmates refused or made no attempt to pay. Nowhere in the document does a procedure for attaching bond monies appear; however, the document\u2019s reference to the temporary restraining order references such orders as \u201cpending a hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The summary update reflects the county\u2019s apparent good-faith attempt to comply with the PRCA by instituting a collection process enforced by denial of good time and the civil action as set out in the act. However, the record does not reflect how the retention of bond monies by ex parte order without a mechanism for a hearing became part of the process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">That the bond monies were retained \u201cin lieu of\u201d a statutory debt does not conclusively establish that the county intentionally sought to deny the prisoners their rights under the constitution or the prca, or otherwise committed inequitable conduct sufficient to invoke the doctrine of unclean hands. It is equally likely that the order was occasioned by a misinterpretation of the requirements of the act, or that the orders were inartfolly drafted without expressly providing for a hearing. This does not change the fact that the plaintiffs here have sufficiently alleged a denial of due process. However, regardless of whether this failure was attributable to the county\u2019s evil intent, or whether the plaintiffs\u2019 delay in seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the return of bond was timed to foreclose assertion of the debt, the record is wholly inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Should the trial court determine that the clean hands defense is available with respect to the counterclaim, common sense dictates that the trial court should also consider the nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 conduct. The plaintiffs knew they had posted bond, but there is no indication that plaintiff Mudge ever sought return of her bond money by an appropriate motion. Nor is there any indication why she did not. Likewise, there is no explanation of how she discovered the bond would not be returned. Plaintiff Mudge did not move for return of bond, or seek to set aside the order in the district court, or seek an appeal when she became aware of the order. Instead, as the record now stands, it is equally possible that, with knowledge of the order, plaintiff Mudge waited until the six-month period had passed before filing a \u00a7 1983 claim. Plaintiff Brown signed an order that appears to have settled his case. Plaintiff Mudge apparently sat on her rights, and there is no indication in the record that she ever cooperated in the county\u2019s reimbursement collection process. Thus, the trial court might appropriately determine that the equities are in balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">As noted by Judge Easterbrook, the confusion created by <em>Zinermon v Burch, supra, </em>and its relationship to <em>Parratt v Taylor, </em>451 US 527; 101 S Ct 1908; 68 L Ed 2d 420 (1981), and <em>Hudson v Palmer, </em>468 US 517; 104 S Ct 3194; 82 L Ed 2d 393 (1984), has resulted in \u201ca line of precedent . . . resembling the path of a drunken sailor . . . .\u201d <em>Easter House v Felder, </em>910 F2d 1387, 1409 (CA 7, 1990) (second reh en <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>banc) (Easterbrook, J., concurring) <em>(Easter House III).</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> Easter House III </em>was the second en banc opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit discussing this difficult issue, and it is a leading case in identifying the dispute over <em>Zinermon </em>in the federal circuit courts.

Thus, the due process violation alleged arises not from the use of an ex parte procedure, but from its misuse in contravention of the statutory procedures to effectuate a property deprivation without a hearing.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The difficulty confronting the courts in cases involving these types of claims is determining whether a given claim should be evaluated under the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine, which teaches that where a government official engages in random and unauthorized activity that results in a deprivation of life, liberty, or property, due process is satisfied by adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>postdeprivation process. <em>Zinermon </em>appears to require predeprivation process in virtually all circumstances, see <em>id. </em>at 127-128 (the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine applies only in rare cases), but courts have struggled to apply its analysis consistently.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">The issue turns on Zinermon's reference to the third prong of its apparent test that in order to trigger <em>Parratt/Hudson, </em>the defendants\u2019 conduct must be \u201c \u2018unauthorized\u2019 in the sense the term is used in <em>Parrott </em>and <em>Hudson.'' Zinermon </em>at 138. The courts\u2019 difficulty lies in determining when the conduct of the official actor is sufficiently authorized that the plaintiff may avoid the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">If <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>is interpreted narrowly, a plaintiff may successfully state a \u00a7 1983 cause of action where an official actor\u2019s allegedly unconstitutional conduct is wholly outside the discretion delegated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the actor in the context of applicable procedural safeguards, i.e., where the alleged deprivation was in direct procedural contravention of the state statute authorizing the very deprivation that occurred. Alternatively, if <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>is interpreted broadly, and postdeprivation process is available, the plaintiff may not maintain the \u00a7 1983 cause of action where the official actor\u2019s allegedly unconstitutional conduct was not authorized by the delegation of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">If a court selects the narrow interpretation of <em>Parrott </em>under <em>Zinermon, </em>a far greater number of plaintiffs will succeed in alleging a \u00a7 1983 cause of action than under the broad interpretation. The latter view would leave plaintiffs alleging a procedural deprivation in contravention of state laws designed, at least in part, to protect against the same to state-law remedies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Not having received briefing from the parties and amici curiae in addressing <em>Zinermon, </em>the majority opts for the narrow view with surprisingly little analysis.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The several opinions issued by the Seventh Circuit in <em>Easter House </em>provide the parameters of the running dispute over the meaning of <em>Zinermon.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>majority in <em>Easter House III </em>concluded that the state action in question was the kind of random and unauthorized action that fails to state a claim where the state provides an adequate postdeprivation remedy pursuant to <em>Parratt/Hudson. </em>The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants conspired to deprive the plaintiff of its adoption agency license. In concluding that the deprivation fell within the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine, the court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">Section 1983 must be preserved to remedy only those deprivations which actually occur without adequate due process of law, such as those which result from a state\u2019s conscious decision to ignore the protections guaranteed by the Constitution. It should not be employed to remedy deprivations which occur at the hands of a state employee who is acting in direct contravention of the state\u2019s established policies and procedures which have been designed to guarantee the very protections which the employee now has chosen to ignore. Such a limitation upon \u00a7 1983 maintains the delicate balance between the state and federal judicial systems, leaving the former to remedy individual torts and the latter to address property deprivations which occur without adequate due process protection. <em>[Easter House III </em>at 1404-1405.][<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Significantly, the majority held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Where adequate postdeprivation remedies exist in a state to redress a property deprivation which has resulted from an employee\u2019s random and unauthorized deviation from established state policy and procedure, a party cannot maintain a \u00a7 1983 action because he has received all of the process which was due. <em>[Id. </em>at 1408.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">It is the phrase \u201crandom and unauthorized deviation from established state policy and procedure\u201d that makes the Seventh Circuit\u2019s holding significant. <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson </em>did not involve procedural deviations. The acts alleged were negligent and intentional conduct by state officials that resulted in due process deprivations. In <em>Zinermon, </em>unlike <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson, </em>the challenged conduct involved either a deviation from procedural safeguards or an unconstitutionally broad delegation of authority. <em>Zinermon </em>at 135-136. Thus, Judge Cudahy, writing for the dissenters in <em>Easter House III </em>concluded that the majority missed the point of <em>Zinermon. Id. </em>at 1410.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Judge Cudahy observed that, under <em>Logan v Zimmerman Brush Co, </em>455 US 422; 102 S Ct 1148; 71 L Ed 2d 265 (1982), <em>\u201cParratt </em>does not extend to cases in which an \u2018established state procedure\u2019 destroys someone\u2019s property right without according that person proper predeprivation process.\u201d <em>Easter House III </em>at 1410 (Cudahy, J., dissenting). In other words, with regard to established state procedures, <em>Logan </em>appeared to take the narrow view of the scope of the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine. Judge Cudahy further noted that the Supreme Court \u201cgranted certiorari in <em>Zinermon </em>precisely in order to resolve the circuit conflict <em>over Parratt\u2019s </em>proper scope,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1411, that is, what constitutes \u201can established state procedure.\u201d Our decision today is consistent with Judge Cudahy\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>dissenting interpretation of <em>Zinermon </em>\u201cthat predeprivation process is the rule, not the exception,\u201d <em>Easter House III </em>at 1411, to the extent the analysis applies to established procedures and to the extent there were such established procedures in this case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Judge Cudahy\u2019s first dissent in <em>Easter House II </em>aptly explained the position we adopt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">Stripped of their analytical intricacies, <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson </em>teach a fairly straightforward lesson (or so I had thought before today\u2019s decision): while the procedural aspect of the due process clause generally requires that the state provide a hearing before it takes away someone\u2019s property, it is physically impossible to grant a predeprivation hearing where the taking is a \u201cfluke,\u201d unplanned and uncontrollable. Such an accident occurs, for example, where a state employee who has no business meddling with anyone\u2019s property rights nevertheless deprives someone of property. (Note that in both <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson </em>the employee who took the plaintiffs property was acting completely beyond the pale of his or her assigned responsibilities \u2014 in <em>Parratt, </em>by signing for (and thereby taking custody of) the plaintiffs package, in direct violation of prison rules; in <em>Hudson, </em>by destroying innocuous items of personal property during a search for contraband.) In these unpredictable and unpreventable situations (and in emergencies, where a predeprivation hearing is unwise) all that a state can realistically offer is a post-deprivation remedy; all that a federal court presented with a due process claim can do is assure itself that the state remedy is \u201cplain, speedy and efficient.\u201d <em>[Id. </em>at 1481-1482.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>As in <em>Zinermon, </em>the case before us does not appear to involve an unplanned, uncontrollable deviation from the authorized state procedure resulting in deprivation of a constitutionally protected interest by \u201cfluke.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Our position is, therefore, consistent with Judge Cudahy\u2019s conclusion that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">for purposes of determining whether the \u201cstate\u201d has violated an individual\u2019s constitutional right to due process, the \u201cstate\u201d generally includes any person to whom is delegated the responsibility of giving predeprivation process. . . .

The alleged abuse of the ex parte mechanism in the PRCA amounts to an alleged failure to abide by the statutory safeguards or otherwise provide notice and a predeprivation hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>ing, see, e.g., MCR 3.310, thus stating a claim under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The Fifth Circuit\u2019s panel decision in <em>Caine v Hardy, </em>905 F2d 858 (CA 5, 1990) <em>(Caine </em>I),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> is also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>instructive with regard to the debate over the limits of the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine. The Fifth Circuit panel, having interpreted <em>Parratt </em>narrowly, acknowledged that <em>Zinermon </em>effectuated a change in the \u201ccontrolling constitutional authority . . . [and] requirefd] reconsideration of [the] Court\u2019s <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Caine I </em>at 861. Judge Williams, characterized the <em>Zinermon </em>decision as being based on three considerations: (1) the deprivation occurred at a predictable time, (2) predeprivation process was not impossible, and (3) the conduct in question was not \u201c \u2018unauthorized\u2019 as that term was used in <em>Parratt </em>and Hudson.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 861. The officials in <em>Zinermon </em>were delegated by the state the authority to effectuate \u201cthe very deprivation complained of,\u201d <em>Caine I </em>at 861, quoting <em>Zinermon </em>at 138, and proceeded to ignore the procedural safeguards designed to ensure constitutionality. The officials in <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson </em>never had any such authority.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Judge Williams explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">The lesson of <em>Zinermon </em>is that the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine is restricted to cases where it truly is impossible for the state to provide predeprivation procedural due process before a person unpredictably is deprived of his liberty or property through the unauthorized conduct of a state actor. In <em>Zinermon, </em>however, the deprivation was not unpredictable. It was not impossible, therefore, for the state to provide predeprivation procedural due process. Since the state actor who caused the deprivation was authorized to take the action that caused the deprivation, the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine did not apply. It follows that when the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine does not apply, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff can state a claim for the state\u2019s failure to provide predeprivation procedural due process. <em>[Caine I </em>at 862.][<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>It is worth noting, despite the conclusion that <em>Caine I, Easter House I, </em>and <em>Fields </em>present the correct understanding of <em>Zinermon, </em>that Judge Jones dissented in <em>Caine I </em>with intensity rivaling that of Judge Cudahy in the <em>Easter House </em>cases, and that Judge Jones\u2019 approach ultimately won over the Fifth Circuit en banc in <em>Caine v Hardy, </em>943 F2d 1406 (CA 5, 1991) <em>(Caine II). </em>Judge Jones\u2019 ultimately prevailing view was succinctly described in <em>Caine I:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\"><em>Zinermon </em>analyzed the state officials\u2019 conduct in admitting Burch to the mental hospital and concluded that <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>did not vindicate the adequacy of a post-deprivation remedy because the voluntary commitment procedure presented both a high risk of erroneous deprivation of a mentally ill person\u2019s liberty, and the substantial likelihood that minimal further procedural safeguards could readily have avoided the deprivation. <em>Zinermon </em>requires a hard look at a <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>claim to determine whether the state official\u2019s conduct, under all the circumstances of the deprivation, could have been adequately foreseen and addressed by procedural safeguards. If it could, then the case requires classic <em>Matthews [v Eldridge, </em>424 US 319; 96 S Ct 893; 47 L Ed 2d 18 (1976)] balancing and has stated a claim for relief. <em>Zinermon </em>did not, however, explicitly or implicitly disavow the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine, nor did it portend that any alleged violation of procedural due process undertaken within the scope of an established and articulated state regulatory framework automatically falls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>outside the purview of <em>Parratt/Hudson. Zinermon </em>employs and hence requires case-by-case analysis of the deprivation at issue. See <em>Zinermon, </em>O\u2019Connor, dissenting [494 US 139], <em>[Caine I </em>at 865 (Jones, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">However, Judge Jones also acknowledged agreement with the majority that <em>\u201cZinermon . . </em>. restricted <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>to cases in which \u2018it truly is impossible to provide pre-deprivation safeguards.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 865-866. Her disagreement, like the disagreement in the Seventh Circuit, lies chiefly with the scope to be given <em>Zinermon </em>regarding the issue whether misuse or abuse of delegated power can ever be considered random and unauthorized given that the actors were \u201c \u2018authorized\u2019 to effectuate the scheme.\u201d <em>Caine I </em>at 866 (Jones, J., dissenting). Judge Jones explained why, under her interpretation, \u201c[t]he factors which distinguish <em>Zinermon </em>from <em>Parratt/Hudson\u201d </em>were not applicable to the plaintiff\u2019s loss of privileges in <em>Caine:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">There is no deficit in the hospital\u2019s procedural regulations. As previously stated, the doctor challenges solely the bias of his peers and their violation of those regulations. These allegations naturally disprove the majority\u2019s third <em>Zinermon </em>based conclusion that the \u201cstate actors\u2019 actions in the present case were not unauthorized.\u201d ... Of course they were! Investigatory and judicial bias in implementing the regulations is always unauthorized, if they are not alleged to flow from the regulations themselves. <em>Holloway v Walker, </em>784 F2d 1287, 1292-1293 (CA 5, 1986). Nearly every paragraph of Dr. Caine\u2019s 50-page complaint concludes with the assertion that the hospital actors\u2019 conduct violated a particular provision of the regulations. The majority have already assumed away the only reason authorized by the regulations for immediate suspension of hospital privileges, i.e., to protect the safety of patients. Hence it follows that any other action which brought about that result had to be unauthorized by the regulations. In <em>Zinermon, </em>by contrast, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the voluntary admission of the patient may have been an abuse of judgment by the staff authorized to admit him, but their exercise of judgment was specifically condoned by the regulations. \u201cFlorida\u2019s [statutory scheme] . . . gives state officials broad power and little guidance in admitting mental patients.\u201d <em>Zinermon </em>[494 US 135]. Such is emphatically not the case under the conditions assumed by the majority. <em>[Caine I </em>at 866-867 (Jones, J., dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Judge Jones, thus, distinguished between officials whose exercise of judgment is specifically authorized, but applied in an unconstitutional manner largely because the legislature failed to adequately circumscribe the discretion delegated, and officials whose conduct is outside the parameters of the discretion granted them under state law and therefore characterized as random, unauthorized, and unpredictable sufficient to trigger the <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>doctrine. This may correctly explain <em>Zinermon. </em>Like Judge Easter-brook\u2019s reference to the difference between liberty and property, Judge Jones\u2019 distinction between a delegation of \u201cbroad power and little guidance\u201d and a delegation of discretion that is more limited by procedural safeguards within a statute may provide a clue about the Supreme Court\u2019s underlying rationale in <em>Zinermon. </em>If so, <em>Zinermon </em>may, as Judge Jones suggests, represent a sui generis situation. However, lacking the comfort of further Supreme Court clarification, I agree with the majority and the approach taken by Judge Williams for the <em>Caine I </em>majority and by Judge Cudahy, that \u201cpredeprivation process is the rule, not the exception,\u201d <em>Easter House III </em>at 1411 (Cudahy, J., dissenting), and that \u00a7 \u201c1983 applies to all violations of constitutional rights \u2014 not only those that are authorized by state law, but also those that result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>from abuses of state authority and are forbidden by state law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1412.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Although the majority appears to imply that the rule to be gleaned from <em>Zinermon </em>is clear, there is confusion in the federal circuit courts over the meaning and effect of that case on \u00a7 1983 jurisprudence. As the above sampling of the leading cases indicates, the only conclusion that can confidently be stated is that the relationship between <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>and <em>Zinermon </em>requires further clarification.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">One way to approach analysis of the controversy involves two models of \u00a7 1983 jurisprudence. See Juarez, <em>The Supreme Court as the Cheshire cat: Escaping the section 1983 wonderland, </em>25 St Mary\u2019s L J 1, 19 (1993). The \u201cLegalist Model\u201d would, consistent \u25a0with a strict interpretation of <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson, </em>ask only \u201cwhether state laws are constitutionally adequate. If there is an adequate state law, then the plaintiff cannot bring a Section 1983 claim, and must instead rely on state-law claims heard, in most cases, in state court.\u201d Juarez, <em>supra </em>at 8. Presumably, this approach would encompass both express and implied inadequacies. The \u201cGovernmental Model\u201d would allow a \u00a7 1983 cause of action where \u201cany state official has infringed the plaintiffs constitutionally protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>interests . . . even when the state\u2019s lawmakers have sought to prevent the violation of constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Although it had appeared that the Legalist Model was the governing model after <em>Hudson, Zinermon </em>added confusion to the equation, demonstrated by the decisions of the federal courts in response. As Juarez noted, \u201cThe <em>[Zinermon] </em>Court concluded by freely mixing the Governmental and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Legalist Models, although these two models are contradictory in their approaches.\u201d Juarez, <em>supra </em>at 24.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Although the <em>Zinermon </em>Court clearly reached the result that would be reached under the Governmental Model, <em>Zinermon\u2019s </em>use of both the Legalist Model and the Governmental Model has led to divergence among the circuits. The majority in our case also reaches the result that the Governmental Model would yield.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The Juarez article reviews the scope of the dispute in the circuits as it existed in 1993. \u201cContrary to <em>Zinermon\u2019s </em>description of <em>Parratt </em>as the \u2018unusual\u2019 case, the courts of appeals in both published and unpublished decisions clearly favored the Legalist Model . . . us[ing] the Legalist Model in thirty-four appellate decisions, while applying the Governmental Model in only eight.\u201d Juarez, <em>supra </em>at 31. Similarly, as of 1993, the district courts favored the Legalist Model 23 to 18. Under <em>Easter House, </em>the Seventh Circuit is clearly a Legalist circuit. See <em>Easter House III, supra </em>at 1404-1405. The majority apparently puts us in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>minority and at odds with the Seventh Circuit with respect to the interpretation of \u00a7 1983 <em>post-Zinermon </em>by reaching the Governmental Model result.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The leading cases in the Fifth Circuit apply a Legalist approach, see <em>Caine II, </em>supra; <em>Charbonnet v Lee, </em>951 F2d 638 (CA 5, 1991), while the Fourth Circuit appears to adhere more closely to the Governmental approach.

For the purposes of our case, the more appropriate result is the one the Governmental Model would reach, although elements of the \u201clegalist\u201d approach appear to survive in Justice Taylor\u2019s opinion as they did in <em>Zinermon. </em>To be certain, lower courts will be better served to err on the side of the \u201cgovernmental\u201d approach, as we have done, rather than seeking to glean a coherent rule from <em>Zinermon.</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Observing a clear disagreement in the federal circuit courts of appeal over the implications of <em>Zinermon, </em>this Court has decided to place itself on one side of the dispute, apparently the minority side.

However, MCL 801.87(1); MSA 28.1770(7)(1) is not an exclusive remedy provision. It stated at tire relevant time that \u201c[w]ithin 6 months ... an attorney for that county <em>may </em>file a civil action . . . .\u201d The act contemplates a collection process in which the prisoner is required to cooperate, and the civil action is only relevant if the county decides that it needs to obtain a judgment against the prisoner. Moreover, MCL 801.88(2); MSA 28.1770(8)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">If necessary to protect the county\u2019s right to obtain reimbursement under this act against the disposition of known property, the county, in accordance with rules of the supreme court of this state, may seek issuance of an ex parte restraining order to restrain <em>the defendant </em>from disposing of the property pending a hearing on an order to show cause why the particular property should not be applied to reimbursement of the county for the maintenance and support <em>of the defendant as a prisoner. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">This provision does not require that the county postpone seeking the ex parte order only until after conviction, but plainly contemplates issuance of the order before conviction if necessary. To the extent the majority implies that the ex parte procedure must be postponed until after conviction, I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">The majority states that \u201c[t]he statutory language says the county <em>may </em>file an action if it wishes to obtain a judgment against an inmate that has been convicted of a felony.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 94, n 3. This is exactly the point: Use of the word \u201cmay\u201d does not suggest this is the exclusive remedy to recover costs, as opposed to obtaining a judgment. Likewise, use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in the provision providing for ex parte action does not suggest that ex parte action otherwise authorized by MCR 3.310 is superseded and unavailable to the county as creditor and potential judgment obligee.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>In addition to these basic considerations of grammatical and statutory construction, common sense suggests that the Legislature intended the phrase \u201cex parte\u201d to mean what it means in any other context: maintenance of the status quo pending a determination of a substantive issue. It makes no sense to conclude that the Legislature intended to defray the burden on taxpayers for the care of convicted defendants by authorizing its recovery and simultaneously precluding the county from preventing the dissolution of assets that otherwise might be available to satisfy a judgment. Since any knowledgeable or well-counseled potential obligor would dispose of any assets under this scenario, the majority\u2019s interpretation amounts to a conclusion that the Legislature created a remedy that would only be efficacious in the case of a wholly uninformed defendant represented by incompetent counsel. For example, MCL 800.404a; MSA 28.1705, authorizing recovery of costs incident to custody of state prisoners provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (3), in seeking to secure reimbursement under this act, the attorney general may use any remedy, interim order, or enforcement procedure allowed by law or court rule including an ex parte restraining order to restrain the prisoner or any other person or legal entity in possession or having custody of the estate of the prisoner from disposing of certain property pending a hearing on an order to show cause why the particular property should not be applied to reimburse the state as provided for under this act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">(2) To protect and maintain assets pending resolution of an action under this act, the court, upon request, may appoint a receiver.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-9\"> The majority states, <em>ante </em>at 94, n 5, with respect to the appropriateness of the Court of Appeals remedy of ordering the return of plaintiff Mudge\u2019s bond monies, that the Court of Appeals did not err in ordering such return absent the county\u2019s compliance with the prca. Thus, the majority, while determining in part n of its opinion, that the issue of the validity of the orders, i.e., whether the orders may be collaterally attacked, was inadequately briefed, inconsistently upholds return of the bond money to Mudge. The majority thus sustains a collateral attack by Mudge, asserted on the ground that the order violated the prca. Assuming, arguendo, that the sheriff acted ultra vires of the prca, the trial court\u2019s order was not void. The trial court had in rem jurisdiction over the bond money and subject matter jurisdiction over the criminal case in which the bond was posted. Thus, the ex parte order of the trial court is valid until vacated or set aside by the trial court or reversed on direct appeal. Plaintiff Mudge never sought such reversal. This Court has not found a due process violation, but only that such a violation was sufficiently alleged. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>The amount of bond money taken may be considered as an item of damages if a due process violation is found on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Further, the validity of the Court of Appeals direction to return the bond money does not depend on whether the issue was adequately briefed or whether we granted leave regarding the question. These observations are non sequiturs, given that the majority affirms the Court of Appeals order returning the bond monies as \u201cproper.\u201d The parties may abandon an issue; they may not confer jurisdiction on a court to grant a remedy. Otherwise stated, the issue whether the Court of Appeals had the authority to grant this relief is an issue the parties\u2019 approach cannot dictate. In point of fact, the defendant claimed that the orders could not be collaterally attacked, a correct conclusion, and one we would, in any event, reach. Even if the defendant\u2019s action is ultra vires of the prca, the order of the trial court transferring the monies posted for bond is voidable, not void.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\"> I also concur with the majority\u2019s decision regarding plaintiff Brown\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action to the extent that it orders the trial court to determine whether Brown may collaterally attack the order he signed. We did not grant leave on this question and, therefore, should express no opinion regarding whether this is a question of fact or a question of law. On remand, that determination is a threshold issue for resolution by the trial court. <em>Stefanac v Cranbrook Educational Community (After Remand), </em>435 Mich 155; 458 NW2d 56 (1990); MCR 2.612.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">Brown was imprisoned for 131 days, entitling the county to $3,930 in reimbursement under the Prisoner Reimbursement to the County Act, MCL 801.81 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 28.1770(1) <em>et seq. </em>The record in this case reflects that plaintiff Brown settled his case for $3,765 as of June 29, 1989. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney attempted to file an order for return of Brown\u2019s bond monies on June 28, 1989. However, the court clerk informed counsel (and noted on the order) that Brown needed to sign his approval and consent to the order because it disbursed Brown\u2019s $10,000 bond, in part, to his attorney. The order, which states that $4,000 was to go to the attorney and $6,000 was to go to Brown, also bears a handwritten notation that the disbursements were to be made \u201cafter payment to Macomb County sheriff of $3,765.\u201d Both versions of the order, the one signed by Brown and the one not signed by him appear in the file with that notation regarding $3,765. The order appears to be valid on its face and sufficient to refute any contention by plaintiff Brown that he was denied due process where he consented to settlement of his attorney fee and debt under the prca. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the Court of Appeals did not directly address the issue of Brown\u2019s consent, the trial court did in its January 24, 1991, opinion and order, and defendants have briefed it and preserved it at all levels. However, given that our grant order was limited to the three issues stated, I agree that a determination limited to whether Brown may collaterally attack the order is appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b193-9\"> Of course, if Brown settled his claim, the county need not assert a counterclaim. The relevant order appears to indicate Brown consented to satisfaction of his obligation under the prca for $3,765.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b194-8\"> Recoupment is not necessarily limited to contract law.

Future ex parte orders restraining disposition of assets should only restrain disposition pending notice and a hearing to show cause why the assets should not be applied to reimbursement under the act, at which the court may order proper disposition. MCL 801.88(2); MSA 28.1770(8)(2).

While we recognize that plaintiff has sufficiently alleged a \u00a7 1983 cause of action, discovery should allow the trial comt to determine whether and to what extent the procedure for obtaining ex parte orders, drafted in such a way as to deprive plaintiffs of notice and a hearing, was officially authorized by the county\u2019s deliberate or customary acts. If the conduct was so authorized, under <em>Monell, supra, </em>the officially sanctioned act allegedly depriving plaintiffs of their rights under the Due Process Clause is actionable under \u00a7 1983 without reference to <em>Parratt/Hudson. </em>However, should discovery reveal that the county did not deliberately or by custom authorize the drafting of the ex parte orders so as to allow the orders to be treated as judgments authorizing transfer of the bond monies into the general fund, the Court\u2019s position on the dispute over the meaning of <em>Parratt/Hudson </em>after <em>Zinermon </em>will determine whether plaintiffs\u2019 action may go forward. Because we have adopted the narrow view of <em>Parratt/Hudson, </em>as explained below, plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action will go forward even if the county did not officially sanction the ex parte bond retention procedure, but the county may not be an actionable defendant given the requirements of <em>Monell.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b202-8\"> An underlying and inadequately addressed issue in the case before us is whether the conduct of the official actor is attributable to the county defendant.

See <em>Easter House III </em>at 1408-1410 (Easterbrook, X, concurring). While some cases have endorsed this distinction, <em>Zinermon, supra </em>at 116, n 2, and 131, n 16, the Supreme Court has not done so. <em>Id. </em>at 132 (\u201cWe ... do not find support in precedent for a categorical distinction between a deprivation of liberty and one of property\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b207-6\"> The county has not argued that the sheriff is a state official, rather than a county official, in an attempt to defeat attribution of the sheriffs conduct to the county.

Federal cases have held that where a plaintiff met the requirements for alleging local government liability under <em>Monell, supra </em>at 690-691, the \u201ccomplaint asserting municipal liability ... by definition [would] state [] a claim to which <em>Parratt </em>is inapposite.\u201d <em>Wilson v Civil Town of Clayton, Ind, </em>839 F2d 375, 380 (CA 7, 1988).

See, e.g., Blum, n 14 <em>supra </em>at 264. Proceedings below will presumably resolve the issue whether the sheriff acted as a state official in accordance with his authority under the proa or pursuant to official county procedure. Thus, they will resolve whether the sheriffs conduct in obtaining the ex parte orders falls within the <em>Zinermon </em>controversy or, as an established state procedure that denies due process, is governed only by <em>Monell.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\"> The Fifth Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Edith Jones, reversed on rehearing en banc, <em>Caine v Hardy, </em>943 F2d 1406 (CA 5, 1991) <em>(Caine II), </em>ultimately adopting a similar approach to that which was adopted in the Seventh Circuit in the <em>Easter House </em>cases. Although we adopt an approach rejected by the Seventh and Fifth Circuits, in cases in which the Supreme Court denied certiorari, my concurrence with the majority\u2019s adoption of the apparent minority approach stems from my agreement with the authorities explained and the continued unsettled nature of this area of the law in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s failure to provide clearer guidance.

However, I find Judge Cudahy\u2019s position more persuasive, as does, I believe, Justice Taylor. Moreover, little guidance may be gleaned from the Court\u2019s denials of certiorari in <em>Easter House III </em>and <em>Caine II </em>considering the Court\u2019s apparently inconsistent remand and subsequent denial in <em>Fields v Durham, </em>909 F2d 94, 97 (CA 4, 1990) (discussed below).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b208-6\"> The <em>Zinermon </em>Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Burch\u2019s suit is neither an action challenging the facial adequacy of a State\u2019s statutory procedures, nor an action based only on state officials\u2019 random and unauthorized violation of state laws. . . .

Moreover, the Court, in rejecting application of <em>Parratt/Hudson, </em>reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">It is immaterial whether the due process violation Burch alleges is best described as arising from petitioners\u2019 failure to comply with state procedures ... or from the absence of a specific requirement that petitioners determine whether a patient is competent .... <em>[Id. </em>at 135-136.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">See also <em>Seals v Edwards, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, issued January 13, 1993 (Docket No. 91-2215), 985 F2d 561; 1993 WL 5932, <em>*2 </em>(CA 6, 1993) (reasoning that it is illogical to equate the concept of wrongdoing with random and unauthorized conduct in the presence of an established state procedure, thereby requiring \u201cevery plaintiff ... to plead himself out of court\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\"> The conclusion of the majority is fortified by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent reference to <em>Zinermon </em>in <em>Gilbert v Homar, </em>520 US 924, 930; 117 S Ct 1807; 138 L Ed 2d 120 (1997):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">This Court has recognized, on many occasions, that where a State must act quickly, or where it would be impractical to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>predeprivation process, postdeprivation process satisfies the requirements of the Due Process Clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">On the other hand, Justice Kennedy has stated more specifically:</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">[T]he price of our ambivalence over the outer limits of <em>Parratt </em>has been its dilution and, in some respects, its transformation into a mere pleading exercise. The <em>Parratt </em>rule has been avoided by attaching a substantive rather than procedural label to due process claims (a distinction that if accepted in this context could render <em>Parratt </em>a dead letter) and by treating claims based on the Due Process Clause as claims based on some other constitutional provision. ... It has been avoided at the other end of the spectrum by construing complaints alleging a substantive injury as attacks on the adequacy of state procedures. See <em>Zinermon . . . ; Easter House </em>.... These evasions are uryustified given the clarity of the <em>Parratt </em>rule: In the ordinary case where an injury has been caused not by a state law, policy, or procedure, but by a random and unauthorized act that can be remedied by state law, there is no basis for intervention under \u00a7 1983, at least in a suit based on \u201cthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment <em>simpliciter.\u201d [Albright v Oliver, </em>510 US 266, 285; 114 S Ct 807; 127 L Ed 2d 114 (1994) (Kennedy, J., concurring).]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b215-4\"> See also Alexander, <em>Constitutional torts, the Supreme Court, and, the law of noncontradiction: An essay on </em>Zinermon v Burch, 87 NW U L R 576, 576-577 (1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">[T]he Legalist model . . . speaks to and imposes duties upon government officials when they act as lawmakers.

It is when the actor\u2019s conduct is contrary to the established procedure or where the extent of discretion delegated is unclear that the confusion in the case law becomes relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\"> The Governmental Model grows out of a line of cases beginning with <em>Home Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co v City of Los Angeles, </em>227 US 278; 33 S Ct 312; 57 L Ed 510 (1913), and culminating with <em>Monroe v Pape, </em>n 22 <em>supra. </em>Alexander, n 24 <em>supra </em>at 580-581. The Legalist Model can be traced back to <em>Barney v City of New York, </em>193 US 430; 24 S Ct 502; 48 L Ed 737 (1904). Alexander, n 24 <em>supra </em>at 580-581. <em>Parratt </em>and <em>Hudson </em>marked the resurrection of the Legalist Model, but <em>Zinermon </em>seems to affirm and reject it at the same time. See Alexander, n 24 <em>supra </em>at 586-587, quoting <em>Zinermon </em>at 124 (Governmental) and 135 (Legalist). In short, the <em>Zinermon </em>Court\u2019s analysis is contradictory because it recognizes first that \u00a7 1983 is supplemental to state remedies, thus making the existence of an enforceable state law irrelevant, while simultaneously reasoning that liability was available to Burch under \u00a7 1983 because Florida lawmakers may have delegated impermissibly broad discretion on its officials. Alexander, n 24 <em>supra </em>at 586-587. Thus, Alexander observes that \u201cexactly where [the Court] is . . . locating the constitutional defect surely is unclear. <em>Id. </em>at 587.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b217-5\"> The decisions of the Sixth Circuit, at the time of the Juarez study, appeared to favor the Legalist Model slightly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b217-6\"> Juarez observes that two factors have driven the lower federal courts toward the Legalist Model despite <em>Zinermon: </em>the flood of \u00a7 1983 litigation and federalism, Juarez, <em>supra </em>at 51, but later characterizes these rationales as having \u201clittle support in the reality facing the federal courts . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 66. Notably, Juarez also advocates a return to <em>\u201cpre-Parratt </em>standards\u201d as the solution to the confusion generated by <em>Zinermon, </em>thus reinstituting \u201cthe basic principle announced in prior cases: predeprivation process is not required when it is impractical to provide it.\u201d Juarez, <em>supra </em>at 62-63. Such an approach would apparently yield the same result as the Corat reached in <em>Zinermon, </em>as well as the result the majority reaches here. The three tests set out in <em>Zinermon, </em>and loosely applied by the majority here \u2014 (1) whether the deprivation was predictable, (2) whether predeprivation process was not impossible, and (3) whether the defendants\u2019 conduct was unauthorized, see Juarez, <em>supra </em>at 24\u2014 would not disappear altogether under this approach. Predictability and impossibility, because they are closely related from a logical standpoint to practicality, would survive under a return to the pr <em>e-Parratt </em>standards, while the inquiry into whether the conduct was authorized, which, as demonstrated above, is the primary source of the confusion among the courts after <em>Zinermon </em>and <em>Parratt, </em>would be eliminated. Juarez, <em>supra </em>at 63-65. This approach appears to be consistent with the case law predating <em>Parratt, </em>as well as the governmental approach, and would apparently settle the confusion by discarding the third test but continuing to allow dismissals where predeprivation process was impractical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\"> In addition to Juarez, <em>supra, </em>see, e.g., Fallon, <em>Some confusions about due process, judicial review, and constitutional remedies, </em>93 Columbia L R 309, 347-348, n 219 (1993), quoting Hart &amp; Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System, p 145 (3d ed, supp 1992) <em>(\u201cZinermon </em>enormously confuses the analysis of random and unauthorized deprivations, . . . makes sense only if read to hold that Florida\u2019s procedural scheme . . . was constitutionally defective, . . .

The Court could adopt a more \u201clegalist\u201d approach, that addresses only the constitutional adequacy of state laws, policies, and procedures, i.e., whether the state has expressly or impliedly authorized the unconstitutional deprivation, thus leaving plaintiffs to state-law remedies where there is no unconstitutional official act. Alternatively, the Court could adopt a more \u201cgovernmental\u201d approach that focuses on whether a policymaker has deprived an individual of a constitutionally protected interest, even in the presence of a constitutionally valid act seeking to prevent such a deprivation, thus providing plaintiffs with a federal remedy in the vast majority of cases where predeprivation process was not impractical under the circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b219-6\"> It may be useful to note, as well, that the relief available in these cases was also addressed in <em>Zinermon, </em>where the Court referenced the fact that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">a deprivation of procedural due process is actionable under \u00a7 1983 without regard to whether the same deprivation would have taken place even in the presence of proper procedural safeguards. . . . [HJowever, ... in cases where the deprivation would have occurred anyway, and the lack of due process did not itself cause any injury (such as emotional distress), the plaintiff may recover only nominal damages. <em>[Id. </em>at 125-126, n 11.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Section 1983 should stand as a deterrent to the misuse of the judicial process to obtain monies owed under the prca. Assuming there is an equitable element to the availability of the recoupment defense, a county\u2019s failure to provide due process in seeking reimbursement, in light of the fact that counties have notice of our decision here, would likely be sufficient to preclude assertion of an equitable defense. Moreover, continued failure to provide due process in seeking reimbursement from uncooperative individuals may provide grounds for an award of punitive damages under federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">I also note that the statute of limitations applicable to \u00a7 1983 claims in Michigan is three years under MCL 600.5805(8); MSA 27A.5805(8).
