Plaintiff, learning that her child was playing in the cellar of the building, descended some steps leading from the street to bring the child back. In doing so she stepped into a hole in one of the steps and was injured. As plaintiff was a mere trespasser, and as it was not shown that even gratuitous permission to enter on the premises had been given by the defendant, defendant owed her no obligation whatsoever. See Fox v. Warner, etc., Co., 204 N. Y. 240, 97 N. E. 497, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 395, Ann. Cas. 1913C, 842.
