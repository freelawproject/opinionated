Moore, 52 N. Y. 12, 16.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b269-19\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is also to be borne in mind that although conditions existing at the time of the making of the will may properly be considered in case of ambiguity, \u201ccircumstances occurring long after the execution of the will could not have been within the contemplation of the testator, and could therefore throw no light upon the meaning of the language which he then used.\u201d Morris v.

If, however, the subsequent circumstances are in consonance with those existing at about the time of the making of the will, the former may fortify the latter in seeking the intention of the testator. Keeping in view these general rules, it will be appropriate, first, to determine whether there is any ambiguity or doubtful meaning in the expressions used in the will. If no such uncertainty exists, the court is obliged to follow the ordinary import of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the words employed, regardless of any extrinsic evidence that may tend to contradict them.

Bigelow Under review is numbered \u201cthird,\u201d and reads in part as follows: \u201cThird. I give and bequeath to my executors and trustees hereinafter mentioned all of the stock or shares in the Bigelow Company of New Haven, state of Connecticut, which I now hold or may be entitled to at the time of my death, to be held in trust by them during the lifetime of my dearly beloved wife, Julie.Helene Georger Bigelow, the' earnings or income from my said stock or shares in the said company to be paid by my said executors and trustees to my said dearly beloved wife, as earned, during her lifetime. * * * \u201d This clause further provides that if the testator\u2019s wife \u201cshall at any time deem the income insufficient for her support and maintenance, she then being unmarried, then and in that event\u201d the trustees are empowered to sell as much of said stock as his wife deems necessary for that purpose, and in that event it is further provided that his brother, the plaintiff, shall have the option of purchasing said stock at the valuation thereof as shown on the books of the company. The fourth clause provides that in the event of the death of the testator without leaving issue him surviving, then upon the death of his wife he bequeaths any or all of his or stock of the Bigelow Company \u201cheretofore left in trust for the benefit of my wife, or so much of the same as shall remain at the time of her decease,\u201d to his \u201cdearly beloved brother, Frank L. Bigelow, or his issue,\u201d provided, however, that in the event of the death of his brother without leaving issue him surviving during the lifetime of his wife, the trust in favor of his wife shall cease and determine and she shall then take all of the stock or shares of the Bigelow Company then remaining. By the fifth clause of his will the testator bequeaths his residuary estate to his wife. The final clause of the will confers power upon the executors and trustees \u201cto sell any or all of my stock or shares in the Bigelow Company,\u201d with power of investment and reinvestment, the income to be paid .to the wife, subject to the trusts and conditions expressed in the \u201cthird and fourth paragraphs\u201d of the will. Walter P. Bigelow, the testator, executed his last will and testament on November 24, 1903, and died on March 7,1907, at the age of 40 years. His death was unexpected and when .in apparent good health. At the time of his death he had been married upwards of sixteen years. He died without issue, and left him surviving his widow (who has since remarried, and who is now Mrs. Walter lies Percival); his mother, who died in May, 1912, in her seventy-eighth year, and his brother, Frank L. Bigelow, the plaintiff. The mother had been an invalid continuously and up to the day of her death since some years prior to her husband\u2019s death, which occurred in 1891. The testator\u2019s wife was about 30 years of age when the will was executed. The estate of the deceased, Walter P. Bigelow, consisted of 500 shares of the common stock of the Bigelow Company of the par value of $100 per share, which the testator owned absolutely, and of other available property, approximating in value the sum of $10,000. His indebtedness did not exceed $9,000. The testator also had an interest in the estate of his father, Hobart B. Bigelow, under the provisions of his father\u2019s will,' which, after making certain specific legacies, directs his residuary estate to be divided into two equal parts, one of which he gave absolutely to his two sons (the testator and the plaintiff) in equal shares, and the other of said parts he gave to his wife, Eleanor E. Bigelow, the mother of Frank L. and Walter P. Bigelow, to \u201chave the income and as much of the principal as she may require for her comfortable maintenance and support for and during her natural life, and whatever of said principal may remain at her decease I give, share and share alike, to my two sons, Frank L. and Walter P. Bigelow, to be theirs absolutely.\u201d As life tenant the mother had the right to use as much of the principal of the trust estate as she might require \u201cfor her comfortable maintenance and support,\u201d and under the law of the state of Connecticut she had the power of disposition of any of the securities and property that came to her under the trust, with authority to convert the investments from time to time, as she saw fit. When the mother died the trust estate in which she had a life estate consisted in large part of shares of stock of the Bigelow Company. It is claimed on behalf of the plaintiff that the testator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Walter P. Bigelow, intended that all of his stock in the Bigelow Company, whether owned by him absolutely or in which he would have a reversionary interest from the trust estate created by his father, was to be held in trust' for the benefit of testator\u2019s widow under the third clause of his will. On the other hand, it is contended on behalf of defendant Julie H. Percival \u201cthat no specific disposition was made by Hobart B. Bigelow\u2019s will of any of the Bigelow Company stock; that the remainder interest which the will of Hobart B. Bigelow gave to his son was not a remainder interest in Bigelow Company stock, but a remainder interest in a portion of Hobart B. Bigelow\u2019s residuary estate, subject to his wife\u2019s life interest therein, and subject to her absolute right, as trustee and life tenant, to change at any time and from time to time the securities in which the portion of the residuary estate was invested,\u201d and hence that the circumstance that testator\u2019s mother, as trustee under his father\u2019s will, held at the time of his death as investment of a portion of the trust estate certain shares of the Bigelow Company, in respect of which she had an inextinguishable power of sale, was no evidence of any intent on the part of Walter P. Bigelow to include under the \u201cthird\u201d paragraph of his will the Bigelow Company stock which at the time of his death might remain in the hands of his mother, as trustee under her husband\u2019s will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b271-3\"><bracketnum>[3, 4]</bracketnum> The third paragraph of the will creates a trust estate of the- \u201cstock or shares in the Bigelow Company * * * which I now hold or may be entitled to at the time of my death.\u201d Effect should be given the words \u201cmay be entitled to\u201d if their meaning is plain. But their meaning is not plain. The testator clearly distinguished between stocks which he absolutely owned and had possession of when he made his will and stocks the ownership of which he might subsequently become entitled to. Could he have had in mind the remote contingency that might exist at the time of his death when, under some executory contract into which he might enter for the purchase of additional stock of the Bigelow Company, delivery thereof had not yet been made? Or did he have in mind the Bigelow Company stock then in his mother\u2019s possession under the trust arising under his father\u2019s will under the assumption that one-half thereof would be eventually his? Clearly an uncertainty exists as to the intention of the testator in respect of the words \u201cor may be entitled to.\u201d The word \u201centitle\u201d means \u201cto give a claim to.\u201d The testator had a substantial interest in the Bigelow Company stock in his mother\u2019s possession as trustee. It is true that a possibility existed of his interest or claim being wiped out by the mother\u2019s exercise of her power to dispose of the stock for her own maintenance, or by her conversion of the stock into some other kind of security. But until the mother exercised this power the testator had an interest in one-half of this stock. Or, stating it somewhat differently, he had an interest in or claim to the stock, subject to be defeated by the exercise of the power of his mother above indicated. As a matter of fact, the mother, as trustee, had not, up to the time of her death, disposed of the Bigelow Company stock, and the estate of Walter P. Bigelow became absolutely entitled to one-half of the shares of the stock of that company, which then constituted a part of the Hobart B. Bigelow residuary estate. In the event that actually happened, we find a condition of affairs when it may be said that the estate of Walter P. Bigelow was \u201centitled to\u201d the possession of specific shares of Bigelow Company stock. It is true that he may not be said to have been technically, or in a strict legal sense, entitled to them at the time of his death. But if all the circumstances indicate that the testator did not contemplate when he made his will that his mother would dispose of the Bigelow Company stock unless upon his and his brother\u2019s advice, and that he had in mind that he would eventually be entitled to one-half of the stock in his mother\u2019s possession, should not such circumstances be considered in determining his intention rather than to seek it by assuming that he had in mind the remote contingency that he might, at the time of his death, have an out&gt; standing executory contract for the purchase of the Bigelow Company stock? Nor does the assumption that the will of Hobart B. Bigelow made no bequest in remainder of specific shares of Bigelow Company stock to Walter P. Bigelow, the testator, necessarily militate against plaintiff\u2019s contention. It may be that a presumption might arise that when the testator made his will he un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>derstood the legal effect of his father\u2019s will and had that in mind, but it does not therefore follow that this presumption may not be rebutted by attendant circumstances which establish that, as matter of fact, he did not have knowledge of nor in mind the strict legal effect of his father\u2019s will. Had testator\u2019s mother\u2019s death preceded his own, the trust estate in his mother\u2019s possession would have included Bigelow Company stock, and he would have been legally entitled to the possession of one-half. We have thus a situation in which the words \u201cor may be entitled to,\u201d standing alone, are of equivocal or ambiguous meaning and resort to extrinsic circumstances contemporaneous with the execution of the will is necessary in order to ascertain the intent of the testator. Testator\u2019s mother died in 1912 at the age of 78 years, notwithstanding that she had been an invalid for upwards of 20 odd years before her death. Was it not, therefore, quite natural for the testator to assume that he would outlive his mother, and that upon her death he would be entitled to one-half of the trust estate held by her, and that a portion thereof would consist of Bigelow Company stock? When Hobart B. Bigelow died in 1891 his estate included an item of 285 shares of the Bigelow Company stock. On June 10, 1897, there was filed in the probate court of the district of New Haven, Conn., a statement showing the formal distribution of the estate of Hobart B. Bigelow, signed by plaintiff, his brother, Walter, the testator and their mother, Eleanor <em>L. </em>Bigelow. This statement, which was filed about six years before Walter P. Bigelow made his will, shows that the trust fund was of the value of $41,473.04, and included 143 shares of the Bigelow Company stock, at a valuation of $14,300. It appears that the Bigelow Company was organized in the year 1883, and that at the time of Hobart B. Bigelow\u2019s death the stockholders of the company consisted of Hobart B. Bigelow, Prank L. Bigelow, the plaintiff, Walter P. Bigelow, the testator, George S. Barnum, a warm, intimate friend of the family, and a Mr. Bison. The interest of Mr. Bison was small, and shortly after Hobart B. Bigelow\u2019s death it was bought up by his widow with insurance moneys that came to her, and the ownership of the stock of the Bigelow Company then was as follows: Eleanor L. Bigelow, as trustee, 192 shares and individually 7 shares; Prank L. Bigelow, 150 shares; Walter P. Bigelow, 150 shares; and George Barnum, 101 shares. Before the date of the execution of the Walter P. Bigelow will the Bigelow family had further added to their holdings in the company by the purchase of 49 shares from Mr. Barnum, so that they then owned all the stock of the company lacking 52 shares held by Mr. Barnum. The relations between the Bigelow brothers and their mother appear to have been most affectionate, and their interests in the Bigelow Company seem to have been uniformly harmonious and united. The conditions'that existed up to the time of the making of the will point to an intention of the testator to keep the Bigelow Company stock in the Bigelow family, meanwhile providing a life income for his wife from the shares of stock of which he was absolutely possessed, and to which his estate would eventually be entitled after his death. The mother of the testator evidently relied upon the judgment of her sons in managing the property which she held in trust, and seconded their purpose to practically own the Bigelow Company business, and the testator had no reason to doubt that the Bigelow Company stock owned by the trust estate under his father\u2019s will would remain intact during his mother\u2019s lifetime. The testator was not a lawyer, and was only about 24 years of age when his father died. It does not appear that the person who drew his will knew the conditions of his father\u2019s will, or that the testator understood or considered the question of the power of his mother to dispose of the trust securities and the possibilities that might ensue if she chose to exercise her authority. As a matter of fact the mother, who died some five years after her son\u2019s death, had not parted with any of the Bigelow Company stock during her lifetime. This circumstance, while not of itself evidence of the testator\u2019s intention, is, however, confirmatory of the sentiment that continuously existed for many years, to keep the Bigelow Company stock in the family. To my mind, unless a narrow, strained meaning is given to the words \u201cor' be entitled to,\u201d the intention of the testator clearly was to include in the trust estate the Bigelow Company stock that was in his mother\u2019s custody as part of the trust estate of his father\u2019s will. The scheme of the tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>tator seems to have been to create a trust which at the same time would keep intact the Bigelow Company stock in the interest of his brother and the latter\u2019s family, and provide an income for life for his wife from the stock of the company, of which he died absolutely possessed, and from such additional stock of the company to which he or his estate might be entitled upon his mother\u2019s death under the trust estate created by his father\u2019s will. The provision of a reversion to testator\u2019s wife of the principal of the trust estate in the event of the death of his brother before him leaving no issue is harmonious with this scheme, since in that contingency no person of his blood would then be in existence. So, too, the provisions which empowered a sale of the Bigelow Company stock would be consistent with this general scheme, inasmuch as it presupposes the consent of his brother, who was an executor and trustee under the will, who would only sell in case a situation arose when it was deemed desirable so to do. As no differences exist between the parties respecting the account of the plaintiff other than the question discussed in this opinion the account submitted will be approved and passed. The motion to strike out testimony relating to circumstances existing subsequent to the date of the execution of the will, which was taken subject to the objections of the defendant, will, for the reasons heretofore outlined, be denied, with appropriate exceptions to the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b273-4\">Argued before INGRAHAM, P.
