The plaintiff herself did not see the persons who lowered the barrel. The driver of the wagon was not produced, nor his absence explained. Haff, the proprietor of the Haff Company, testified that he saw the accident from the opposite side of the street; that two laborers were assisting in\"the removal of the barrels; but that he was unable to identify either. The only witness produced by plaintiff who knew what had happened were: (a) Piersanti, a peddler with a push-cart, who testified that he occasionally helped generally about' defendant\u2019s place in return for their allowing him to peddle in front thereof. He said that he had been helping to remove barrels from this truck, but, at the time when this barrel was being moved, he was selling tomatoes from his push-cart to a customer, and that he saw this barrel roll and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>that the driver of the truck rolled it to the skid and let it go. (b) Anderson, a \u201cchecker\u201d of defendant, who testified that PTrsanti was four feet away from the truck when this barrel came down. He thought that Piersanti was about to wait upon a customer at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">There being no testimony in the case from which the jury could connect defendant or any of its employ\u00e9s with the occurrence, the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
