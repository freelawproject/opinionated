The sole issue is whether the defendant did his duty in properly maintaining them. The rule \u201cres ipsa loquitur\u201d does not apply, for the sufficient reason that the covers were necessarily moveable, and the fact that one moved under the unmeasured driving power of a man slipping against it does not of itself show abnormal condition of the securing bolts. Nor is there evidence of omission of duty in maintaining the covers. The plaintiff\u2019s argument is that the cover moved under the pressure applied, and that it would not have moved had the bolts been properly tightened; hence the screws were not properly set. The difficulty is that the pressure of the man slipping and falling is a quantity unmeasured and unknown. It may have been sufficient to open doors properly held. It must be considered that the covers were made to open and shut under a force consistent with work properly and lawfully done on the surface of the conveyor. The suddenly fallen man may have applied that force. The evidence leaves the question unanswered, save by unpermitted- conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-5\">The order should be affirmed, with costs to respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
