As we said heretofore in this proceeding, the submission of an illegal and an excessive bill of costs is a serious offense. Matter of Mashbir, 44 App. Div. 632, 60 N. Y. Supp. 451. The attorney did not establish propriety of conduct in the taxation of his costs; for there appears no justification for the insertion of some items in his bill, and also no sufficient proof that the amounts of other items were legal or were proper. The attorney\u2019s only excuse is inexperience, and this is not excuse, but at best palliation. While, under all the facts elicited upon the hearing, we think that the attorney should neither be disbarred nor suspended, we do think that he should be thus reprimanded formally.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">The record, as thus modified, is confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-16\">STAPLETON; J., takes no part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
