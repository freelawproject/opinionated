In point of fact there is very little of the structure in Pearl street in front of plaintiff\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">It is very probable that values in Pearl street above Coenties Slip have been seriously impaired by the erection and operation of defendants\u2019 railroad, and that such impairment has affected values in the street generally, even below the point where the structure leaves Pearl street and turns into Coenties' Slip, and where it does not substantially interfere with plaintiffs\u2019 easements; but for this latter impairment no damages can be recovered. The premises in suit have been allowed to fall into such a state of disrepair that some portion of the diminution of rental value must be attributed to neglect. On the whole, we are of opinion that substantial justice will be done if the fee damage is reduced to $3,025, and the rental damage to $181.50 per annum, or $1,875.50; both sums to carry interest from May 20, 1913, the date of the trial. The extra allowance must also be reduced to $245.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">The judgment will, accordingly, be modified in these respects, and as modified affirmed, without costs in this court. The twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth findings of fact will be reversed, and in place thereof there will be found and inserted in the order findings of similar tenor, except as to the several amounts of damage, which shall be as above indicated. Settle order on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
