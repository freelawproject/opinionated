He paid his fare, received the transfer, and rode up Broadway. The Broadway conductor repeated the same information, returned to him the final stub of the transfer; and he boarded an Eighth street car east-bound and surrendered this stub to the conductor. A few moments later the conductor came to- him, showing him a transfer stub, telling him: \u201cThe transfer isn\u2019t good.\u201d Plaintiff testified: \u201cI said: T didn\u2019t give you that transfer.\u2019 \u201d At Eighth street and Avenue A an inspector boarded the car. \u201cHe said: \u2018Pay your fare.\u2019 I wanted to explain, but the conductor didn\u2019t let me <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>explain. He gave me one yank, and they chucked me off.\u201d He was then thrown off, and sues for his damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\">The motion to dismiss was based on two grounds. The second\u2014i. e., that no more force was used in ejecting the plaintiff than was necessary\u2014need not be discussed, inasmuch as it is perfectly evident that there was ample evidence in that regard to carry the case to the jury. The present appeal raises only a question of law as to the first ground, which was: \u201cThat there is no proof that the transfer offered was a valid transfer.\u201d This ground, in my opinion, is not well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Although no objection was taken on the score that there was not in operation at the time an appropriate system of transfers between these various lines of cars, plaintiff actually introduced evidence to that effect. Under such circumstances, the plaintiff, having demanded a transfer for the route which he subsequently took, was entitled to assume that he received what he asked and paid for. Muckle v. Rochester Co., <em>79 </em>Hun, 32, 29 N. Y. Supp. 732; Eddy v. Syracuse Co., 50 App. Div. 109, 63 N. Y. Supp. 645. There was, therefore, as I understand the case, ample evidence that plaintiff had received and tendered a valid transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Moreover, in any event, assuming the transfer to have been invalid, plaintiff was not afforded, according to his testimony, a reasonable opportunity to pay his fare, on which ground alone he would be entitled to recover. See Hayes v. N. Y. C. R. R. Co., 34 Hun, 627, opinion reported in 30 Albany Law Journal, 469; Huba v. Schenectady R. R. Co., 85 App. Div. 199, 83 N. Y. Supp. 157; also 6 Cyc. 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
