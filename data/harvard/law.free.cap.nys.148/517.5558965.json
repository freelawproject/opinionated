It has been uniformly held that under this section a party has an absolute right to amend once, providing he do so within 20 days after service of the answer, demurrer, or reply. An amendment by leave of the court is not a substitute for, and does not preclude, a subsequent amendment under the section cited. Backes v. Mech. &amp; Traders\u2019 Bank, 130 App. Div. 20, 114 N. Y. Supp. 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-17\">Order appealed from reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
