The records of the banker\u2019s office were accessible at the time of the trial, and were not introduced by defendant. <em>Held </em>that the court did not, under the circumstances, abuse its discretion in overruling the motion, both because there was no proper showing of diligence and because another trial was almost certain to result the same way.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b61-7\">[Ed.

This motion has been considered by the same learned judge who tried the cause, and his denial requires appellant to show strong grounds why we should grant him the extraordinary relief sought. The frauds of foreign ticket agents, who engage also in remitting money to relatives and friends in Europe, moved the Regislature to pass chapter 185 of the Raws of 1907 to require a bond to be approved by the state comptroller as a condition of engaging, in such business. And it was this bond which the defendant furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-15\">Gagliano, who was such a ticket banker, having received considerable sums of money in this way, absconded. This plaintiff testified that he had given $600 into his banking house, to be forwarded to him in Sicily, and that it was never repaid. The defendant put in no proof, did not ask to go to the jury on the issue of the deposit, and joined with plaintiff\u2019s counsel in asking that a verdict be directed. Gagliano, the absconding banker, now turns up, and he and his clerk, Ra Ducca (who never left New York), are now proffered by defendant as its newly found witnesses. They say they can give testimony to disprove receipt of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-16\">But it appears that, although the banker had clerks in his employ, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>defendant made no effort to call them, and was either then satisfied of the fact of this deposit, or else was negligent in its preparation, for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The denial of such an application has abundant support. An absconding banker may not yield to temptation on the instant. Accounts and receipts of his office might be left to conceal, rather than to record truly, his obligations. Hence evidence, based o.n the absence of records, or as to the serial number of his receipts, has not even that negative value which would always be weak as against the depositor\u2019s direct proof of having handed in the money over the counter.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">As a matter of discretion, where the .costs already are out of proportion to the recovery, a new trial should not be had, where it would recall plaintiff from Italy to give his testimony again. Indeed, if the present judgment be vacated, a new recovery might not restore the rights of the plaintiff, as proceedings may give such creditors against this banker but*a pro rata proportionate satisfaction out of the security-which defendant furnished. Finally, upon the showing by the moving affidavits, a trial before another jury would almost surely lead to the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">The order, therefore, should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
