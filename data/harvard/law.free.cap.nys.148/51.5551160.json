Bearing this in mind, it is equally clear that the only costs and disbursements that were to be paid were those which had accrued in the interval between the date of the original order of reversal and the resettlement thereof. These were taxable costs in the Court of Appeals before argument, and such disbursements in connection with such appeal as would be properly taxable, and which had been made up to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-13\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, the appeal from the taxation of costs sustained, and the motion granted to strike out all of the costs as taxed, except costs in the Court of Appeals before argument, and disbursements for printing the case in the Court of Appeals and printing the points.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
