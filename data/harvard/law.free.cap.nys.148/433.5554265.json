The facts are undisputed. The defendant was engaged in the lumber business, and whenever it had occasion to use a truck for the purpose of delivering lumber it sent word to one Durr, a liveryman, who thereupon sent the truck with horses and a driver. This is what had been on the day of the fatal accident. The truck itself belonged to defendant and bore its name upon it. The horses belonged to Durr, and the driver was selected, hired, and paid by him, and he alone had power to discharge him. All that defendant could have done, if for any reason it was dissatisfied with a driver furnished by Durr, was to send him back to his employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-16\">For the use of the horses and driver defendant paid Durr an agreed price per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">The trial justice submitted it to the jury to say in whose employ the driver was. This was error. Upon the undisputed facts the court should have held as matter of law that the driver was the servant of Durr. The case is not distinguishable from Kellogg v. Church Charity Foundation, 203 N. Y. 191, 96 N. E. 406, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 481, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Ann. Cas. 1913A, 883, and other similar cases of which there have been many. See Schmedes v. Deffaa, 153 App. Div. 819, 138 N. Y. Supp. 931.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">The judgment and order appealed from must be reversed, and the complaint dismissed, with costs to the defendant in all courts. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
