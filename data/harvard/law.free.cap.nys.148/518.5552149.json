The application for a reissue was made in July, 1913. In this application, appellant states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">\u201cI am now actually engaged in the business of master or employing plumber and have an office or place of business located at 775 Seventh avenue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">The application was refused on the ground that the appellant\u2019s statement that he was a master or employing plumber was false. In truth, at the time of the application, defendant was employed by the New York Railways Company at a salary and in a shop furnished by it, at the address stated in the application. No license is required by a journeyman, but only by one \u201cengaged in the business of master, or employing plumbers.\u201d People ex rel. Nechamcus v. Warden, etc., 144 N. Y. 529, 537, 39 N. E. 686, 27 L. R. A. 718. There is nothing in this record, however, which shows that at the time of his application appellant was a master plumber within the above definition or otherwise. If it had appeared that appellant was acting as master rather than a journeyman, that he exercised powers and duties of superintendence, or that he had journeymen plumbers working under his direction, I do not think the mere fact that he himself was working as an employ\u00e9 of another, rather than independently, would have affected his right to a certificate, but this record is barren of any such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">On this ground, the order should be affirmed, with $10 costs, and without prejudice to a new application on sufficient papers. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
