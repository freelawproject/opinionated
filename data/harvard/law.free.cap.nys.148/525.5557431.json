It went on to show that the executrix had paid legacies to the amount of $9,000 more than 20 years prior to commencement of this proceeding, \u201cand the remaining $249.95 was paid and applied by the said Elizabeth .T. Watson, as executrix, towards the legal expenses in probating the will.\u201d By decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court, dated February 17, 1890, the sum of $726.80 was charged against the estate on account of such legal expenses of probating said will. It also denies having any assets of the estate for more than 20 years prior to the institution of these proceedings. It also sets up the presumption of payment (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 376) by expiration of 20 years, and asserts that hence petitioner is not a creditor entitled to take these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">In connection with a plea of the six-year limitation to call the executors to account, the answer avers that the payments to the legatees (which were before the judgment) amounted to a repudiation of any alleged trust relation that may have existed between these executors and the petitioner\u2019s predecessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The reply urged that petitioner\u2019s status as a creditor had been judicially established as against the executors, who have not repudiated or renounced their stewardship herein; that the statutory presumption and limitation, also set up, never began to run as against the judgment creditor or his successor this petitioner herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">Upon a hearing upon these pleadings, the learned surrogate dismissed the petition, on the ground that by the lapse of 20 years the judgment is conclusively presumed to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-14\">Section 376 is :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-15\">\u201cA final judgment or decree for a sum of money, or directing the payment of a sum of money, heretofore rendered in a Surrogate\u2019s Court of the state, or heretofore or hereafter rendered, in a court of record within the United States, or elsewhere, or hereafter docketed * * * is presumed to be paid and satisfied, after the expiration of twenty years from the time, when the party recovering it was first entitled to a mandate to enforce it. This presumption is conclusive\u201d (except in case of part payment, or acknowledgment in writing).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>In the Revised Statutes this period by which a judgment should be presumed to be paid ran \u201cfrom the time of the signing and filing such j'.idgment or decree\u201d (part 3, c. 4, tit. 2, art. 5, \u00a7 47; 2 R. S. p. 301 [Ed. 1829]).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 376 (Throop\u2019s Code) first enacted this condition that the judgment creditor should be \u201centitled to a man-, date to enforce\u201d the judgment. This expression \u201cmandate to enforce\u201d is to be read with chapter 2 of the Code, which deals expressly with execution of civil mandates. This change from the Revised Statutes indicates: First. The period of limitation no longer runs from recovery and entry of judgment, as respondent contends. Second. The expression \u201centitled to a mandate to enforce\u201d the judgment refers to, and only to, an execution issued to a sheriff, or a like command to one in a ministerial office. In dealing with this section, this court, by Woodward, J., said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">\u201cA mandate * * * is a judicial command or precept issued by a court or magistrate directing the proper officer to enforce a judgment, sentence or decree.\u201d Seaman v. Clarke, 60 App. Div. 416, 421, 69 N. Y. Supp. 1002, 1005.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Hence there must not only be an order judicially given, but to be a mandate such order must go to an administrative officer, as a sheriff or coroner, who, under it, is to perform some act carrying out a decree or judgment. Hence the surrogate\u2019s citation or order to show cause (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2727) is not a \u201cmandate\u201d within section 376 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Therefore the words of the section are as if the text had been \u201ctwenty years from the time when the party recovering the judgment was first entitled to an execution or other decree or order to enforce it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The reform introduced by Mr. Throop was designed to limit the need for execution against executors. His report stated that he aimed to \u201crender the actual issuing of an execution unnecessary, in the great majority of cases. In general, there can be no necessity for such a step, unless the executor or administrator is perverse.\u201d Throop\u2019s Code, 1876, \u00a7 1826 note.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">The surrogate is to direct the administration, and by his order alone can an execution be issued against executors. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7\u00a7 1825, 1826. If granted, the execution may be only for the judgment creditor\u2019s proportionate part of all the assets (section 1826). In- this proceeding, the fact of nonpayment is admitted. The answer showing substantially no assets after February 17, 1890, has by that negative fact taken away any ground by which the judgment creditor would be entitled to have any execution, as such leave would be vain where there were no assets or property to be levied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-11\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The judgment against executors in their representative capacity differs from other judgments. It does little more than settle and liquidate the amount of the liability. The estate is still impounded by the law and remains under the direction and control of the surrogate. Willis v. Sharp, 115 N. Y. 396, 22 N. E. 149, 5 L. R. A. 636; Schmitz v. Langhaar, 88 N. Y. 503, 511, 512. Can one be said to be entitled to a mandate to enforce it, when the issue of the mandate rests in the discretion of the Surrogate\u2019s Court, and no ground to call for that ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>ercise of discretion appears, but instead the facts shown by the executors themselves present a sure ground to deny such leave for a useless form? Belfer v. Ludlow, 143 App. Div. 147, 149, 127 N. Y. Supp. 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\"><bracketnum>[4, 5]</bracketnum> The judgment creditor therefore was not prevented by Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 376, from awaiting the accounting of the executors and then asserting his judgment. The learned surrogate did not refer to the attempt to interpose the six-year statute of limitations as to this proceeding for an accounting by the executors. Recent decisions of the Court of Appeals are to the effect that, because of the fiduciary relation, the mere lapse of time should not debar the remedy of accounting. The. accounting is to be ordered, leaving such questions thereafter to be determined in the proceedings. In re Meyer, 98 App. Div. 7, 90 N. Y. Supp. 185; Id., 181 N. Y. 553, 74 N. E. 1120; Re Asheim, 111 App. Div. 176, 97 N. Y. Supp. 607; Id., 185 N. Y. 609, 78 N. E. 1099. Of course the averment that the executor has repudiated the trust is but a conclusion of law and cannot avail, without strict proof of such act by one holding a fiduciary relation, as does an executor toward a judgment creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">I recommend that the surrogate\u2019s decree be reversed, and the application for an accounting be granted, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
