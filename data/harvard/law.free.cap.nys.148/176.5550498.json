June 12, 1913, the New York Fire Insurance Exchange required the installation of certain floor valves, which requirement was covered by said agreement between plaintiff and defendant, and was part of the defendant\u2019s duty to install; that on or about October 18, 1913, defendant \u201cin order to wrongfully obtain from this plaintiff the sum of $395, and to injure and prejudice this plaintiff in the- completion of its contract with the owner of said building, * * * falsely, fraudulently, illegally, and with intent to oppress this plaintiff, threatened this plaintiff that unless it paid the said defendant $395, being the alleged value of said requirements of the New York Fire Insurance Exchange in said sprinkler system, within three days, that it, the said defendant, would issue a replevin suit and remove the sprinkler system from said premises, notwithstanding the fact that this plaintiff had paid almost the entire purchase price thereof, which threatened action on the part of this defendant would have caused this plaintiff irreparable injury and damage\u201d; that on or about January 16, 1914, plaintiff, under protest and solely by compulsion and under duress, and by reason of the aforesaid threats, was compelled to and did pay the said defendant the said sum of $395, which amount plaintiff now seeks to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The contention that the Municipal Court was without jurisdiction of such a cause of action is not well founded. Wilkenfeld v. Lynn, 55 Misc. Rep. 270-272, 105 N. Y. Supp. 71. Defendant appellant further urges that the complaint merely alleges a threat to resort to legal process or pursue a legal remedy, and therefore did not constitute duress, citing Dunham v. Griswold, 100 N. Y. 224, 226, 3 N. E. 76; Lilienthal v. Bechtel Brg. Co., 118 App. Div. 205, 207, 102 N. Y. Supp. 1051. While the mere threat to pursue a legal remedy to which one is entitled does not constitute duress, because duress must be a wrongful act, and to prosecute a valid claim is not wrongful, irrespective of motive (Martin v. New Rochelle Water Co., 11 App. Div. 177, 42 N. Y. Supp. 893, affirmed 162 N. Y. 599, 57 N. E. 1117; Lilienthal v. Bechtel Brg. Co. supra), the threat to pursue a legal remedy to which one is entitled, as alleged in the complaint herein, may amount to duress.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The complaint alleges that defendant threatened to prosecute an unfounded claim, and to wrongfully resort to legal process, for purposes of extortion. If the fact of extortion is established, and there has been added to it the further fact that the person upon whom the extortion is practiced was in such a necessitous condition that, to avoid a greater harm and damage, he was forced to submit to the extortion, then the element of consent will not be deemed to exist, and the contract will be avoided. Van Dyke v. Wood, 60 App. Div. 208, 215, 70 N. Y. Supp. 324; Harmony v. Bingham, 12 N. Y. 99, 62 Am. Dec. 142.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">\u201cIt has come to be the rule of law in this country * * * that, where one is presented with the contingency of serious loss or damage to his property or of a submission to an extortionate claim, if he pay the claim or make the contract which is extorted from him, it is not to be considered a voluntary act, and it may be set aside on the ground of duress.\u201d Van Dyke v. Wood, supra, 60 App. Div. page 213, 70 N. Y. Supp. page 327.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Whether there was duress, a state of mind in which the person who seeks to avoid his act was, by the act or conduct of another, deprived of the power of voluntary action or consent, is ordinarily a question of fact, and, where duly alleged, furnishes the basis of a good cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\">The defendant appellant relies mainly in its brief upon certain clauses stated by it to have been part of the contract between plaintiff and defendant; but the contract as set forth in the complaint contains no such provisions, and they cannot be considered in passing upon this demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The complaint alleges a good cause of action to recover moneys paid under duress by plaintiff to defendant; said duress being a threat, made for purposes of extortion, to illegally and' fraudulently use a process of court in the prosecution of an unfounded claim, with the avowed intent of destroying and removing property belonging to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Interlocutory judgment affirmed, with leave to defendant to withdraw demurrer and answer within five days, upon payment of costs in this court and in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">PENDLETON, J., concurs.
