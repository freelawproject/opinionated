The case comes within the principles involved in Port Jervis Water Co. v. Village of Port Jervis, 151 N. Y. 111, 45 N. E. 388), and there appears no good reason why the claim should not be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
