It is not merely a presumption arising from the fact that this rock remained unsupported while it was being loosened as the blasts continued, but because of actual warnings and notifications by the men who worked there, confirmed by the city engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The matter of contributory negligence was submitted to the jury. The testimony raised an issue whether scaling was any part of plaintiff\u2019s duty. Against this verdict we cannot hold that plaintiff was negligent in going oh with the work. Neither did he assume the risk, where the danger had been discoverable and was actually made known to the employer prior to such injuries. Labor Law, \u00a7 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The exhibition of the crippled child to the jury is assigned as reversible error. The diversity in decisions admitting testimony as to family circumstances is pointed out in Sedgwick on Damages (9th Ed.) \u00a7 580. Lockwood v. N. Y., Lake Erie &amp; Western R. R. Co., 98 N. Y. 523, makes it competent to have the number and ages of dependent children stated, and probably their conditions, including physical defects. But to keep before the jury the crippled body of a seven year old child is different. A witness could without difficulty describe the helpless state of such a defective child. If it was ground to reverse because a jury had shown to it a picture of a deceased wife (Smith v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., 177 N. Y. 379, 69 N. E. 729), the exhibition of this afflicted boy, mute, helpless, and deformed, which the jury were allowed to keep in view, was bound to move their feelings, or at least surround them with \u201can atmosphere freighted with sympathy\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>(Houghkirk v. President, etc., D. &amp; H. C. Co., 92 N. Y. 219, 225, 44 Am. Rep. 370. See, also, Schwanzer v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 18 App. Div. 205, 45 N. Y. Supp. 889; Harrison v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 195 N. Y. 86, 87 N. E. 802).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Considering this influence, which is reflected in the verdict, the recovery of $16,000 should be reduced. The earnings of $4.50 a day are not shown' to be continuous, Other testimony as to heading foremen show occasional lay-offs and other interruptions in their employment. A fair and just compensation should not exceed $12,000. Hoffman v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 42 Misc. Rep. 579, 87 N. Y. Supp. 617; Stevens v. Union Railway Co., 75 App. Div. 602, 78 N. Y. Supp. 624; Conrad v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 137 App. Div. 372, 121 N. Y. Supp. 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and new trial granted, costs to abide the event, unless within 20 days plaintiff stipulate to reduce the recovery to $12,000, with interest from March 6, 1913, in which event the judgment, as so modified, and order, are affirmed, without costs. _</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
