The defendant Carlton is a creditor of the corporation and received from Mr. A. M. Kennedy, who had the general management of the company\u2019s business in the city of New York, negatives from which Carlton was to furnish positives to the Kennedy Features, Incorporated, whose business was the furnishing of films to moving picture enterprises.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>The negatives were given to Carlton under an agreement which provided that if the Kennedy Features, Incorporated, were in arrears for the period of <em>7 </em>days, Carlton might sell-the negatives for the purpose of realizing the indebtedness of the Kennedy Features, Incorporated, to him. The contract provided that the sale might be made on 24 hours\u2019 written notice, and that Carlton might sell or otherwise realize upon'all property or properties of the Kennedy Features, Incorporated, then in Carlton\u2019s possession for the payment of moneys that might be due to him, and that this sale might be without process of law and without recourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">On April 15, 1914, the Kennedy Features, Incorporated, being then indebted to Carlton, he served a notice upon them, and after some time sold the property, at private sale, to the defendant Harry F. McGarvis. The bona fides of this sale is strenuously attacked by plaintiff, and it certainly does not appear to be above suspicion. However that may be, the pretended sale by Carlton was clearly unauthorized by the terms of the contract. The agreement was that a sale might be made \u201cupon twenty-four hours\u2019 written notice,\u201d meaning obviously notice of the time, place, and manner of sale. The notice which was given was not at all such a notice. It notified the Kennedy Features, Incorporated, that it had violated the contract by failing to make payments in accordance therewith. It then contained this sentence: \u201cSaid James L. Carlton now has the right to proceed as provided in article No. 6.\u201d Here was no notification of an intention to sell, or of the time, place, and manner in which it was proposed to make a sale. It was a mere assertion of Carlton\u2019s right to sell if he elected to do so. Obviously this was not such a notice as was contemplated by the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to continue the injunction pendente lite granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
