The latter pleading, as remarked by the justice at Special Term, is \u201cunnecessarily discoursive,\u201d being in effect an expansion by immaterial allegations of a former complaint which had been held defective on demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"AKa\">In brief, the plaintiff alleges that she was authorized by the King of Spain to procure a purchaser for certain tapestries, being promised a commission if she succeeded. She strove to- interest a possible purchaser by whom she was referred to defendants, who, as it was said, would examine and appraise the articles. She saw defendants and gave them such information and introductions as were necessary to enable them to gain access to the tapestries. She says that it was agreed that in case the defendants should purchase the said tapestries either for themselves or for a customer, \u201ceither directly or through any other person or persons,\u201d they would notify her as to the circumstances of the sale, and would take no action in the premises which would in any way prejudice her right to obtain a commission. She complains that defendants thereafter purchased the tapestries \u201cthrough some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>person or persons unknown to plaintiff,\u201d but this they clearly had the right to do under their agreement with plaintiff as alleged by her.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Without attempting to quote from or paraphrase this very verbose complaint, it is sufficient to say that plaintiff fails to allege any wrongful act or omission on the part of defendants which would appear to stand in the way of collecting her commission from the King of Spain, nor is it alleged that he has ever refused to pay her a commission. She may not recover as for money had and received, for it is not alleged that defendants acted as her agent in effecting the purchase, or that they had agreed to purchase only through her, or had agreed to pay her any part of the profit or commission, if any, that they realized upon the transaction. All they did was to purchase the tapestries, and this, by her own allegation, was precisely what it was contemplated they would do. We are unable to spell out of the complaint any cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The orders appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements as to each. Defendants\u2019 motion for judgment must be granted, with $10 costs, and plaintiff\u2019s motion denied, with $10 costs, with leave to plaintiff upon payment of the aforesaid costs to serve an amended complaint within 20 days. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
