A large number of defendants are named, most of them presumably tenants of the property; but the present motion is directed only against the defendant Rodel, said to be a junior mortgagee, who has interposed \u25a0 an answer, although no personal judgment is asked against him. He does not deny the mortgage, nor the fact that default has been made in the payment of the principal according to the terms of the mortgage. He denies, for lack of knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief, certain allegations which, as to him at least, are immaterial, and undertakes to deny, although rather awkwardly, the allegation as to the nonpayment of interest. This, however, is not material, because the nonpayment of the principal is sufficient to warrant a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-19\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> By a separate defense defendant attempts to set up, also on information and belief, an agreement by the plaintiff or its assignors to extend the time of payment of the mortgage. This allegation, however, is defective and ineffectual because it does not say with whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>the agreement was made, or show that, if such an agreement was made, respondent is entitled to avail himself of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\">The order appealed from must therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs, with leave to respondent to amend his answer within 20 days upon payment of all costs of the action. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
