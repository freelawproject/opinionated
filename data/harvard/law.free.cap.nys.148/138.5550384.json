There is no doubt that plaintiff brought to the attention of the purchaser the property in question, though there is some doubt whether, under the circumstances, it may be held that he was employed by the defendants or their representative. After he had shown the church to a committee of the institution which subsequently purchased the property, plaintiff had an interview with one of defendants\u2019 representatives. At that time defendants had reduced the price from $70,000 to $65,000. Plaintiff said that his people had only $3,000 in cash, but would try to get a necessary Iban. Plaintiff also t\u00e9sti\u00f1ed that he informed defendants\u2019 representative that he had to go away to the country for some time. This was on or about April 15, 1913. He testified, further, that defendants\u2019 representative then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-20\">\u201cAll right. I want to see the people Wednesday morning. They will sell the church, and everything will be all right. You show to me the people. Leave that thing to me, and I will settle. * * * For your work you will have your pay as soon as the people have finished the business. Leave it to me, and I will see to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Had the negotiations continued and been successfully concluded as a result of or in furtherance of this interview, plaintiff might seriously claim that he had performed all that was required of him, and that he was the procuring cause of the sale, so far, at least, as that further services from him had been expressly excused by defendants; but the record shows that nothing further transpired, that at the end of May defendants advertised the church for sale extensively, that thereupon, several months later, another broker brought the parties together, and the sale was consummated for $61,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Defendants\u2019 testimony to the effect that they paid this other broker the commission was improperly excluded, but that point is not now determinative. Under the circumstances, it seems to me plain that plaintiff cannot recover as broker, because he did not show that he was the procuring cause of the transaction. At the time when the alleged conversation with defendants\u2019 representative took place, the negotiations were in a very embryonic state. The statement alleged by him to have been made by defendants\u2019 representative might have excused plaintiff\u2019s further attention to the negotiations, provided the negotiations had continued and been brought to a successful conclusion, even though the terms had been somewhat modified. They were not so continued, but completely interrupted and broken off, and the sale ultimately concluded was a new transaction. See Parkhurst v. Tryon, 134 App. Div. 843, 119 N. Y. Supp. 184, Sampson v. Ottinger, 93 App. Div. 226, 87 N. Y. Supp. 796, and Mutchnik v. Davis, 130 App. Div. 417, 114 N. Y. Supp. 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
