Corporate titles. </em>Every corporation incorporated or qualified under this Chapter shall be known as an Industrial Loan and Thrift Company, and may use the words \u2018Industrial Loan and Thrift Company\u2019 or any part thereof as part of its corporate title. It shall be unlawful for any company organized after July 1, 1968, and qualified under the provisions of this Chapter to use as a part of its company title the words \u2018savings and loan\u2019. <em>Each company </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number><em>organised prior to July 1, 1968, and using such ivords as a. part of its company title, as a condition precedent to its registration or re-registration under Tennessee Code Annotated, 45-2011, shall agree to\\ include with each -lose of its company title, in advertising the issuance or sale of certificates of investment or indebtedness, in lettering at least tivo-thirds the sise of the lettering in its title and directly beneath the title so as to be plainly visible, the following addendum: \u2018 (not federally insured)\u2019.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-3\">\u201cBE IT FURTHER ENACTED, That this Act take effect from and after its passage, the public welfare requiring it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The effect of the enactment of Chapter 275 was to add to Section 45-2006 the last sentence which for convenience we have italicized. The complainants averred that they had been incorporated in 1964 and 1965, respectively, under tire provisions of the Industrial Loan and Thrift Act (Chapter 20 of Title 45, T.C.A.); that each had expended large sums in advertising and promoting goodwill for their corporate names including the words, \u201csavings and loan\u201d, and that they had acquired valuable property rights in their names and that the effect of Chapter 275 would be to deprive them of such rights without due process of law consistent with Article XI, see. 8, of the Constitution of Tennessee and with the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The complainants prayed for a temporary injunction prohibiting the defendant Commissioner from enforcing the Act against them pending the further orders of the court and that upon the hearing the complainants have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>a declaratory decree declaring the Act \u201cunconstitutional, void and of no effect insofar as it purports to deprive the complainants of the right to continue their business under their lawful corporate names after July 1, 1969, without adding negative words relating to insurance,\u201d and that upon the hearing the temporary injunction be made permanent.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Both defendants answered the bill by which they asserted the validity of the statute and by leave of the court the Tennessee Savings and Loan League, Inc., intervened and filed an answer by which they too contended for the validity of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">After the hearing, which was upon oral testimony, the Chancellor decreed that Chapter 275 was not violative of either the Constitution of Tennessee or the Constitution of the United States and dismissed complainants\u2019 bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">From the Chancellor\u2019s decree the complainants have appealed and have filed eight assignments of error, which we will consider in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">(1) The appellants\u2019 first assignment is that the Chancellor erred in not holding that the statute, as it affects them, is void because the Commissioner refused the appellants\u2019 request to give them \u201cguidelines\u201d. The appellants have cited no authority in support of this assignment, and since Chapter 275 does not require that the Commissioner construe it as a condition to its becoming effective, we overrule this assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">(2) By their second assignment the appellants insist that the Chancellor erred in failing to declare the statute void because its subject is not expressed in its caption and because its body is broader than its caption. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>In <em>Industrial Development Board of County of Sevier v. First United States Corp., </em>219 Tenn. 156, 407 S.W.2d 457, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-3\">\u201cThe caption of the amendatory act meets the requirements of captions under settled decisions of Tennessee. Our courts have held that in captions of amendatory laws, <em>a </em>reference to the law to be amended by its section number of the Code wherein codified is sufficient compliance with Article II, Section 17, of the Constitution. <em>Gamble v. State, </em>159 Tenn. 446, 19 S.W.2d 279; <em>Basham v. Southeastern Motor Truck Lines, </em>184 Tenn. 532, 201 S.W.2d 678; <em>Pharr v. Nashville C. </em>&amp; <em>St. L. Ry. Co., </em>186 Tenn. 154, 208 S.W.2d 1013. The caption of the amendatory act in question refers to a section of the official annotated code of Tennessee to be amended and therefore meets all of the requirements of Article II, Section 17, under well-settled authorities hereinbefore cited.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">This holding- is our authority for overruling- the second assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">(3) The third assignment is that the Chancellor \u201cerred in failing to hold that the complainants have vested property rights in their corporate names and the goodwill promoted thereunder. \u2019 \u2019 It must be noticed that the statute does not deny the complainants the right to use their corporate names but provides, rather, that when they use their names in their advertisements they must add the words \u201cnot federally insured\u201d. The Court takes judicial knowledge of the fact that throughout the State there are many Federal Savings and Loan Associations which are federally insured, and we hold that it is not an unreasonable exercise of the police power for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>General Assembly to enact legislation which will distinguish corporations organized under the Loan and Thrift Act from corporations having similar names and which are insured by an agency of the Federal Government. In <em>Ford Motor Company v. Pace, </em>206 Tenn. 559, 335 S.W.2d 360, the Court said: \u201cLegislative power is not static and helpless but arises to adjust and face new conditions as they appear to affect the people of the State. Of course, the Legislature of the State cannot prohibit an ordinary business but it may, however, regulate the business to promote the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public.\u201d We overrule the third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">(4) By their fourth assignment the appellants insist that the Chancellor committed error in failing to hold that the \u201ccomplainants have a vested contract right to the perpetual use of their corporate names in their businesses.\u201d The statute does not prohibit the use by the complainants of their corporate names but regulates the use of the names of companies chartered under the Loan and Thrift Act, when such names include the words, \u201csavings and loan\u201d, in their advertising. For the reason that we overruled the third assignment we overrule this <em>one.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The appellants insist that by granting them charters that included the words \u201csavings and loan\u201d in their corporate names the State made a contract with them which the enforcement of Chapter 275 would violate. With this contention we do not agree. We direct attention to sec. 48-713, T.C.A., which was in effect when the State granted the complainants a Charter and which provides, \u201cNothing in this Chapter, or implied from any of its provisions, shall affect, alter or modify the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>police and taxing power of the legislature, or the right of the legislature to repeal, annul, modify or amend all charters granted hereunder. In <em>Liles v. Creveling, </em>151 Tenn. 61, 268 S.W. 625, this Court held that \u201cA contract cannot be interposed to defeat the exercise of the police power, neither can prescription.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-3\">(5) By the fifth assignment the appellants contend that the Chancellor erred in refusing to declare the Act invalid \u201cinsofar as it attached a prohibitive condition to the continued exercise of its right to use and advertise its lawful business in its corporate name.\u201d For the reason we overruled the appellants\u2019 fourth assignment we overrule this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">(6) The sixth assignment is that the Chancellor erred in his failure to declare the Act \u201cinvalid as an attempt to grant a selected group an exclusive copyright in the commercial use of the words, \u2018savings and loan,\u2019 contrary to general federal and state law on copyrights and trade names.\u201d The appellants are mistaken in their construction of the statute as one granting a copyright. The appellants themselves are not prohibited the use of the phrase in their corporate titles, but we have previously said in this opinion the General Assembly was within the authority of its police power to regulate the use of the phrase \u201csavings and loan\u201d in advertisements by appellants and other Industrial Loan and Thrift companies having the phrase in their corporate titles.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">(7) By their seventh assignment the appellants contend that the Chancellor should have declared the statute void on the ground that it is vicious class legislation and not a general law and that he was in error in failing to do so. As we have observed heretofore we do not regard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the Act as vicious class legislation or a denial of the complainants\u2019 rights to the equal protection of the laws. In <em>Motlow v. State, </em>125 Tenn. 547, 145 S.W. 177, L.R.A. 1916F, 177, this Court citing as authority <em>Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., </em>220 U.S. 61, 31 S.Ct. 337, 55 L.Ed. 369, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">\u201c(1) The equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment does not take from the state the power to classify in the adoption of police laws, but admits of the exercise of a wide scope of discretion in that regard, and avoids what is done only when it is without any reasonable basis, and therefore is purely arbitrary. (2) A classification having some reasonable basis does not offend against that clause merely because it is not made with mathematical nicety, or because in practice it results in some inequality. (3) When the classification in such a law is called in question, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it, the existence of that state of facts at the time the law was enacted must be assumed. (4) One who assails the classification in such a law must carry the burden of showing that it does not rest upon any reasonable basis, but is essentially arbitrary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">We overrule the seventh assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">(8) The eighth assignment is that the Chancellor erred in failing to declare the Act void for vagueness. The Act is not vague. Its meaning is entirely clear and we accordingly overrule this assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Having disposed of appellants\u2019 eight assignments of error and having overruled all of them, we affirm the Chancellor\u2019s decree at the cost of the appellants.</p>\n<judges id=\"b323-5\">Dyer, Chief Justice, and Chattih, Cresost, and Hum-phreys, Justices, concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b323-6\">MeCak-less, Justice, not participating.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
