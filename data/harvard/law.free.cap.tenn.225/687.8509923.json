The father of one of the parties, Arthur Roback, had for a number of years rented a small lot of land near the TVA &amp; I Fair held yearly in Knoxville, Tennessee, for the purpose of parking automobiles for those attending the fair and for which lie received a fee of $2.00 per car. This business was operated generally in September of each year for a period of eight days. In September, 1968, the father was ill and his son, Arthur Roback, obtained a leave from his usual employment to take over this parking operation for his father. Arthur Roback was in full charge of this parking during this eight days in September, 1968, working thirteen to sixteen hours a day, parking and moving automobiles and collecting these fees. These fees, less expenses, were turned over by Arthur Roback to his father. The automobiles were parked on this lot in such a manner as to often necessitate the moving of one of the automobiles by Arthur Roback in order that another automobile could be driven off the lot. To accomplish this it was necessary that those parking* on this lot leave the keys in their automobiles.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">On a day in September, 1968, while Roback was operating this parking lot, Steve Brantley drove his 1960 Chevrolet on this lot, paying his fee to park, and at the request of Roback left his keys in the automobile. During the time this 1960 Chevrolet was on this lot Roback found it necessary to move it in order for another automobile parked on the lot to get out. In moving the 1960 Chevrolet, Roback drove it out into the street and was in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>volved in a collision with an automobile driven by-Anthony Martinez, resulting- in personal injuries to Anthony Martinez and Anna Martinez, a passenger at the time in the Martinez automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\">As a result of this accident Anthony Martinez and Anna Martinez brought suit for personal injuries in the Circuit Court for Knox County against Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company, Arthur Eoback, and Edith Brantley, the titled owner of the 1960 Chevrolet. Upon demand, the Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company and The Home Insurance Company refused to provide any coverage under their policies issued to Edith Brantley and Arthur Eoback.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Upon this refusal by Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company and The Home Insurance Company, Aetna and Eoback filed the suit now before the Court- against Anthony Martinez, Anna Martinez, Edith Brantley, Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company and The Home Insurance Company seeking to have the court declare Eoback was insured (1) under the non-owned automobile provision in the policy issued to Eoback by The Home Insurance Company, and (2) as a permittee under Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company\u2019s policy issued to' Edith Brantley.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The insurance coverage afforded the parties involved is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">Eoback, as named insured, had coverage for public liability under a policy issued by The Home Insurance Company covering the use of a non-owned automobile, except where maintained or used by the insured when \u201cemployed or otherwise engaged in the automobile busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>ness. \u2019 \u2019 This policy defined automobile business as, among other things, the \u201cstoring or parking automobiles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Edith Brantley was the title owner of the 1960 Chevrolet and had a public liability policy on this automobile issued by Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company. Steve Brantley was the eighteen-year-old son of Edith Brantley and Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company had knowledge Steve was to operate and use this automobile, having general unrestricted use thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company policy provided coverage to Edith Brantley as named insured and to \u201c(3) any other person using the automobile with the permission of the named insured provided his actual operation or (if he is not operating) his aetual use thereof is within the scope of such permission . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company policy provided this insurance would not apply under,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-8\">(c) coverages A (Bodily Injury Liability) and B (Property Damage Liability), except as to the named insured, to the automobile while used in an automobile business, except coverages A and B shall apply, as excess insurance over any other collectible insurance, to a resident of the same household as the named insured, to a partnership in which such resident or the named insured is a partner, or to any partner, agent or employee of the named insured, such resident or partnership; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">As in The Home Insurance Company policy the Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company policy de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>fined \u201cautomobile business\u201d as, among other things, the \u2018 \u2018 storing or parking automobiles. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">The Martinez automobile was covered by a public liability policy issued by Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company which, among other things, contained an uninsured motorist provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The first issue for determination is whether Roback was operating the 1960 Chevrolet, at the time of the collision, while engaged in the \u201cautomobile business\u201d within the meaning of this exclusion as contained in both The Home Insurance Company and Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company policies. On this issue the trial court and the Court of Appeals found in the affirmative, and we agree. The Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">Without question in our mind, Arthur Roback\u2019s access to the Brantley automobile and the necessity for him to drive the Brantley automobile arose out of and was a part of the business of \u201cparking automobiles,\u201d which under the policy definitions of \u201cautomobile business\u201d brings into play the policy exclusions set out above, .... The fact that Roback operated the parking lot for only 8-days a year and then only to assist his father is not sufficient to take him from under the policy exclusions. The key to coverage is the nature of the use of the automobile by Roback at the time of the accident. As pointed out by the court in <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Hoffman, </em>21 Ill.App. [2d 314] 214, 158 N.E.2d 428, 430, \u201cit is not uncommon for an insured to have a business in addition to his regular and customary occupation which he may pursue primarily or even wholly for purposes other than pecuniary gain; but such collateral business would nonetheless 'constitute a business or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>occupation while so pursued.\u201d See also <em>Seaford v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., </em>253 N.C. 719, 117 S.E.2d 733 and <em>Voelker v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>(CA 7 Ill.) 260 Fed. [2d] 275.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Upon holding Roback at the time of the collision was engaged in the \u2018\u00a3 automobile business \u2019 \u2019 the Court of Appeals, as to The Home Insurance Company policy, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">The policy issued Roback by Home Insurance Company is an \u201cowner\u2019s\u201d policy and provides the coverage required by the Financial Responsibility Act for such a policy. T.C.A. 59-1223 (b) (2). The limitation placed on coverage of the insured under the policy was limited to the use or maintenance of a non-owned automobile by the insured while the insured \u201cis employed or otherwise engaged in the automobile business. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">This court has held that such an exclusion is reasonable in view of the increased hazard growing out of the use of non-owned automobiles by a person operating a parking lot or a parking garage. <em>Pollard v. Safeco Insurance Company, </em>52 Tenn.App. 583, 376 S.W.2d 730.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-8\">\u201cExclusionary clauses like the one here involved have been held reasonable because of the increased hazard growing out of the use of non-owned cars by such establishments while in their legal custody. Anno. 47 A.L.R.(2d) 556. They have been frequently applied under circumstances not unlike those presented in this case. Anno. 47 A.L.R.(2d) 558 et seq.; Insurance Law and Practice, Appelman, Vol. 7, Section 4372; 5A Am. Jur. 103, Automobile Insurance, Section 102. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">\u2018 \u2018 <em>* </em>* * It would be grossly unfair to the insurer to hold that an insured engaged in the automobile business could take out a policy on his privately owned and op<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>erated car and then on the basis of the same small premium claim protection for any and all un-owned automobiles used in such business. Policies of that nature providing general coverage for such business carry a much higher premium rate. \u2019 \u2019 <em>Pollard v. Safeco Insurance Company, </em>supra, at pages 587 and 593. [376 S.W.2d 730]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">As to the Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company policy the Court of Appeals found under the facts of this case Roback had actual permission of Steve Brantley to drive the 1960 Chevrolet for the limited purpose of moving it to permit passage of other automobiles on the parking lot and had implied permission of the named insured, Edith Brantley, to drive this automobile for that purpose. The Court of Appeals then noted this policy made no attempt to limit the class of permittees, but did undertake through the exclusion (copied above) to limit the scope of coverage afforded a permittee and to give the permittee less coverage than was given the named insured. The Court of Appeals, apparently with great reluctance, felt this exclusion as to the scope of coverage afforded a permittee was void under our opinion in <em>Commercial Union Insurance Co. v. Universal Underwriters Insurance Company, </em>223 Tenn. 80, 442 S.W.2d 614 (1969), and that the Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company policy afforded coverage to Roback.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The holding in <em>Commercial Union Insurance Co. v. Universal Underwriters Insurance Company, </em>supra, which the Court of Appeals felt compelled the result it reached as to the Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company policy is to this effect: That this policy had been approved and Avas on file with the Department of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>Insurance and Banking of the State of Tennessee, the result being our financial responsibility statutes, particularly T.C.A. sec. 59-1223 (b) (2) must be read into and considered a part of the policy. This exclusionary clause being in conflict with this statute, such was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The Court of Appeals opinion was prepared and filed prior to release of our opinion in <em>McManus v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., </em>225 Tenn. 106, 463 S.W.2d 702 (1971). In McManus we expressly overruled the holding in <em>Commercial Union Insurance Co. v. Universal Underwriters Insurance Company, </em>supra, relied upon by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\"> Under this record neither The Home Insurance Company nor the Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company policies were certified policies within the meaning of our Financial Responsibility Statute, T.C.A. secs. 59-1201 to 59-1240, and this Chapter is not applicable in the decision of this case. The question here then is whether this exclusion in the Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company policy as to use of the automobile in the \u201cautomobile business\u201d relieves Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company from any liability to afford coverage to Roback. To remove a problem we should note in this declaratory judgment suit no issue is made as to coverage afforded the named insured under the Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">The language of this exclusion in the Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company policy is not ambiguous. When the insured automobile is used in the \u201cautomobile business\u201d the named insured is covered and as to a certain group of persons identified in the exclusion the scope of coverage is reduced. As to all others, the group into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>which Eoback falls, there is no coverage. This exclusion is reasonable for the same or similar reasons and under the authority cited above in this opinion holding the exclusion in The Home Insurance Company policy valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">It is insisted The Home Insurance Company is estopped to deny coverage to Eoback because of its failure to respond to a notification from the Financial Eesponsibility Division of the Department of Safety that Eoback had filed an SE-21 form stating he had automobile liability coverage under the policy issued by Home. On this issue the Court of Appeals, with which we agree, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">The majority of the courts which have dealt with this question have held that the act of an insurance company in filing an SE-21 form, or in some other manner confirming insurance coverage of an accident, does not estop the company from thereafter disclaiming coverage where none exists under the policy. <em>Seaford v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., </em>253 N.C. 719, 117 S.E.2d 733; <em>State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Hubbard, </em>(272 Ala. 181), 129 So.2d 669; <em>Fidelity and Casualty Co. of New York v. McConnaughby, </em>[McConnaughy] 228 Md. 1, 179 A.2d 117; <em>Marley v. Lewis, </em>(189 Kan. 658), 369 P.2d 783; <em>Insurance Company of North America v. Atlanta </em>[Atlantic] <em>National Insurance Co., </em>329 F.2d 769 (4th Cir. Va.) See also: <em>Kurz v. Collins, </em>6 Wis.2d 538, 95 N.W.2d 365. 7 Am.Jur.2d, Automobile Insurance, Section 7, p. 299.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">As succinctly pointed out in <em>Seaford v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, </em>supra, [117 S.E.2d] at page 737,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>\u201cThe purpose of the SR-21 form . . . seems to he a means of protecting one\u2019s driving privilege by proving insurance in the minimum amount required by this State, and was not intended to be a contract. The required filing of the SR-21 form does not show intent on the part of the Legislature that once the insurer files the form showing that the policy is in effect, such act affects the contractual rights of the parties, or precludes the insurance company from thereafter seeking to deny its liability under the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff contends that the filing of the SR-21 form should have the effect of estopping the insurer from later denying coverage under the policy, and cites a Wisconsin case, <em>Behringer v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., </em>275 Wis. 586, 82 N.W.2d 915, in support of his contention. As a result of the holding in the Behringer case, supra, the laws of Wisconsin were amended so as to change the holding of that case. Indeed, since the law has been changed in Wisconsin the Supreme Court of that state has allowed the insurance company to raise a defense subsequent to the filing of the SR-21 form. <em>Kurz v. Collins, </em>6 Wis.2d 538, 95 N.W. 2d 365.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">\u2018 \u2018 The better rule seems to be that by the mere filing of an SR-21 form as required by the law of this State, the insurer is not estopped to later deny coverage under the policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">It results, and we so hold, that Tennessee Farmers Mutual Insurance Company and The Home Insurance Company are relieved of any liability arising out of the suit in the Circuit Court wherein Anthony Martinez and Anna. Martinez, as plaintiffs, are attempting to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>damages from the defendants therein, Aetna Casualty and Surety Company, Arthur Boback and Edith Brant-ley.</p>\n<judges id=\"b717-3\">CresoN, Humphreys and McCanless, Justices, and Jenkins, Special Justice, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
