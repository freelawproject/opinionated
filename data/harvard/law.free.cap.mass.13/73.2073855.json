The tenant also claimed title to the demanded premises by-force of the levy of his execution against said <em>Folsom, </em>* issued upon a judgment recovered by him at the same court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-12\">The following facts were in proof at the trial. The extent of all the said executions was regularly made, and within thirty days after the respective judgments were rendered ; the demanded premises having been attached upon mesne process in each case. The attachments on the demandants\u2019 original suits were made half an hour <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>before the tenant\u2019s attachment; and must be deemed to have priority, unless' the subsequent service on the writs of the demandants destroyed their attachments, or gave priority to that of the tenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AtJ\">On the 31st of October, 1814, the demandants sued out their said two writs, and caused directions to be put on the back of each of them as follows ; \u2014 \u201c Mr. Officer, you are directed to attach sufficient \u2014 per order.\u201d\u2014The writs were then delivered to <em>L. Baldwin, </em>a deputy, sheriff of this county, who attached the demanded premises, and the goods in the store of the said <em>Folsom fy </em>Rogerson, and made a minute as follows, on the back of each writ;\u2014\u201c Oct. 31st, half past 7, A. M., attached in store,\u201445 m. past 7, attached house in Charles street. <em>L. </em>B.\u201d\u2014In this situation the writs were sent to one <em>S. </em>Blaney, a deputy sheriff of <em>Norfolk </em>county, without any particular directions, as he testified, what kind of service to make. Finding no property, he arrested <em>Folsom, </em>and returned, on both the writs, that, Oct. 31st, 1814, at <em>12 </em>o\u2019clock at noon, he arrested the body of said Folsom, and held him to bail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-6\">When the demandants\u2019 attorney learned what service <em>Blaney </em>had made, he immediately informed him that the service was contrary to their wishes, as the object was to get property ; and he directed <em>Blaney </em>to go and tender the bail bonds to <em>Folsom, </em>which he accordingly did ; but <em>Folsom </em>declined receiving them after summonses were given to him and <em>Rogerson </em>by <em>Baldwin, </em>who made his return accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-7\">At the term of the court at which the said writs were * returnable, the bail of <em>Folsom </em>surrendered him on the demandants\u2019 two writs, and he was within the limits of the jail-yard about a fortnight, when he was discharged by the demand-ants\u2019 attorney, previously to the levy of their executions. The demandants did not order the arrest of <em>Folsom </em>; but, after it was done, did every thing in their power to vacate or destroy the effect of that service ; and showed a constant intention to rely solely on their attachment of property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-8\">If, on these facts, the Court should be of opinion, that the demand-ants\u2019 attachment of <em>Folsom's </em>property was rendered - void by the arrest of his person, and taking bail ; or that it gave a prior right to the tenant\u2019s subsequent attachment of the same property, then the verdict returned for the demandants was to be set aside, and a general verdict entered for the tenant; otherwise, the verdict was to stand, and judgment be rendered accordingly.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-9\"><em>Peabody, </em>for the tenant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAt\">argued, that the arrest of the defendant, after the attachment of bis estate, and before the service of the writ was completed by a delivery of a summons, avoided the attachment. The writ could not be used both as a <em>capias </em>and as a writ of attachment. The service being incomplete at the time of the arrest, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>previous attachment was waived thereby ; which being of itself a .complete service, the leaving of the summons was of no effect, but a mere nullity, and so the service by attachment was never completed. The intentions and wishes of the plaintiffs could have no operation to alter the legal effect of their actions. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b66-5\">Dutton, for the demandants.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b66-12\"> <em>Watson &amp; al. </em>vs. <em>Todd &amp; al., </em>5 <em>Mass. Rep. 273.\u2014Bond </em>vs. <em>Ward, </em>7 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>123. \u2014 <em>Brinley </em>vs. Allen, 3 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>561.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b66-6\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Acy\">The objections, made to the title of the demandants, rest upon a mistaken opinion of the effect of the original attachment made by the demandants. We must consider that attachment as made at the time the return bears date ; although a memorandum only was then made of it. The arrest, subsequently made by the officer of the county of Norfolk, was void, because an attachment of property had been previously made. The service of the summons was <em>* </em>necessary to complete the attachment; but that service, being afterwards seasonably made, had relation to the time of the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">We cannot admit, that a creditor, having obtained security for his debt by an attachment of property, can be defeated of this security by a subsequent service of the same writ, in a manner which he did not direct. The direction upon the writ was sufficient to notify the officer that an arrest was not desired. The common direction is, to attach sufficient property <em>or </em>hold to bail. The alternative being withholden, in this case, it was not easy for the officer to mistake the creditor\u2019s intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">If the debtor has been injured by the arrest, be has his remedy by an action of trespass ; but there is no reason why an attachment, seasonably made by one creditor, should be avoided by another, by any thing done subsequently to the attachment, without the direction or consent of the attaching creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">The circumstances reported in the case, which go strongly to show a collusion between the second attaching creditor and the debtor, in order to supersede the first attachment, will be important, in case the debtor should sue for damages for the unlawful arrest of his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">\n<em>Judgment according to the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
