In the latter the promise is alleged to have been made by the intestate ; and the replication avers a promise by the defendant. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> If the plaintiffs intended to rely on the promise of the administratrix, they should have declared upon it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>But an administratrix cannot, by her own promise, take the case out of the statute of 'limitations ; <footnotemark><em>(2)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which was enacted as well for the safety and benefit of the heirs as of administrators.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-5\">Hopkins, for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AST\">contended, that his replication was no departure from the declaration ; and he cited and relied on the authorities in the margin. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-6\">The merits of the replication rest upon the construction to be given to the statute of 1791. The words of this statute are not stronger than those of the general statute of limitations ; and as to these, the construction has been such as to let in the slightest acknowledgment, without any promise. An acknowledgment, even pending the suit, * will take a case out of the general statute. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> The provision of the general statute is founded on a presumption of payment; that of the statute of 1791, upon the supposition that executors and administrators will be improperly vexed by suits, if the creditor lies by without making any demand for four years. When the presumption is removed in either case, the statute is not intended to operate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b166-7\">An administrator represents the person of his intestate ; and may renew a promise made by the deceased, to which the statute might have been pleaded. <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b165-12\"> 1 <em>Chitty on Pleading, </em>204. \u2014 <em>Sarell, adm. </em>vs. <em>Wine, </em>3 <em>East, </em>409.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b166-11\"> <em>Stat. </em>1791, c. 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b166-12\"> <em>Com.

An acknowledgment of the debt, therefore, by an executor or administrator, as well as by the original debtor, has been held to avoid that statute. But the statute we are now considering has no regard to the payment or non-payment of the debt ; it was designed to produce a speedy settlement of estates, that the heirs might be quieted. A promise of the administrator can, therefore, have no effect to bind tbe estate. He may decline pleading the statute ; but, if he does, without consent of the heirs, he may expose himself for his unfaithful conduct. The promise creates only a personal obligation on the part of the person making it; but cannot affect the estate, <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">\n<em>Replication adjudged bad.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b166-15\"> See <em>Thompson </em>vs. <em>Brown et </em>al., 16 Mass. <em>Rep. </em>178</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
