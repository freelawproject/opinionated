After the execution was in the plaintiff\u2019s hands, he demanded the chattels of the defendant, <em>Plumb; </em>but the other defendant, <em>Sherrill, </em>being out of the county, no demand was made on him, nor could the plaintiff find the chattels whereon to levy the execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b242-12\">These facts appearing on the trial of the general issue in <em>assumpsit, </em>before <em>Putnam, </em>J., he ordered the defendants to be called, the plaintiff agreeing, that the default should be taken off, and that he would become nonsuit, if, in the opinion of the whole Court, the action could not be supported against both the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b242-13\"><em>Sedgwick, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As0\">argued, that the demand should have been made upon both defendants ; and that <em>Sherrill\u2019s </em>being out of the county did not excuse this defect.
