The award was holden good in that part; and, if it had been otherwise, the other obligors would have been bound to perform the award as it respected them.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-11\">Debt on bond. On oyer, it appeared to be a bond of the defendant and sundry other persons, and amongst them \u201c <em>John </em>Cox, as administrator of the estate of <em>George </em>Cox, deceased \u201d ; by which they <em>severally </em>acknowledged themselves indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $ 3000 each. The condition recited, that there were many accounts between the plaintiff and the obligors, as members of a trading company, and that it had been agreed, that certain arbitrators named should examine all such accounts, and award and determine what sum should be paid or received by each member of the company ; and, as to such of the obligors as should perform the award of the said arbitrators, the bond was to be void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>The name of <em>'\u2022'\u2022John Cox\u201d </em>was subscribed, and a seal thereto annexed, but without other addition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">The defendant pleaded no award made. The plaintiff, in his replication, set forth an award in substance; and, among other things contained therein, it was ordered, that the defendant should pay the plaintiff the sum of $380.93, and that the plaintiff should pay to \u201cthe said <em>John Cox, </em>administrator of <em>George Cox, </em>deceased,\u201d an other sum certain ; and other sums were' awarded as to all the obligors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">The defendant demurred generally to the replication, and the plaintiff joineddn demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-7\"><em>Mellen, </em>in support of the demurrer,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A0T\">argued, that the arbitrators had exceeded their authority, in awarding money to <em>John Cox, </em>as administrator ; he having executed the instrument only in his own name, and not as administrator.

One of the company, <em>George Cox, </em>was dead, and, it appears, a considerable sum of money was due to his estate from the company. <em>John Cox, </em>naming himself administrator of the deceased, became a party to the submission ; and the arbitrators awarded him a sum of money in his capacity of administrator. In this they did not exceed their powers. But, if they had in that particular, the defendant could not avail himself of it. The bond is the several deed of each obligor. The signature, also, of <em>John Cox </em>must be taken with reference to the description of him in the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-10\">\n<em>Replication adjudged good.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
