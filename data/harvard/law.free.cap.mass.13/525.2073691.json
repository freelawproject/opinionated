J\\I. Parker, </em>an attorney at law, duly admitted and practising as such, took out an execution upon said judgment, being lor a less sum than <em>Locke's </em>execution against said <em>Temple, </em>and delivered it to the defendant, then a constable, who, having arrested <em>Locke </em>upon <em>Temple's </em>execution, he <em>(Locke) </em>produced his execution against <em>Temple, </em>and required the defendant to offset <em>Temple's </em>execu tion and discharge it by indorsing the amount thereof on his <em>(Locke's) </em>execution ; and also paid the defendant the fees due to him as constable on <em>Temple's </em>execution ; that the defendant, pursuant to the demand of said <em>Locke, </em>did offset and discharge the <em>debt </em>in <em>Temple's </em>execution against him, by indorsing the same on his <em>(Locke's) </em>execution ; but refused to do it, as regarded the <em>costs, </em>unless <em>Locke </em>would first pay or secure to the attorney, in said action, the amount thereof, and compelled <em>Locke </em>to pay them. The amount of the costs in <em>Temple's </em>execution included only the attorney\u2019s fees and disbursements made by him in the prosecution of the same suit; and, at the time the defendant so refused to offset the costs as aforesaid, the said attorney, who had prosecuted <em>Temple's </em>suit, was present, and notified <em>Locke, </em>as well as the defendant, that the said costs were due to him for costs and * disbursements as aforesaid, and that, before the same could be offset in manner as required by <em>Locke, </em>he <em>(Locke) </em>must pay or secure to him, the said attorney, the amount of his said costs. The Court instructed the jury, that it was the duty of the constable, upon his fees being paid or tendered to him, to have offset the whole amount of <em>Temple's </em>execution, as well the costs as the damages, and to have discharged the execution by indorsing the whole amount upon <em>Locke's </em>execution against <em>Temple ; </em>and that they ought to find the defendant guilty, and assess damages for the plaintiff. The jury having returned a verdict for the plaintiff conformed to the said directions, the defendant filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>his bill of exceptions to the same ; and now assigned the said directions as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b420-5\"><em>Parker, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APi\">The statute of 1810, c. 84, recognizes the lien of an attorney for his fees and disbursements, in the case of setting off executions against each other ; and this Court, in the case of <em>Baker </em>vs. <em>Cook, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> has given a construction to the statute which makes all argument upon the point needless, if not indecorous.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b420-6\"><em>W. Austin, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQx\">The statute but incidentally mentions the subject of an attorney\u2019s lien, and can hardly be said to create it, unless it existed before. In the case of <em>Getchell </em>vs. <em>Clark, </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> which was prior to the statute, the Court expressly deny that such a right existed, and say, that the only remedy for an attorney for his fees is an action against his client. In <em>Goodenow </em>vs. <em>Buttrick, </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> and <em>Hatch </em>vs. <em>Green, </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> no such claim was suggested, though the cases were such as would naturally have given occasion for it, had the parties conceived such a right to exist.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b420-9\"> 11 <em>Mass.

This amounts, *at least, to a legislative declaration that such lien may exist.\u00bb In the case brought before us by this writ of error, such a lien existed, and, being duly made known to the officer holding the executions, he was bound to recognize it. He acted correctly in refusing to set off the costs. The judgment of the Common Pleas was, therefore, erroneous, and must be reversed. a</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
