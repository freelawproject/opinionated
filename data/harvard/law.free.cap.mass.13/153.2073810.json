Billings </em>or bis order, one for <em>$ </em>500 in six months, and the other for $ 300 in twelve months, with interest after maturity, and, on the 19th of the same November, indorsed by said <em>Billings </em>to the plaintiff at <em>Providence.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-11\">The defendant pleaded two several pleas in bar ; the first of which alleges, that, after the notes declared on were made, namely, on the 21 st of <em>November, </em>1811, one <em>Alvarez Fisk </em>of <em>Georgia </em>(of which State the said <em>Billings </em>and the defendant are also citizens) impleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the said <em>Billings </em>in the Inferior Court in the County of Richmond, in the said State, in a plea of debt, for the contents of two promissory notes made to said <em>Fisk </em>by said Billings, and caused the said <em>Blake </em>to be summoned as the garnishee of the said <em>Billings ; </em>which process was, pursuant to a statute of the said State of Georgia, set forth in the plea ; that the said <em>Billings </em>appeared at the said court, and there disclosed upon oath the giving the said notes declared on in this action; and thereupon, at the same court, upon the default of the said Billings, damages were assessed by a jury in favor of said <em>Fisk, </em>and judgment was rendered against <em>Billings </em>for the sum of $668.25 damages and costs, and against said <em>Blake </em>as garnishee; with liberty to sue execution <em>instanter </em>for $504.44, being the amount due on the first note, and for the residue of the judgment after the 11th of November, 1812, when the second note would fall due. These proceedings were declared, in the said judgment, to operate as a bar in favor of <em>Blake </em>against <em>Hull </em>or his indorsee on said notes, for as much as the judgment consumed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-5\">In his second plea in bar, the defendant sets forth an act of the legislature of the State of Georgia, by which it is * provided, \u201c that, where any creditor apprehends the loss of his debt by his debtor being about to squander or waste his property, and shall make oath thereof, he shall be at liberty to piosecute his suit to judgment.\u201d He then alleges, that the now plaintiff, in September, 1813, by petition, -instituted an action upon the same notes in the Superior Court of said State, under the provisions of the said act; that he, the said Blake, being duly summoned, appeared and pleaded in bar of said suit the attachment and judgment made and obtained by <em>Fisk, </em>as set forth in the first plea in bar ; and that thereupon, on the 12th of October, 1814, the said <em>Hull </em>dismissed and discontinued his said suit against him, the said <em>Blake.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-6\">To both which pleas in bar the plaintiff demurred generally, and the defendant joined in demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-7\"><em>Prescott </em>and <em>Parker, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4n\">contended, that the notes, having been indorsed by <em>Billings </em>before the process instituted against him and the defendant, as his garnishee in <em>Georgia, </em>the defendant had ceased to be the debtor of <em>Billings : </em>so there was nothing for that process to operate upon. It is no answer, that the courts in <em>Georgia </em>have authority to construe their own statutes. Our own courts, will also construe them, so far as to prevent injury to our own citizens. But, if the right to explain those statutes were exclusively in the courts in <em>Georgia, </em>still it was the duty of the defendant to have obtained, by an appeal, the opinion of the Superior Court of that State.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b127-8\">This being a question, rather on the remedy than on the right, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>own laws are to govern. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> In <em>Baker </em>vs. Wheaton, <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> the Court say expressly, that, if the note had been transferred to the plaintiff, a citizen of this State, while it remained due, and undischarged by the laws of <em>Rhode </em>Island, his right could not have been affected by the proceedings of the court in that State. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> Whether these notes were negotiable by the laws of <em>Georgia </em>or not, they were certainly so at Providence, and were there legally transferred to the plaintiff, by the laws of <em>Rhode </em>Island, * prior to the commencement of <em>Fisk's </em>process in the State of <em>Georgia.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b128-5\"><em>W. Sullivan, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8b\">argued, that the notes, being made in the State of <em>Georgia, </em>must have been\" made and indorsed with reference to the laws of that State. Those laws gave them all their original validity, and by those laws should their effect and operation be determined. The action of <em>Fisk, </em>on which judgment was rendered that the creditor of <em>Billings </em>should have his satisfaction out of the notes, was within the legal jurisdiction of the court which rendered the judgment; and no fraud is imputed to it. It was, therefore, binding upon the notes. If the defendant has to pay them to the present plaintiff, he will be twice charged for the same debt. On the other hand, the plaintiff has still his remedy against <em>Billings, </em>his indorser, who will have no defence, either legal or equitable, against such demand. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-6\"><em>[Note. </em>It was agreed, on the part of the defendant, that judgment should be rendered, as on <em>nil dicit, </em>for the part of the sum demanded not covered by the judgment of the court in Georgia.]</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b128-9\"> <em>Pearsall &amp; al. </em>vs. <em>Dwight &amp; al. </em>2 <em>Mass.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Abm\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The defence set up against the notes, which are the subject of this action, is contained in the first plea in bar ; the second plea being unquestionably bad, it merely showing that a process, in the nature of an action, had been prosecuted by the present plaintiff upon the same notes, in the State of <em>Georgia, </em>which was afterwards discontinued. The question presented, then, is, whether the facts contained in the first plea are a good bar to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">The plea alleges in substance, that the defendant, who was the promissor in the notes sued, has been summoned as the garnishee or trustee of <em>Billings, </em>the promissee, in the State of <em>Georgia; </em>that, by a court of that State which had jurisdiction of the process, upon a disclosure by the defendant that he had made the notes to Billings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>which are the subject of the present suit, judgment was rendered * against him as the trustee of <em>Billings, </em>at the suit of one of his creditors in <em>Georgia; </em>and that the same judgment still remains in force against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Upon an examination of a transcript of the record of that process, it appears that such judgment was rendered, although it was stated in the disclosure, that the notes were negotiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">Is this a good bar to the suit of the plaintiff, who is a <em>bona fide </em>indorsee of the notes, having acquired his title before the commencement of the process in <em>Georgia </em>by which the defendant attempts to discharge himself ?</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The plaintiff, although his contract with <em>Billings, </em>his indorser, was made in the State of <em>Rhode Island, </em>and so probably subject to the laws of that State, must be considered as having purchased a security which was subject, for its construction and its legal qualities and character, to the law of <em>Georgia ; </em>it being a well settled principle, that the <em>law of the place </em>where a contract is made is to govern in ;ts construction, and that, by the law of the same place, it may be avoided and defeated. The notes were dated at <em>Jlugusta, </em>in the State of <em>Georgia; </em>and the plaintiff, when taking them as his property, must be presumed to have known that they were made with reference to the laws of that State.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">If, then, by the laws of the State of <em>Georgia </em>in force when these notes were given, they might be discharged by a payment to the original promissee after they were indorsed, and such a payment had been actually made, proof of these facts would secure the defendant from a second payment, although it should be demanded by an indorsee, who had paid a valuable consideration, and who must, in such case, be considered as relying upon his indorser, if he should fail of recovering the amount from the promissor. A law providing that any creditor of the promissee may compel the promissor to pay the debt to him, notwithstanding the evidence of its negotiable quality, and that it may have been actually negotiated, would have the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">* Such a provision would be extraordinary, and contrary to the effect generally given to negotiable securities in any mercantile country ; but, if the law be so, it must have its operation upon the contract, wherever it may be sued ; because the laws of the place where the contract is made necessarily make a part of the contract, and are understood as its governing principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">The question, then, in the present case, would seem to be, whether such was the law of <em>Georgia </em>with respect to a negotiable promissory note, at the time this contract was made. That it was, the evidence resulting from the judgment of the Court of that State, which had the jurisdiction of the subject matter, is perhaps conclusive. Al <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>least it ought to be so considered in favor of a party, who has been there concluded by it, and has no means of avoiding the execution of it; unless it should be made to appear that he aided in the procurement of such a judgment, by withholding facts essential to the right determination of the Court. In this case a true disclosure appears to have been made ; and, although the law of this State would not authorize a similar judgment upon similar facts, the law of <em>Georgia </em>may be different, and must be presumed to be so, because a Judicial Court of that State, of competent jurisdiction, has so declared it.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">It is true, there are higher tribunals in the State, to which the present defendant might have resorted ; but we do not think that he was obliged to do so. It was enough for him to present to the Court a true state of his relation to <em>Billings, </em>his creditor ; and he might safely acquiesce in the decision of that tribunal to which the laws of the State had given authority over the subject. If he had collusively submitted to a judgment which by law could not have been recovered against him, he could derive no advantage under it if the other party should put in issue the collusion ; and, upon such issue, the failure to appeal might, under some circumstances, be sufficient evidence of the collusion. In this case no collusion is alleged against the * judgment, and the presumption must be that it was fairly rendered ; so that the defendant is under legal obligation to pay the debt to the creditor of <em>Billings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">It has been settled, that a judgment thus rendered will protect the judgment debtor, as much as if he had actually satisfied the judgment ; although the want of satisfaction might be another material fact, in the trial of the issue whether the judgment was collusive or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The result is, that the defendant\u2019s pleas in bar are good and sufficient, for so much as the sum which the defendant is bound to pay to <em>Fisk, </em>the judgment creditor in <em>Georgia. </em>For the residue the plaintiff is to take judgment as by the agreement of the parties.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
