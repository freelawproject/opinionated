The writ was dated June 20th, 1814.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-9\">It was in evidence at the trial, which was had upon the general issue, before <em>Parker, </em>C. J., at the last November term, in this county, that <em>Billings </em>returned, upon the original writ, that he had arrested the body of <em>Ingraham </em>and taken bail; but that, in fact, he had not taken bail, but, having arrested him, suffered him to go at large, upon his promise that he would execute a bail-bond with sufficient sureties. <em>Gcesar </em>entered his action against <em>Ingraham, </em>and, at the October term, 1812, of the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Middlesex, </em>recovered judgment for $ 309.50 damage and costs. Execution issued thereon in January, 1813, and was delivered to <em>Billings, </em>who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>made a return of <em>non est inventus </em>on the same, bearing date the sixth of April, 1813 ; but it was not in fact returned into the clerk\u2019s office until a long time after the return day thereof. No application *was made for the bail-bond until more than a year had elapsed after the judgment ; and <em>Ingraham </em>had not been within the Commonwealth since, so that he could be taken execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-6\">The defendant\u2019s counsel insisted, that, upon the first count, the actioi could not be maintained, because the bail-bond was not demanded, nor the suit commenced, until more than a year had elapsed after the judgment; and he stated, that funds bad been lodged with him, as attorney of <em>Ingraham, </em>to satisfy the judgment; which having kept, until he supposed the right of action against the sheriff to be gone, he had paid over. He also contended, that, upon the second count, only nominal damages could be recovered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-7\">The judge who sat in the trial instructed the jury, that, as the return upon the writ was false in fact, the right of action remained after a year from the judgment ; although the bail would not have been answerable beyond that time. For it might well be, that the creditor knew there was no bond to be obtained, if demanded, and that he relied upon his right of action against the sheriff. And this was especially to be presumed, if the jury were satisfied that the execution was not duly returned into the clerk\u2019s office. Because, not finding the execution there, the creditor would, of course, rely upon his remedy against the officer ; having no right of action against the bail, without a return of the officer upon the execution. A verdict being returned for the plaintiff in conformity with the judge\u2019s direction, the defendant moved for a new trial on account of that direction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-8\"><em>Jlylwin, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKm\">A false return does not of itself give a right of action, unless actual damage be proved to have been incurred in consequence of such return. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> But here, no damage would have been sustained, had due diligence been used by the plaintiff. The amount of his judgment was placed in the attorney\u2019s hands, and kept by him for more than a year, ready to be paid over on. request to the sheriff or his deputy. But the plaintiff lay by, until all parties supposed the sheriff discharged, and *then the money was returned. Nominal damages only should have been given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b140-9\">Upon the second count the plaintiff has shown no better title to damages. The execution was returned in season for him to have demanded the bail-bond and sued his <em>scire facias. </em>All bis misfortune has arisen from his own negligence. The defendant ought not to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>charged in damages, further than the plaintiff\u2019s loss is actually owing to <em>Billings's </em>misconduct. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-5\"><em>Ward, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b140-10\"> <em>Boles </em>vs <em>Lassels, Cro.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AbUn\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The question made in this case is, whether the plaintiff has not lost his right of action against the sheriff for the misfeasance of his deputy, because he did not make a demand of the bail-bond within a year after judgment against the principal. The position is attempted to be supported by analogy to the action against bail, which is limited to a year after judgment against the principal; and it is said no damage has been sustained, because, had there been a bail-bond, the plaintiff, by his negligence, would have lost his remedy upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">But this is taking for granted what may never have happened ; for it may be presumed, that the plaintiff knew that no bail had been taken, notwithstanding the return of the officer; and, with such knowledge, to have made the demand would have been but an idle ceremony. The wrong done was in making the false return ; and there is no limitation affecting an action for that wrong, but the general statute of limitations in personal actions. The limitation for a <em>scire facias </em>against bail, is a personal privilege to the bail: which cannot be transferred to an officer, who has neglected his duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">\n<em>Judgment according to the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
