Issue was joined upon the traverse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-10\">At the trial of the said issue, which was had at the last October term in this county, before <em>Thatcher, </em>J., after the plaintiff had produced his proof of property in himself, the defendant offered two depositions of the said <em>Stearns, </em>to prove the facts alleged in his plea, . and to disprove the plaintiff\u2019s property in the oil. The plaintiff objected to the admission of these depositions, on the ground, that <em>Stearns </em>was an interested and incompetent witness, when called on the part of the defendant. The judge overruled the said objection, and admitted the said depositions to go in evidence to the jury; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>who, upon the evidence before them, returned a verdict in favor of the defendant.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AXG\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The interest of <em>Stearns </em>is not so direct as to make him incompetent as a witness. The property was attached as his partner\u2019s, <em>John Page. </em>jun. He testified that it belonged to him and <em>Page. </em>The effect of this testimony would be, to render the moiety of it subject to the execution of his partner\u2019s creditor. If the sheriff should proceed to sell the whole upon the execution, and the witness should bring his action for the moiety, he could not avail himself of the verdict in this case to support his demand. Indeed, it * would seem indifferent to him whether the issue, to which his testimony referred, was found for the plaintiff or the defendant; for he would have the same right to a moiety, if his story be true, in either event. The only effect of his' testimony would be, to leave the chattels in the hands of the deputy sheriff, that he might satisfy the execution out of the moiety supposed to belong to <em>John </em>Page, jun.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">All the cases go upon the ground, that the verdict would be available for\" the witness, where he is rejected as incompetent; except the case of <em>Buckland </em>vs. Tankard, cited in the argument; in which Lord <em>Kenyon </em>held, that the witness ought to be rejected, because his creditors would be better by the verdict one way. This appears to us but a loose objection to a witness ; and we think that the only intelligible rule is, that, to render him incompetent, he should be interested in the event of the suit; because the verdict will establish something in his favor or against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
