Cases of settlement are cases of strict law ; and the only question in the case now before the Court is, whether the defendants or the Commonwealth shall support the pauper. For there is no pretence of an obligation upon the plaintiffs ; and, if this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>pauper is not settled in <em>West Stockbridge, </em>he has no settlement within the State, and is one of the Commonwealth\u2019s poor. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-5\">But this is an application of a novel impression. The cause has been determined by the Court upon an agreed statement of facts, in which the judges have acted rather as arbitrators selected by the parties than as a court of law. If it is within the power of the Court to set aside the judgment, it is humbly submitted, that they have no power to annul the agreement of the parties, on which that judgment was rendered, without their consent.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b247-6\"><em>Jlshmun, </em>for the petitioners.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMI\">There is nothing of system in the granting of new trials. The application in each case is to the sound discretion of the Court. There is no greater objection to the granting a review of a judgment grounded on a case stated than on a special verdict. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> There is no higher evidence of the facts in one case than in the other. It is every day\u2019s practice with this Court to discharge a stated case, when one party has discovered a fact material to his cause, and which was not known to him at the time of stating the case ; unless the other party will agree to insert such fact</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b247-7\">The petitioners have all the rights, and all the merits, in this action, which can be derived from a solemn act of the legislature humanely providing for the support of the indigent, whether with or without a home, and for this object establishing a set of rules operating on the whole with equal and perfect justice.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b246-11\"> 1 <em>D. </em>&amp; <em>E. </em>84.-2 <em>D. &amp; E </em>113. \u20141 <em>Salk. 273. \u2014 Sayer, </em>27.-8 <em>Mod. </em>2.-7 <em>Mod </em>156.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b247-12\"> 2 <em>Salk. </em>647.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"ANH\"> <em>Bac. Abr. Tit. Trial, L. </em>1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b247-8\">* <em>By the Court.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AVq\"><em>We </em>have no doubt of our authority to grant a review in this case. Nor do we perceive any reason against such an application as the present, which does not equally apply to a judgment rendered upon a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Where parties have been entrapped or misled into an agreement, and without laches on their part, or if, within the time limited by statute for the granting of reviews, they discover a fact misstated or omitted, it is as much within the legitimate powers of the Court as to discharge a statement for a similar cause pending the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">The petitioners in this case cannot be charged with the want of due diligence. They could not obtain the paper now produced until it was furnished them by Mr. <em>Williams',s </em>executors ; and they have certainly been prompt enough in their application to the Court since they did obtain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">But, as the respondents have been in no fault, it would be unjust to subject them to the costs of the former suit, if the petitioners should be successful on the review ; let the costs be subject to the direction of the Court, and upon those terms let the petitioners take their review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
