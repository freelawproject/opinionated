Although he had authority, by law, to complete the service of any precepts in his hands at the date of the plaintiff\u2019s resignation, yet by accepting the new appointment from Mr. <em>Brown, </em>and this by the assent of the plaintiff, he must be considered as having ceased from that time to be the deputy of the plaintiff. The appointment under the plaintiff was during the will of both parties; and that will was determined by the new appointment. He could not be the deputy of both the sheriffs at the same time ; and, as the fault in this case was the failure to return the warrants, and pay the money, within a reasonable time after the return day thereof, which was long after the appointment under Mr. <em>Brown, </em>he should be considered as having misbehaved under Mr. <em>Brown, </em>and therefore not accountable to the plaintiff; and, of course, the condition of the bond sued was not broken. But, if the defendants are liable at all, they think themselves no farther liable than to the amount actually collected by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>him during the plaintiff\u2019s continuance in office. For the rest, Mr <em>Brown </em>must look to the indemnity given him.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b242-5\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A38\">Two questions are made in this case ; whethei the defendants are liable at all within the condition of their bond and, if it all, for how much, as it appears that part only of the money embezzled by <em>Root </em>was actually collected by him during the plaintiff\u2019s sheriffalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">And we are clearly of opinion, that they are responsible for the whole of the deficiency stated in the case. When the warrants were put into the hands of Root, he was the deputy of the plaintiff; and his power to complete the execution of them continued, by virtue of the plaintiff\u2019s deputation. The successor of the plaintiff could never be answerable for this misconduct. He had no means of even knowing that such precepts had been delivered to Root, who was responsible to the plaintiff in the same manner and degree as if he had not been reappointed by the succeeding sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\"><em>Defendants </em>defaulted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
