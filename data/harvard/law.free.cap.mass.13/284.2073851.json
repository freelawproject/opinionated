The declaration originally contained one count *only, namely, \u201cfor that the said Ezra, at, &amp;c., on, &amp;c., being indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of-, <em>according to the account </em>annexed, then and there, in consideration thereof, promised the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>tiff to pay him the same on demand ; yet the said <em>Ezra, </em>though often requested, has never paid the same, but neglects and refuses so to dc.\u201d The account annexed was of several articles of merchandise sold by the plaintiff to the defendant. The second count, which was filed by consent before the trial of the action, was a <em>quantum valebant </em>for the same articles ; but it contained no averment of a demand and refusal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-5\">The errors assigned were, that, by the first count, there was no sufficient cause of action set forth ; and that, in the second, the plaintiff had alleged no breach of the promise therein declared on.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-6\"><em>Eddy, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW4u\">The declaration should, at least, have stated what was the consideration for the promise, as, for goods sold and delivered ; and, without some words showing generally what was contained in the account or schedule, the declaration was insensible, and showed, in fact, no cause of action. The schedule constitutes no part of the declaration. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-7\">To support the assignment of the error in the second count he cited <em>Lawes's Pleading in Assumpsit, </em>258.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-8\"><em>H. Cushman, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW-Y\">cited <em>Chitty on Pleading, </em>324, 327, 331 ; \u20141 <em>L.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A13p\">The errors assigned in this case are not supported. With respect to the first count, it is in a form which has been in use and practice as long as the memory of the oldest practitioner can reach ; and it is too late to question it on nice technical objections. Although a schedule annexed to a writ in replevin or trover is held to make no part of the declaration, yet, in <em>indebitatus assumpsit, </em>it has been uniformly allowed, for more than thirty years, to supply a particular allegation in the body of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"AIu\">* With regard to the second error assigned ; if the supposed defect existed, we are not clear that it would not have been cured by the verdict. But the averment at the close of the original declaration may well be applied to both of the counts ; and the authorities show clearly, that one averment of a request and refusal to pay is sufficient for any number of counts in <em>assumpsit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
