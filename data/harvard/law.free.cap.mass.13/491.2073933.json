It appeared that <em>Frost </em>was liable to the fine imposed upon him, unless his enlistment in a company of artillery within the same brigade, as a musician, was a legal excuse. And as to this, it appeared that he arrived at the age of eighteen years on the 1st of May, 1813. On the 15th of April, preceding, he enlisted in the said company of artillery ; on the 4th of said May was enrolled therein ; and ever since, and particularly on the said third day of May, 1814, had done duty therein.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-11\"><em>Josiah Mams, </em>in support of the conviction,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6C\">argued, that the enlistment, having taken place before <em>Frost </em>was eighteen years of age, was void. And he argued, that this was such a contract as a minor under twenty-one years was not competent to make. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> If. the enlistment into the artillery company was void, or even voidable, he was duly enrolled in the standing company, and so liable to the fine imposed on him.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b392-13\"> <em>Commonwealth </em>vs. <em>Harrison, </em>11 <em>Mass.

This enlistment was not void on account of his minority, though voidable by himself, had he chosen to have avoided it. The law, having made eighteen years the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>age for military duty, necessarily gives the power at that age to enlist in any company, which is, in fact, a part of the militia. It is merely choosing the kind of militia service he would perform ; and to say, that the enlistment is not binding, would be to break up many independent companies, which may be considered the <em>\u00e9lite </em>of the militia.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\n<em>Proceedings quashed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">[See <em>Sup.
