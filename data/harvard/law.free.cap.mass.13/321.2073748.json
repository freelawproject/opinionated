Field.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b260-10\">A sheriff may appoint one his aid without writing; and such aid, in the execution of civil process, is entitled to the protection of the law equally with the sheriff, although not in his sight, provided both are pursuing one business or object.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-11\">The defendant was indicted, at the last May term of this Court, in the county of Franklin, for assaulting and beating one <em>Samuel Rich, </em>when performing the duty of an assistant or aid <em>of-Bates, </em>a deputy sheriff in that county, when in the execution of the duty of his office ; and for rescuing <em>Warren JL. Field, </em>who (as was alleged) had been arrested upon an execution in favor of Messrs. <em>Jackson fy </em>Waimoright, for $ 99.64.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-14\">At the trial before <em>Putnam, </em>J., it appeared, that the defendant was the brother of the execution debtor ; and it was proved, that <em>Rich </em>had the execution, to collect the money due thereon for the use of the creditors, and delivered it to <em>Bates </em>to be served. He then proposed to be appointed an aid or assistant of <em>Bates </em>in the business To this <em>Bates </em>assented, and verbally appointed him his aid. <em>Rich </em>then stated, that he was acquainted with the debtor ; who possibly migh. be willing to pay, or compromise the matter, without further trouble ; and therefore proposed, that he should go forward and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>converse with the debtor, who was at the house of the defendant To this <em>Bates </em>assented, and agreed to follow ; and he testified, that he expected that <em>Rich </em>would not permit the debtor to escape, but would arrest him, if he should attempt to get away. <em>Rich </em>then went forward, and <em>Bates </em>followed. The defendant was at his house. The debtor, alarmed at the approach of these men, ran out of the door of the defendant\u2019s house towards the woods. <em>Rich </em>then beckoned to <em>Bates, </em>who was in sight, and called to him to \u201ccome on.\u201d The debtor ran into the woods, <em>Rich </em>pursuing him, the defendant pursuing <em>Rich, </em>and <em>Bates </em>following them. As <em>Rich </em>was pursuing, he told the debtor to stop, saying that he had nothing against him but what he could meet or settle. \u2022 On this the debtor looked round, but continued running. At last <em>Rich </em>overtook the debtor, -who defended himself with a *club, giving to <em>Rich </em>a blow on the head. <em>Rich </em>then seized the debtor, telling him, at the same time, that he was his prisoner. The debtor made no demand by what authority <em>Rich </em>acted. Nothing more was said than is above stated. A violent struggle then ensued between <em>Rich </em>and the debtor, which was continued until the defendant came up with them ; who, without demanding of <em>Rich </em>by what authority he seized his brother, immediately gave <em>Rich </em>several severe blows upon his head with a club, which stunned him. He hallooed, Murder ! which was heard by a man at work in the woods about thirty rods off, who immediately ran, with the intention of preserving the peace, and separated them. At that instant the debtor ran off, and has not since been heard of in this Commonwealth. Immediately afterwards <em>Bates </em>arrived, but not in season to arrest the debtor. There was no written appointment of <em>Rich </em>to be an aid or assistant of <em>Bates.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">The jury were instructed, that a verbal request was sufficient ; that, if they believed the facts testified and before stated, <em>Rich </em>might be considered as acting as an aid or assistant of the officer, although not in his sight; provided the jury believed, that they were both <em>pursuing one business or </em>object; \u2014 that an arrest by the aid or assistant, under such circumstances, would be, to all intents and purposes, as valid as if the same had been made by the sheriff\u2019s proper hand; \u2014 and that the aid or assistant would be under the same protection of the law as the sheriff himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-7\">The jury found the defendant guilty ; and he moved for a new trial for misdirection. If, upon these facts, the Court should be of opinion that the defendant ought not to have been convicted, the verdict was to be set aside, and a new trial granted. Otherwise, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b261-8\"><em>Newcomb, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1f\">argued, that the arrest, in this case, was not legal, and, of course, there was no rescue. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> The sheriff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>has no authority to take assistants with him for the \u00e9xecution of merely civil process, unless *he has good reason to believe that he shall be resisted. And, in that case, if he would clothe them with authority to execute process, he must do it by writing at least. A parol appointment is not sufficient. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> To claim the protection of an officer, the assistant must be in the officer\u2019s presence, at least constructively. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> In this case <em>Rich </em>was wholly out of the reach of <em>Bates\u25a0 </em>He did not even declare by what authority he made the violent attack upon the debtor ; who had no cause to apprehend that he was clothed with the authority of law. Had <em>Rich </em>been killed in the rencounter, it would never have been ruled to be <em>murder </em>in the defendant, <em>Rich </em>having shown no war rant. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b262-5\"><em>Morton </em>(Attorney-General), for the 'Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b261-10\"> 6 <em>Mod. </em>210.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b262-10\"> <em>Bull. </em>N. <em>P. </em>63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"A8fj\"> <em>Blatch </em>vs. <em>Archer, Cowp </em>63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(4)\">\n<p id=\"b262-11\"> <em>Moor, </em>767. \u2014 6 Co. 54. \u2014 9 <em>Co. </em>69.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b262-6\">Putnam, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AATS\">delivered the opinion of the Court. In the case ol <em>Blatch </em>vs. Archer, cited in the argument for the defendant, and which was very much like the case at bar, it was determined, that an arrest was good which was made by the servant of the bailiff, when the bailiff was not in sight, nor within thirty rods of the debtor. In that case, as in the present, the officer had the capias, and the servant acted by the verbal authority of the officer ; and the jury, in this case, as in that, have found, that both were intent upon one object, namely, the arresting and detaining of the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">It has been contended, in the case at bar, that <em>Rich, </em>the assistant, did not sufficiently make known his authority to arrest. But he had no opportunity to do more than he did ; and' it was not his fault, that an explanation was not fully made after the arrest. The case, in which one arrested may demand of one, not known generally as an officer, to produce his warrant or authority, is, when the party arrested submits himself to the arrest; <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> not where he immediately resists, and by his own wrongful act prevents the officer from doing his duty. Parties thus resisting do it at their peril; and all who come to their assistance under such circumstances must take the consequences of their unlawful interference.</p>\n<p id=\"Al_g\">* Upon consideration, we are all of opinion, that the direction to the jury was right; and the motion for a new trial .\"s overruled.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(5)\">\n<p id=\"A2QJ\"> <em>Mackalley's case, </em>9 <em>Co. </em>66. <em>b.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
