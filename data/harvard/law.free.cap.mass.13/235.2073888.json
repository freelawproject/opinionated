The defendants have had due notice of the assignment. They received the full value for the note ; and, if this attempt at fraud is countenanced, it will be hereafter only for debtors to a banking corporation to depreciate its paper, by refusing to pay in their debts, and then to make payment in the paper thus reduced in its value.i</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-7\"><em>Orr. </em>Bank-bills are cash, and a tender in them is good to all intents, if not objected to at the time. This corporation cannot fairly object to receiving the bills to which they have given a currency, and for which they *have received the full value. It would be a gross fraud upon the public. If the demand sued be assigned, it was not assigned until it was overdue, and therefore the rights of the defendants are not changed.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b193-9\">\n<em>By the Court.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A6K\">Nothing is a lawful tender but gold and silver. To permit the defendants thus to set off these promissory notes would be allowing cross demands to be set off in like manner in every case. These notes are nothing more than evidence of a right of action ; so that, if the assignment were out of the question, the motion could not obtain. The only course in such case would be, for the present defendants to obtain a judgment upon the notes and set off such judgment against the plaintiffs\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">The defendants were afterwards defaulted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
