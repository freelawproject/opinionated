The said <em>Raymond </em>several times sent a part of bis earnings at <em>Charlestown </em>to his family previous to his removing them; and he went twice to visit them ; ai <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>one time tarrying with them two or three weeks ; and at another, during the embargo of 1807, he remained with them five or six months. He has been taxed in Charlestown, and has paid the taxes assessed upon him more than five years within any ten successive years since he first resided there ; and he has several times voted in the election of governor, senators, and representatives.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-5\">\u201c.The said <em>Wheeler </em>is an alien, and married to a woman who has her- settlement in Charlestown, and has resided in that town ever since his marriage ; but has never been supported by that town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-6\">\u201c The board and necessaries sued for in this action were furnished by the plaintiffs to the said <em>Raymond, </em>and Wheeler, while they were imprisoned in <em>Cambridge </em>for debt ; from which imprisonment they were both discharged by taking the poor debtor\u2019s oath. Notice was duly given by the plaintiffs to the defendants in both cases.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-7\">Upon these facts it was agreed that judgment should be rendered, upon nonsuit or default, as the decision of the Court should require.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-8\">Baldwin, for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABx8\">was stopped by the Court as to <em>Raymond\u2019s settlement; </em>and he argued that <em>Wheeler </em>gained a settlement by his marriage, under the first article of the second section of the statute of 1793, c. 34, and that the defendants were bound to furnish relief for him in the * first instance, and resort to the Commonwealth for their indemnity.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-9\"><em>Stearns, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZfK\">insisted, that the provision of the statute relied on for the plaintiffs was intended only for the case where the wife was removed, that the husband should not be separated ; but it had no application to the case of <em>Wheeler.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b401-10\">As to Raymond, he argued, that his residence was interrupted by his visits to <em>Vermont, </em>and that, his family continuing there, he must be considered as still having his home or domicil there. It may be likened to the case of a seaman, who never loses his settlement in the place where he leaves his family, let his absence be ever so long. <em>Raymond </em>was absent at <em>Vermont </em>longer than the pauper in the case of <em>Billerica vs. Chelmsford; </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and the Court held the absence in that case sufficient to break the continuity, and to prevent the gaining of a settlement.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-11\"><em>Baldwin, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXoS\"><em>Raymond </em>had no intention, in his visits to <em>Vermont, </em>to change his place of residence, as was the fact in <em>Bille rica vs. Chelmsford. </em>He probably paid taxes in <em>Charlestown </em>the same years that he visited his family.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b401-14\"> 10 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>394,</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b401-12\">Parker, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AjWp\">delivered the opinion of the Court. On the facts agreed in this case, we think the defendants liable for the support of one of the paupers, and not for that of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">With respect to <em>Raymond, </em>he has resided ten years in Charles-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number><em>town, </em>and has paid his taxes five years. This makes him chargeable to the defendants, according to the twelfth rule established by the legislature in their act respecting habitancy. That he had a family in <em>Vermont, </em>and occasionally visited them there, makes no difference ; because he did not consider it as his home, but kept his family there only until he could conveniently remove them. In the mean time he was permitted to exercise all the privileges, and was subject to all the duties, of an inhabitant of <em>Charlestown. </em>Had his family resided on a farm, belonging to *hitn, in another town within the Commonwealth, there might be some question respecting his domicil. At least, we do not decide on such a state of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">As for the other pauper, who is an alien, he would be chargeable to <em>Charlestown </em>only in case his wife, who has her settlement in that town, had been removed thither. But it does not appear that any such removal had taken place. The plaintiffs must, therefore, apply to the Commonwealth for the reimbursement of the expense incurred in his support.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
