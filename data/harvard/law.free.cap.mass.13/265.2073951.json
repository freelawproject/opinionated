The plaintiff recovered judgment, from which <em>Turner </em>appealed to the Circuit Court of Common Pleas. After two continuances in that Court, and when the cause was coming on for trial, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved, \u201c that the papers in the action be quashed\u201d ; and the Court, after hearing the parties, made an order accordingly; and in effect dismissed the appeal, without entering a formal judgment for either party.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-7\">The plaintiff assigns for error the refusal of the Court to permit him to proceed to a trial of the issue joined in * the action, and the dismission of it without rendering any proper and legal judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-8\"><em>B. Whitman, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZh\">contended, that error did not lie in this caso, as there was no judgment entered by the Court below ; and that ti-e plaintiff\u2019s only remedy was a <em>mandamus </em>to the Circuit Court of Ctn-mon Pleas, upon which that Court might certify the reasons for the t vder which they made. And he suggested that there were sufficient l s.xsons, although they did not appear upon the record.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b217-9\"><em>Winslow, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAz\">cited the cases of <em>Lamphear </em>vs. <em>Lamprey, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> <em>Tappan </em>vs. <em>Bruen, </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> and <em>Keyes vs. Stone; </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> and he contended, that the principles established with regard to appeals applied with equal foie' to writs of error.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b217-11\"> 4 <em>Mass.

The plaintiff has lost by it the fruits of the judgment which he recovered in the justice\u2019s court. The effect of that judgment was destroyed by the appeal, which, as far as we can now see, was regularly claimed and prosecuted. The plaintiff was then entitled to a new judgment in his favor; unless, upon some issue in law or fact, the ra ise should have been determir-ed against him ; or unless, after a verdict for him, the judgment shou\u2019d hav e been arrested. There is no issue of law joined on the record ; and there has been no trial of the issues of fact. The judgment p* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>the Circuit Court of Common Pleas being thus substantially erroneous, the irregular form in which it was entered cannot oust this Court of its jurisdiction of the cause. We must now enter such judgment as that Court should have entered. It cannot be known what that judgment should be, until after a trial of the issues of fact. The judgment of the Court below is reversed ; and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>must be awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
