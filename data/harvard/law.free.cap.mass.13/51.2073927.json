Both these deeds are immediately registered.\u2014Previous to the execution of these two deeds, D., a creditor of A., had caused A.\u2019s interest in the land to be attached on mesne process, and after the deeds were registered, having recovered judgment in his suit, caused his execution to be extended on the land, as the estate of A. \u2014 It was holden, that the said two deeds were to be considered as parts of one contract and that A.\u2019s instantaneous seizin could not be the subject of an attachment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-11\">This was a writ of <em>Entry sur disseizin, </em>in which the demandant counted on his own seizin of a piece of land in <em>Boston, </em>and on a disseizen by the tenants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-12\">The cause was tried upon the general issue, before <em>Jackson, </em>J , at the last November term in this county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-13\">It appeared, at the trial, that the demanded premises were formerly the property of one <em>Jesse B. Wilcox, </em>under whom both the parties claimed to hold the same. The said <em>Wilcox, </em>by his deed dated the 2d of July, 1806, * conveyed the premises to one <em>Elijah Withington </em>in fee, with covenants of general warranty. This deed was registered the 3d day of the same July. The said <em>Withington, </em>on the same 2d July, gave his bond to the said <em>Wilcox </em>in a sum of $ 3000, with a condition there underwritten, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>reciting that <em>Wilcox </em>had on that day conveyed to him the premises, and had delivered possession thereof to him, and that he had agreed to let the same ; and the condition was, that the said <em>Withington, </em>on being paid the sum of $ 1088, with lawful interest, within three years, and such further sums as should within that time be due to him from said <em>Wilcox, </em>should reconvey the said premises to <em>Wilcox, </em>and account with him for the rent. This bond was recorded in the registry of deeds for this county on the 14th of July, 1807. The said <em>Withing-ton </em>did not then understand or suppose, that this conveyance might be considered as a mortgage, or that the said <em>Wilcox </em>could have any right to a reconveyance of the premises, at any time after the 2d of July, 1809.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-5\">On the 8th of July, 1809, the demandant was about purchasing the premises of <em>Withington, </em>and finally agreed to pay a certain sum, which proved to be a little more than was then due from <em>Wilcox </em>to <em>Withington. Wilcox </em>was present at the whole of this negotiation, and agreed to all that was done. The whole consideration money was paid by the demandant to <em>Withington; </em>and he afterwards, on settling his account with <em>Wilcox, </em>paid him the abovementioned excess. It was thought proper, or more convenient, in this transaction, that <em>Withington </em>should reconvey the premises to <em>Wilcox, </em>and that the latter should convey the same to the demandant. Two deeds were accordingly prepared, both bearing date on the Sth of July, 1809 ; one from <em>Withington </em>to <em>Wilcox, </em>and the other from <em>Wilcox </em>to the demandant, both containing covenants of warranty. These two deeds were not' executed until the 17th of July, 1809, when they were both executed and acknowledged by the respective grantors, and both immediately delivered into * the registry of deeds, where they were recorded, one immediately after the other. On the same 17th of July, a memorandum was made and signed by the said <em>Wilcox, </em>on the margin of the leaf on which said bond was recorded, acknowledging that the condition of the bond had been performed, and desiring that the said record might be discharged. During all this time the said three parties were wholly ignorant of the attachment upon the premises hereafter mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-6\">On the 10th of July, 1809, one <em>Enoch Drake </em>sued out his writ of attachment against said <em>Wilcox, </em>and caused all his right, title, and interest in the demanded premises to be attached thereon on that day. The debt, to recover which that action was brought, arose on a contract made between those two parties on the 6th of February, 1807. By that writ the sheriff was commanded to attach the goods or estate of <em>Wilcox </em>to the value of $ 800, and the plaintiff\u2019s damages were laid in the writ at the same sum. <em>Drake </em>recovered judgment in that suit for $796.86 debt, and $ 14.19 costs ; and within thirty days after the judgment, namely, on the 20th of Febniarv, 1810, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>caused his execution thereon to be levied on the premises, as the estate of <em>Wilcox; </em>and the same were accordingly appraised and set off to the said <em>Drake </em>for the sum of $830, in full satisfaction of that execution, and of the cost of levying the same. It was agreed, at the trial, that the present tenants had all the estate in the premises which the said <em>Drake </em>had therein by virtue of the levy of said execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b49-5\">The judge directed a verdict for the demandant, subject to the opinion of the Court upon the foregoing report. If the Court should be of opinion, that the demandant was entitled to recover, the verdict was to stand, and judgment be entered thereon ; otherwise it was to be set aside, and a verdict entered for the tenants, and judgment accordingly.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-6\">Cooke, for the</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ak\">tenants, argued, that, at the time of the * attachment of the premises by Drake, <em>Wilcox </em>had an equity of redemption, on which that attachment operated ; and that, by the posterior conveyance by <em>Witkington </em>to him, the mortgage was discharged, and a clear estate in fee vested in Wilcox, to which <em>Drake's </em>process immediately attached, the attachment of the equity being converted into an attachment of the fee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-7\"><em>The demandant </em>(a counsellor of the court),</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXff\">contended, that the bond, given by <em>Withington </em>to <em>Wilcox, </em>did not operate to change the absolute estate, which had already vested in the former, into an estate in mortgage. It was not a defeasance, but a mere personal-contract. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-8\">The seizin of <em>Wilcox, </em>under <em>Withington's </em>deed, was but for an instant. No estate vested in him. His wife could not claim her dower <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> in the land in right of such a seizin ; and, <em>a </em>fortiori, a creditor could not avail himself of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b49-9\">But a more fatal objection exists against the title derived from <em>Drake's </em>attachment and levy. The former was for $800 only ; the latter was $830. He certainly can claim, as against the demandant\u2019s title, no more than the amount of his supposed lien. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> He then extended his execution on a part of the land which he never attached. To such part he acquired no title. But there is no means of separating such surplus from the residue ; and his title must wholly fail.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-10\"><em>Cooke, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aquf\">The costs, by which <em>Drake's </em>judgment was made to exceed the <em>ad damnum </em>in his writ, were merely incidental. The demandant was bound to take notice of the lien, that it was to the amount of the judgment, to which the plaintiff in that action was entitled. In the case of <em>Amory </em>vs. <em>Fairbanks al., </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> a mortgagee, who had entered and possessed himself of the mortgaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>premises, for condition broken, was still held entitled to recover on his bond, beyond the value of the premises.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b49-11\"> <em>Bac.

Several questions have been raised in the argument of this cause ; as to some of which, more consideration, than we have * hitherto bestowed upon them, might probably be necessary, to enable us to come to a satisfactory decision. The view we have taken, however, of one part of the case, we think decisive as to the question of title, and renders the other points, which have been made, immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Both parties, it appears, claim title under one <em>Wilcox </em>; and there can be no doubt, that the demandant has derived the legal estate from him ; unless the intended operation of the deeds, under which he claims, has been defeated by the intervention of <em>Drake\u2019s </em>attachment, and the proceedings consequent thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">On the 10th of July, 1809, when <em>Drake </em>made his attachment, it is admitted, that <em>Wilcox </em>had parted with the legal estate, and had then only an equity of redemption. But it is contended by the counse for the tenants, that afterwards, on the 17th of the same month, when <em>Withington </em>conveyed to Wilcox, there was, by operation of law, a transmutation of the attachment on the equity into an attachment on the land, and that <em>Drake </em>had the same lien upon it as if his attachment had been made at the time of that conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">We think it difficult for the'tenants to maintain this position. But supposing it otherwise, we still think they must fail in their defence on another ground ; as to which we cannot perceive any reasonable cause of doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The deed from <em>Withington </em>to Wilcox, and that from the latter to the demandant, were executed, as it appears, at the same time ; and all the other acts, necessary to give them validity, were simultaneous. These deeds must, then, be considered as parts - of the same contract, <em>Wilcox </em>being the instrument of conveyance, and having only an instantaneous seizin for that purpose, <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Such a seizin, we are of opinion, cannot be the subject of an attachment. This position seems a necessary result from the principles laid down in the case of <em>Holbrook </em>vs. Finney, which was cited at the bar, and where the question was presented in a point of view most favorable to the argument' now made <em>* </em>by the counsel for the tenants ; that being an action of dower, which is ever entitled to favor in the application of legal principles. But the Court, in that case, ruled, that a seizin of the husband, <em>for an </em>instant, was not sufficient to entitle the wife to her dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The general principle is well illustrated by the case put by the Chief Justice, in delivering the opinion in the case referred to. Thus, <em>\u201c\u25a0 </em>If a feoffment be made to B. and his heirs, to the us\u00e9 of C. and his heirs, the wife of B. shall not be endowed ; for the same feoffment, which gave him a seizin, by the statute of uses transferred it to C.\u201d \u00abv2 fortiori, we think, the creditors of B., in such a case, could not intercept, by an attachment, the transfer of the estate to C. And viewing the two deeds, from <em>Withington </em>to <em>Wilcox, </em>and from <em>Wilcox </em>to the demandant, as parts of one contract, made and executed at one time, we can perceive no distinction, in principle, between that case and the one at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">This view of the cause makes it unnecessary for us to take into consideration the objections urged in relation to the supposed irregularity of <em>Drake's </em>proceedings, in extending his execution. For, however regular they may have been, he can have acquired no title thereby, except to an equity, which cannot be set up against a legal estate. But, as one objection involves a question of general practice, I think it proper to observe, that the Court consider it entitled to great notice. <em>Drake's </em>attachment was made to respond for damages and costs, to the amount of $ 800, and no more. He could not, therefore, thereby have a lien on the property attached beyond that amount. But he, having extended his execution on the land at the appraised value of $ 830, the tenants now claim to hold the same by virtue of his attachment. This is certainly a singular claim ; and we know no principle to support it. As to the excess, it is very clear, that the title under the attachment must fail; and it would be difficult to devise a rule, by which, consistently with known principles, the * property may be so apportioned, as to admit the reference of title to any distinct part of the premises, corresponding in value with the amount of the attachment. But of this we give no decided opinion ; being satisfied, on the other ground, that the demandant is entitled to judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">\n<em>Judgment according to the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">[See <em>Mass.
