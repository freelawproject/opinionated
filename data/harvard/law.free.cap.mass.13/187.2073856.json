The plaintiffs recovered judgment against <em>Thompson </em>for <em>$ </em>30.06 damage, and <em>$27.79 </em>costs. Execution upon the judgment was delivered to another of the defendant\u2019s deputies, who returned <em>non est inventus </em>; whereupon due process was sued out against one <em>Kimball, </em>who was the bail, and judgment was recovered against him for the said sums and costs. <em>Kimball </em>was wholly unable to pay the amount of the judgment or any part thereof; and <em>Thompson </em>had absconded before judgment was recovered against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A45\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>* The defendant proved that <em>Thompson, </em>at the time he was arrested, was destitute of property, and had so continued, being of a worthless and dissipated character ; that, after the arrest, he was in custody a part of two days, and was on his way to prison, when <em>Kimball </em>was prevailed upon to become his bail; that <em>Kimball </em>was then supposed to be of sufficient ability to pay said demand ; that the plaintiffs offered to take <em>Kimball\u2019s </em>note and discharge Thompson, after they had entered their action against <em>Thompson, </em>which <em>Kimball </em>refus\u00e9d to give ; and that <em>Kimball, </em>at another time, offered to surrender <em>Thompson </em>in court where the action was pending, and was prevented from doing it by the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-6\">Upon this evidence the judge left it to the jury to assess such a sum in damages as they should be of opinion the plaintiffs had suffered in consequence of the neglect of the defendant\u2019s deputy, and he instructed them, that they were not by law obliged to give the whole amount of the plaintiffs\u2019 said debt and costs in damages, unless they should be of opinion that the plaintiffs had sustained a loss to that amount by reason of the said deputy\u2019s neglect. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, for $14 damage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-7\">If, in the opinion of the whole Court, these directions to the jury should be considered wrong, the verdict was to be set aside, and a new trial had ; otherwise judgment was to be entered on the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-8\"><em>Holmes, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnK\">contended, that, in the cases in the books, where the officer is permitted to go into evidence in mitigation of damages, the body of the principal debtor was still within reach of the creditor\u2019s process, who thereby had all the security for his debt which he originally had. But, in this case, the principal debtor has absconded, and the bail, to whom the officer delivered him, turns out to be wholly worthless. The officer should not be permitted to lessen the damages by saying he could * obtain no better bail. It was his duty to hold the principal in custody, until sufficient bail was offered.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b154-9\"><em>Mellen </em>and Mams, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AinD\">The action being in case, it was the province of the jury to inquire what actual damage the plaintiffs had sustained by the neglect complained of. They were not obliged to give the whole original demand of the plaintiffs. The question for them to decide was, what the principal debtor\u2019s body was worth to the plaintiffs, as a pledge ; and this was the purport and effect of the judge\u2019s direction. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b154-12\"> <em>Colby </em>vs. <em>Sampson, </em>5 <em>Mass.
