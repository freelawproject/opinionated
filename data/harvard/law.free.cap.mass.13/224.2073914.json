It was not for the defendants to deliver them up, and expose the sheriff to an action,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-9\">Long fellow, for the defendants, insisted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7Q\">that the evidence offered was competent, and furnished a complete defence to the action. The plaintiff has no right to recover in this case, unless the sheriff was liable for the article's in question. But the sheriff was answerable to no one ; not to the judgment debtor, for he had no property in the articles ; not to the judgment creditor, for he had lost nothing ; not to the real owner, because they had come to his use and possession. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b184-11\"> <em>Lyman </em>vs. <em>Lyman &amp; al., </em>11 <em>Mass.

This is certainly admissible evidence ; for the defendants were not bound by their receipt, at all events, to retain the goods. They were certainly not bound\u2019to hold them against the demand of him who had the right. That person might have taken them out of their hands by replevin ; and they were under no obligation to resist a claim at the expense of a lawsuit, if they were willing to incur the peril of surrendering them. The sheriff was not liable to an action for not levying upon these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>goods ; and we think the defendants not liable to the sheriff upon their receipt. * Under these circumstances, it being admitted, that the property of the goods was in <em>Benjamin Sawtell, </em>whose administrator formerly demanded the same of the defendants, and has since disposed of them in discharging the debts of the rightful owner, the plaintiff has disclosed no sufficient . cause of action, and she must, therefore, be called.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\"><em>[Denny </em>vs. <em>Willard, </em>11 <em>Pick. 519.\u2014Fisher </em>vs. <em>Bartlett, </em>8 <em>Greenl. </em>122.\u2014 Ed.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
