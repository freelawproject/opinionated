The two defendants pleaded, jointly, not guilty. On the trial of that issue, the jury found one of them guilty, and the other not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-7\"><em>Cummings </em>moved for costs for the defendant who had been acquitted, considering him as the prevailing party within the intent of the statute of 1784, c. 28, \u00a7 9 ; and he cited the cases of <em>Hart </em>vs. Fitzgerald, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and <em>Galloway </em>vs. <em>Pitman fy al. </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-8\"><em>Saltonstall, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AI7\">The case is not within the statute. The two defendants constitute the party, and they cannot be said to have prevailed. The cases cited for the *defendant do not apply. In <em>Hart </em>vs. <em>Fitzgerald </em>there was but one defendant, and the only point decided as to costs was, that the defendant shall recover them when judgment is arrested for the insufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s declaration. In <em>Galloway </em>vs. <em>Pitman &amp; al. </em>the defendants pleaded severally, so this point could not come up.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b427-10\">2 <em>Mass.

It is plain from the verdict, that the plaintiff had no cause of action against him ; as between him and the plaintiff, he is the prevailing party. The verdict has severed the two defendants as effectually as their pleading several pleas would have done. Let costs be taxed for the defendant, in whose behalf the motion was made.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
