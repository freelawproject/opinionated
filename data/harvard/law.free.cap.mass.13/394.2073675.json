Afterwards, on the 7th of February then next, the said cattle being found in the possession of Bond, and <em>Padelford </em>still having the said writ in his hands, he retook the cattle ; and afterwards returned the said w:it to the court to which it was returnable, and where it was duly filed, with the following return, namely, \u2014 \u201c <em>Worcester </em>ss. Jan. 27, 1815. By virtue of this writ I attached six oxen, four cows, and four steers, the property of the within-named <em>John </em>Bond, and at the same time gave him a summons in hand. <em>Harry </em>Padelford, <em>Deputy Sheriff.\"</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-5\">*If, upon this statement, the Court should be of opinion that the action could be maintained, the plaintiff\u2019s damages were to be assessed by a jury ; otherwise, he was to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-6\">Burnside, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aue7\">contended, that <em>the </em>defendant\u2019s conduct, as disclosed in the case, besides being extremely oppressive, was a direct violation of an agreement between the plaintiff, the defendant, and <em>Flagg ; </em>by which the defendant waived the special property he had acquired in the cattle by attaching them, so long as <em>Flagg </em>should continue to be' sufficient responsibility. It is always at the debtor\u2019s request, that such an accommodation is made, and it is always understood that it is to continue until judgment is rendered in the suit; unless in the mean time the receipter conceives it unsafe to permit the chattels to remain with the debtor. That was not the case here.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-7\"><em>Padelford's </em>authority under the writ ceased, as soon as he had made the attachment, and given the debtor a summons. The writ cannot justify him after he had fully obeyed its precept. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-8\"><em>Jl.

The present plaintiff had no interest in the agreement made between the defendant and <em>Flagg. </em>He had no right to the custody or use of the cattle, after they were attached. He held them merely by the indulgence, and at the pleasure, of the officer, or Flagg, who can be considered, in this transaction, in no other character than as the servant of the officer. <em>Flagg </em>could have maintained no action for the cattle in his own name ; but he might lawfully, at any time, have taken them out of <em>Bond's </em>possession, notwithstanding any contract between himself and the officer. So might the officer, although he had made a return of the writ. The special property remained in him, and he had a complete right to the possession ; and his exercising that right was no injury to <em>Bond.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AbIR\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
