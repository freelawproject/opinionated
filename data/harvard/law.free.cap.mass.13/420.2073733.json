Since the erection of the said dam, the plaintiffs have shut down their said gate, and flowed their meadow at pleasure, during the winter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-14\">The defendant owns a grist-mill, which has been built about fifty years, situated about three quarters of a mile below the plaintiffs\u2019 dam, and on the same stream ; to which, before the erection of the said dam, the water ran without impediment through the meadow of the plaintiffs ; and now, all the water of said stream, after it has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>raised to the height of the plaintiffs\u2019 dam by shutting down said gate, runs in its ancient channel to the said grist-mill ; except what is absorbed in the soil of their said meadow, or evaporated. But, while the water is rising, after the said gate is shut down, the defend ant\u2019s said grist-mill is nearly useless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-5\">On the 25th of November, 1815, the plaintiffs shut down their said gate, and thereby stopped the water of said stream, so that the defendant was unable to use his mill, except during a short time each day. Wherefore, at the time in the declaration mentioned, the defendant drew up and took away the said gate, and thereby prevented the plaintiffs from overflowing their said meadow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-6\">* If, in the opinion of the Court, the plaintiffs could by law maintain this action, the defendant agreed to be defaulted, and that the plaintiffs\u2019 damages should be assessed by a jury ; otherwise, the plaintiffs were to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-7\">Worthington, for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao-\">agreed, that, if they could not lawfully erect and keep up the dam and gate, the defendant had good and lawful right to take down the gate, in the manner he had done But he contended, that the owner of land, through which a stream of water runs, has a complete right to the use of such water for the purpose of irrigating his land ; although, if he does the same thing idly, and for no purpose, or for the purpose of incommoding his neighbour, an action would lie against him. The facts in the case of <em>Weston </em>vs. <em>Alden </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> were very like those in the case at bar ; and the decision is very full. \u201c A man owning a close on an ancient brook may lawfully use the water thereof for the purposes of husbandry, as watering his cattle, or irrigating the close ; \u2014 and, if the owner of a close below is damaged thereby, it is <em>damnum absque </em>injuria.\u201d The difference between sluices in that case and a dam in this, and a mill hero and other useful purposes of husbandry there, cannot be material. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-8\">Richardson, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aoy\">cited the authorities in the margin. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b337-11\"> 8 <em>Mass.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AsM\">delivered the opinion of the Court. In the case of <em>Hodges </em>vs. <em>Raymond &amp; </em>al., cited from 9 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>316, the common law doctrine is recognized ; one, having a right to a watercourse to carry his mill, may justify entering upon the land of one who has erected any obstruction, to remove it. That is precisely the case of the defendant in this action ; unless the purpose for which the dam was erected by the plaintiff, namely, to irrigate and fertilize his meadow, forms an exception to the general rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>According to the case cited from 1 <em>Wils. </em>175, the plaintiffs had no right to adopt any new measure to irrigate *their land, the consequence of which would be injurious to the priyilege below. But it has been urged, u'$tt the case of <em>Weston </em>vs. <em>Alden </em>is an authority in point, to establish the right claimed by the plaintiffs. There is, however, this difference between that case and the one now before us., In that case, there was no obstruction to the course of the water; sluices-were made for it into the land of the defendant in that action, and the water, after washing his lands, still passed down the natural channel. Nor does it appear in that case, that the plaintiff had acquired a' right by prescription to the use of the stream, to carry works which had been erected and maintained at expense ; but he had merely enjoyed the natural benefits of the stream, without any labor or expense of his own. In the case before us, the whole stream was stopped, or, at least, so much of it as to render the defendant\u2019s mill entirely useless. There is no principle upon which this can be justified ; and we think that the defendant had a perfect right to remove the gate which occasioned him the injury. The plaintiffs must be called.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\n<em>Plaintiffs nonsui\u00bf</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
