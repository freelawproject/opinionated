The defendant exhibited his account against the said house, of the aforesaid services, consisting of a great number of items, charged at different times, including part of the same period in which the plaintiff\u2019s charges against him were made ; and he offered to prove that the said services were rendered as charged. He did not offer to show that his said account had ever been exhibited to the said <em>Harrison Wilby, </em>or in any manner liquidated or assented to by them ; and the plaintiff denied that such services had ever been rendered to the said partners ; or that he,.as surviving partner, was in any manner liable therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-6\">The said account had not been filed by way of set-off, according to the provisions of the statute of 1784, <em>c. </em>28, \u00a7 12.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-7\">The judge rejected all the evidence offered hy the defendant, and a verdict having been returned for the plaintiff, the defendant moved for a new trial on account of that rejection.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Afb\">*At the last October term, <em>Ward, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbnW\">contended, that the goods for which the plaintiff now demanded payment were themselves in truth delivered to the defendant in payment for the labor and services which he offered to prove at the trial. It must be considered as the original contract between <em>Harrison </em>and the defendant, that the services of the latter should be set off against this demand. There was never an understanding that money should be demanded or paid on either side, except for an eventual surplus or balance. Nothing can be more unjust than to demand this money of the defendant, and to turn him over to the insolvent estate of <em>Harrison </em>for a partial payment of this demand. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b396-9\"><em>Peabody, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au7H\">insisted, that the defendant\u2019s account, not being filed according to the statute, nor pleaded as a set-off, nor being between the said parties, could not avail him in this action. It cannot be considered as payment; because no agreement is pretended as to the price or value of the services, and no adjustment was ever made between the parties to the transaction. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b396-11\"> 10 <em>Mass.

It finds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>that <em>Harrison </em>was indebted to the defendant for work and labor ; that he agreed to pay for the same in goods from the store in which he was concerned as a partner ; and that the goods, for the price of which the present action was brought, were delivered in pursuance of that arrangement. The goods were, in truth, never sold to the defendant, but were delivered to him in payment of a preexisting debt ; and, although a part of the labor was performed after some of the goods were delivered, that will not vary the character of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Either partner had sufficient control of the goods, for a pur pose like this ; for, as it respects their interests, it may be considered a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">* There never was any implied agreement or promise by the defendant to pay for these goods ; and, if there were, it was a promise to pay in labor, which would defeat this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\n<em>New trial granted</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
