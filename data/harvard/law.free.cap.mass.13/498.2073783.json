B. afterwards obtained the deed by fraud, caused it to be recorded, and then mortgaged the land. The title of the mortgagee was maintained against A.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-10\">This was a plea of land for one half of a farm in Pepperell, in this county, the demandant counting on his own seizin in fee and in mortgage within twenty years. The said <em>Oliver Newhall </em>pleaded <em>non disseisivit, </em>on which issue was joined. <em>Ezekiel Newhall, </em>the other tenant, was defaulted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-11\">At the trial of the said issue, which was bad at the sittings here after the last October term, before <em>Putnam, </em>J., the demandant, to maintain the issue on his part, produced a deed from the said <em>Oliver </em>to the said <em>Ezekiel, </em>conveying the demanded premises in fee with warranty, dated the 16th of March, 1805, and recorded the 30th of June, 1809 ; the execution of which was duly proved by one of the subscribing witnesses ; also, a mortgage of the same premises from the said <em>Ezekiel </em>to the demandant, dated the 14th of March, 1814, acknowledged and recorded the 28th of the same month.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-12\">The said <em>Oliver </em>stated in defence, that, after the premises were conveyed by him to the said <em>Ezekiel, </em>and before the deed was recorded, it was agreed between them, that the bargain should be re scinded, and the deed given up by <em>Ezekiel </em>to <em>Oliver, </em>which was done accordingly ; and that the said <em>Ezekiel </em>obtained the deed clandestinely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>and by fraud, from the said Oliver, and put it upon record. To prove this statement, the said <em>Oliver </em>offered to give in evidence the declarations of the said <em>Ezekiel </em>Newhall, made after the deed from <em>Oliver </em>to him had been given up, and before the deed from <em>Ezekiel </em>to the demandant had been executed, which evidence was admitted, notwithstanding the demandant objected thereto.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AqL1\">* <em>W. Wright </em>testified,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbI\">that he was at work with the said <em>Ezekiel </em>in the latter part of June, 1809, when the said <em>Ezekiel </em>said, that, when he settled with his father, the said <em>Oliver, </em>the old man was careless, and he <em>[Ezekiel] </em>got the deed which was to have been given up ; that it was not.upon record, but he intended to wait till the old man died, and then he would put it on record, and would be as well off as any of them. There was other testimony, proving the declarations of the said Ezekiel, as to the rescinding of the original agreement, and the giving up of the deed, as above stated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-7\">It appeared from the evidence, that the said <em>Ezekiel </em>had a family, and lived on the premises with the said <em>Oliver, </em>until the spring of 1809, in which year he removed to <em>Bolton, </em>and the next year into the <em>District of Maine, </em>from whence he returned in 1814, and occupied the premises that year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-8\">There was no evidence to prove that the said original deed from <em>Oliver </em>to <em>Ezekiel </em>was given up, and the bargain rescinded as aforesaid, but the declarations of the said <em>Ezekiel, </em>made after that transaction, and before the execution of the deed to the demandant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-9\">If the evidence, which was admitted as aforesaid, should have been rejected, a new trial was to be granted ; otherwise judgment was to be rendered for the tenant, upon the verdict returned for him.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-10\"><em>Bigelow, </em>for the tenant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Agzn\">insisted, that the declarations of a party to the suit were always deemed good as against such party and all claiming under him. It was the demandant\u2019s mistake to join <em>Ezekiel </em>in tuts action, by which means his declarations became competent evidence. That the giving up the deed operated to divest the estate from <em>Ezekiel, </em>and to revest it in <em>Oliver, </em>he cited the case of <em>The Commonwealth </em>vs. <em>Dudley. </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AUI\"><em>Lawrence, </em>for the demandant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Axcc\">The action was well brought against the mortgagor and the tenant in * possession ; and in no case can the declarations of one defendant be evidence for his co-defendant. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-13\">It is well settled in our country, although the law is not so in <em>England, </em>that, when a deed not recorded is cancelled, the estate re-vests in the grantor. But cancelling must be understood technically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>For, if a deed be delivered up to the grantor, and afterwards gets to the hands of the grantee uncancelled, it will still have force as a conveyance. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-5\">The demandant had good right to rely on the title of <em>Ezekiel, </em>who produced the deed of his grantor, duly acknowledged and recorded. The acknowledgment of a grantor is not sufficient proof of the execution of a deed. The subscribing witness must be produced. And, since cancelling a deed passes a title here, as good evidence should be required of such cancelling as of the execution of a deed in other cases. <footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b398-14\"> 10 <em>Mass Rep. </em>403.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b398-15\"> 1 <em>Mass.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8Q\">delivered the opinion of the Court. Without determining on the propriety of admitting evidence of the declarations of <em>Ezekiel Newhall, </em>tending to defeat the title of the demand-ant, derived directly from him, of which there is certainly reason to doubt; we all think the verdict clearly wrong. For, on the supposition that those declarations were competent evidence, they do not, of themselves, impeach the demandant\u2019s title.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\"><em>Oliver Newhall, </em>the father, made his deed to <em>Ezekiel Newhall, </em>the son, and thus vested in him the title to the land. This title, thus created, could not be destroyed, to the prejudice of a <em>bona, fide </em>purchaser of <em>Ezekiel, </em>without an actual cancelling of the deed <footnotemark>[\u2020</footnotemark> which had been given to him. An agreement to rescind the bargain did not rescind it; and, although the deed was returned to the father, and was afterwards retaken fraudulently by the son, the title remained in him as to purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The mortgage to the demandant was made in 1814. The deed from <em>Oliver </em>to <em>Ezekiel </em>had been then four or five years upon record, and <em>Ezekiel </em>was at that time in * possession of the land. Now to permit him, from whom the title flowed, under such circumstances, to reclaim the land against his own deed, by parol evidence of a secret bargain between him and his grantee, would be to destroy all faith in records and deeds, and to set afloat titles to real estate, which it is the policy of our law to make depend upon solemn and public acts, and not upon loose and uncertain oral testimony. The verdict is set aside, and</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">\n<em>A new trial granted.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"[\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b399-12\"> Even <em>cancelling </em>the deed would not be sufficient to destroy the grantee\u2019s tita See 9 <em>Pick. </em>105. \u2014 <em>Greenleaf on Evidence, </em>302, 303, and cases cited. \u2014 Ed.]</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
