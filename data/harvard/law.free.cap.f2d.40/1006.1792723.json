Bookman, 22 F. (2d) 930, decided December 5, 1927; and that the examiner erred in refusing to per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>mit applicant to urge <em>that </em>the deseriptiveness of opposer\u2019s mark.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-5\">\n<em>\u201cIt is believed that the prior adjudicartions of the Courts involving the rights of the parties to this proceeding are conclusive of the question involved in the instant case, vis., whether the applicant is entitled to the registration for which she has made application.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">\u201cIn the U. S. District Court, Southern District of New York, in the case .entitled Oakland Chemical Company, Plaintiff, against Rose Nerenstone, doing business as the Peroxogen Company of America, Judge Knox handed down a decision May 14, 1927, holding that \u2018the name adopted by the defendant is an infringement of plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark admist [admits] of little doubt,\u2019 but that \u2018Dioxogen is descriptive of peroxide of hydrogen, and therefore, not capable of exclusive appropriation and registration.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">\u201cOn appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, the decision of the District Judge was affirmed (December 5,1927), Judge Hand, in delivering the decision of the Court, holding in effect that \u2018Dioxogen would infringe as much as peroxygen\u2019 and that these and like terms describe the class of substances to which the product belongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">\u201cIt follows from these adjudications that registration of the applicant\u2019s mark is prohibited by section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of Feb. 20,1905 (15 USCA \u00a7 85), which provides :</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">\u201c \u2018That no mark which consists * * \u2022 merely in words or devices which are descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods, * * * shall be registered under the terms \u2022of this subdivision of this chapter.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">\u201cAs to the applicant\u2019s contention that the \u25a0examiner erred in not permitting the applicant to urge lack of ownership of the mark on the part of opposer, it may be stated that a trade-mark use of a mark is not necessary in a proceeding of this kind. If the opposer can show in any way that it would probably be damaged by the registration of the applicant\u2019s mark, it has the right to bring opposition proceedings. There is nothing -in the Trade-Mark statute which says that a person must own a trade-mark, registered or not, before he can oppose the registration of the mark to another person. (Touraine Company v. F. B. Washburn &amp; Co., 309 O. G. 676, 52 App. D. C. 356, 286 F. 1020, 1923 C. D. 174.)\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">Counsel for appellant concurs in the view -expressed by the Commissioner that appellee\u2019s mark \u201cDioxogen\u201d is descriptive and that it was so held by the Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, in the ease of Oakland Chemical Co. v. Rose Nerenstone Bookman, doing business as the Peroxogen Co. of America, 22 F.(2d) 930, 18 T. M. R. 1. However, counsel takes exception to the statement in the Commissioner\u2019s decision that appellant\u2019s mark \u201cPeroxogen\u201d was also held to be descriptive. It is further contended that, as its mark has been held to be descriptive, appellee is not entitled to the exclusive use and is- not the owner of the mark \u201cDioxogen\u201d; that appellee cannot invoke the confusion in trade clause of section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February, 1905 (15 US CA \u00a7 85), as the basis of its opposition; and that, as appellee cannot show \u201cstatutory injury\u201d by the registration of appellant\u2019s mark, appellant is entitled to have her mark registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-13\">It is evident that the marks of the contending parties are used on goods of the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-14\">In the case of the Oakland Chemical Co. v. Rose Nerenstone Bookman, etc., supra, the Circuit Court of Appeals, in its statement of the ease, said:</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-15\">\u201cThe parties are both citizens of New York and the jurisdiction of the District Court depended wholly upon the registration of the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark, \u2018Dioxogen,\u2019 whose infringement by the defendant\u2019s mark, \u2018Peroxogen,\u2019 was the gist of the suit. Peroxide of hydrogen is a chemical product, so called because it consists of a molecule of two atoms of oxygen and two of hydrogen. Its use as a disinfectant is old, and the plaintiff began to make and sell it in 1890, under the name, \u2018Peroxide of Hydrogen, O. C.,\u2019 though its more proper chemical name is \u2018dioxide of hydrogen,\u2019 or \u2018hydrogen dioxide.\u2019 The plaintiff, after using the second of these names for a while, in 1901 changed to \u2018Dioxogen,\u2019 which it registered as a trade-mark in 1903 and again in 1924. It has spent large sums in advertising the product under that name, and has registered the same mark in more than 30 foreign countries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-16\">\u201cThe defendant sells the same product under the name \u2018Peroxogen,\u2019 but without attempting otherwise to invade the plaintiff\u2019s good will. Since the suit depends upon registration, no questions of secondary user, or of other unfair competition at common law, arise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-17\">The court held that the mark \u201cDioxogen\u201d was descriptive and accordingly affirmed the judgment of the District Court dismissing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>the bill of eomplaint. In its opinion, among other things, the Circuit Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-4\">\u201cWhile that is indeed not itself an English word at all, its composition is apparent. \u2018Di\u2019 is not an unknown prefix \u2014 e. g., \u2018diphthong,\u2019 \u2018dilemma,\u2019 \u2018dichotomy,\u2019 and \u2018diptych\u2019 \u2014and in scientific and technical terminology it is common. Its significance as a prefix to oxygen would be plain to a literate person; the word would mean \u2018double oxygen.\u2019 True, it would still remain ambiguous; but then too, so would \u2018dioxide,\u2019 standing alone, a word of common speech. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-5\">\u201cIt fails also in the second. \u2018Dioxide\u2019 would infringe as much as \u2018peroxygen\u2019 \u2014 more indeed \u2014 and yet.it is the only proper word to describe the class of compounds among which the plaintiff\u2019s product is. Certainly the defendant could have used it. Indeed, \u2018double oxygen\u2019 itself would be an equal infringement. Both these are actual words. In a suit for unfair trade perhaps the plaintiff could forbid such words as \u2018peroxygen\u2019 or \u2018bioxygen,\u2019 for these are coined, and it is no hardship to prevent their use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">Whether the Commissioner rightly construed the court\u2019s decision as holding that the word \u201cperoxygen\u201d was descriptive, need not give us great concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">Funk &amp; Wagnalls\u2019 New Standard Dictionary defines the words \u201cPeroxide,\u201d \u201cDioxide,\u201d and \u201cProtoxid\u201d as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">\u201cPeroxide, <em>n. </em>1. <em>Ghem. </em>An oxid having a larger proportion of oxygen than any other oxid of the same series: Contrasted with <em>protoxid. </em>2. <em>Same as Hydrogen dioxide </em>(Beginning \u201cSame\u201d italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-10\">\u201cDioxide, <em>n. Ghem. </em>An oxid containing; two atoms of oxygen to the moleeule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-11\">\u201cProtoxid, <em>n. Ghem. </em>An oxid containing-only one atom of oxygen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-12\"> The question of the deseriptiveness of' appellant\u2019s mark, in view of the quoted definitions, requires no discussion. Obviously, if' the word \u201cDioxogen\u201d is descriptive, the word \u201cPerbxogen\u201d is none the less so. If neither is descriptive, then, in our opinion, the use-by appellant of the mark \u201cPeroxogen\u201d on goods possessing the same descriptive properties as those on which appellee uses its registered mark \u201cDioxogen\u201d would be likely to-cause confusion in the mind of the publie and. to deceive purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-13\">The right to oppose-the registration of a trade-mark is not limited to those who-possess exclusive ownership of a similar-mark; nor are the Patent Office tribunals-limited, in an opposition proceeding, to a-consideration of the precise questions- presented in a notice of opposition. On the contrary, in such a proceeding, they may dispose-of any question relating to the proposed registration that might properly be considered in an ex parte case. California Cyanide Co., v. American Cyanamid Co. (Cust. <em>&amp; </em>Pat. App.) 40 F.(2d) 1013, decided concurrently herewith, and eases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-14\">For the reasons stated, the decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
