That from a date prior to the date of alleged use of the trade mark sought to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>registered, and continuously to the present time, the American Cyanamid Company has used the trade mark \u2018Calcium Cyanide\u2019 in interstate commerce for fumigants, and that the trade mark \u2018Caleyanide\u2019 is deceptively similar thereto.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">The ease was submitted to the Examiner of Interferences upon an agreed statement of facts. It appears therefrom that the goods of the parties possess the same descriptive properties; that the words \u201ccalcium cyanide\u201d have been used on its goods by appellee since 1921; that appellant has used the trade* mark \u201cCaleyanide\u201d on its goods since December,. 1925; that the goods of the parties are sold and used in practically all parts of the United States; that \u201ccalcium eyanidei\u201d is a chemical compound; and that the fumigant of appellant \u201ccontains commercially pure calcium cyanide,\u201d whereas that of appellee \u201ccontains crude calcium cyanide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">We quote from the agreed statement of facte:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-6\">\u201c10. Eimer and Amend catalogue \u2022 dated August, 1920, lists on page 194 the materials Oale-sinter and Calc-tufa as chemicals in stock and for sale. These names designate, calcium compounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-7\">\u201c11. The Pharmacopoeia of the United States of America (1926) lists calcium salts giving the word \u2018Caleii\u2019 as the designation for calcium on pages 86-91. On pages 92 and 93 the word \u2018calx\u2019 is used to designate lime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-8\">\u201c12. M. W. Randall and Victor I. Safro if called and examined as witnesses on behalf of applicant would testify that the term \u2018Caleyanide\u2019 was coined and adopted by the applicant, California Cyanide Company, as a trade mark for its product because it suggests one of the ingredients of the product to which it is applied; because it suggests the name of the applicant \u2014 \u2018Cal\u2019 being the abbreviation .for California and \u2018Cyanide\u2019 being the second word in applicant\u2019s name; and because it is in harmony with applicant\u2019s established trade marks \u2018Caley\u2019 and \u2018C'aleyeo.\u2019 \u201d \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">The sole question for determination is whether the term \u201ccaleyanide\u201d is descriptive or merely suggestive of- appellant\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-10\">It is conceded that the words \u201ccalcium cyanide\u201d used by appellee are descriptive, and that appellee is not the exclusive owngr of those words for trade-mark purposes. If the term \u201cCaleyanide\u201d is descriptive, the opposition was properly sustained. If it is merely suggestive, appellant is entitled to registration of its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-11\">The Examiner of Interferences held that the words \u201ccalcium cyanide\u201d were purely descriptive of appellee\u2019s goods, that they did not perform the function of indicating origin, and that, as appellee was not the owner of the mark \u201cCalcium Cyanide,\u201d it could not, under the statute, oppose the registration of appellant\u2019s mark \u201cCaleyanide.\u201d The question of whether or not the mark \u201cCaleyanide\u201d was \u201cdescriptive\u201d was not discussed in the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">On appeal, the Commissioner of Patents' held that the opposer, appellee, had the legal right, if it could show that it would be damaged thereby, to oppose the registration of appellant\u2019s mark \u201cCaleyanide,\u201d although, due to the fact that its mark \u201cCalcium Cyanide\u201d was descriptive, it (appellee) did not have the right to its exclusive use and was not the owner thereof. In support of his -holding, the Commissioner of Patents cited the case of Touraine Co. v. F. B. Washburn &amp; Co., 52 App. D. C. 356, 286 F. 1020, 1022, 1923 C. D. 174, and quoted the following from the decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-13\">\u201cOf course, a trade-mark use of a mark is not necessary in a proceeding of this kind. If the opposer can show in any way that he would probably be damaged by its registration to the applicant he may do so-. The trade-mark statute (section 6, 33 Stat. 726 [Comp. St. \u00a7 9491 (15 USCA \u00a7 86)]) is our chart. There is nothing im it which says that a person must own a trade-mark, registered or not, before he can oppose the registration of the mark to another person. All that the statute requires of him, according to our interpretation, is to prove facts which, if true, would tend to show that he would probably be damaged by the registration.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1028-14\">In holding that appellant\u2019s mark \u201cCaleyanide\u201d was descriptive, and therefore not registerable as a trade-mark, the Commissioner said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-15\">\u201cA comparison of the two marks shows that they have the same essential characteristics as to appearance and meaning. The applicant\u2019s mark consists merely in writing calcium cyanide as one word, omitting the syllables \u2018cium\u2019 of the first. By stipulation it is agreed that \u2018calc\u2019 has been written for calcium in compound words including calcium; also-, that it is common practice to write the words calcium cyanide either sis two words or as a single word. It is also stipulated that calcium cyanide is the name of a chemical compound known for a number of years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1028-16\">\u201cWith this understanding of the facts in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>volved, it must be held that tbe applicant\u2019s mark is a mere variant of the opposer\u2019s mark, and is descriptive of tbe chemical compound calcium cyanide. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">It is claimed by appellant that tbe mark \u201cCaleyanide\u201d is not descriptive, but, on tbe contrary, is merely suggestive of tbe ingredients, qualities, or characteristics of its fumigants, that it is not found in tbe dictionaries nor in tbe \u201ccommon language of tbe trade,\u201d and that it is merely a coined word used to indicate the origin of appellant\u2019s product.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">Tbe second proviso of section 5 of tbe Trade-mark Act of 1905 (15 USCA \u00a7 85) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1029-7\">\u201c * * * Provided, That no mark which consists merely in tbe name of an individual, firm, corporation, or association not written, printed, impressed, or woven in some particular or distinctive manner, or in association with a portrait of tbe individual, <em>or merely in words or devices which are descriptive of- the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods, or merely a geographical name or term, shall be registered under the terms of this subdivision of this chapter. * </em>* * \u201d (Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">Although a descriptive mark is not registerable as a trade-mark, one that is merely suggestive of tbe character or quality of goods is entitled to registration. Orange Crush Co. v. California Crushed Fruit Co., 54 App. D. C. 313, 297 F. 892. There are many other decisions of tbe courts to tbe same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">It appears from tbe record that tbe word \u201ccalcium\u201d is frequently abbreviated and tbe word \u201ccalc\u201d is substituted therefor as a part of a compound word to indicate calcium compounds; for example, \u201cCalc-sinter\u201d and \u25a0\u201cCalc-tufa.\u201d Tbe word \u201cCaleii\u201d is also used to designate calcium.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">Cyanide is a \u201ccompound of cyanogen with a metallic element or radical.\u201d Funk <em>&amp; </em>Wagnalls\u2019 New Standard Dictionary. Tbe same authority defines \u201ccalcium\u201d as \u201ca silver-white, malleable,' metallic element, never occurring free, but widely distributed in combination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-12\">There are many calcium, as well as many cyanide, compounds. In view of tbe faet that both calcium and cyanide are compounds, neither ever occurring free, and as the word \u201ccalcium\u201d is frequently abbreviated to\u2019 \u201ccalc\u201d when used in conjunction with other words to designate calcium compounds, it would seem to be evident that tbe word \u201ccaleyanide\u201d is but an abbreviation of tbe term \u201ccalcium cyanide.\u201d If tbe word \u201ccalc\u201d is used with tbe word \u201ccyanide\u201d \u2014 caleyanide\u2014to designate calcium cyanide, tbe trade-mark of appellant has been formed by merely omitting tbe letter \u201ce\u201d in either cyanide or calc and using tbe two words as one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-14\">Counsel for appellant argues that tbe word \u201ccaleyanide\u201d is merely highly suggestive. <em>We </em>are not of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-15\">In view of tbe facts of record, we think that tbe involved mark is reasonably descriptive of appellant\u2019s fumigant, and that it is not indicative of its origin, but of its quality and character. See Drive It Yourself Co. v. North et al., 148 Md. 609, 130 A. 57; In re Central Consumers Company, 32 App. D. C. 523; Electro Steel Co. v. Lindenberg Steel Co., 43 App. D. C. 270; In re Swan &amp; Finch Co., 49 App. D. C. 94, 259 F. 990; In re Alvah Bushnell Co., 49 App. D. C. 133, 261 F. 1013; In re Charles R. Long, Jr., Co., 51 App. D. C. 399, 280 F. 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-16\">It is well settled that the statutory right to oppose tbe registration of a trademark does not depend upon tbe exclusive ownership by an opposer of a similar mark. It is only necessary that tbe opposer establish that be would probably be damaged by tbe registration of an applicant\u2019s mark. Touraine Co. v. F. B. Washburn &amp; Co., supra; Broderick v. L. Mitchell <em>&amp; </em>Co., 53 App. D. C. 220, 289 F. 618, and eases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-17\">Section 7 of tbe Trade-mark Act of February, 1905 (15 USCA \u00a7 <em>87), </em>provides that <em>\u201c </em>* * * in every case of interference or opposition to registration be [tbe Commissioner of Patents] shall direct tbe examiner in charge of interferences to determine tbe <em>question of the right of registration to such trade-mark, </em>and of tbe sufficiency of objections to registration. * * * \u201d (Italics ours.) Accordingly, tbe Patent Office tribunals may, in an opposition proceeding, dispose of any question relating to tbe proposed registration that might properly arise in an ex parte case. In re Herbst, 32 App. D. C. 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-18\">In view of tbe faet that appellant\u2019s mark is descriptive of tbe goods of appellee as well as those of appellant and as appellee would probably be damaged by tbe registration complained of, it had a legal right to oppose such registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-19\">For tbe reasons stated, the decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
