Appellee (applicant) states use on and for \u201cwearing apparel for men, women, and children\u2014 namely middies and sport shirts made of knitted and textile fabrics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-22\">We think the case is on-all fours with one between the same parties, No. 2209, 40 F.(2d) 121, heard and decided concurrently herewith, wherein the words at issue are \u201cZipper\u201d and \u201cZip-Kniek.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-23\">The only resemblance in the marks themselves is contained in the single syllable \u201cZip.\u201d In the instant case the imposition of the word \u201cKenilworth\u201d over or upon the larger letters \u201cZip-Midy\u201d tends to make the resemblance even more remote than that existing between the marks \u201cZipper\u201d and \u201cZipKniek\u201d in plain letters in case 2209.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-24\">We think the marks are entirely dissimilar and that the use by appellee of \u201cZipMidy,\u201d as proposed, would not be likely to cause confusion in the mind of the public or deceive purchasers, and should be admitted to registration.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-25\">The decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b148-27\">BLAND, Associate Judge (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"b148-28\">This is a companion case to suit No. 2209, 40 F.(2d) 121, and suit No. 2211, 40 F.(2d) 125, between the same parties. In suit No.. 2209, the Kenilworth Manufacturing Company was granted'registration for the term \u201cZip-Kniek\u201d as applied to certain kinds of men\u2019s, women\u2019s, and children\u2019s knickers, etc. In suit No. 2211, it was granted the right to register the term \u201cZip-Over\u201d in connection with the word \u201cKenilworth\u201d for use on sweaters and sweat shirts, and in this case appellee was granted the right to register \u201cZip-Midy\u201d in connection with the word \u201cKenilworth\u201d for use on wearing apparel for men, women, and children, including a middy, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-29\">For the reasons set out in suit No. 2209, decided concurrently herewith, I dissent from the views of my associates.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
