In the meantime a credit had been made on the tax in question of an overpayment on a tax for a later year.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The findings further show that upon receipt of a claim, in abatement it was the common practice to hold up the collection of an additional assessment, and that the collector of internal revenue acted in accordance with the practice in this case and made no endeav- or to collect the amount covered by the claim in abatement until after the claim had been finally adjusted by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The facts bring the ease squarely within the rules announced by this court in the Oak Worsted Mills Case, 36 F.(2d) 529, decided December 2, 1929, and the Gotham Can Co. Case, 37 F.(2d) 793, decided January 20, 1930. Following the rules laid down in these eases, it is ordered that plaintiff\u2019s petition be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
