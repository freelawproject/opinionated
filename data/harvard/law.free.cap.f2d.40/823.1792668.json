In support of his contention he relies largely on the decision of this court in American Soda Fountain Co. v. Parsons, 32 F.(2d) 737, 739. But that ease is not applicable, for there the property in controversy and which the Soda Fountain Company sought to reclaim was in the possession of the trustee, having come into the custody of the court from the bankrupt- when the petition in bankruptcy was filed. In such case there can be no doubt that a trustee has the rights of a lien creditor in property of the bankrupt so possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">But in <em>the </em>instant ease <em>the </em>property is not in the possession of the trustee and has not been since the filing of the petition in bankruptcy. The agreed finding is that at the time of the filing of the petition the property was in the possession of Tafeen, where it has since remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Section 47a (2) of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended in 1910 (11 USCA \u00a7 75(a)(2), provides: \u201cAnd such trustees, as to all property in the custody or coming into the custody of the bankruptcy court, shall be deemed vested with all the rights, -remedies, and powers of a creditor holding a lien by legal or equitable proceedings thereon; and also, as to all property not in the custody of the bankruptcy court, shall be deemed vested with ah the rights, remedies, and powers of a judgment creditor holding an execution duly returned unsatisfied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">In Clark v. Snelling, 205 F. 240, 243, this court held that under the last clause of section 47a(2), a trustee having the rights of a Massachusetts, judgment creditor would not have a lien on property \u201cnot coming into the custody of the bankruptcy court\u201d; for, under the law of Massachusetts, a judgment creditor does not have a lien upon his debtor\u2019s property, real or personal. It was there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-11\">\u201cIf, in most states, sueh a creditor [a judgment creditor] would have a lien, in Massachusetts he would not, unless before his judgment he had attached the land. Not having so attached it) his judgment and execution would give him no rights in it before he had taken it on execution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">The question, therefore, is whether under the facts in this ease the trustee has the right of -a creditor \u201cholding a lien by legal or equitable proceedings,\u201d upon the property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\">If the property was \u201cin the custody\u201d (actual possession) of the bankruptcy court through its trustee, there would be no question about the <em>trastee </em>having a lien thereon. American Soda Fountain Co. v. Parsons, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\">If, at the time the petition in bankruptcy was filed, the property was \u201ccoming into the custody\u201d of the court, that is, was in the constructive possession of the bankruptcy court, though in the actual possession of the bankrupt or of a third person under a merely colorable claim of <em>right, </em>there would likewise be no question.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-15\">But, according to the facts in this case, the property at the time the petition in bankruptcy was filed was not in the actual or constructive possession of the bankruptcy court, but in the actual possession of Tafeen under a substantial claim of right, not a merely colorable one. Boyle v. Gray (C. C. A.) 28 F. (2d) 7, 15; Harding v. Federal Nat. Bank (C. C. A.) 31 F.(2d) 914, 918. This being the case, the trustee did not have the right of a creditor holding a lien upon the property. Massachusetts Trust Co. v. MacPherson (C. C. A.) 1 F.(2d) 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-16\">In this case the trust company was in possession, having taken possession before the bankruptcy petition was filed in the enforcement of its equitable claim of right. Its claim of right was substantial, not merely colorable; and it was held that the trustee did not have the rights of a creditor holding lien on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-17\">\u201cAgreements creating equitable liens in property, when established, are recognized and enforced in Massachusetts, where this contract was made.\u201d Crosby v. Packer (C. C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>A.) 22 F.(2d) 611, 613; Massachusetts Trust Co. v. MacPherson (C. C. A.) 1 F.(2d) 769.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">The decree of the District Court is affirmed, with costs to the appellee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
