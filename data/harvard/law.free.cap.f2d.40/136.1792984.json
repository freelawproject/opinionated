Nothing was said as to the date on which a credit should be regarded as taken. In these sections Congress primarily was concerned with the dates from which and to which interest should be computed upon overpayments to be refunded and over-payments for one year to be credited against deficiencies for another year. In the ease of credits, this period was definitely fixed. As to additional assessments the period as fixed by section 1019 of the Revenue Act of 1924 was from the dat\u00e9 of the overpayment to the date of the assessment of the deficiency; in the Revenue Act of 1926 it was from the date of overpayment to the date on which the amount constituting the deficiency should have been paid, in respect of the additional assessments for years prior to 1921 and in respect of additional assessments for 1921 and subsequent years from the date of the overpayment to the date of the assessment of the additional tax. Riverside <em>&amp; </em>Dan River Cotton Mills, Inc., v. United States (CL Cl.) 37 F.(2d) 965, decided February 10, 1930. The date on which a credit is taken or is made effective under the statute is the same, wheth- ' er made under the 1924 act or under the 1926 act. For the reasons stated by the court in West Leechburg Steel Company v. United States, supra, we think a credit is made effective and is taken on the date on which the Commissioner approves the schedule of abatements, credits, and refunds certified to him by the collector.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">The Commissioner is the executive directly in charge of the administrative branch of the government having to do with the assessment, collection, refund, and crediting of taxes. Girard Trust Co. et al. v. United States, 270 U. S. 163, 46 S. Ct. 229, 70 L. Ed. 524. The collector of internal revenue cannot act independently of him in these matters, except as to the collection of taxes shown by the taxpayer upon the return and not stayed by the filing of a claim for abatement or otherwise. The signing of.the schedule of overassessments by the Commissioner in the first instance and the making of a report by the collector to the Commissioner as to the status of the taxpayer\u2019s accounts are steps preliminary to making a credit effective. In the matter of credits the collector of internal revenue is merely the bookkeeper who reports the condition of the taxpayer\u2019s accounts to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue for final action.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">The parties in their briefs have confused the term \u201ccredit taken.\u201d The plaintiff contends that \u201cthe collector takes the credit,\u201d while the defendant insists that \u201cthe taxpayer takes the credit when he receives notice from the commissioner that it has been made.\u201d Neither position is correct. The law takes the credit when the Commissioner has performed the act necessary to make the credit effective under the statute, and, in the absence \u2018 of any statutory provision to the contrary, the credit is taken and is made effective when the Commissioner finally acts by approving the schedule certified to him by the collector. That which is thereafter done in respect of a credit is administrative and procedural, requiring no exercise of judgment or discretion. See Pittsburgh Bridge &amp; Iron Works v. U. S. (D. C. W. D., Pa.) 40 F.(2d) 692, par. 11, vol. 1, P. H. Feder\u00e9. Tax Service. Therefore the credits here involved were taken within the meaning of the statute prior to the eriaetment of the Revenue Act of 1926 and the amount of interest upon the overpay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>ments applied as credits is governed by section 1019 of the Revenue Act of 1924 (26 USCA \u00a7 153 note). The plaintiff is therefore entitled to' judgment for $15,190.19 as interest upon the credits mentioned from the dates of overpayment thereof to the date of the additional assessment of the tax against which credited. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">BOOTH, Chief Justice, and WILLIAMS, GREEN, and GRAHAM, Judges, concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
