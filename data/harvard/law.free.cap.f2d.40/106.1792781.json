The representation of the hotel, as adopted by the applicant, includes even the representation of the street ear and the horses and vehicles adopted by the op-poser. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">The ground of dismissal of the opposition was that the goods of the parties possess different descriptive properties, and, therefore the opposer, appellant\u2019s assignor, having based his notice of opposition wholly upon confusion in trade, did not present a statutory ground of opposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">The only question necessary for us to determine is whether the goods of the parties are of the same descriptive properties, as that term is used in section 5 of the Act of February 20, 1905, as amended (15 USCA \u00a7 85).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-16\">The construction of the phrase \u201csame descriptive properties\u201d has frequently been before the courts, and many conflicting decisions can be found upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-17\">This court at the present term, in a number of eases, has had occasion to review this question and the conflicting decisions with respect thereto. In the ease of B. F. Goodrich Co. v. Clive E. Hockmeyer (Zip-On Manufacturing Co., substituted), 40 F.(2d) 99, we definitely held, speaking of said section 5, that: \u201c * * \u201c The language \u201csame descriptive properties\u201d contained in the first <em>proviso </em>was intended by the Congress to relate to goods of the same general class; that such language was not intended to be more or less comprehensive than the term \u2018class\u2019 used in the first part of the section; that the language of the first <em>proviso </em>was intended to state the Converse of the mandates of the first part of the section, namely, that a mark by which the goods of the owner of the mark may not be distinguished from other goods of the same class <em>shall not be registered. </em>* * <em>*\u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-19\">In other words, this court holds that the word \u201cclass\u201d and the phrase \u201csame descriptive properties,\u201d as used in said section 5, are synonymous in their meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-20\">Applying this construction to the case at bar, we have no difficulty in holding that the goods of the parties to which the marks are applied are of the same descriptive, properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-21\">The Century Dictionary defines \u201cclass\u201d as follows: \u201c4. a number of objects distinguished by common characters from all others, and regarded as a collective unit or group; a collection capable of a general definition; a kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-22\">While this definition may not be sufficiently comprehensive, it is a correct statement of the common meaning of the word as ordinarily used.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-23\">Do the goods of the parties belong to a collection \u201ccapable of a general definition\u201d? We think they do. We may take judicial notice of the fact that the goods of both parties are commonly known as groceries, sold in the same stores and to the same class of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-24\">The word \u201cgroceries\u201d is defined in Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary as fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>lows: \u201cHousehold supplies for the table such as are dealt in by grocers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The Century Dictionary has the following definition of the word: \u201c3. General supplies for the table and for household use, as flour, sugar, spices, coffee, etc. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">We are clear that coffee and tea, the goods of appellant to which its mark is applied, and horse-radish, olive spread, cranberry jelly, relish spread, composed of a mixture, of eggs, oil, vinegar, and sweet pickles, sweet relish, composed of sweet pickles and curry seed, chili sauce, salad dressing, orange marmalade, mustard, tomato catchup, Thousand Island dressing, peanut butter, and mayonnaise, the goods of appellee to which its mark is applied, are of the same class; that they possess the -same descriptive properties, as that phrase is construed by this court; and that the Commissioner <em>erred </em>in dismissing the notice of opposition of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The decision of the Commissioner is reversed, and the ease remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views here expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
