Use of the word as a trade-mark was claimed to have begun in applicant\u2019s busi-\" ness March 8, 1926.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-29\">Opposition to the application was made by the appellee, American Cyanamid Company, who alleged that \u201cit believes it would be damaged by such registration,\u201d and stated its grounds of opposition to be:</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-30\">\u201cThat from a date prior to the date of alleged use of the trademark sought to be registered, and continuously to the present time, the American Cyanamid Company has used the trademark 'Citrus Dust\u2019 in interstate commerce for fumigants, and that the trademark 'Citrofume\u2019 is deceptively similar thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-31\">\u00ab Upon being required specifically to identify the clause or clauses of the Trade-Mark Registration Act (15 USCA \u00a7 81 et seq.) upon which it relied, opposer pointed out that language of section 5 (15 USCA \u00a7 85) which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-32\">\u201cThat trade-marks * * * -which so nearly resemble <em>a, </em>registered or known trade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>mark owned and in use by another and appropriated to merchandise of the same descriptive properties as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers shall not be registered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">No proof was taken in the ease, but a stipulation of facts was entered into upon which it was agreed that the proceeding be determined. The material portions of this stipulation recite that the words \u201cCitrus Dust\u201d were adopted and used by opposer (appellee) first in 1923 and have been since used on labels applied to material sold for fumigation; that labels bearing the words \u201cAero Brand Citrus Dust\u201d and \u201cCyanogas Citrus Dust,\u201d respectively, have been used on such materials; that the material is in powder form and used in the fumigation of citrus trees; that the product of applicant (appellant) is in powder form and has the same use; that . the products are used in the same territory; that the term \u201cCitrofume\u201d was coined ahd adopted by applicant in the latter part of the year 1925 and applied to shipments of its products, on January 27, 1926, and.March 6, 1926, being at first applied by means of a stencil and later by printed labels; that there has been wide use of the terms \u201cCitrofume\u201d and \u201cCitrus Dust,\u201d respectively, by the respective parties, in the citrus fruit region of the United States and in certain foreign countries; that the advertising of opposer and appellant has been, extensive and the sales of their respective products large.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">It was also stipulated that an article entitled \u201cFumigation Checks Aphis\u201d by a salesman of appellee might be introduced into the record; also that two certain persons, if called, would testify that \u201cthe term \u2018Citrofume\u2019 was coined and adopted by the Applii cant, California Cyanide Company, as a trade-mark for its product because of the faet that it suggests a fumigant especially adapted for the fumigation of citrus trees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">Paragraph 7 of the stipulation reads: \u201cThe material designated \u2018Citrus Dust\u2019 by American Cyanamid Company and the material designated \u2018Citrofume\u2019 by California Cyanide Company are goods of the same descriptive properties within the meaning of the trade mark law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">It appears that the words \u201cCitrus Dust,\u201d standing alone, have not been registered by appellee, but that they have been used as the stipulation recites, and there is one registration in the record which contains the words along with the word \u201ccyanogas.\u201d Appellee does not, however, rely upon registration, but upon prior use of the words in the manner recited in the stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">The Examiner of Interferences held that there could be no confusion in trade growing out of the use of the respective words, saying: \u201cConfusion in trade is obviously impossible unless both symbols perform the function of indicating origin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">He further held that, as used by the op-poser, the words \u201cCitrus Dust\u201d perform the function of deseriptiveness, and, expressing the belief that this right would not be restricted by the exclusive use of the notation \u201cCitrofume,\u201d dismissed the opposition and adjudged appellant entitled to the registration sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-12\">The Commissioner of Patents, upon appeal, took the view that the word \u201cCitrofume,\u201d under the facts reeited in the record, \u201calso, would be descriptive of the goods,\u201d and reversed the decision of the Examiner. The decision of the Commissioner rested solely upon the ground that applicant\u2019s mark was descriptive of the opposeris goods, and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1038-13\">\u201cWith this view of the question at issue, it seems unnecessary to pass upon the question as to whether the mark \u2018Citrofume\u2019 so nearly resembles the opposeris mark \u2018Citrus Dust\u2019 as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1038-14\">Before us both parties contend that their respective marks are not descriptive in the sense of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-15\">It is the insistence of appellee that, although the term \u201cCitrus Dust\u201d is not descriptive, nevertheless appellant\u2019s word \u201cCitrofume\u201d so nearly resembles \u201cCitrus Dust\u201d as that its application to the merchandise which we think is correctly described as being in faet and in law \u201cof the same descriptive properties\u201d is likely to cause confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-16\">Appellant insists in its brief that appellee\u2019s words \u201cCitrus Dust\u201d are descriptive, but that \u201cCitrofume\u201d is not, and that there is not sueh a resemblance as to cause confusion and so render the word nonregistrable under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-17\">We find ourselves unable to concur with the view taken by the Commissioner that the word \u201cCitrofume\u201d is descriptive of the goods or of the character or quality of the goods with which it is used. It is not a dictionary word, but was coined by appellant. It has no common meaning. It had no meaning whatever \u2014 indeed it did not exist \u2014 until applied to the product in question. It was not found in either common or trade language.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-18\">Since its application to the goods of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>pellant, the word has doubtless come to have a trade meaning. That is one trade-mark purpose. By reason of its use it may now have a common meaning in the sections where commonly used, but it was not, to our minds, descriptive of the goods in their quality or character at the time of its adoption by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">Standing alone and without the explanation given in the stipulation, the first impression which many would derive as to the meaning of the word probably would be that of a product made from a citrus ingredient rather than of something to be applied to a citrus tree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">At most, we think the word is nothing more than suggestive as to the nature of the goods upon the label of which it is applied, and the law recognizes a decided distinction between suggestiveness and deseriptiveness. Vide B. Altman &amp; Co., 7 Trade Mark Reporter, 560. In that case the Commissioner of Patents very aptly said: \u201cIt may be remarked further that not only have trademarks been designed for suggestiveness since ancient times, certainly antedating all Anglo-Saxon trade-mark laws, but that the growing modem habit of using suggestive marks almost universally is based on sound reasons of public policy; the multiplication of goods and makers of similar goods, and the ease and wide extent of shipping goods to distant markets, makes it necessary that the public be assisted to fix the mark in mind and remember it, by an association of ideas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-7\">In United Lace &amp; Braid Mfg. Co. v. Barthels Mfg. Co., 221 P. 456, 461 (D. C. E. D. New York, 1915), the court said: \u201cEvery good trade-mark is suggestive; once seen or heard, its association with the product is readily fixed in the mind. If there were no association of ideas between the two, it would require an independent effort of memory to recall the connection. It is not necessary to the validity of a trade-name that it should be utterly devoid of aptitude. It is enough that it leaves open to every one all words that are really descriptive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-8\">Difficulties are often encountered in determining where suggestiveness ends and deseiiptiveness begins, in the sense of the trademark laws, and it probably would not be possible to lay down a rule which would determine all eases, except in a most arbitrary manner. In any event, we shall not attempt to do so here. It seems sufficient to say that, for the reasons stated, we do 'not regard \u25a0\u201cCitrofume\u201d as being descriptive in the sense of the statute under which this proceeding is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-10\">We do not deem it necessary to determine whether appellee\u2019s words \u201cCitrus Dust\u201d are descriptive or not. There is no challenge to appellee\u2019s right to their use, as they have been used, and no question concerning the right of use or registration of them is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-11\">Appellee\u2019s use of \u201cCitrus Dust\u201d antedated appellant\u2019s adoption and use of \u201cCitrofume\u201d by some two and a half years. It is not necessary that one claiming use of a mark shall have that mark registered in order to oppose registration of another mark alleged to be nonregistrable under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-12\">In section 6 of the Trade-Mark Registration Act (15 USCA \u00a7 86) it is provided: \u201c * * * Any person who believes he would be damaged by the registration of a mark may oppose the same by filing notice of opposition, stating the grounds therefor. * * <em>*\u00bb \u25a0</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-14\">Conceding appellee\u2019s right to use the words \u201cCitrus Dust\u201d and to oppose appellant\u2019s application for registration in the instant proceeding, the remaining question to be determined is whether \u201cCitrofume\u201d bears such a resemblance to \u201cCitrus Dust\u201d as to cause confusion when applied to goods of the same descriptive properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-15\">We do not think it should be so held. The words have no similarity of sound when pronounced and no particular similarity of appearance when printed. One term consists of two common words; the other of one coined word, and the one word is not made up of syllables which cause it to look or sound like the two-word term. The concluding syllable \u201cfume\u201d of appellant\u2019s coined word has nothing in common in appearance or sound with \u201cdust.\u201d The ordinary meaning of the one differs from the ordinary meaning of the other. They are not synonyms in their customary usage. The first four letters of appellee\u2019s first word \u201cCitr\u201d are the same as the first four letters of appellant\u2019s word, but these do not constitute dominating features in any trade-mark sense in either term. The coined word is not so made up as to cause it to resemble the normally spelled and pronounced term.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-16\">It is true that the stipulation justifies the finding that appellant coined and adopted the word \u201cCitrofume\u201d because it \u201csuggests a fumigant especially adapted for the fumiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>tion of citrus trees;\u201d and appellee argues that this is an admission of similarity by appellant because it stipulated to this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">It does not seem to us to be an admission that the <em>words </em>are similar or that they resemble. It is an admission that \u201cCitrofume\u201d <em>suggests a product </em>which, it appears, is used for the same purpose as that for which the product labeled \u201cCitrus Dust\u201d is used, but this does not mean that the words themselves are stipulated to be alike, and it is the resemblance, or lack of resemblance, of the <em>marks, </em>not the use of the products which they label, with which we are here immediately concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">We do not regard \u201cCitrofume\u201d as being descriptive in the sense of the statute, nor do-we think \u201cCitrofume\u201d and \u201cCitrus Dust\u201d are conflicting or confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">The decision of the Commissioner is reversed, and appellant will be granted the registration sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-8\">BLAND and HATFIELD, Associate Judges, dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
