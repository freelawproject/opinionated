We therefore have no knowledge as to when the suit, which we infer from the decree to have been, at least in part, an equity proceeding alleging infringement and unfair competition, was instituted .in the New York court; nor are we informed as to the issues of the case. Whether the identical issue which- is before us was there presented we have no way of ascertaining from the mandate or decree. In view of the jurisdiction of this court in trade-mark registration cases as compared with that of courts of equity, the time of filing the New York suit may be of importance, as well as the exact issues which were presented and the specific forms of relief there sought. We do not, therefore, feel that we have before us a record upon which we can determine the question raised by appellant\u2019s motion. Accordingly, decision upon it will be deferred until the further hearing of the ease, which hearing will be had at the November session of the October, 1930, term of the court. Leave is granted to appellant to file, not later than September 1, 1930, a certified copy of the record in the New York ease, or of such portions thereof as will enable this court to ascertain the date upon which the action there was instituted, the issues therein involved, the relief sought, and all such other features as are neeessary in determining the question of res adjudicata. Such record or parts thereof need not be printed. Leave is also given to the parties to file briefs upon the question of res adjudicata as applicable to this case if they so desire; the brief of appellant to be filed not later than October 1, 1930, and the brief of appellee not later than October 30, 1930.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
