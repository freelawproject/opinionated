Hoekmeyer, 40 F.(2d) 99, recently decided, the instant ease is not altogether on all fours with cases 2209 and 2210, supra, because \u201cZip-Over\u201d standing alone has a significance not possessed by either \u201cZip-Kniek\u201d or \u201cZip-Midy,\u201d but is more nearly in the class of the word \u201cZip-On,\u201d which is refused registration by us in the Hoekmeyer proceedings. However, as we pointed out in the beginning, appellee is not proposing to register the plain words \u201cZip-Over,\u201d as was proposed with \u201cZip-On,\u201d but has imposed upon them in a panel the word \u201cKenilworth.\u201d This word is so superimposed upon the compound word, or hyphenated phrase, \u201cZip-Over,\u201d that it becomes really the dominant feature of\u2018the mark, as printed. It seems to us that in this form there is no likelihood of confusion being caused in the mind of the public, or purchasers being deceived. We therefore hold that appellee is entitled to the registration sought, and the decision of the Commissioner is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b149-23\">BLAND, Associate Judge (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"b149-24\">In this case the same parties are involved as were involved in suit 2209, 40 F. (2d) 121, and in that instance appellee was granted the right of registration of the term \u201cZipKniek,\u201d with and without the superimposed parallelogram containing the word \u201cKenilworth.\u201d Here the same party was granted the right to register the term \u201cZip-Over\u201d with the same superimposed word. For the reasons set but in my dissent in suit No. 2209, I believe that the use of the term \u201cZip-Over\u201d is more objectionable than the term \u201cZip-Knick,\u201d and registration should be denied. Registration for \u201cZip-On\u201d was refused by this court in B. F. Goodrich Co. v. Clive E. Hockmeyer (Zip-On Mfg. Co., substituted), 40 F.(2d) 99, decided April 14, 1930.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-25\">In another case before us, arid decided concurrently herewith, suit No. 2210, 40 F. (2d) 124, the same appellee was granted registration for the term \u201cZip-Midy.\u201d The question necessarily arises as to whether, if appellee was entitled to register any form of the word \u201cZip,\u201d how many forms is it entitled to.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-26\">The decision of the Commissioner should be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
