They purchased of the firm of Williams Bros, a sorghum mill and evaporator, which was warranted by J. C. Williams to be of good quality, he representing that it would grind and evaporate at th\u00ab rate of sixty gallons a day. The representations have proved false, and the warranty has failed, as the mill and evaporator will not do half the work stated. Defendants intending to <em>reserve </em>the right to refuse to pay for the mill, etc., the price agreed upon if the warranty failed, or the representations proved false, declined to sign a note negotiable at all, or one payable to bearer, and signed the note sued on without the words \u201cor bearer,\u201d which have been since fraudulently interlined in said note by J. C. Williams, or under his direction. This alteration is material, and voids the note as to these defendants. It was made by the holder fraudulently, without their knowledge or consent, and they would not have made a note with such words contained therein. 8. The note never was indorsed or assigned by J. C. Williams, the payee, or by his authority or consent, and the indorsement thereon is fraudulent, and a forgery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-12\">The magistrate rendered judgment for the plaintiff and the defendants appealed to the superior court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-13\">The evidence, so far as material, disclosed that J. 0. Williams, G. W. Williams and B. A. Williams were partners, using the firm name of Williams Bros., in the manufacture and sale of sorghum mills and evaporators, and sold one of these machines to defendants. That the latter refused to sign a note therefor payable to the order of J. 0. Williams \u201cor bearer,\u201d and had a second note written with all nego<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>tiable words, as they supposed, omitted, which is the one now sued on. They offered to show that they did not know that even the words \u201cto the order of\u201d were in the note signed, but this evidence was excluded by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-5\">The evidence also showed that the name of J. C. Williams was indorsed on the note in the writing of G. W. Williams, without the knowledge or consent of the former, and that this was done before the interlineation of the words \u201cor bearer.\u201d Also, that these words were interlined without the knowledge or consent of the makers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-6\">The court charged, in substance, as follows : If the Williamses were partners, and the property for which the note was given belonged to the firm, and not to J. 0. Williams individually, then either of the partners could sell it, and either of them would be authorized to indorse the name of the payee, and could do this without his assent or knowledge, and the effect would be to confer upon the holder the legal title. If George W. Williams had authority as partner to make the indorsement, and had written the name of J. C. Williams across the note before the words \u201cor bearer\u201d were inserted, then the insertion of such words was immaterial inasmuch as the note, by the indorsement, was in effect payable to bearer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-7\">The jury found for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-8\">The defendants excepted to the exclusion of defendants\u2019 testimony of ignorance of the fact of the words \u201cto the order of\u201d being in the note, and to the instructions to the jury.

It verges on forgery. The introduction of such words is a material alteration, for they go to modify the manner of negotiating' the instrument. <em>Dudley R., </em>243. Without them, or words of similar import, the instrument is negotiable by indorsement only ; with them, it is negotiably by bare delivery as well as by indorsement. It is said they were immaterial in the present case for the reason that the note .was indorsed in blank before their insertion, and thereby the note had already become negotiable by delivery, the effect of indorsement in blank being to render it payable to any bearer. But the payee did not indorse, and the person who did indorse, though a partner of the payee, did not indorse in the partnership name or in his own name, but in the name of the payee ; and this he did without a.ny authority further than the general implied authority of the partnership relation. The partnership had an established partnership name, which was quite different from the name of the individual partner to whom the note was payable. The agency of a partner to sign for the partnership is generally restricted to siguing in the established partnership name, where the partnership has such a name. Let it be conceded that the note was partnership property, and that the partner who transferred it had a right to transfer it, we think that, without some special authority from the payee, he could not indorse it- in the name of the latter, and put it afloat with all the incidents of negotiable paper transferred before due: and if he could not do this, the words \u201cor bearer,\u201d had they been genuine, would or might have varied the rights of the holder,, and made these rights more comprehensive; and whatever would or might have had that effect cannot be treated as immaterial. There is a public policy to be subserved in guarding the purity and integrity of negotiable paper, and neither surreptitious in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>terpolations in the body of the instrument, nor the indorsement by one man with the name of another, ought to be countenanced as a strictly commercial transaction in a doubtful case. On the face of the note is nothing whatever to indicate the connection of any partnership with it; and the operation of the indorsement in the name of the payee would be, <em>prima </em>facie, to render him, and him alone, liable upon the contract of indorsement. All interest of the partnership in the transaction depends upon evidence extrinsic of the note and of the indorsement, and this being so, the words <em>\u201cor </em>bearer\u201d have a material bearing upon the measure of evidence requisite to make a case for recovery by the holder against even the makers. As the note was not in fact indorsed by the payee, it is easy to see that the holder would be better off with the words \u201cor bearer\u201d in the terms of the instrument than if they were not there, since the want of them would place upon him the burden of proving that the indorsement was made with the payee\u2019s authority, the plea putti.ng the genuineness of the indorsement in issue. In any and every view of the matter, the alteration was material, and the court erred in the instructions given to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
