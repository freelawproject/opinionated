Of course until the case is finally disposed of in the court below, it cannot be brought to this court, and the only question is, does the record show that it is still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-15\">The following order and judgment appear in the transcript :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-16\">\u201c R.

Mitchell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">\u201c The defendant being dissatisfied with the verdict and judgment in said case, comes, during said term of the court, and before the adjournment thereof, and moves the court for a new trial, upon the following grounds, to-wit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az\">1. Because the verdict of the jury is contrary to the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ6\">2. Because the verdict is contrary to the evidence and the principles of justice and equity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABe\">3. Because the verdict is without evidence to support it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK3\">4. Because the verdict of the jury is so far contrary to the evidence as to shock the moral sense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARuq\">\u201c Whereupon he prays that these, his grounds for a new trial, be inquired of by the court, and that a new trial be granted him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aok\">Signed by counsel and approved as correct grounds by the court, October 11th, 1878, signed Martin J.

It seems therefore to be pending still in the superior court; it was pending then when this writ of error was sued out, and the record shows no disposition of it.
