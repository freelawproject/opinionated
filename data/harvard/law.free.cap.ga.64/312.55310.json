If the proprietor of a toll-bridge knows of a defect therein, dangerous to passengers and likely to result in damage, and the dangerous defect is not exposed so that the passenger can also see it, and taking toll from the passenger, allows him to cross without warning, the proprietor is liable for damages; <em>aliter, </em>if the defect is not dangerous and likely to result in damage, but in the judgment of the proprietor slight and thought to have been safely repaired ; and a request to charge which does not guard this distinction was properly refused. The proprietor of a bridge is only liable for ordinary-care and diligence, and beyond this is not an insurer.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-10\">New trial.

The verdict is for defendant. The evidence is conflicting, but is sufficient to sustain the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\"><bracketnum>2.</bracketnum> The error of law complained of is that the court declined to charge the jury that \u201cwhen there is a defect in a toll-bridge which is not open and exposed to all, and the proprietor of the bridge knows of the defect, and allows persons to cross on the bridge and takes toll for crossing, then the proprietor is liable for damages resulting from said defect.\u201d We think that the charge requested is too broad. If the proprietor knew that the defect in the bridge was <em>dangerous </em>and likely to result in the damage, then we would hold him liable; but not for any defect, however slight, \u2022which, contrary to his expectations and belief, resulted in un foreseen and unexpected damage. He is only liable for ordinary care. 53 <em>Ga., </em>47, <em>Tift vs. Towns. </em>That case arose on the same state of f\u00e1cts as this, and covers this. It is presumed that the law was given in accordance*with the ruling there, and the court there say that the evidence is sufficient to uphold a verdict for either party. Besides, the request is too broad in this that its language is \u201copen and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>exposed to all,\u201d whereas this plaintiff may have known as much-about it as the proprietor did. See also the same case <em>\u2014Tift vs. Towns </em>\u2014 decided this term \u2014 where we uphold the verdict for plaintiff in part on similar facts as here ; and though it looks odd for juries to give different verdicts on similar facts, yet that is their business. Our rule, as a reviewing court,, is one of law, and it is not to interfere with the jury on conflicting facts where the. presiding judge declines to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
