A mere vote on the question of exchange or no exchange, held under no law passed by the general assembly to carry into effect the mode of avoiding this prohibition on new debts, and held under no law of the state or the city prescribed for such an election at any time, cannot beheld to he such an authorization of a new debt as will comply with the constitution and relieve the city from the prohibition. Tax-pavers are interested to see that their city does not incur such debts, except lawfully, and may intervene by applying for an injunction to restrain the municipal authorities from unlawfully incurring such new liabilities.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b287-5\">Constitutional law. Municipal corporations. Injunction. Before Judge Lester. Cobb County. At Chambers. May 7, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b287-6\">Certain citizens of Marietta, Hudson <em>et al., </em>filed their bill against the municipal authorities to restrain them from incurring any debt in exchanging a hand fire-engine for a steam one. It was alleged that the council had discussed the question of making an exchange, and had passed a resolution calling an election for the purpose of assenting or dissenting to the same; that the ballots were marked exchange\u201d and \u201c no exchange,\u201d and that two-thirds of the votes cast were in favor of an exchange; that in making sucii exchange the city will incur a debt of $3,000.00. Various grounds of illegality in the election were alleged, but are not material here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-7\">In regard to the answer, it need only be stated that it admitted the necessity for incurring a debt of $3,000.00, but denied that it would impose any new burden of taxation on the citizens, as it could be met without a resort to such means.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-8\">Affidavits were read in support of the bill and answer\u2019. The chancellor refused the injunction, and complainants excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b287-9\">W. P.

So that it is an effort on the part of this city to make a new debt, incurred to procure a steam fire engine in the place of an old hand engine, at a considerable cost, without complying with that provision of our present constitution. It cannot be done.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The provision is inserted therein to stop, to dam up, this deluge of city and cqunty debts which is flooding the country, and sinking the bestinterests of the people. It is made the duty of the judiciary to give the provision full effect. Section 4, par. 2, art. 1 of constitution 1877.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Citizens who must pay the taxes unconstitutionally laid, if not arrested, have the right to enjoin the collection, and the chancellor should have issued the writ at their prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
