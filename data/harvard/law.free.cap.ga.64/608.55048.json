Before Judge Buchanan. Carroll Superior Court. October Term, 1879.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-7\">Adamson was a judgment creditor of one Snow. On December 2nd, 1878, he sued out summons of garnishment, which was served on Hearn the same day. This summons called upon Hearn to answer at the December term of the justice court. At the bottom of the summons was a \u201c P. S.,\u201d without date or signature, notifying the garnishee to answer in ten days. The December term was on December 14th. On that day Hearn answered \u201cnot indebted.\u201d Plaintiff moved to take judgmenc against him by default, because he did not answer in ten days. The motion was granted. On appeal to a jury they found for the garnishee. Plaintiff sued out a writ of <em>certiorari. </em>On the hearing it was sustained, and the garnishee excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b608-8\">Oscar Reese ; N.

On the appeal trial in the justice court the jury found a verdict in favor of the garnishee. The court sustained the <em>certiorari </em>on the ground that the verdict discharging the garnishee was contrary to law and the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">There was no error in this ruling of the court. When the garnishee was served with the summons, the law made it his duty to answer it within ten days from the date of such service, and it was not necessary to state in the summons that he should answer within ten days. The mandate of the law was sufficient for that purpose, of which he was bound to take notice, and be governed by it. See Code, \u00a74161.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Let the judgment of the court below be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
