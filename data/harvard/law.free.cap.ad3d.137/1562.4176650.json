The determination rescinded petitioner\u2019s parole release date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-8\">It is hereby ordered that the determination is unanimously confirmed without costs and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-9\">Memorandum: Petitioner, an inmate serving an aggregate sentence of 25 years to life for various convictions including murder in the second degree <em>(People v Spataro, </em>202 AD2d 1005 [1994], <em>lv denied </em>84 NY2d 833 [1994]), commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking to annul the determination of the New York State Board of Parole (Board) that, after a hearing, rescinded a prior determination granting him an open release date. We confirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1316-10\">A parole board may, \u201c[i]n its discretion, . . . revoke or modify any of its decisions or determinations\u201d (9 NYCRR 8000.4), and a parole release date may be rescinded when, among other things, there is \u201csignificant information which existed . . . prior to the rendition of the parole release decision, where such information was not known by the board\u201d (9 NYCRR 8002.5 [b] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1563\">*1563</page-number>[i]; <em>see Matter of Ortiz v New York State Bd. of Parole, </em>239 AD2d 52, 55 [1998], <em>lv denied </em>92 NY2d 811 [1998]). In rescinding an inmate\u2019s parole release date, a majority of the board must be \u201csatisfied that substantial evidence was presented at the hearing to form a basis for rescinding the grant of release\u201d (9 NYCRR 8002.5 [d] [1]; <em>see Ortiz, </em>239 AD2d at 55).</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-4\">Contrary to petitioner\u2019s contention, we conclude that the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Matter of Costello v New York State Bd. of Parole </em>(23 NY3d 1002, 1004 [2014], <em>revg </em>101 AD3d 1512 [2012]) does not require annulment of the Board\u2019s rescission determination here. In <em>Costello, </em>the Court held that the Board improperly rescinded the petitioner\u2019s parole release \u201cunder the particular circumstances of this case,\u201d and emphasized that its resolution in <em>Costello </em>\u201cshould not be interpreted as minimizing . . . the importance of victim impact statements in parole board hearings\u201d (23 NY3d at 1004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1317-5\">Here, in addition to various unrelated crimes, petitioner was convicted of murder in the second degree after he conspired with the victim\u2019s wife to collect on the victim\u2019s life insurance policy and then shot the victim in his driveway when he returned from dinner with his wife. The statements from the family members of that victim submitted in conjunction with the rescission procedure detailed their grief and the continuing ramifications of the murder on the health and well-being of the family, and also provided information concerning the brutality and consequences of petitioner\u2019s crime by describing the pain and suffering experienced by the victim before he died. The Board was aware that the victim was not killed instantly when petitioner shot him with a handgun at close range, and that he received medical care at two hospitals for several weeks before succumbing to severe bronchial pneumonia that was induced by the gunshot wound to his neck. Nonetheless, the subsequent statements of the family members provided detailed eyewitness accounts of the victim\u2019s suffering during his hospitalization, including his unsuccessful attempts to communicate despite the fact that he had been partially paralyzed and his vocal cords had been \u201cdestroyed\u201d as a result of the shooting. We thus conclude that, even if some of the other information submitted was already known to the Board, the abovementioned victim impact statements provided \u201csignificant information\u201d not previously known by the Board, and the statements constitute substantial evidence to support the determination rescinding petitioner\u2019s parole release date (9 NYCRR 8002.5 [b] [2] [i]; <em>see </em>9 NYCRR 8002.5 [d] [1]; <em>Matter of Rizo v New York State Bd. of Parole, </em>251 AD2d 997, 997-998 [1998], <em>lv denied </em>92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1564\">*1564</page-number>NY2d 811 [1998]; <em>Ortiz, </em>239 AD2d at 56).</p>\n<judges id=\"AZ6\">Present\u2014Smith, J.P., Peradotto, Lindley, DeJoseph and Scudder, JJ.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
