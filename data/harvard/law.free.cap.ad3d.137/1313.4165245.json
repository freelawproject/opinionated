Following a jury trial, defendant was convicted as charged and sentenced to an aggregate prison term of seven years, followed by 10 years of postrelease supervision. Defendant now appeals, and his sole argument is that he was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, it is incumbent upon a defendant to establish that alleged errors by counsel demonstrate the absence of a legitimate strategy or explanation <em>(see People v Benevento, </em>91 NY2d 708, 712 [1998]). Once a defendant has established that counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number>actions fell outside of these legitimate bounds, he or she must then establish that such deficiencies either caused prejudice <em>(see Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668, 694 [1984]) or, more generally, deprived him or her of meaningful representation <em>(see People v Oathout, </em>21 NY3d 127, 128 [2013]). A defendant cannot depend on either \u201cthe clarity of hindsight\u201d <em>(People v Benevento, </em>91 NY2d at 712) or on speculation as to matters outside of the record <em>(see People v Maracle, </em>19 NY3d 925, 929 [2012]), and the defendant cannot meet his or her burden by merely pointing out that counsel employed losing tactics <em>(see People v Stultz, </em>2 NY3d 277, 283 [2004]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-3\">Certain of defendant\u2019s proposed courses of action for trial counsel would, contrary to his assertions, have been futile. Law enforcement stopped a truck\u2014driven by defendant\u2014that was without a visible rear license plate and that matched the description of the one alleged to be driven by the perpetrator of the victim\u2019s assault; this information was known by the relevant officer due to a \u201cbe on-the-lookout\u201d alert. As such, a suppression motion specifically alleging that there was a lack of probable cause to initiate the traffic stop of defendant\u2019s vehicle would have been without merit <em>(see People v Rose, </em>72 AD3d 1341, 1343-1344 [2010], <em>lv dismissed </em>16 NY3d 745 [2011]). Likewise, the fact that defendant was sitting in a police vehicle during that brief traffic stop did not render his consent to give a tissue sample for DNA analysis involuntary, and a motion arguing that point would have been unavailing <em>(see People v Dail, </em>69 AD3d 873, 874 [2010], <em>lv denied </em>14 NY3d 839 [2010]). Given these conclusions, defendant\u2019s related contention that the fruit of the aforementioned searches and seizures could have been suppressed are also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Many of defendant\u2019s allegations regarding counsel\u2019s deficiencies revolve around counsel\u2019s decision not to vigorously challenge the People\u2019s evidence regarding DNA, which, at trial, generally established to a high degree of certainty that defendant had left his genetic material on the victim\u2019s clothing and body. Our review, however, reveals that counsel\u2019s available reasonable trial strategies were limited by defendant\u2019s choice to take the stand and testify that he had grappled with the victim. Accordingly, given that defendant acknowledged that physical contact occurred, he has not shown that it was an unreasonable strategy to forgo challenging DNA evidence that was highly probative in establishing that defendant came in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>contact with the victim.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s contentions that counsel should have called defendant\u2019s wife to testify, that counsel\u2019s performance should have been better at the suppression hearing, during summation and at sentencing and that the jury charges that counsel preferred were poorly chosen are also contentions that fail to rise above hindsight second-guessing of counsel\u2019s legitimate strategic choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-3\">Additional alleged errors\u2014counsel\u2019s failure to object to (1) certain bolstering and hearsay, (2) testimony regarding chokeholds that was advanced as expert evidence and (3) the People\u2019s suggestion that jurors conduct chokehold experiments during deliberations\u2014are also unpersuasive. There is no reasonable probability that, had counsel made such objections, the result of the trial would have been different. Further, counsel executed a strategy consistent with defendant\u2019s testimony and primarily focused on persuading the jury that reasonable doubt existed with regard to the requisite intent for the charged crimes. More generally, counsel made appropriate pretrial challenges to the People\u2019s evidence, lodged meaningful objections during trial and cross-examined witnesses in a manner consistent with the aforementioned strategy. Accordingly, based on our review of the record and viewing counsel\u2019s representation as a whole, we conclude that defendant received the effective assistance of counsel <em>(see People v Benevento, </em>91 NY2d at 714-715; <em>People v Hook, </em>80 AD3d 881, 884 [2011], <em>lv denied </em>17 NY3d 806 [2011]). To the extent that defendant\u2019s remaining contentions regarding alleged errors by counsel have not been explicitly addressed herein, they have been considered and are also found to be without merit.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1069-4\">Egan Jr., Lynch and Devine, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"AZx-\">Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1069-7\"> More specifically, defendant testified that his altercation with the victim\u2014who was 17 years old\u2014ensued after she misinterpreted his innocent purpose\u2014-which was to acquire directions\u2014in reaching out and touching her while she jogged, alone, through a cemetery. The victim\u2019s testimony created a different portrait of defendant\u2019s intended purpose. She explained that defendant followed her, placed her in a chokehold and then stuck his hand inside of her underwear and touched her vagina. She further described that she was unable to say whether defendant then assaulted her to any greater extent because defendant had choked her to the point of unconsciousness.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
