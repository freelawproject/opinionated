The disk contained photographic images of suspected drugs, paraphernalia, and cooking components for methamphetamine taken at the residence of Beaupre and her husband, Shane Beaupre (Shane), on Lower Valley Road, in Boulder, Montana. The informant told Hamilton the pictures had been taken while informant was working on a crew hired to clean the Beaupres\u2019 residence after a fire. The informant also told Hamilton that there were several empty cans of Coleman fuel, a potential precursor to methamphetamine, outside the Beaupre residence. Hamilton subsequently contacted Jefferson County Deputy Sheriff Bob Gleich and told Gleich about the informant\u2019s report, including the photographs. Gleich did not speak with the informant because the informant had told Hamilton that she wished to be kept out of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b68 Based on the images on the disk and the conversation with Hamilton about the informant\u2019s report, Gleich applied for a search warrant on or about February 6, 2002, to search the Beaupres\u2019 Lower Valley Road residence and a storage unit also owned by the Beaupres on 412 North Monroe in Boulder. Gleich testified that Justice of the Peace Dennis Giulio was unavailable and, further, that District Judge Loren Tucker was unavailable, so acting Justice of the Peace Debbie Rennie approved the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b69 Gleich received the warrant about 4:00 p.m. and, with the assistance of agent Daniel J. Doyle of the Southwest Montana Drug Task Force, Montana Highway Patrol Officer Jay Hanson and other officers, served it at approximately 6:30 p.m. at the Beaupres\u2019 Lower Valley Road residence. The officers found a marijuana pipe, a couple of brass finger scales, snort straws, glass jars with residue, a roach clip, and a small round mirror, but did not locate any of the items depicted in the photographic images provided by the informant. Gleich contacted Hamilton and asked him to inquire of the informant where those items might be located. Hamilton did so, and the informant stated that the items were possibly at the Beaupres\u2019 rented residence on Second Avenue in Boulder. Hamilton relayed this information to Gleich. While one search team of officers went to the storage unit, Gleich, Doyle, Hanson, and Officer Nelson of the Jefferson County Sheriffs Office went to the Beaupres\u2019 rented home on Second Avenue. From this point, the Beaupres\u2019 and the officers\u2019 stories differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\u00b610 Gleich testified that only he and Doyle approached the house and knocked on the door. He said that when Beaupre answered the door, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>they asked if they could enter and she gave them permission. Once they were inside Beaupre woke up Shane, who was sleeping on the couch. Doyle explained to the Beaupres that they were there because they had a search warrant for the Beaupres\u2019 storage unit and the Lower Valley residence based on information that the Beaupres were producing methamphetamine at that residence. The officers then asked for a key to the storage unit\u2019s lock to avoid having to cut off the lock. Shane went out to his truck, followed by Gleich, to retrieve the key. Once Shane located the key, he turned it over to Gleich who radioed an officer from the storage unit search team to come and pick up the key.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b611 Gleich further testified that Doyle asked the Beaupres if they had any of the items the officers were looking for. The Beaupres denied having any of the items and told Gleich and Doyle to search the residence if they wanted. Gleich then went back outside to his patrol car and retrieved a consent to search form. Because the pre-printed form was for a vehicle, Gleich wrote in \u201cresidence\u201d in the space for car make and model. While walking back to the house, Gleich testified that he told Nelson, who was standing on the porch by this time, that they had been given permission to search and Gleich wanted Nelson to assist. Once he was back in the home, Gleich then read the document, line-by-line, to the Beaupres, gave the document to Shane, and Shane read and signed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b612 Beaupre testified that the officers, once she let them inside, told her that they were there in anticipation of finding a meth lab, that they had already been to the Beaupres\u2019 other residence and had found nothing, \u201cand figured [the Beaupres] had moved it uptown .... They presented a search warrant and said if we [didn\u2019t] sign it [the officers] were going to tear the place apart.\u201d She testified that the warrant was not read out loud to either Shane or her. She also indicated that when the consent to search form was presented to her and Shane, the officers asked for a key to the storage unit and another officer entered the home with a large set of bolt cutters.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b613 Shane testified that there were at least five or six officers in the house; that Gleich did not read the consent to search form to Shane; that Shane was told the consent form was for a vehicle; and that Shane had felt pressured and read only half of the consent form before he signed it. In addition, Shane testified that he was not prepared to face the officers\u2019 requests because he had been in a deep sleep on the couch after working \u00e1 fourteen-hour shift. Shane did testify, however, that the search of the Second Avenue house did not commence until after he signed the consent form.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>\u00b614 Doyle\u2019s testimony was substantially similar to Gleich\u2019s. He added that bolt cutters were never mentioned or brought into the home, that he had asked the Beaupres if it would be all right if other officers entered to help with the search, and that the Beaupres had consented. Doyle further testified that once Shane signed the consent form, Doyle searched the Beaupres\u2019 bedroom and there located Beaupre\u2019s purse. Inside the purse there were syringes and a half a gram of methamphetamine in an eyeglass repair kit. Additional syringes and a set of scales were also found in the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u00b615 On March 27, 2002, Beaupre was arraigned in the District Court on an amended information charging her with criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a felony, and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor. She filed a motion to suppress evidence, claiming the search warrant was void <em>ah initio </em>because acting Justice of the Peace Rennie was without lawful authority, the evidence seized was fruit of the poisonous tree, and there was no valid consent to the search of the Second Avenue residence. On July 17, 2002, the court ruled that there was probable cause to issue the search warrant and that the Beaupres had consented to the search of their rented home. Later that month, the District Court issued a supplemental order concluding that substitute Justice of the Peace Rennie, contrary to Beaupre\u2019s claim, was qualified by law to act and the search warrant she had issued was issued with valid authority.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ4\">\u00b616 In August, at a change of plea hearing, Beaupre pled guilty to criminal possession of dangerous drugs and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia, reserving her right to appeal the suppression issues. The District Court imposed a three-year deferred sentence for criminal possession of dangerous drugs and a concurrent six-month deferred sentence for possession of drug paraphernalia, during which Beaupre would be under the supervision of the Department of Corrections and would adhere to several conditions. Beaupre subsequently filed a notice of appeal with this Court and then moved the District Court to stay the fine and surcharges, which the District Court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u00b617 Citing to our decision in <em>State v. Rushton </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 248, 870 P.2d 1355, Beaupre states that the standard of review for a motion to suppress is whether there is substantial credible evidence to support the court\u2019s findings of fact and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. However, in <em>State v. Hermes </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 446, 904 P.2d 587, we modified the substantial credible evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>standard used in <em>Rushton </em>and stated that we would not \u201coverturn a District Court\u2019s findings of fact regarding suppression hearing evidence unless those findings are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Hermes, </em>273 Mont. at 449, 904 P.2d at 589 (quoting <em>State v. Cope </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 387, 396, 819 P.2d 1280, 1286). We have further held that findings of fact are clearly erroneous \u201cif they are not supported by substantial evidence, the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or our review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>State v. Lacasella, </em>2002 MT 326, \u00b6 10, 313 Mont. 185, \u00b6 10, 60 P.3d 975, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A_e\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b618 <em>Did the substitute justice of the peace have authority to issue the search warrant?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u00b619 Beaupre argues that \u00a7 3-10-231(3), MCA, was violated because there was no attempt to call in another justice of the peace or city judge to issue the search warrant prior to contacting substitute Judge Rennie for execution of the warrant and that the warrant is void pursuant to our decisions in <em>State v. Vickers, </em>1998 MT 201, 290 Mont. 356, 964 P.2d 756, and <em>Potter v. Dist. Ct. of 16th Jud. Dist. </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 384, 880 P.2d 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u00b620 Section 3-10-231, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-8\">(1) Whenever a justice of the peace is disqualified from acting in any action because of the application of the supreme court\u2019s rules on disqualification and substitution of judges, 3-1-803 and 3-1-805, the justice of the peace shall either transfer the action to another justice\u2019s court in the same county or call a justice from a neighboring county to preside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\">(2) (a) The following requirements must be met to qualify a substitute for a justice of the peace:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-10\">(i) Within 30 days of taking office, a justice of the peace shall provide a list of persons who are qualified to hold court in the justice\u2019s place during a temporary absence when another justice or city judge is not available. The persons listed must be of good moral character and have community support, a sense of community standards, and a basic knowledge of court procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-11\">(ii) The sitting justice of the peace shall request and obtain from the commission on courts of limited jurisdiction established by the supreme court a waiver of training for the substitutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-12\">(iii) Each person on the list, provided for in subsection (2)(a)(i), shall subscribe to the written oath of office as soon as possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>after the person has received a waiver of training from the supreme court. The oath may be subscribed before any member of the board of county commissioners or before any other officer authorized to administer oaths.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\">(b) The list of qualified substitutes, the written oath, and the commission\u2019s written approval and waiver of training for those substitutes, pursuant to subsection (2)(a)(ii), must be filed with the county clerk as provided in 3-10-202.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-5\">(c) A county clerk may provide a current list of qualified and sworn substitutes to local law enforcement officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">(3) Whenever a justice is sick, disabled, or absent, the justice may call in another justice, if there is one readily available, or a city judge or a person from the list provided for in subsection (2) to hold court for the absent justice until the absent justice\u2019s return. If the justice is unable to call in a substitute, the county commissioners shall call in another justice, a city judge, or a person from the list provided for in subsection (2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">(4) During the time when a justice of the peace is on vacation or attending a training session, another justice of the peace of the same county is authorized to handle matters that otherwise would be handled by the absent justice. When there is no other justice of the peace in the county, the justice of the peace may designate another person in the same manner as if the justice were sick or absent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">(5) A justice of the peace of any county may hold the court of any other justice of the peace at that justice\u2019s request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">\u00b621 In <em>Potter, </em>we held that, pursuant to \u00a7 3-10-231(2), (3), and (4), MCA, \u201ca sitting justice of the peace must first attempt to call in another justice of the peace, if there is one readily available, or a city judge before resorting to calling in a qualified substitute judge from the list.\u201d <em>Potter, </em>266 Mont. at 391, 880 P.2d at 1324 (citation omitted). In <em>Vickers, </em>we held that the statute did not permit a justice of the peace to delegate to law enforcement the task of contacting another justice, but rather, the justice was required to personally contact a replacement. <em>Vickers, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">\u00b622 The record indicates that, prior to this incident, Judge Guilio obtained letters from judges in Helena and Butte indicating that they were not available should he be absent. These letters were updated every six months. Judge Guilio followed this course of action pursuant to advice provided in an Attorney General\u2019s opinion, which stated, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-11\">A letter from a neighboring justice stating that he or she is too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>busy to act as a substitute may be relied upon by the sitting justice for a reasonable period of time. It would be unreasonable, however, to rely upon such a letter indefinitely to determine the availability of the justice. Periodically, the justices who wrote the letters should be contacted to determine if they are still unavailable. The reasonableness of such a time period may vary, but it would be prudent to contact the justices every four to six months to determine whether they are still unavailable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">48 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. No. 11 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\u00b623 Additionally, the State offered a letter at the suppression hearing from Judge Guilio which stated that he had also personally visited with the judges \u201cin all counties\u201d regarding their availability. This evidence is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\u00b624 Thus, consistent with <em>Vickers, </em>Judge Guilio personally contacted the other judges, and did not simply instruct police to do so. Consistent with <em>Potter, </em>Judge Rennie, Judge Guilio\u2019s designated substitute, was called into service after Judge Guilio had previously determined that the other judges were not available<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\u00b625 Beaupre further argues that, although the letters obtained by Judge Guilio may have verified that judges were unavailable in Butte and Helena, there was no such letter obtained from a justice of the peace in Townsend, Broadwater County, and therefore, not all of the \u201cneighboring counties\u201d were contacted prior to bringing Judge Rennie into service. This argument is in reference to the requirement in \u00a7 3-10-231(1), MCA, that the justice of the peace shall \u201ccall a justice from a neighboring county to preside.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\u00b626 We note, however, that \u00a7 3-10-231(1), MCA, governs substitution when a justice of the peace is disqualified from acting pursuant to the judicial disqualification statutes. The \u201cneighboring county\u201d provision is not repeated in other subsections of the statute governing substitutions for sickness, disability, vacation, attending a training session or other absences. Section 3-10-231(3) and (4), MCA. However, we need not resolve this question of statutory interpretation for purposes of this case because Judge Guilio, in addition to obtaining letters from some counties, received verbal confirmation from the judges \u201cin all counties\u201d of their unavailability, which would mean, at a minimum, those counties neighboring Jefferson County.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">\u00b627 Beaupre also criticizes Gleich for making no attempt to contact a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>judge from Butte, Helena or Townsend prior to contacting Judge Rennie. However, it was precisely such \u201cjudge-shopping\u201d by law enforcement which we held was inappropriate in <em>Vickers. Vickers, </em>\u00b6 28 (\u201cJudge Larsen simply provided law enforcement with a \u2018menu\u2019 of substitutes from which to choose. This procedure clearly violates \u00a7 3-10-231, MCA, and encourages \u2018judge-shopping.\u2019 \u201d). Under the statute, it is the duty of the sitting judge to determine what other judges are available, and here, Judge Guilio did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\u00b628 Having considered Judge Guilio\u2019s efforts, we cannot conclude that \u00a7 3-10-231, MCA, and the interpretations thereof rendered in <em>Potter </em>and <em>Vickers, </em>were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u00b629 Beaupre next claims that Judge Rennie\u2019s designation as substitute judge did not comply with \u00a7 3-10-231(2)(a)(i), MCA, which requires a substitute to be designated by a justice of the peace \u201c[w]ithin 30 days of taking office,\u201d because Judge Guilio\u2019s designation of Judge Rennie occurred in late November 1998, following his reelection, and because Judge Rennie\u2019s oath of office was sworn to before District Judge Frank Davis on December 31, 1998, the last day of Judge Guilio\u2019s first elected term and prior to the initiation of his second elected term.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u00b630 However, according to Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (1998), the preposition \u201cwithin\u201d is \u201cused as a function word to indicate situation or circumstance in the limits or compass of: as ... before the end off.]\u201d Such a reading of \u201cwithin,\u201d used as a preposition by \u00a7 3-10-23 l(2)(a)(i), MCA, would require designation of a substitute \u201cbefore the end of\u2019 thirty days following the judge\u2019s taking office. The statute does not, by its plain language, preclude designation of a substitute prior to the initiation of the term for which the judge was elected. As the District Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">[T]he legislature intended to create a deadline for the various activities which establish eligibility for substitutes rather than creating a narrow window of time within which qualifying action must be taken. Qualifications for substitute Justice of the Peace in this case were complete long before the deadline.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">\u00b631 The language here thus has the effect of setting a deadline for designation of a substitute at thirty days following the beginning of the term. Judge Guilio was elected for a second term in November 1998 and, as the incumbent judge, thereafter completed the process for designating a substitute in November and December 1998. His designation thus satisfies the timing requirement because it was completed prior to the expiration of the statutory deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">\u00b632 The dissent offers an alternative interpretation of this provision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>but enters the theoretical world to do so, positing that the issue must be addressed \u201cas though Judge Guilio had been newly elected in November of 1998,\u201d and that, therefore, the question is whether Judge Guilio could have taken \u201cany official action prior to taking office.\u201d However, that is not the reality here, and therefore, does not solve the dilemma. Judge Guilio was <em>not </em>newly elected in November of 1998 and the issue is <em>not </em>whether he could have taken action prior to taking office. In fact, he was an incumbent judge who took the action while he was in office. Our duty is to apply this statute to this case, not to theoretical circumstances that may provide easier choices. In short, we must face the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b633 Neither do the other \u201c30 day provisions\u201d offered by the dissent provide any assistance. Quite simply, under <em>none </em>of those provisions would it be possible for the contemplated action to be completed prior to the commencement of the thirty-day period. How could a district court set aside an agency decision before it was rendered? Indeed, there would be nothing to set aside. The meanings of these provisions are obvious from their individual contexts, and are not governed by a universal application of. the definition of \u201cof,\u201d as the dissent suggests. Here, the statute in question does not prohibit action by a sitting judge and is reasonably interpreted to set a deadline by which the action had to be completed. The District Court was correct in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b634  Lastly, Beaupre argues that Judge Rennie\u2019s designation as a substitute judge was unlawful because Judge Rennie\u2019s \u201cwaiver of training\u201d form signed by \u2022 Judge Guilio on December 10, 1998, designated Judge Rennie as a substitute \u201cuntil the end of my present term of office,\u201d which drew to a close shortly thereafter with the expiration of the year 1998. However, we have already determined that Judge Rennie was timely designated under the statute as a substitute judge for Judge Guilio\u2019s second term, beginning in January 1999. Further, the record reflects that the documentation to accomplish that purpose, including Judge Rennie\u2019s waiver of training form, was properly submitted by Judge Guilio. Thus, despite the inaccurate wording on the training form itself, Judge Guilio satisfied all of the statutory requirements for designation of Judge Rennie as a substitute judge, and therefore, we conclude that the error in the wording is of no consequence, and did not affect Judge Rennie\u2019s authority to act. Accordingly, we hold that Judge Rennie had authority to issue the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u00b635 Was <em>the warrant supported by probable cause </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>\u00b636 Beaupre claims that there was insufficient information to establish probable cause necessary for issuance of the search warrant because the informant was anonymous as to Officer Gleich and her report was not corroborated by police. She also notes that the photographs taken by the informant did not exhibit all of the items identified in the application. The State responds that there was probable cause because the informant was not anonymous as to Officer Hamilton, and, even if the information was hearsay to Gleich, it was nonetheless reliable because it was founded upon the personal observations of the informant, acting as a concerned citizen, and upon pictures which confirmed the informant\u2019s information.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\u00b637 We must determine whether the District Court, in issuing the search warrant, \u201chad a substantial basis to determine probable cause existed.\u201d <em>State v. St. Marks, </em>2002 MT 285, \u00b6 12, 312 Mont. 468, \u00b6 12, 59 P.3d 1113, \u00b6 12. In analyzing whether probable cause existed, we do not look at \u201ceach individual fact presented in the application for search warrant,\u201d but rather a \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>St. Marks, </em>\u00b6 22. Where a warrant is based on an informant\u2019s information, we have previously \u201cset out a step-by-step analysis for determining when further corroboration of an informant\u2019s information is necessary to establish sufficient probable cause.\u201d <em>St. Marks, </em>\u00b6 24; <em>see State v. Reesman, </em>2000 MT 243, \u00b6\u00b6 28-35, 301 Mont. 408, \u00b6\u00b6 28-35, 10 P.3d 83, \u00b6\u00b6 28-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b638  First, if the informant is anonymous, independent corroboration of the informant\u2019s information is required. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 28. If the informant is not anonymous, the next inquiry is whether the informant\u2019s information is based on personal observation or hearsay. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 29. If based on hearsay, then independent corroboration is needed. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 30. If based on the informant\u2019s personal observation, we then address reliability by determining whether the informant has provided reliable and accurate information to officers in the past, whether the admission is against the informant\u2019s interest, or whether the informant was motivated by good citizenship. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">\u00b639 Addressing the first requirement, Beaupre argues that the informant was anonymous because Gleich was not aware of the informant\u2019s identity, and distinguishes our holding in <em>State v. Oleson, </em>1998 MT 130, 289 Mont. 139, 959 P.2d 503 <em>(overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, \u00b6 19, 291 Mont. 474, \u00b6 19, 970 P.2d 556, \u00b6 19), which was relied upon by the District Court. In <em>Oleson, </em>an informant advised a game warden that the informant had observed an individual in a pick-up truck with the license \u201cRIG PIG\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>spotlighting near the Yellowstone River, and had heard gunshots coming from the pick-up\u2019s location. <em>Oleson, </em>\u00b6 10. The informant asked to remain anonymous. <em>Oleson, </em>\u00b6 10. The game warden visited the area identified by the informant and recovered .22-250 caliber shell casings and deer hair in a drainage ditch within ten feet of the shell casings. The warden obtained a warrant and searched the defendant\u2019s home for evidence of the unlawful taking of big game, but also discovered twenty-five packets of methamphetamine, money, and records of drug transactions, leading to drug charges. <em>Oleson, </em>\u00b6 2. Based on the foregoing and the warden\u2019s experience and training in wildlife crime detection, we concluded that the District Court did not err in concluding that the warrant to search the defendant\u2019s home was supported by probable, cause, despite the informant\u2019s anonymity. <em>Oleson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11, 19. Beaupre argues that our decision in <em>Oleson </em>\u201crelied heavily\u2019 on the warden\u2019s personal discussion with the informant, but here, Gleich had no discussions with the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b640 Beaupre\u2019s argument here is essentially two-fold. First, she asserts that because Gleich did not personally speak with or know the informant, then, pursuant to <em>Reesman, </em>the informant was \u201canonymous\u201d and police corroboration was required. Secondly, although she does not expressly raise a hearsay issue, she argues that, unlike <em>Oleson, </em>the officer (Hamilton) who had personal contact with the informant was not the same officer (Gleich) who applied for the warrant. Her argument implies that because the informant was anonymous as to Gleich, the warrant was defective because it was based upon hearsay. We turn to her first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b641 Two years after <em>Oleson, </em>we more precisely defined, in <em>Reesman, </em>both the terms and procedures to be employed in analyzing search warrants based upon an informant\u2019s reports. We said an \u201canonymous\u201d informant \u201cmeans that law enforcement officers have no idea who is providing the information. A phoned-in Crimestoppers \u2018tip\u2019 is one frequent, common example.\u201d <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 28. Clearly, the informant here was not \u201canonymous\u201d under this definition. Beaupre correctly notes that the informant was not known to Gleich, but the informant was known to Hamilton, who personally talked to the informant and obtained the disk containing pictures from the informant. Hamilton\u2019s actions were similar to those of the warden in <em>Oleson. </em>Here, like <em>Oleson, </em>an officer established the informant\u2019s identity and had personal contact with the informant. Hamilton then contacted Gleich, who applied for the search warrant based on the information received from Hamilton and Gleich\u2019s own observation of the informant\u2019s pictures. Thus, the informant was not \u201canonymous\u201d as defined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>Reesman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b642 However, though not anonymous, the informant did not want to be identified, and thus, must be considered a \u201cconfidential\u201d informant. To determine the need for independent corroboration, we then inquire whether the confidential informant\u2019s report was based upon personal observation of the criminal activity. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 29. This requirement is clearly satisfied by the informant\u2019s personal involvement here, which included taking pictures. Lastly, the inquiry is whether the confidential informant may be deemed to be reliable. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"AMR2\">\u00b643 The basis offered for establishing reliability here is that the informant was acting as a concerned citizen. When determining whether an informant was acting pursuant to good citizenship, we look to \u201cthe very nature of the circumstances under which the incriminating information became known.\u201d <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 34 (quoting <em>State v. Valley </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 489, 493, 830 P.2d 1255, 1258). The factual situation here is similar to <em>Reesman, </em>but is different in a significant respect which requires a different outcome than in <em>Reesman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u00b644 As here, the informant in <em>Reesman </em>was known to police, but remained confidential. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 37. Further, the warrant application in <em>Reesman </em>failed to state that the informant was acting as a \u201cconcerned citizen.\u201d <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 38. Such an indication is also missing from Gleich\u2019s application here. Although describing the informant\u2019s personal involvement with the evidence and stating that the informant \u201cthen immediately notified law enforcement,\u201d the application does not specifically claim that the informant was acting as a concerned citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b645 However, we reasoned in <em>Reesman </em>that it was \u201cmore important\u201d for the application to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">under what circumstances the informant went to and entered the trailer that day and subsequently was shown the incriminating information she later shared with Detective Hanson. Was she there to clean the carpet? Collect rent? Purchase a gram or two of the fresh harvest? Was she acting under law enforcement direction? WTiy did [the occupant] so willingly show her his illegal operation? We do not know, and, accordingly, neither did the reviewing magistrate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-8\"><em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 38. Because these questions about the informant\u2019s involvement and motivation were unanswered by the application, we concluded it was insufficient to provide probable cause without further corroboration. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 39. However, the application here is not similarly flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">\u00b646 Gleich\u2019s application stated that the Beaupres\u2019 home had sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>fire damage for which they had contacted a cleaning company. In response, the cleaning crew, including the informant, went to the residence and began working inside. The crew began handling and boxing up personal property items within the house. During that process, the crew observed items they believed to be contraband and an illegal narcotics operation, prompting them to take photographs of the items. Following completion of the cleaning duties, law enforcement was immediately notified. The informant met with police and delivered the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b647 Thus, unlike <em>Reesman, </em>the application here contained the necessary information to establish the reason for informant\u2019s personal exposure to the evidence. The questions unanswered in <em>Reesman </em>are answered here. In this case, the informant was acting as an ordinary citizen who worked as part of a hired cleaning crew that cleaned the Beaupres\u2019 home after a fire in the residence. The informant was thrust, via employment, into the position of observing drug manufacturing components at the Beaupres\u2019 residence and subsequently reported it to the police. There is nothing in the record to suggest any motivation other than good citizenship, and we conclude that the informant was reliable for purposes of establishing probable cause without further corroboration, and that the information used in the application was reliable and credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b648 Beaupre\u2019s second argument, that the warrant was impermissibly based on hearsay, is likewise unavailing. We have held that \u201c[i]t cannot be disputed that hearsay information may be considered to establish probable cause,\u201d <em>State v. Kelly </em>(1983), 205 Mont. 417, 434, 668 P.2d 1032, 1042 (quoting <em>State ex rel. Townsend v. District Court </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 357, 360, 543 P.2d 193, 195), but, more specifically, we have also held that \u201c[observations of fellow officers of the Government engaged in a common investigation are plainly a reliable basis for a warrant applied for by one of their number.\u201d <em>State v. Seaman </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 466, 472, 771 P.2d 950, 954 (quoting <em>United States v. Ventresca </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 102, 111, 85 S.Ct. 741, 747, 13 L.Ed.2d 684, 690). As such, it was not inappropriate for Gleich to rely on the information Hamilton provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u00b649 Neither was the application insufficient, as Beaupre argues, because the photographs supplied by the informant did not exhibit all of the items listed on the application to be seized during the search. The application relied upon the cleaning crew\u2019s personal observations, as communicated by the informant, which was confirmed by photographs of a syringe, cooking components and a white, powdery substance which the crew believed to be cocaine. Officer Gleich, based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>upon his experience and training, saw other items in the photographs, such as straws, wires and spoons, which he believed were consistent with a drug operation. The informant also related additional information, such as the presence of cooking glassware and empty cans of Coleman fuel. Taken together, the application presented sufficient reliable information to support the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b650  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that there was probable cause to issue the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b651 <em>Did the District Court err in finding a valid consensual search?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ayu\">\u00b652 Beaupre argues that the District Court erred in finding that there was consent to the search because the District Court did not apply the totality of the circumstances test and instead found that the Beaupres were not credible. The State counters that the District Court did look at the totality of the circumstances and properly concluded that the Beaupres had consented to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\u00b653  \u201cThe knowing and voluntary consent by a citizen to a search is a recognized exception to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>State v. Olson, </em>2002 MT 211, \u00b6 19, 311 Mont. 270, \u00b6 19, 55 P.3d 935, \u00b6 19. In determining whether consent was knowing and voluntary, \u201cwe must consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the giving of the consent.\u201d <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 21. Beaupre insists that there was no valid consent because she and Shane were coerced into consenting to the search. She alleges coercion because there were numerous officers in her home, Shane did not read the consent form before he signed it, and Shane was taken off guard because he had been sleeping after a long work shift and was not prepared to \u201cface something like this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">\u00b654  The record clearly indicates that the District Court did consider the totality of the circumstances. In finding that the Beaupres had consented to the search, the District Court noted the \u201cinconsistencies in [the Beaupres\u2019] recollections and in the testimony or the evidence which they provided by their previous affidavits,\u201d and orally ruled, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">there were a minimum number of officers who, first of all, requested permission to enter the house, made an inquiry after they arrived within the house whether they could search, they were authorized verbally to search, they went to the efforts of attempting to corroborate that by a written signature, that was done after Mr. Beaupre read various, depending on his testimony, the top half, which contains all of the terms about voluntarily authorizing the officers to search and remove items or all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>consent <em>form and then a </em>relaxed Mr. Shane Beaupre signed the consent agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b655  Our review of the record and the District Court\u2019s decision indicates that there was substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we hold that it did not err in finding that the Beaupres voluntarily and knowingly consented to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b656 <em>If the search warrant was invalid, does the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine require suppression of the evidence seized through the consensual search?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u00b657 Because we conclude that the District Court properly found that substitute Justice of the Peace Rennie had authority to issue the search warrant, that the search warrant was supported by probable cause, and that the Beaupres voluntarily and knowingly consented to the search, we do not need to address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">\u00b658 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b440-9\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, REGNIER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-10\"> The 1997 amendments to \u00a7 3-10-231, MCA, which followed <em>Potter </em>and <em>Vickers, </em>do not affect the analysis here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b440-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AGQA\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">\u00b659 I dissent from the Court\u2019s determination that Rennie, the purported substitute justice of the peace, had authority to issue the search warrant. On that basis, I would not reach whether the warrant was supported by probable cause and would conclude that the consensual search-as well as evidence found at the places searched-resulted from an invalid warrant and, therefore, were fruit of the poisonous tree. I would reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of Beaupre\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">\u00b660 The key to the proper resolution of all these issues, as the Court recognizes, is whether substitute justice of the peace Rennie was authorized to issue the warrant. In other words, were the requirements set forth in \u00a7 3-10-231, MCA, met? I submit that they were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-13\">\u00b661 I agree that the \u201cwithin 30 days of taking office\u201d phrase in \u00a7 3-10-231(2)(a)(i), MCA, is the focal point of this issue because, unless Judge Guilio\u2019s designation of Rennie occurred timely within the meaning of that phrase, Rennie was not authorized to issue the search warrant. I disagree with the Court\u2019s approach to interpreting that phrase, as well as with the result it reaches therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">\u00b662 I do not disagree with the Court that a dictionary contains the definition of \u201cwithin\u201d on which it relies. Indeed, various oft-used and respected dictionaries contain a plethora of definitions of the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>\u201cwithin\u201d when used as a preposition. <em>See, e.g., </em>The AMERICAN Heritage Dictionary ofthe English Language 1976 (4th ed. 2000); Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2627 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b663 In my opinion, however, the question before us is really not the definition of \u201cwithin.\u201d The question is the meaning of the entire prepositional phrase \u201cwithin 30 days of taking office.\u201d In other words, does the phrase mean, as the Court seems to posit, that Judge Guilio was required to designate Rennie at any time after his re-election in early November of 1998 but no later than 30 days after he took office again? I think not. It is my view that the 30 days run forward from the circumstance included at the end of the prepositional phrase-here, within 30 days <em>after </em>taking office. I realize that the Legislature used the word \u201cof\u2019 rather than the word \u201cafter.\u201d But, in my view, the only reasonable interpretation of legislative intent in the context of \u00a7 3-10-231, MCA, is \u201cwithin 30 days after taking office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b664 Section 3-10-231(2)(a), MCA, contains only one provision regarding a justice of the peace providing a list of substitute justices of the peace. The requirement is that a justice of the peace shall provide a list of persons qualified to hold court in the justice\u2019s place \u201c[wjithin 30 days of taking office.\u201d Section 3-10-23 l(2)(a)(i), MCA. The statute does not contain a method applicable to a newly elected justice of the peace and a separate method applicable to a re-elected justice of the peace such as Judge Guilio. Thus, this issue must be addressed as though Judge Guilio had been newly elected in November of 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"AH6v\">\u00b665 The question, then, is whether a justice of the peace can take any official action <em>prior </em>to taking office, as the Court\u2019s analysis of the phrase \u201cwithin 30 days of taking office\u201d would permit. The answer, quite simply, is \u201cno\u201d-because the elected person does not <em>become </em>a justice of the peace for purposes of designating substitutes, or any other purpose, unless and until she or he \u201ctakes office.\u201d In the present case, it is not disputed that Judge Guilio\u2019s designation of Rennie was not timely during his first term of office. By the same token, since the designation was made <em>prior </em>io-and not within 30 days <em>after </em>\u2014 Judge Guilio took office for his second term, the designation did not satisfy the statutory requirements. As a result, Rennie was not authorized to issue the search warrant at issue in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b666 Other than a dictionary definition which relates solely to the word \u201cwithin,\u201d the Court advances no authority for its interpretation of the statutory phrase \u201cwithin 30 days of taking office.\u201d This is somewhat surprising, given the number of times the phrase \u201cwithin 30 days of [some occurrence or event]\u201d appears in Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u00b667 The phrase appears once in the people\u2019s document-the Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Constitution. Article VII, Section 8 provides that in the event'the governor fails to timely appoint a replacement for a District or Supreme Court vacancy, the Chief Justice shall make the appointment from the same nominees \u201cwithin thirty days of the governor\u2019s failure to appoint.\u201d Certainly that constitutional provision can only mean \u201cwithin thirty days <em>after </em>the governor\u2019s failure to appoint.\u201d No rational person would even hint that the Chief Justice could act during the same period of time the governor was authorized to act. Yet, a refusal to interpret \u201cwithin 30 days of\u2019 as \u201cwithin 30 days after\u201d results in such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b668 Moreover, the prepositional phrase \u201cwithin 30 days of [some occurrence or event]\u201d appears more than 200 times in the Montana Code Annotated. Only a few examples need to be set forth to illustrate the error in the Court\u2019s interpretation. Section 2-3-114, MCA, provides that \u201c[t]he district courts of the state have jurisdiction to set aside an agency decision under this part upon petition made within 30 days of the date of the decision[.]\u201d Can this statute really mean, as it does pursuant to the Court\u2019s analysis, that a petition can be filed within 30 days before the decision at issue, but not later than 30 days after the decision? Similarly, \u00a7 2-3-213, MCA, provides that a suit to void a decision made in violation of \u00a7 2-3-203, MCA, must be commenced \u201cwithin 30 days of the decision.\u201d Does this mean that such a suit can be filed in a district court within 30 days before the decision is made, but not later than 30 days after? Surely not!</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b669 Furthermore, the Legislature is fully cognizant of how to set a time parameter which includes a 30-day time period both before and after a specified event. For example, \u00a7 1-5-405(3), MCA, requires fees and documents to be submitted \u201cwithin 30 days before or within 30 days after\u201d the effective date of a surety bond. The Legislature did not include this language in \u00a7 3-10-231(2)(a)(i), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u00b670 Finally, to the extent the Court believes it is appropriate to rely on a dictionary definition of only one word in the phrase at issue, I recommend it look to a definition for the word \u201cof.\u201d The first definition of that word set forth in The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1219 (4th ed. 2000), is \u201coriginating at or from.\u201d Under this common meaning of the word \u201cof,\u201d the only reasonable interpretation of the phrase \u201cwithin 30 days of taking office\u201d is that a substitute justice of the peace must be designated within 30 days from a justice of the peace taking office, not prior to taking office.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\u00b671 Judge Guilio\u2019s designation of Rennie prior to taking office does not comply with the requirement of \u00a7 3-10-23 l(2)(a)(i), MCA, that a justice of the peace shall provide for a substitute justice of the peace withifi 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>days of taking office. The search warrant at issue in the present case was not valid because Rennie was not authorized to issue it. For that reason, I would reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of Beaupre\u2019s motion to suppress and remand for further proceedings consistent with the stated conclusions. I strenuously dissent from the Court\u2019s refusal to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b443-4\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AgS\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b672 I concur in Chief Justice Gray\u2019s dissent. As an aside, this is the third time in the last ten years that this Court has been called upon to interpret \u00a7 3-10-231, MCA. <em>See State v. Vickers, </em>1998 MT 201, 290 Mont. 356, 964 P.2d 756; <em>Potter v. Dist. Ct. of 16th Jud. Dist. </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 384, 880 P.2d 1319. In these cases, the evidence that was seized pursuant to search warrants issued by justices of the peace was suppressed because of a failure to comply with the technical requirements of \u00a7 3-10-231, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u00b673 Specifically, in <em>Vickers, </em>the acting justice of the peace did not qualify as a judge under \u00a7 3-10-231, MCA, because: (1) he failed to create a list of substitutes; (2) the constitutional oath of office was not properly administered; and (3) he failed to satisfy the call-in procedure when he did provide law enforcement officials with a \u201cmenu\u201d of substitutes, rather than designating specific justices whom could assume jurisdiction. <em>Vickers, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-29. Further, in <em>Potter, </em>we held that marijuana and other drug related evidence seized as a result of search warrants issued by an acting justice of the peace must be suppressed, given that the acting justice of the peace did not qualify as such under \u00a7 3-10-231, MCA, because he: (1) did not draw up a list of persons qualified to hold court in his absence within thirty days of his taking office; (2) he did not a obtain a waiver of training from the Commission; (3) he was not sworn as an acting justice of the peace; and (4) another city judge was not asked to serve, although he was capable of so doing. <em>Potter, </em>266 Mont. at 392-94, 880 P.2d at 1324-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\u00b674 In addition to <em>Vickers </em>and <em>Potter </em>and the discussions contained therein, \u00a7 3-10-231, MCA, has been at issue in five separate Attorney General Opinions. All of these opinions have attempted to provide guidance regarding the very complex process of substituting a justice of the peace. <em>See </em>48 <em>Op. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>11 (2000); 43 <em>Op. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>51 (1990); 43 <em>Op. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>49 (1989); 42 <em>Op. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>4 (1987); 40 <em>Op. Att\u2019y Gen. </em>26 (1983). If nothing else, this Court\u2019s Opinions in <em>Vickers </em>and <em>Potter, </em>coupled with those of the Attorney General ought to say something to the legislature regarding the complexity of the process delineated in \u00a7 3-10-231, MCA-namely that calling in an acting justice of the peace should not be this difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>\u00b675 Section 3-10-231, MCA, was originally enacted in 1871; it has been amended numerous times, the last in 1997. It is high time that \u00a7 3-10-231, MCA, be scrapped and a new statute adopted which simplifies the process and procedure for calling in a qualified substitute justice of the peace. The present statute contains sufficient traps for the unwary and, as here, interpretational issues, to make calling in a substitute justice, at best, risky business. And, as demonstrated by <em>Vickers </em>and <em>Potter, </em>the consequences of not complying with the statute are severe-i.e., crucial evidence of criminal conduct can be lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b676 In some cases, as the Court\u2019s Opinion shows, the actual practice of justices does not conform to what that law actually requires-e.g., some justices do not consult with every judge in every surrounding county in attempting to assess the judge\u2019s availability or lack thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"ApmH\">\u00b677 In other instances, what the law requires does not make sense. For example, \u00a7 3-10-231(4), MCA, requires that if the justice of the peace is attending a training session, another justice of the peace in the same county is authorized to handle matters that would otherwise be handled by the absent justice. One problem with this language is that <em>all </em>limited court jurisdiction judges must complete two mandatory training sessions each year as prescribed by the Commission on Courts of Limited Jurisdiction. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3-1-1502, MCA; Rule 4 of the Rules for Courts of Limited Jurisdiction Training and Certification of Judges. In jurisdictions which have two justices of the peace, both justices of the peace, along with the city court and municipal court judges, will all be in the prescribed training at the same time.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b678 In short, \u00a7 3-10-231, MCA, needs to be made a good deal more user friendly and workable than it is now.
