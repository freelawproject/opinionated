(hereinafter \u201cJ\u201d), ayouth, was charged with two counts of felony Assault with a Weapon.

We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issue before this Court is whether the District Court erred when it concluded that a cigarette lighter was a \u201cweapon\u201d capable of producing \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d and thereafter denying \u201cJ\u2019s\u201d Motion to Dismiss on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">\u00b63 The facts in this case are undisputed. On August 11, 2001, when \u201cJ\u201d was sixteen years old, his mother asked him to babysit for his five-year old half-sister (hereinafter \u201cM\u201d), and his two half-brothers, ages four and two. Over the course of the evening, \u201cJ\u201d repeatedly burned \u201cM\u201d with the heated metal tip of a cigarette lighter. After inflicting at least six burns to her shoulder, arm, the inside of her thigh, and the bottom of one of her feet, he instructed her to put aloe on the injuries and to tell no one what he had done. When their mother returned home and noticed the multiple bandaids \u201cM\u201d was wearing, \u201cM\u201d told her she had fallen while riding her bicycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">\u00b64 A few days later, the mother took the young children swimming and discovered the burns beneath \u201cM\u2019s\u201d bandaids. At that time, \u201cM\u201d told her what \u201cJ\u201d had done. The four-year old child corroborated the story and said he was afraid that \u201cJ\u201d was going to bum him and the younger child that evening as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">\u00b65 On August 17,2001, approximately one week after the burns were inflicted, \u201cM\u2019s\u201d mother reported the incident to \u201cM\u2019s\u201d day care provider, who in turn notified the authorities. On August 20, \u201cM\u201d was examined by a pediatric physician who diagnosed her with several second degree burns that potentially could cause permanent scarring. On August 21, \u201cJ\u201d was taken into custody. He underwent a psychological evaluation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>and on April 19, 2002, the State charged him with two counts of Assault with a Weapon. One count was for causing \u201cM\u201d to be in reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury; the other was for causing his four-year brother the same fear and apprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b66 On June 26,2002, \u201cJ\u201d filed a Motion to Dismiss on the ground that the facts alleged against him did not, as a matter of law, support the two counts of assault. The State filed its Response on July 25, and on August 29, 2002, the District Court issued it's Opinion and Order denying \u201cJ\u2019s\u201d Motion. \u201cJ\u201d filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b67 As indicated above, the issue before us on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying \u201cJ\u2019s\u201d Motion to Dismiss after concluding that a cigarette lighter was a \u201cweapon\u201d capable of producing \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d The District Court\u2019s determination that the lighter satisfied the statutory definition of \u201cweapon\u201d is a conclusion of law which we review for correctness. Moreover, a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss criminal charges is also a matter of law which we review <em>de novo, </em>determining only whether the court correctly interpreted the law. <em>State v. Smith, </em>2004 MT 191, \u00b6 12, 322 Mont. 206, \u00b6 12, 95 P.3d 137, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">\u00b68 \u201cJ\u201d argues that the \u201cunlit\u201d lighter he used to burn \u201cM\u201d does not meet the statutory definition of a \u201cweapon\u201d that is set forth in \u00a7 45-2-101(78), MCA. He further argues that because the \u201cunlit\u201d lighter was not a weapon, he was erroneously charged with \u201cAssault with a Weapon\u201d under \u00a7 45-5-213, MCA, and the District Court erred in denying his Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">\u00b69 Section 45-2-101(78), MCA, defines \u201cweapon\u201d as \u201can instrument, article, or substance that, regardless of its primary function, is readily capable of being used to produce death or serious bodily injury.\u201d Section 45-5-213(1), MCA, states that \u201c[a] person commits the offense of assault with a weapon if the person purposely or knowingly causes: (a) bodily injury to another with a weapon; or (b) reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury in another by use of a weapon or what reasonably appears to be a weapon.\u201d \u201cSerious bodily injury\u201d is defined as a bodily injury that \u201ccreates a substantial risk of death; causes serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function or process of a bodily member or organ; or at the time of injury, can reasonably be expected to result in serious permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>function or process of a bodily member or organ.\u201d Section 45-2-101(65), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b610 \u201cJ\u2019s\u201d argument is predicated upon the fact that the lighter was unlit when he burned \u201cM,\u201d and that an \u201cunlit\u201d lighter is not readily capable of producing death or serious bodily injury; therefore he cannot, by law, be guilty of assault with a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b611 The State counters that the lighter is \u201can instrument\u201d that is \u201creadily capable of being used to produce death or serious bodily injury;\u201d therefore it is a weapon under \u00a7 45-2-101(78), MCA. The State concedes that had the lighter been defective or been out of fuel and therefore incapable of being ignited, this may have precluded the lighter from being a \u201cweapon\u201d under <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 134, 936 P.2d 316 (a broken, unloaded, and inoperable BB gun was not a weapon under Montana law), or <em>State v. Clemo, </em>1999 MT 323, 297 Mont. 316, 992 P.2d 1263 (an unloaded BB gun was not a weapon). However, such was not the case. The lighter used by \u201cJ\u201d contained-sufficient fuel to ignite numerous times in order to get the tip hot enough to burn \u201cM.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u00b612 The District Court concluded that the cigarette lighter was a weapon because \u201c[e]ven though the flame was extinguished before the lighter was held against [\u201cM\u2019s\u201d] body, the lighter was readily capable of being used to produce serious bodily injury, had [\u201cJ\u201d] relit it next to [\u201cM\u2019s\u201d] clothing, hair, or body.\u201d The District Court continued that the Montana Supreme Court has defined \u201cweapon\u201d broadly and \u201chas upheld the determination that items are weapons under the statutory definition even when serious bodily injury has not resulted from their use; the potential to cause serious bodily injury is sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\u00b613 While the lighter \u201cJ\u201d used to burn \u201cM\u201d was unlit when he pressed it to her flesh, it had been lit immediately prior in order to heat the metal tip to a temperature that would inflict pain and burn \u201cM.\u201d Despite her cries and pleas to stop, \u201c J\u201d burned \u201cM\u201d this way at least six times. His two younger brothers witnessed the assaults and were afraid that they, too, would be assaulted. There is no doubt that at the time \u201cJ\u201d was using the \u201cunlit\u201d lighter in this fashion, it was a weapon in the generic sense or as defined by the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary (i.e., \u201csomething used to injure\u201d). We need now determine whether the District Court correctly concluded that it met the statutory definition of \u201cweapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">\u00b614 <em> \u201cJ\u201d </em>relies on In Re R.L.S., 1999 MT 34, 293 Mont. 288, 977 P.2d 967, in which we concluded that a package intended to look like a bomb but which had no explosive or dangerous components was not a \u201cweapon\u201d under \u00a7 45-2-101(76), MCA, (later renumbered as subsection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>(78)). Virtually the only portion of <em>R.L.S. </em>that is inapposite to the case before us is its holding. In <em>R.L.S., </em>we explained that our role in construing a statutory definition is \u201cto ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d We continued that \u201c[w]here the language is clear and unambiguous, the statute speaks for itself and we will not resort to other means of interpretation.\u201d <em>R.L.S., </em>\u00b6 8. Lastly, we concluded that \u201ca device is a weapon under the plain meaning of \u00a7 45-2-101[78], MCA, if it is easily able to produce death or serious bodily injury.\u201d <em>R.L.S., </em>\u00b6 9. In <em>R.L.S., </em>the fake bomb did not satisfy this definition. In the case before us, an operable cigarette lighter containing fuel and being used as a device to inflict pain or injury on \u201cM,\u201d and threatened to be used by \u201cJ\u201d on his little brother, does satisfy this definition. The District Court did not err when it so concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b615  Lastly, \u201cJ\u201d disingenuously maintains that because he did not actually inflict \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d on \u201cM,\u201d he cannot be guilty of assault with a weapon. \u201cJ\u201d is confusing assault with a weapon with the crime of aggravated assault, \u00a7 45-5-202, MCA, which requires the assailant to purposely or knowingly cause serious bodily injury to another. For one to violate the assault with a weapon statute, \u00a7 45-5-213(l)(b), MCA, one need only purposely or knowingly cause the victim \u201creasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury\u201d by use of a weapon or what reasonably appears to be a weapon. In <em>R.L.S., </em>we explained that reasonable apprehension of a victim pertains to \u201cwhether the victim reasonably believes he or she will be seriously bodily injured, not whether he or she subjectively believes that the device or instrument used by the assailant is actually a weapon.\u201d <em>R.L.S., </em>\u00b6 14. In the case before us, it is undisputed that both \u201cM\u201d and \u201cJ\u2019s\u201d four-year old brother who witnessed \u201cJ\u201d burning \u201cM\u201d viewed the hot lighter as a weapon and were frightened for their safety. The four-year old even expressed fear for his younger brother\u2019s safety. Whether such young children can intellectually distinguish fear of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d as defined by the statute from fear of other obviously painful physical injury is irrelevant. There is no dispute that these children were in reasonable apprehension of what they rightfully considered to be \u201cserious bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b616 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b90-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
