On cross motions for summary judgment, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of GMROA. Gagnon appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it granted GMROA\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Gagnon\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u00b63 Gagnon owns Lot 115 of the Grassy Mountain Ranch-Phase II Subdivision in Meagher County. Gagnon purchased a Marlette Manufactured Home and placed it on a permanent foundation on his lot. The parties agree that the home is \u201cmanufactured housing\u201d as defined by \u00a7 76-2-202(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">\u00b64 GMROA brought a cause of action against Gagnon alleging his placement of the home on the lot violates the restrictive covenants pertaining to the subdivision. Specifically, GMROA argues that manufactured homes are not permitted in the subdivision. Two provisions of the covenants are relevant to the present case. The first provision, which defines \"mobile home,\u201d reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">A detached residential dwelling unit manufactured at a factory, is not in accordance with the standards of the Uniform Building Code, and is designed for transportation on its own chassis to a building site for occupation as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">The second provision is Covenant 5.14, which provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\">Except as provided in 5.14.1, no trailers, mobile homes, or other movable living conveniences shall be lived in upon the property. The restriction does not prevent pre-built homes on permanent foundations that meet United States Federal Housing Specifications as non-mobile, permanent residential homes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">\u00b65 Gagnon had both constructive and actual notice of the covenants when he purchased Lot 115. He also was warned in writing by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>representative of GMROA, prior to placing the manufactured home on his lot, that its placement would violate Section 5.14 of the covenants and that GMROA would enforce the covenants.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-3\">\u00b66 Gagnon and GMROA filed cross motions for summary judgment. The District Court granted GMROA\u2019s motion and denied Gagnon\u2019s. Gagnon appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">\u00b67 Our review of a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment is de novo. <em>Associated Press v. Crofts, </em>2004 MT 120, \u00b6 11, 321 Mont. 193, \u00b6 11, 89 P.3d 971, \u00b6 11. Our standard of review for a question of law is plenary. <em>Collection Bureau Servs. v. Morrow, </em>2004 MT 84, \u00b6 6, 320 Mont. 478, \u00b6 6, 87 P.3d 1024, \u00b6 6. We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions for correctness. <em>Generali v. Alexander, </em>2004 MT 81, \u00b6 17, 320 Mont. 450, \u00b6 17, 87 P.3d 1000, \u00b6 17. Where all of the facts bearing on the resolution of legal issues are before this Court, we have the authority to reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment and direct it to enter summary judgment in favor of the other party. <em>Royal Ins. Co. v. Roadarmel, </em>2000 MT 259, \u00b6 51, 301 Mont. 508, \u00b6 51, 11 P.3d 105, \u00b6 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err when it granted GMROA\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Gagnon\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">\u00b69 Gagnon advances three arguments on appeal. First he argues that the covenant at issue specifically allows for a manufactured home if it meets certain specifications. Second, he argues in the alternative that the covenant at issue is ambiguous and should therefore be interpreted to allow free use of the property. Third, he argues that GMROA waived its right to enforce the covenant against Gagnon. Because we find that the covenants clearly allow for Gagnon\u2019s manufactured home, we need not address his other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">\u00b610 In <em>Fox Farm Estates Landowners v. Kreisch </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 264, 947 P.2d 79, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">This Court interprets restrictive covenants by looking first to the language of the covenant to ascertain its meaning. If the language is clear and explicit, the language will govern. The language of restrictive covenants should be understood in its ordinary and popular sense. Restrictive covenants should be strictly construed and ambiguities resolved to allow free use of the property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>However, such free use must be balanced against the rights of other purchasers. Generally, restrictive covenants are considered valid if they maintain or enhance the character of the subdivision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABa\"><em>Fox Farm Estates, </em>285 Mont. at 268-69, 947 P.2d at 82 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b611  The District Court found that Gagnon\u2019s home was a mobile home within the definition provided in the covenants, and cannot be considered a non-mobile, permanent, residential home as contemplated by the second sentence of Section 5.14. We disagree. Gagnon acknowledges that under Montana law, a \u201cmanufactured home\u201d is a \"mobile home.\u201d <em>See Fox Farm, </em>285 Mont. at 270-272, 947 P.2d at 83-84. Gagnon concedes that if Section 5.14 had ended after the first sentence which specifically excludes \u201cmobile homes,\u201d he would be in violation of the covenants. However, the second sentence of Section 5.14 makes it clear that a manufactured home or other pre-built home placed on a permanent foundation is not to be excluded if it meets the United States Federal Housing Specifications. If the intent of the drafters was to prohibit manufactured homes, including manufactured homes placed on permanent foundations in compliance with federal standards, then there would have been no need to have included the second sentence of Section 5.14.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b612 GMROA argues that under <em>Fox Farm, </em>Gagnon\u2019s manufactured home violates the covenants. In concluding that the manufactured home at issue in <em>Fox Farm </em>was a mobile home, we considered that the home was described as a manufactured home by the dealer, that the home was issued a Montana Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title number and a vehicle identification number, that it was brought to the lot in two separate units and then joined together and that it had its own steel frame undercarriage and used axles and wheels for the purpose of transport. <em>Fox Farm, </em>285 Mont. at 270-71, 947 P.2d at 83. GMROA points out that those same factors are present in this case. However, <em>Fox Farm </em>is distinguishable not because of the type of home, but because of the covenants. The covenant <em>in Fox Fann </em>expressly forbade mobile homes, but did not include a provision allowing for certain prebuilt homes on permanent foundations as does Section 5.14 here.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\u00b613  Interpreting the covenant to prohibit Gagnon\u2019s manufactured home would render the second sentence meaningless. We hold that Section 5.14 of GMROA\u2019s covenants allow for a manufactured home on permanent foundations that meet United States Federal Housing Specifications as non-mobile, permanent residential homes. We reverse the District Court and remand with instructions to enter summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>judgment in favor of Gagnon.</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-3\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"ASE\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"Ap\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">\u00b614 I dissent. Gagnon conceded that his home was a \u201cmobile home.\u201d Covenant 5.14 therefore applies to ban its placement on the lot. The second sentence of this provision excepts from the Covenant\u2019s application pre-built homes on permanent foundations that meet U.S. Federal Housing Specifications \u201cas <em>non-mobile </em>permanent residential homes.\u201d (Emphasis added). Given his admission, Gagnon\u2019s home simply does not qualify as a <em>non-mobile </em>home. In my judgment, that should be the end of the inquiry. I would therefore affirm the entry of summary judgment in favor of GMROA.</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-5\">JUSTICE WARNER joins in the dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
