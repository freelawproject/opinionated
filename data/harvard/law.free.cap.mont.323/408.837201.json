Fyant (Fyant) appeals the judgment of the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, denying her Motion for Assumption of Jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal and affirm: Did the District Court err in denying Fyant\u2019s Motion for Assumption of Jurisdiction? We decline to address Fyant\u2019s second issue raised on appeal, given that we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Fyant\u2019s Motion for Assumption of Jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">\u00b63 On August 18, 2002, Fyant, who was in the process of driving her intoxicated friends home, was pulled over because the vehicle she was driving-her boyfriend\u2019s vehicle-did not have a license plate light, nor was it insured. Upon failing to provide proof of insurance, Fyant received a citation and then was permitted to finish driving her friends home.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">\u00b64 Fyant voluntarily, upon questioning from the Justice Court, pled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>guilty to failing to provide proof of insurance-her second offense. In exchange for her guilty plea, it was agreed that Fyant would receive a 10 day suspended jail sentence, a $20.00 surcharge, and a $350.00 fine, with all or part of the fine suspended upon a finding by the Justice Court of Fyant\u2019s inability to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b65 Fyant introduced evidence at Justice Court that her 2002 income was approximately $9,000.00; that her expected annual income for 2003 was approximately $5,000.00; and that she had two children, no husband, and received no child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\u00b66 The Justice Court made no determination regarding Fyant\u2019s ability to pay the fines and refused to suspend the fines. Fyant then filed a timely appeal to the District Court, arguing that the sentence imposed was illegal and bringing the question of subject matter jurisdiction to the District Court\u2019s attention. The District Court found that \u201cFyant failed to provide any statutory authority for appeal,\u201d and it, therefore, lacked subject matter jurisdiction to determine Fyant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">\u00b67 Whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>State v. Boucher, </em>2002 MT 114, \u00b6 10, 309 Mont. 514, \u00b6 10, 48 P.3d 21, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err in denying Fyant\u2019s Motion for Assumption of Jurisdiction?</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">\u00b69 Fyant argues that since the State is authorized by statute to appeal illegal sentences in certain cases, then that right must be reciprocal under the Montana and United States Constitutions. In addition, Fyant argues that there exists a discrepancy between \u00a7 46-17-311, MCA, which provides grounds upon which a defendant may appeal in a criminal case from a court of limited jurisdiction, and \u00a7 46-20-103, MCA, which provides the State with different grounds for appeal. As such, Fyant argues that she \u201cdoes not fall under any of the four categories to which criminal defendants are expressly limited\u201d by \u00a7 46-17-311, MCA, and \u201c[bjecause she appealed an illegal sentence she would have grounds for appeal if she had been the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">\u00b610 The State of Montana (the State) argues that the legislature has clearly spoken on the issue Fyant propounds, namely that \u201ca plea of guilty or nolo contendere in a justice\u2019s court... waives the right of trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>de novo in district court.\u201d In addition, the State argues that this Court has also addressed this issue in <em>State v. Feight, </em>2001 MT 205, 306 Mont. 312, 33 P.3d 623, \u201cin holding that the law provides no appeal from a guilty plea entered injustice court.\u201d As such, the State contends that Fyant misleadingly cites to the proposition that a district court has \u201cgeneral appellate jurisdiction,\u201d regarding Fyant\u2019s guilty plea in Justice Court. As to Fyant\u2019s constitutional arguments, the State cites <em>Boucher </em>for the proposition that \u201cMontana law does not require such an odd remedy as a new trial for an illegal sentence claim following a guilty plea.\u201d Indeed, the State argues that Fyant\u2019s sole recourse is a postconviction relief proceeding, given that \u201c[u]nless a specific issue has been preserved for appeal prior to final judgment, our laws provide no appeal from a plea of guilty or nolo contendere entered in a court of limited jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b611 Section 46-21-101, MCA, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">(1) A person adjudged guilty of an offense in a court of record who has no adequate remedy of appeal and who claims that a sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution or the laws of this state or the constitution of the United States ... may petition the court that imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside, or correct the sentence or revocation order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">(2) If the sentence was imposed by a justice\u2019s, municipal, or city court, the petition may not be filed unless the petitioner has exhausted all appeal remedies provided by law. The petition must be filed with the district court in the county where the lower court is located.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">\u00b612  As the above-quoted statute states, and as we noted in <em>Boucher, </em>\u201c[t]he right to postconviction relief is available to a defendant whose sentence was imposed by a justice, municipal or city court,\u201d and is available \u201cwhen the sentence violates state law, the Montana Constitution or the Constitution of the United States.\u201d <em>Boucher, </em>\u00b6 17. However, this right to postconviction relief is only available once a defendant has exhausted all appeal remedies provided by law. Section 46-21-101(1), MCA; <em>Boucher, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">\u00b613  In addition, we recently held in <em>Pe\u00f1a v. State, </em>2004 MT 293, 323 Mont. 347, 100 P.3d 154, that jurisdictional claims before a court include those claims that challenge the court\u2019s \u201c \u2018power\u2019 or \u2018capacity to entertain the subject matter of the proceeding and render a determination therein.\u201d <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">\u00b614  Section 46-17-203(2)(a), MCA, states that a \u201cplea of guilty or nolo contendere in a justice\u2019s court, city court, or other court of limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>jurisdiction waives the right of trial de novo in district court.\u201d However, for the waiver to take effect, \u201c[a] defendant must be informed of the waiver before the plea is accepted, and the justice or judge shall question the defendant to ensure that the plea and waiver are entered voluntarily.\u201d Section 46-17-203(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\u00b615  Here, Fyant pled guilty to driving without insurance--her second offense. As part of her plea, she agreed to pay certain statutory fines, with all or part of those fines suspended upon a finding by the Justice Court that she was unable to pay them. The Justice Court, however, did not make such a finding. Hence, Fyant has available to her the remedy of postconviction relief, under \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA, having met the necessary criteria. Her remedy is not a trial <em>de novo </em>at the District Court. Section 46-17-203(2)(a), MCA, clearly states that a trial <em>de novo </em>is not available to a defendant who voluntarily pleads guilty. Hence, as in <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>the District Court did not have the \u201c \u2018power\u2019 or \u2018capacity\u2019 to entertain the subject matter of the proceeding and render a determination therein.\u201d Therefore, we conclude that the District Court was correct in determining that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Fyant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b424-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, REGNIER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
