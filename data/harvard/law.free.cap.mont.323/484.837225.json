We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u00b62 We rephrase the issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in dismissing Quality\u2019s complaint on grounds that the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over Respondents would violate due process?</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">\u00b64 The parties dispute the status of Quality as a business entity, whether a Montana <em>de facto </em>partnership or corporation. The District Court did not address the issue, although the complaint defined Quality as \u201ca car dealership located in Hamilton, Montana.\u201d We also note that the complaint treats Quality as an unspecified business entity which had Montana employees, sustained damages, and pursued recovery from the Respondents. During the course of the litigation, Quality was incorporated as a Montana corporation. Regardless of its particular status, there is no question that Quality is a business entity which operated a car dealership in Montana during the events which gave rise to this litigation. As such, we will refer to Quality as a business entity herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">\u00b65 Prior to obtaining the Quality dealership, Hull, Ovitt, and Buckner owned interests in dealerships in Idaho and Butte, Montana. During this time, Appellants became involved with Blayden, who, in addition to being the president and an agent for the Herndon Insurance Agency, was a salesman at one of the Appellants\u2019 Idaho dealerships. Seeking to insure its dealerships, Appellants requested Blayden to procure insurance coverage, including workers\u2019 compensation coverage, for all its dealerships, including its Montana dealership in Butte. Blayden responded to the request, and compiled a list of employees from both the Idaho and Montana dealerships for purposes of calculating workers\u2019 compensation premiums. Blayden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>then ostensibly procured insurance coverage for all the dealerships, believing the coverage included workers\u2019 compensation insurance for the Appellants\u2019 Butte employees. Appellants paid premiums based on the number of their employees. At all times, and upon their request of Blayden to procure insurance and Blayden\u2019s representations, Appellants believed that its Montana employees were covered by workers\u2019 compensation insurance. Blayden did not indicate he could not obtain coverage for Appellants\u2019 employees, and Appellants allege that Blayden negligently believed that he was licensed and authorized to sell workers\u2019 compensation insurance for Montana employees, but that, in fact, he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b66 In August 1998, after selling their Butte dealership, Appellants obtained the Quality dealership, located in Hamilton. Blayden then assisted the Appellants in acquiring a Montana motor vehicle dealer bond for Quality from Western Surety Company. A dealership is required to obtain a motor vehicle dealer bond pursuant to Montana statute to insure third parties will be compensated if they suffer damages due to a dealership\u2019s unlawful conduct. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-4-101(7), MCA. Thereafter, Blayden corresponded with Quality regarding renewal of the bond and solicited further business from Appellants. According to their complaint, Appellants\u2019 belief that they had procured, through Blayden, workers\u2019 compensation coverage for the employees of the Quality dealership is based upon their continued payment of premiums assessed for their Montana employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b67 On September 13,2000, Edna Nasca (\u201cNasca\u201d), an employee at the Hamilton dealership, fell from a truck bed and was injured. Shortly after the accident, the State of Montana informed Quality that its employees were not covered by workers\u2019 compensation insurance. However, by then, Quality had been alerted to the failure to procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance. A few days before Nasca\u2019s accident, Rex Williams (\u201cWilliams\u201d), an insurance agent who was attempting to acquire Quality\u2019s insurance business, discovered that Quality did not actually have workers\u2019 compensation coverage in force. Quality immediately requested Williams to secure such coverage, but unfortunately, Nasca injured herself in the interim. In the course of his work for Quality, Williams questioned Blayden regarding Quality\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation coverage, and Blayden replied he believed that Quality\u2019s Montana employees were insured under the Idaho policy he had procured.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b68 On October 22, 2001, Nasca filed a complaint against Quality for workers\u2019 compensation benefits she would have been entitled to had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Quality been insured. Nasca also filed a claim for compensation with Montana\u2019s Uninsured Employers Fund (\u201cUEF\u201d). Subsequently, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. Quality agreed to reimburse UEF, pay for certain of Nasca\u2019s medical costs, and pay for Nasca\u2019s attorney fees. In return, Nasca agreed to dismiss both her civil suit and workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b69 On February 1,2003, Quality filed a third-party complaint against the Respondents, alleging Blayden had breached their contract when he failed to procure workers\u2019 compensation coverage for Quality\u2019s employees and had committed negligent acts, omissions and representations, and seeking indemnification for the cost of Nasca\u2019s settlement. On April 1, 2003, Respondents filed a Rule 12(b)(2), M.R.Civ.P., motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Respondents argued that, at most, they merely assisted Quality in obtaining a Montana motor vehicle dealer bond from Western Surety Company.</p>\n<p id=\"A-DG\">\u00b610 On May 13, 2003, Nasca and Quality filed a Stipulation for Dismissal of Nasca\u2019s claims, as they had then been settled. The District Court then granted Respondents\u2019 Motion to Dismiss, concluding that, with Nasca\u2019s dismissal, no Montana parties remained in the action, and thus, exercising jurisdiction over the Respondents, who were Idaho residents, would violate due process. Quality appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b611 A district court\u2019s determination not to exercise jurisdiction on the basis of due process is a constitutional question. \u201cA court\u2019s resolution of an issue involving a question of constitutional law is a conclusion of law, which we review to determine whether the conclusion is correct.\u201d <em>City of Missoula v. Robertson, </em>2000 MT 52, \u00b6 14, 298 Mont. 419, \u00b6 14, 998 P.2d 144, \u00b6 14; <em>see also Cimmaron Corp. v. Smith, </em>2003 MT 73, \u00b6 8, 315 Mont. 1, \u00b6 8, 67 P.3d 258, \u00b6 8 (our review of a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s determination that it lacks jurisdiction is a conclusion of law, which we review to ascertain whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct\u201d). \u201cMotions to dismiss are construed in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party and should not be granted unless, taking all well-plead allegations of fact as true, it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiffs can prove no set of facts in support of their claim which would entitle them to relief.\u201d <em>Threlkeld v. Colorado, </em>2000 MT 369, \u00b6 7, 303 Mont. 432, \u00b6 7, 16 P.3d 359, \u00b6 7. \u201cGenerally, a court should determine jurisdiction only on the necessary jurisdictional facts and not on the merits of the case.\u201d <em>Seal v. Hart, </em>2002 MT 149, \u00b6 23, 310 Mont. 307, \u00b6 23, 50 P.3d 522, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err in dismissing Quality\u2019s complaint on grounds that the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over Respondents would violate due process?</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b613  In <em>Cimmaron, </em>\u00b6 10, we held that to determine whether a district court may exercise specific personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant involves a two-part analysis, first determining whether jurisdiction exists pursuant to Rule 4(B)(1), M.R.Civ.P., and second, whether the court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction comports with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b614 Rule 4B(1), M.R.Civ.P., Montana\u2019s \u201clong-arm\u201d provision, states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">All persons found within the State of Montana are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State. In addition, any person is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State as to any claim for relief arising from the doing personally, through an employee, or through an agent, of any of the following acts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-8\">(a) the transaction of any business within this state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-9\">(b) the commission of any act which results in accrual within this state of a tort action;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">(c) the ownership, use or possession of any property, or of any interest therein, situated within this state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">(d) contracting to insure any person, property or risk located within this state at the time of contracting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">(e) entering into a contract for services to be rendered or for materials to be furnished in this state by such person; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">(f) acting as director, manager, trustee, or other officer of any corporation organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business within this state, or as personal representative of any estate within this state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-14\">\u00b615 In its order, the District Court concluded that Respondents\u2019 actions fell within Rule 4(B)(1)(a) and (d), M.R.Civ.P., subjecting them to this state\u2019s specific jurisdiction, but further determined that Montana\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction would violate Respondents\u2019 due process rights. While Quality challenges the District Court\u2019s holding, Respondents, in addition to defending the court\u2019s holding, also argue the court erred when it determined that Montana had specific jurisdiction over them under the first prong of the test. In response, Quality asserts that Respondents\u2019 failure to file a cross-appeal from the District Court\u2019s conclusion bars our review of that argument. We first take up this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>\u00b616 Relying on <em>Rouse v. Anaconda-Deer Lodge County </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 1, 9, 817 P.2d 690, 695, <em>overruled by Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 67, 915 P.2d 175; <em>Silva v. City of Columbia Falls </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 329, 332-33, 852 P.2d 671, 674; and <em>Bond v. City of </em>Phillipsburg, 2003 MT 74, \u00b6 9, 315 Mont. 7, \u00b6 9, 67 P.3d 255, \u00b6 9, Quality argues that whether Montana has specific personal jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 4(B)(1), M.R.Civ.P., is \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from the District Court\u2019s due process analysis, and, therefore, a cross-appeal was necessary to preserve the issue on appeal. Respondents contend that whether Montana specific jurisdiction over them was an integral part of the District Court\u2019s jurisdictional analysis, is an argument they raised in the District Court, and does not require a cross-appeal to preserve.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b617 Quality correctly notes that this Court has required defendants to file a cross-appeal on matters which are \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from those raised by an appellant on review. However, unlike the arguments this Court declined to consider in <em>Rouse, Silva, </em>and <em>Bond, </em>Respondents\u2019 challenge to the District Court\u2019s conclusion on specific jurisdiction is not \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from the issue raised by Quality on appeal. The District Court concluded that it had specific jurisdiction, but determined that the exercise thereof would violate Respondents\u2019 due process rights. Thus, the court\u2019s determination of specific jurisdiction was a sub-part of the entire analysis required of the court. <em>See Cimmaron, </em>\u00b6 10 (if the district court concludes personal jurisdiction fails to exist, further analysis of defendant\u2019s due process rights is unnecessary). Without concluding that specific jurisdiction existed over Respondents, the District Court would never have reached the due process element which Quality challenges on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b618 Further, we have held \u201c[as a] general rule ... a cross-appeal is not necessary to enable a prevailing party \u2018to defend its judgment on any ground properly raised below whether or not that ground was relied upon, rejected, or even considered by the District <em>Court\u2019...\u201d Robertson, </em>\u00b6 20 (quoting <em>Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation </em>(1979), 439 U.S. 463, 478, 99 S.Ct. 740, 750, 58 L.Ed.2d 740, 743). Here, Respondents are the prevailing party in the District Court\u2019s ultimate determination of the two-part personal jurisdiction test. Thus, they are entitled to defend that determination without filing a cross-appeal, because the issue of specific jurisdiction over them was raised in-and rejected by-the District Court. Should Respondents prevail in defending their judgment on the first part of the test, via this Court\u2019s reversal of the District Court\u2019s determination that it had specific jurisdiction over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>them, the Appellants\u2019 issue on appeal would be moot. Based on this authority, we conclude that Respondents\u2019 challenge to the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Montana had specific jurisdiction is not \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from the issue raised by Appellants, and therefore, Respondents retain the right to challenge this conclusion without filing a cross-appeal. We then turn to the issues raised herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Specific personal jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b619 Rule 4B(1), M.R.Civ.P., incorporates the principles of both general and specific jurisdiction. <em>Cimmaron, </em>\u00b6 12. As the District Court noted, the first sentence of the statute deals with the question of general jurisdiction, that is, whether the party can be found within the State. However, general jurisdiction is not at issue in this matter. The parties stipulated that Respondents are residents of the State of Idaho. Thus, at issue is the remainder of Rule 4B(1), M.R.Civ.P., addressing specific personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b620 Respondents argue the District Court erred in concluding that Montana had specific jurisdiction, asserting they neither transacted business nor sold insurance coverage in the State of Montana which would bring them under the provisions of either paragraph (l)(a) or paragraph (l)(d) of Rule 4B. Respondents argue that they merely provided Quality with assistance in securing a Montana motor vehicle dealer bond from Western Security Company, as neither of the Respondents were licensed to insure Montana risk, and point out that Quality\u2019s claims do not arise out of the purchase of this bond. Respondents further offer that they did not maintain offices, employees, or real property in Montana, nor advertised, maintained a telephone listing or solicited referrals in Montana, and thus, did not maintain the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d necessary to establish jurisdiction over them in this state. Lastly, Respondents contend that Quality did not request Blayden to procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance for its Montana employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u00b621 Appellants counter that Respondents are understating their involvement in Montana and minimizing the significance of the motor vehicle dealer bond transaction. They argue that consideration of all of Respondents\u2019 in-state activities reveals that Respondents were transacting business within the state, and that their claims arose from the business Respondents conducted with Quality in Montana. Further, they insist that they had entrusted the procurement of workers\u2019 compensation for Quality\u2019s Montana employees with Blayden, that he had represented the coverage existed, and that they had paid premiums based upon the number of their Montana employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>\u00b622 The District Court rejected Respondents\u2019 arguments, finding significance in Respondents\u2019 procurement of Quality\u2019s motor vehicle dealer bond:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">While the Motor Vehicle Dealer Bond is not the policy allegedly issued by Blayden and/or the Herndon Agency from which this transaction arises, it does offer proof that Blayden and/or the Herndon Agency were transacting business within the State of Montana, as well as contracting to insure a risk located within Montana at the time of contracting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b623 The District Court further rejected Respondents\u2019 contention that they were never instructed to procure workers\u2019 compensation for Quality\u2019s Montana employees. Noting that Appellants\u2019 complaint alleged that Blayden did not believe Montana workers\u2019 compensation coverage was necessary because he believed or misrepresented that the Idaho policy would provide such coverage, the District Court concluded that Respondents had failed to demonstrate that Appellants could prove no set of facts which would entitle them to relief pursuant to the allegations of their complaint. Although Respondents complain that the District Court failed to lay the burden upon Appellants to establish their claim, we conclude herein that Appellants met their burden.</p>\n<p id=\"AoR\">\u00b624 In <em>Seal, </em>we addressed the application of Rule 4B jurisdictional principles upon an out-of-state insurance agent. First, we held that Rule 4B(l)(d), applied not only to insurance companies, but to insurance agents, noting that \u201c[i]t follows that since [the insurance broker] was supposed to obtain insurance for \u2018property or risk located within th[e] Commonwealth at the time of contracting,\u2019jurisdiction can properly be maintained ....\u201d <em>Seal, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Cornell &amp; Co. v. Home Ins. Cos. </em>(E.D.Pa. 1995), 1995 WL 46618, *3). We further held that exercise of jurisdiction over the out of state insurance agent</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">simply requires that the claim for relief arise out of the contracting to insure any person, property, or risk located within Montana at the time of contracting. \u201cArising from,\u201d within this context, has been defined as a direct affiliation, nexus, or substantial connection between the basis for the cause of action and the act which falls within the long-arm statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-7\"><em>Seal, </em>\u00b6 23 (citation omitted). Finally, we concluded that the jurisdiction over the out-of-state defendant had been established under the plaintiffs complaint, which alleged \u201cthat [defendant] had a contractual duty to insure the goods against loss or damage, [defendant] breached her duty to procure the respective insurance, and [plaintiff] suffered a loss as a result of [defendant\u2019s] breach. At their core, the allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>in the complaint derived from the alleged act.\u201d <em>Seal, </em>\u00b6 24. We further noted that jurisdiction was established by the defendant\u2019s knowledge that the goods to be insured were located in Montana. <em>Seal, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b625  The Appellants\u2019 third-party complaint contains the same essential allegations as contained in the complaint in <em>Seal. </em>Further, Respondents\u2019 relationship with Quality exceeded simple knowledge of Quality\u2019s business, which we found sufficient in <em>Seal. Seal, </em>\u00b6 24. Respondents were actively providing insurance services and receiving premium payments from Quality. Although Respondents contest Quality\u2019s assertions regarding their obligation to procure workers\u2019 compensation coverage, that is an issue of fact on the merits of the claims that does not diminish either of the District Court\u2019s findings that Quality\u2019s claims arose from (1) the transaction of business in Montana by Respondents, thus satisfying Rule 4B(l)(a), and (2) contracting to insure risk located within this state, satisfying Rule 4B(l)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Thus, we conclude the District Court correctly held that Respondents\u2019 actions fell within the plain language of Rule 4(B)(1)(a) and (d), M.R.Civ.P., subjecting them to this state\u2019s specific jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Due process</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b626  Under the second part of the test, Appellants argue that the District Court erred in concluding that the exercise of jurisdiction over Respondents did not comport with due process. In <em>Simmons Oil Corp. v. Holly Corp. </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 75, 83, 796 P.2d 189, 194, we adopted the. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal\u2019s three-part test for determining whether the exercise of jurisdiction comports with due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">(1) The nonresident defendant must do some act or consummate some transaction with the forum or perform some act by which he purposefully avails himself of the privileges of conducting activities in the forum, thereby invoking the laws;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">(2) The claim must be one which arises out of or results from the defendant\u2019s forum-related activities; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-10\">(3) The exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">\u00b627 As we noted in <em>Simmons, </em>\u201ca plaintiff is not required to demonstrate each of the above three elements to establish jurisdiction.\u201d Rather, \u201conce a plaintiff shows that the defendant has purposefully availed itself of the privileges of conducting activities [in this state], a presumption of reasonableness arises, which the defendant can only overcome by \u2018presenting a compelling case that jurisdiction would be unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Simmons, </em>244 Mont. at 85, 796 P.2d at 195 (quoting <em>Brand v. Menlove Dodge </em>(9th Cir.1986), 796 F.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>1070, 1074). We will address each element of the due process test in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">\u00b628 <em>Purposefully availing. </em>In <em>Simmons, </em>244 Mont. at 86, 796 P.2d at 195, we stated a nonresident defendant taking voluntary action designed to have an effect in the State of Montana purposefully avails itself of the benefits and protections Montana law provides, and thus, should reasonably anticipate being haled into court in this state. Respondents assert their actions were neither voluntary nor directed to take advantage of the benefits and protections of the law of this state, noting that they neither had offices, employees, or real property in this state, nor advertised, maintained a telephone listing or solicited referrals in this state. However, Respondents fail to fully acknowledge the effect which the allegations of Blayden\u2019s alleged negligence and misrepresentations, if true, had within this state. There can be no doubt that Blayden was commercially engaged with Quality. A commercial transaction was consummated between the parties which resulted in the payment of monies by Quality that profited Respondents. Thereafter, Quality, a Montana business, Nasca, a Montana worker, and the UEF, a state agency, were substantially burdened by Quality\u2019s lack of coverage, which was occasioned by Blayden\u2019s alleged negligence and misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b629  The District Court determined that this element favored the exercise of jurisdiction. Finding that Respondents had engaged in \u201csome transaction\u201d with Quality in Montana, the District Court concluded that Respondents had thus purposefully availed themselves to the privilege of conducting activities in Montana. We concur. Therefore, a presumption arises that exercise of jurisdiction over Respondents is reasonable, which Respondents can overcome only by demonstrating with compelling reasons that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable. <em>Simmons, </em>244 Mont. at 85, 796 P.2d at 195.</p>\n<p id=\"AdS\">\u00b630 <em>Arising out of forum-related, activities. </em>The District Court concluded that this factor also favored the exercise of jurisdiction over the Respondents. Respondents object to the District Court\u2019s conclusion, citing Doe <em>v. Am. Nat\u2019l Red Cross </em>(9th Cir. 1997), 112 F.3d 1048, 1051, which held that a claim does not arise out of the forum if, \u201cbut for\u201d the defendant\u2019s activities therein, the claim would not have occurred. Using this test, Respondents argue that the District Court \u201cwas required to determine that \u2018but-for\u2019 Blayden and the Herndon Agency\u2019s assistance in obtaining a motor vehicle bond, Blayden and the Herndon Agency would have provided Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation insurance to Quality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>\u00b631 However, Respondents\u2019 argument completely ignores the allegations in the complaint. As the District Court concluded, the Appellants\u2019 claims of breach of contract, negligence and misrepresentation arise out of Respondents\u2019 alleged promise to procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance for Quality\u2019s employees, not Respondents\u2019 actions in procuring the motor vehicle dealer bond for Quality. While the motor vehicle dealer bond is evidence of Respondents\u2019 business activity within this state, the complaint\u2019s allegations go beyond that transaction. In <em>Simmons, </em>244 Mont. at 87, 796 P.2d at 196, we stated that to ascertain whether a cause of action arises out of a defendant\u2019s forum-related activity, we would review the entire chain of events leading up to the final act resulting in the claim. Thus, \u201cbut-for\u201d Respondents\u2019 alleged breach, negligence and misrepresentation, Quality would not have relied upon Respondents\u2019 assurance, and could have procured insurance elsewhere, which Quality did upon learning of the absence of coverage. Further, \u201cbut-for\u201d Respondents\u2019 alleged Montana actions, Nasca\u2019s claims against Quality and the UEF, and subsequently, Quality\u2019s claim for indemnification from Respondents, would not have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b632 <em>Reasonableness. </em>The exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable to comport with due process. In <em>Simmons, </em>244 Mont. at 87-88, 796 P.2d at 197, we enumerated several factors to consider when examining the reasonableness of jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">(1) The extent of the defendant\u2019s purposeful interjection into Montana;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">(2) The burden on the defendant of defending in Montana;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">(3) The extent of conflict with the sovereignty of the defendant\u2019s state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-8\">(4) Montana\u2019s interest in adjudicating the dispute;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">(5) The most efficient resolution of the controversy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-10\">(6) The importance of Montana to the plaintiffs interest in convenient and effective relief; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-11\">(7) The existence of an alternative forum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">\u00b633 Further, we noted that \u201c[t]he above factors are not mandatory tests, each of which the plaintiff must pass in order for the court to assume jurisdiction. Rather, the factors simply illustrate the concepts of fundamental fairness, which must be considered in each jurisdictional analysis.\u201d <em>Simmons, </em>244 Mont. at 88, 796 P.2d at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayz\">\u00b634 After considering these factors, the District Court concluded that the exercise of jurisdiction over Respondents was unreasonable. However, the District Court did not indicate whether it had considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>that, by its determinations that Respondents had purposely availed themselves to the forum and that Quality\u2019s claims arose from the Respondents\u2019 forum-related activities, a presumption in favor of reasonableness had arisen. With that presumption, Respondents bore the burden of demonstrating by compelling reasons that the exercise of jurisdiction would be unreasonable. <em>Simmons, </em>244 Mont. at 85, 796 P.2d at 195.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b635 Turning to the reasonableness factors, Respondents contend that the extent of their purposeful interjection in Montana was minimal, arguing that their \u201csole contact\u201d was to assist Quality with a motor vehicle dealer bond. Again, Respondents ignore the allegations in Quality\u2019s complaint about their failure to procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance, but further, cite no authority to support their contention that the number of transactions is determinative of this issue. In <em>Spectrum Pool Prod., Inc. v. MW Golden, Inc., </em>1998 MT 283. \u00b6 16, 291 Mont. 439, \u00b6 16, 968 P.2d 728, \u00b6 16, we noted that-interjection into Montana, whether to the extent of a single transaction or a number of transactions, is not determinative. The District Court concluded this factor weighed in favor of exercising jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b636  Respondents argue that, under factor two, defending the claim in Montana would burden them. The District Court agreed with Respondents on this point, emphasizing that, with Nasca\u2019s dismissal from the action, no Montana parties remained in the action. However, we disagree. First, the Respondents are located approximately 90 miles from Hamilton, a distance which is hardly excessive, given the problem of an out-of-state party. More importantly, Nasca\u2019s dismissal did not remove the last Montana party from the action. Quality was an ongoing business entity in Montana, hiring employees and engaging in commercial activity here. As such, Quality is a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of determining jurisdictional questions under Rule 4A, M.R.Civ. P., even without having organized as a corporation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">As used in this rule, the word \u201cperson,\u201d whether or not a citizen or resident of this state and <em>whether or not organized under the laws of this state, </em>includes ... a corporation; a limited liability company; a business trust; an estate; a trust; <em>a partnership; an unincorporated association; and any two or more persons having a joint or common interest or any other legal or commercial entity.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQl\">(Emphasis added.) As a \u201cperson\u201d under this Rule, Quality was entitled to consideration as a Montana resident for jurisdictional purposes. This makes practical sense-Quality operated a dealership and hired employees in Montana. It was thus entitled to consideration as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>resident for accessing this state\u2019s courts. Further, for these reasons, as well as the burdens Respondents\u2019 alleged actions have placed on a Montana claimant, a Montana business, and, indirectly, the citizens of this state, by its imposition upon the UEF, Montana has a significant interest in adjudicating this controversy under factor four and the importance of Montana to Quality\u2019s interest in convenient and effective relief, factor six, is also evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b637 Regarding factor three, the extent of conflict with the sovereignty of the defendant\u2019s state, the District Court concluded that this factor favored the exercise of Montana jurisdiction because Montana insurance and workers\u2019 compensation law applied, not Idaho law. We agree. Nonetheless, the District Court concluded that Idaho had the superior interest in adjudicating the matter because the dispute was between Idaho residents. However, for the reasons set forth above, we conclude that Montana had, at a minimum, an equal interest in adjudicating the matter, given Quality\u2019s status.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b638 After reviewing these factors, we conclude that they weigh in favor of exercising jurisdiction over the Respondents, and a compelling case that such exercise is unreasonable has not been demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"ARq\">\u00b639  Respondents purposefully availed themselves to our jurisdiction, Quality\u2019s claims arose from Respondents\u2019 forum-related activity, and the exercise of jurisdiction over Respondents is reasonable and comports with due process. We therefore conclude that the District Court erred in declining to exercise jurisdiction over the Respondents in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">\u00b640 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b509-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, NELSON and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
