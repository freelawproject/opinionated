We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in denying Martin\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea?</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">\u00b64 2. Did Martin receive effective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b333-14\">\u00b65 On February 9, 2003, Martin\u2019s neighbor, Errol Fisher (Fisher), phoned 911 and reported Martin had stabbed a female the previous night and that Martin would not let her leave the apartment to seek medical treatment. When Billings police officers arrived at the apartment building, they located the victim, Carolyn Smith (Smith), in her bedroom. When asked if she had been stabbed, she lifted up her shirt to reveal blood and what appeared to be a wound on her left upper back. Officers found Martin in the hallway of the apartment building. A black folding knife, which appeared to have blood on the blade, was located in Martin\u2019s front right pocket. A small plastic bag of what appeared to be marijuana was also removed from Martin\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-15\">\u00b66 Officers transported Martin to the Yellowstone County Detention Center, where officers collected Martin\u2019s pants and slippers because they appeared to have blood on them. Once read his Miranda rights, Martin stated Smith had been stabbed outside of the residence, he was not present during the incident, and Smith had given him the knife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>when she returned to the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b67 Fisher provided a statement to police on February 9,2003, stating that Martin told him he had stabbed Smith with a pocketknife, that Martin showed him how deep the knife went into Smith\u2019s body, and that Martin asked him not to call for assistance because Martin would go back to prison. Fisher gave a follow up statement to police on May 27, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">\u00b68 On February 12, 2003, Martin was charged with assault with a weapon, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-213(l)(a), and criminal possession of dangerous drugs, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-102(2). On February 13,2003, the State filed a notice of intent to have Martin designated a persistent felony offender, based on a 1996 conviction of partner family member assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">\u00b69 On June 6, 2003, Martin moved to withdraw his plea of not guilty to the felony assault charge and enter a guilty plea. Following appropriate inquiry, the court accepted his plea. Martin accepted a plea agreement which provided he would be sentenced for five years to the Department of Corrections, with two years suspended, and the State would dismiss the persistent felony offender designation. Two days before the original sentencing date, a woman claiming to be Smith went to the Public Defender\u2019s Office and gave a statement that Martin was not the person who committed the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u00b610 On September 15, 2003, Martin filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. On October 8,2003, a hearing on the motion was held. On October 14, 2003, the court issued its order denying Martin\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. On October 22, 2003, Martin was sentenced pursuant to the plea agreement. Martin now appeals from the court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">\u00b611 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw a guilty plea to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Schaff, </em>1998 MT 104, \u00b6 16, 288 Mont. 421, \u00b6 16, 958 P.2d 682, \u00b6 16; <em>State v. Enoch </em>(1994), 269 Mont. 8, 11, 887 P.2d 175, 177. No categorical standard exists as to how a district court must address a request to withdraw a guilty plea; rather, each case must be considered in light of its unique record. <em>Mallak v. State, </em>2002 MT 35, \u00b6 16, 308 Mont. 314, \u00b6 16, 42 P.3d 794, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b334-11\">\u00b612 1. Did the District Court err in denying Martin\u2019s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>withdraw his guilty plea?</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b613  Section 46-16-105, MCA, provides that at any time before or after a judgment, the court may, for good cause shown, permit the plea of guilty to be withdrawn and a plea of not guilty substituted. This Court has established three factors to be considered when determining whether \u201cgood cause\u201d under \u00a7 46-16-105, MCA, exists to permit the withdrawal of a guilty plea: 1) the adequacy of the district court\u2019s interrogation as to the defendant\u2019s understanding of his plea; 2) the promptness of the motion to withdraw the prior plea; and 3) the fact that the defendant\u2019s plea was apparently the result of a plea bargain in which the guilty plea was given in exchange for dismissal of another charge. <em>State v. Graham, </em>2002 MT 237, \u00b6 16, 311 Mont. 500, \u00b6 16, 57 P.3d 54, \u00b6 16 (citing <em>Mallak, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>State v. Knox, </em>2001 MT 232, \u00b6 11, 307 Mont. 1, \u00b6 11, 36 P.3d 383, \u00b6 11; <em>State v. Bowley </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 298, 304, 938 P.2d 592, 595). Consideration of the third factor is intended to prevent the parties to a plea agreement, either a defendant or the State, from escaping the obligations of the plea agreement after accepting its benefits. <em>Schaff, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u00b614 On appeal, Martin does not dispute the first factor-the adequacy of the District Court\u2019s interrogation of him when he changed his plea. The second factor is not in dispute because the timeliness of Martin\u2019s motion is not challenged. Further, promptness of a motion, alone, does not outweigh the other two factors. <em>State v. White, </em>2004 MT 103, \u00b6 18, 321 Mont. 45, \u00b6 18, 88 P.3d 1258, \u00b6 18 (quoting <em>State v. Keys, </em>1999 MT 10, \u00b6 21, 293 Mont. 81, \u00b6 21, 973 P.2d 812, \u00b6 21). Therefore, the only factor argued on appeal is the third. In the District Court proceedings, Martin\u2019s counsel conceded this factor to the State, however, on appeal Martin contends this was not a concession, but merely an acknowledgment the State had a valid-sounding argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u00b615 It has long been the rule in this Court that we will not fault a district court for a ruling in which the appellant acquiesced or participated in. <em>State v. Gardner, </em>2003 MT 338, \u00b6 44, 318 Mont. 436, \u00b6 44, 80 P.3d 1262, \u00b6 44 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Smith </em>(1990), 242 Mont. 495, 501, 791 P.2d 1373, 1377). Acquiescence in error takes away the right of objecting to it. <em>Gardner, </em>\u00b6 44 (citing <em>State v. LaDue, </em>2001 MT 47, \u00b6 23, 304 Mont. 288, \u00b6 23, 20 P.3d 775, \u00b6 23; \u00a7 1-3-207, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">\u00b616 A review of the record reveals Martin\u2019s counsel did, in fact, concede this element to the State in the District Court proceedings. Martin\u2019s acquiescence constitutes a waiver of his right to assert error regarding this factor on appeal. Thus, we decline to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u00b617  Last, Martin states the fundamental purpose in allowing a withdrawal of a plea is to prevent the possibility of convicting an innocent person. <em>Knox, </em>\u00b6 10 (citations omitted); <em>State v. Arledge </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 225, 232, 741 P.2d 781, 785. He claims Smith\u2019s statement to the public defender exonerating Martin was reason enough for the District Court to grant his motion. However, considering Smith did not testify at the hearing, the identity of the woman who made the statement to the public defender was not confirmed as Smith, the birth date she provided was not correct, and Fisher\u2019s statement to police incriminating Martin, we cannot say the District Court abused its discretion when it denied Martin\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">\u00b618 2. Did Martin receive effective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">\u00b619 Since this Court finds Martin is precluded from arguing on appeal the validity of the third \u201cgood cause\u201d factor, Martin alternatively contends that his counsel was ineffective when he conceded the third \u201cgood cause\u201d factor in the District Court proceedings and failed to preserve the issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\u00b620 The State argues Martin\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance cannot be deficient because the issue Martin claims he failed to raise lacks merit. The State contends the plea agreement in this case benefitted Martin and therefore satisfied the third \u201cgood cause\u201d factor. Relying on our recent decision in <em>White, </em>where we stated that a plea agreement between a defendant and the State \u201cis a contract which is subject to contract law standards,\u201d the State argues it was bound by the agreement from the moment it was entered into. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 25 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\u00b621 Martin does not dispute he received a benefit under the plea agreement, but contends at the time of the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, he had not yet received the benefit of the plea agreement because the misdemeanor charge had not been dropped, the persistent felony offender notice had not been withdrawn, and he had not been sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u00b622 Montana has adopted the two-pronged test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2064, in determining whether a defendant received effective assistance of counsel. A defendant must show his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that this deficient performance prejudiced him. <em>State v. Osterloth, </em>2000 MT 129, \u00b6 30, 299 Mont. 517, \u00b6 30, 1 P.3d 946, \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"AWc\">\u00b623 Martin\u2019s argument he had not received the benefit of the plea bargain at the time of the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>withdraw his guilty plea is not persuasive. We have rejected similar arguments before, holding plea agreements are enforceable from the moment they are entered into with both sides receiving the benefit of their bargain from the moment of signing. <em>White, </em>\u00b6 26; <em>Schaff, </em>\u00b6 31. Martin accepted the benefits of the plea bargain immediately upon signing it June 6, 2003. Thus, the State established the third \u201cgood cause\u201d factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b624  Since the third \u201cgood cause\u201d factor weighed in favor of the State, Martin\u2019s counsel did not err when he conceded it to the State in the District Court proceedings. A counsel\u2019s performance cannot be deficient when the issue counsel failed to raise lacks merit. <em>Osterloth, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>State v. Hildreth </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 423, 433, 884 P.2d 771, 777. Martin\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient; therefore, we hold Martin received effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b337-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
