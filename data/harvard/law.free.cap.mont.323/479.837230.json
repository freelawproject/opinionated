We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether counsel was ineffective in failing to file a motion to suppress all the evidence in this case as being the fruit of an illegal search.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether the trial court committed reversible error by allowing the officers to give testimony regarding Timi\u2019s intent to sell illicit drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">\u00b65 On September 27,2002, Officer Baumann of the Great Falls Police Department noticed Garrit Frasure in the passenger seat of a car turning into a restaurant parking lot. Baumann recognized Garrit from previous contacts, and quickly contacted dispatch to check if Garrit had any outstanding warrants. When Baumann discovered that Garrit did have an outstanding warrant, the officer pulled into an alley behind the parking lot and approached him. Baumann noticed that Garrit was very likely under the influence of methamphetamine. He placed him under arrest and asked if he had any drugs on him, to which Garrit gave contradictory responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">\u00b66 After approaching Garrit, Baumann moved to the driv\u00e9r\u2019s side of the automobile where Garrit\u2019s wife, Timi Frasure, sat. Baumann soon discovered that Timi also had an outstanding arrest warrant. He also noticed she was reticent in opening her purse in front of him. Therefore, he arrested Timi as well and transported them to the detention center. He asked them if the police could search the vehicle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>but the couple refused to give permission. Thereupon the police impounded the vehicle and obtained a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">\u00b67 The search revealed that a purse in the vehicle containing Timi\u2019s driver\u2019s license and other personal materials belonging to her also contained a Tylenol bottle with three baggies of methamphetamine inside it, another baggie containing marijuana, and two playing cards of the type often used in cutting drugs. The search also found a fanny pack attributed to Garrit containing three baggies of methamphetamine, five baggies of marijuana, and other items related to the production and sale of illicit drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b68 Both spouses were tried for possession of dangerous drugs with intent to sell. Garrit was tried by a jury and convicted. Timi waived her right to a jury and received a bench trial. Her attorney did not object to the admission of the above evidence. During her trial, Officer Baumann and Officer Brinkman (who assisted with the vehicle search) both testified. In their testimony they stated that based on their experience the amount of methamphetamine Timi was carrying illustrated she had an intent to sell. Timi\u2019s attorney objected to these comments. Garrit testified on behalf of Timi and stated that he placed the drugs in her purse when she was not looking once he saw Baumann approaching their vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u00b69 The court found Timi guilty, and she now appeals, claiming that she received ineffective assistance of counsel because her trial counsel did not object to the introduction of evidence, and that the officers\u2019 testimony was expert opinion for which the prosecution did not lay an adequate foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\u00b610 <em>Whether counsel was ineffective in failing to file a motion to suppress all the evidence in this case as being the fruit of an illegal search.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">\u00b611 The right to effective assistance of counsel is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and by Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution. We have adopted the two-part test of <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, in determining ineffective assistance of counsel claims. <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 6, \u00b6 11, 97 P.3d 1095, \u00b6 11. First, the defendant must demonstrate that her counsel\u2019s actions fell below an objective level of reasonableness or were defective, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>second, establish that there is a reasonable probability the result of the proceeding would have been different if counsel had not performed ineffectively. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 11. The first prong carries a strong presumption to defer to counsel\u2019s actions when they are made for tactical reasons. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b612 We need only address the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. As we have.stated in the past, we will only determine that there was ineffective assistance of counsel if such a conclusion can be based upon the record on appeal or if there is no plausible justification for counsel\u2019s actions or inactions. <em>See State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, \u00b6 50, 315 Mont. 146, \u00b6 50, 69 P.3d 641, \u00b6 50. Furthermore, counsel are not expected to make motions that theoretically might help their clients if the motions lack merit. <em>State v. Hildreth </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 423, 432-33, 884 P.2d 771, 777. Timi does not proffer any argument as to how the authorities\u2019 acquisition of incriminating evidence was defective.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since Timi seeks to establish that her counsel was ineffective for not filing a motion to suppress the evidence, she must also establish that there was arguably some merit to such a motion. She has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b613  Since Timi has not established that her ineffective assistance of counsel claim is record based, we dismiss the claim without prejudice to the filing of a petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">\u00b614 <em>Whether the trial court committed reversible error by allowing the officers to give testimony regarding Timi\u2019s intent to sell illicit drugs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">\u00b615 When reviewing a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling we ask whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Christofferson v. City of Great Falls, </em>2003 MT 189, \u00b6 8, 316 Mont. 469, \u00b6 8, 74 P.3d 1021, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b494-12\">\u00b616 Timi argues that Officers Baumann and Brinkman were allowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>to give expert testimony without the prosecution first laying a foundation establishing their qualifications as experts, as required by Rule 702, M.R.Evid. This testimony, Timi contends, was central to the State\u2019s case that she had intent to sell the drugs found in her purse. The State responds that the testimony was actually lay opinion governed by Rule 701, M.R.Evid., and was therefore admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">\u00b617  Lay opinion testimony is admissible if \u201cthe witness\u2019 testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d Rule 701, M.R.Evid. In applying Rule 701 we have held that police officers may testify to \u201cmatters as to which they have extensive experience and are properly qualified through training and experience.\u201d <em>Onstad v. Payless Shoesources, </em>2000 MT 230, \u00b6 40, 301 Mont. 259, \u00b6 40, 9 P.3d 38, \u00b6 40 (citing <em>Hislop v. Cady </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 243, 249, 862 P.2d 388, 392).</p>\n<p id=\"Af9\">\u00b618  In this case, the prosecution established that Officers Baumann and Brinkman had extensive training and experience in the methods used in the illicit drug trade and the prices that illicit drugs, such as methamphetamine, generally garner. This provided a sufficient foundation for them to provide lay opinion testimony as to whether it was likely that Timi possessed the drugs with intent to sell. Their testimony was rationally based on their perceptions and helped give a clear understanding of whether Timi had the necessary intent. Therefore, the requirements of Rule 701 were met, and the District Court was within its discretion in overruling Timi\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">\u00b619 For the forgoing reasons the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b495-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-13\"> Timi asks that we look to the arguments put forward in her husband\u2019s case, which involved the same search, but the cases have not been consolidated. Furthermore, her own brief contains absolutely no argument regarding the legality of the search.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
