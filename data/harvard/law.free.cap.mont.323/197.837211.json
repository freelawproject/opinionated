We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">\u00b62 On or about July 14, 1994, Clyde Park retained MOR to defend against a claim by Patty Pinkerton, n/k/a Patty Russell (Ms. Russell). Ms. Russell objected to the town\u2019s water rights claims filed with the Water Court in April 1982. Ms. Younkin represented Clyde Park on behalf of MOR. In accordance with Ms. Younkin\u2019s recommendations, Clyde Park entered into a final settlement agreement with Ms. Russell in January 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-12\">\u00b63 The issues regarding the parties\u2019 respective water rights continued, with Ms. Russell complaining to the Clyde Park town council that she was not receiving her water and that the town was misappropriating the water. In order to determine how much water Clyde Park was allowed to use within certain time periods, Jon M. Hesse (Mr. Hesse), in his official capacity as Clyde Park\u2019s attorney and at the behest of Clyde Park, contacted Ms. Younkin and requested a copy of MOR\u2019s file so he could \u201cunderstand historically what had been done with respect to the Town water rights.\u201d MOR provided the requested file to Mr. Hesse on June 3, 1998. Based upon Mr. Hesse\u2019s investigation into how much water it could use, on August 8, 1998, Clyde Park entered into an agreement to lease Ms. Russell\u2019s water.</p>\n<p id=\"AdT\">\u00b64 On April 30, 1999, Ms. Russell commenced a lawsuit against Clyde Park claiming it had wrongfully appropriated her water for an approximate ten year time period. When Clyde Park\u2019s insurance carrier investigated that claim, it determined there were several arguments in Clyde Park\u2019s favor, one being that the water rights may have been previously abandoned by Ms. Russell.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">\u00b65 Over the following year, negotiations between Clyde Park and Ms. Russell continued. Clyde Park considered either entering into another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>agreement with Ms. Russell or drilling additional wells. When negotiations failed, Clyde Park decided to drill wells and hired an engineering firm to design a new water system. In order to qualify for grants and loans to build the new system, as well as to better ascertain whether it was violating its agreement with Ms. Russell, Clyde Park had to determine whether its water rights were sound. In order to do so, Clyde Park retained Leanne Schraudner (Ms. Schraudner), a water rights expert, to conduct a review of its water rights and make recommendations about whether to drill additional wells. Mr. Hesse forwarded the MOR file to Ms. Schraudner.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b66 On June 2,2000, Mr. Hesse received a letter from Ms. Schraudner that, if accurate, outlined possible legal theories Clyde Park could have asserted in earlier stages. Ms. Schraudner\u2019s report alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Clyde Park had enjoyed priority over Ms. Russell\u2019s claims and could have acquired all of the rights it subsequently stipulated away during the earlier settlement agreement. The report was based upon Ms. Schraudner\u2019s \u201creview of the historical documentation and file presented to [her] ... some limited discussion with counsel [sic] members and the file provided to [her] by [Mr. Hesse], which [he] represented to be the Moore Law Firm file regarding the City of Clyde Park water rights ... [and] a review of the 1951 Water Resource Survey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b67 On May, 30, 2003, Clyde Park initiated a malpractice action against MOR and Ms. Younkin asserting that, by agreeing to settle with Ms. Russell, it had unknowingly waived its claim to a larger water right and that, had Ms. Younkin properly advised the town of its priorities, its rights under adverse possession, and its claim of abandonment against Ms. Russell, it would have prevailed in any water rights litigation against Ms. Russell. On June 11, 2003, Clyde Park filed an amended complaint commencing its action against Ms. Younkin. On July 23, 2003, MOR moved for summary judgment against Clyde Park on the ground that Clyde Park\u2019s complaint was barred by the three-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA. The parties waived oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">\u00b68 On August 21,2003, the District Court granted MOR\u2019s motion for summary judgment, ruling that Clyde Park had actual or constructive knowledge of the facts underlying Ms. Younkin\u2019s alleged malpractice on June 3,1998, when Mr. Hesse received the MOR file. Accordingly, the District Court concluded that the statute of limitations expired three years later, on June 4, 2001. Clyde Park appeals from the District Court\u2019s ruling and asserts instead that it first discovered all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>of the facts when it received Ms. Schraudner\u2019s opinion, which tolled the statute of limitations until June 2, 2000. The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment based upon the application of the three-year statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b69 We review a District Court\u2019s summary judgment ruling <em>de novo. Cape-France Enterprises v. Estate of Peed, </em>2001 MT 139, \u00b6 13, 305 Mont. 513, \u00b6 13, 29 P.3d 1011, \u00b6 13. We apply the same criteria applied by the District Court under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., <em>Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 372, 376, 945 P.2d 32, 34. The movant must demonstrate both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>MacKay v. State of Montana, </em>2003 MT 274, \u00b6 14, 317 Mont. 467, \u00b6 14, 79 P.3d 236, \u00b6 14. Any factual inferences which can be drawn must be resolved in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Morton v. M-W-M, Inc. </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 245, 249, 868 P.2d 576, 579. If no genuine factual issues exist, this Court then reviews the district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>MacKay, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u00b610 The statute of limitations applicable to legal malpractice actions, \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnY\">An action against an attorney licensed to practice law in Montana ... based upon the person\u2019s alleged professional negligent act or for error or omission in the person\u2019s practice must be commenced within 3 years after the plaintiff discovers <em>or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered </em>the act, error, or omission, whichever occurs last.... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">\u00b611  When a statute of limitations issue involving a legal malpractice claim relates to actual discovery, the test is knowledge of the facts essential to the malpractice claim, rather than discovery of legal theories. <em>Johnson v. Barrett, </em>1999 MT 176, \u00b6 11, 295 Mont. 254, \u00b6 11, 983 P.2d 925, \u00b6 11. When the statute of limitations issue involves the time at which the plaintiff, through the use of reasonable diligence, should have discovered the facts, the test is whether the plaintiff has information of circumstances sufficient to put a reasonable person on inquiry, or has the opportunity to obtain knowledge from sources open to his or her investigation. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">\u00b612 The critical question in this matter is when Clyde Park obtained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>knowledge of the essential facts necessary to put it on inquiry of possible problems with Ms. Younkin\u2019s representation, not when it obtained knowledge of its legal theories. <em>See Johnson, </em>\u00b6 11. Clyde Park contends that it did not discover the facts concerning its missed legal theories of adverse possession and abandonment until it received Ms. Schraudner\u2019s opinion on June 2, 2000. The District Court disagreed and determined that Clyde Park had information sufficient to provide knowledge of the facts necessary for a malpractice claim when Mr. Hesse received the MOR file on June 3, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b613 Clyde Park requested the MOR file after being informed by Ms. Russell that there were possible legal issues that were not resolved at the time of the settlement. Upon receipt of the file, Mr. Hesse, as the city\u2019s attorney, was placed on inquiry, and had available to him sources from which he could have investigated the problem further. In fact, the same file and available information resulted in Ms. Schraudner\u2019s report which Clyde Park maintains started the statute of limitations. The MOR file, some limited discussions with council members, and a review of a water resource survey was enough for Ms. Schraudner to rely upon, and through reasonable diligence, provide an opinion to Clyde Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b614 Clyde Park also contends that Mr. Hesse\u2019s representation in this matter was narrow in that he obtained the MOR file only to review two documents contained therein, in order to ascertain whether Clyde Park was indeed violating their settlement agreement with Ms. Russell. Thus, the remainder of the contents of the MOR file fell outside of the scope of Mr. Hesse\u2019s representation, so the file could not provide Clyde Park with the knowledge necessary for its malpractice claim. Clyde Park further asserts that because Mr. Hesse is not a water law attorney and the MOR file did not mention abandonment or adverse possession, it could not have discovered the legal theories it relies upon in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u00b615  However, the statute of limitations issue does not relate to the discovery of legal theories. <em>See Johnson, </em>\u00b6 11. Clyde Park had knowledge of the facts essential to its malpractice claim when Mr. Hesse requested the MOR file. He requested the file in response to Ms. Russell\u2019s objections and in order to familiarize himself with the history of Clyde Park\u2019s water rights so he could evaluate and negotiate a lease on behalf of the town. To claim he did not look, or did not have the expertise to know what to look for, does not toll the legal malpractice statute of limitations. The issue does not turn on Mr. Hesse\u2019s expertise in various legal matters. For the purposes of tolling the statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>limitations, it only matters that Clyde Park had all of the necessary information on June 3, 1998, when it had in its hands the MOR file which put it on notice of a possible malpractice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b616  As with any decision affirming a statute of limitations bar, we do not reach the merits of Clyde Park\u2019s allegation of malpractice. Clyde Park\u2019s action is barred by the statute of limitations as \u00a7 27-2-206, MCA, plainly requires that a malpractice action be commenced within three years after the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the negligent act, error, or omission. Consequently, Clyde Park was required to commence its alleged legal malpractice claim against MOR and Ms. Younkin by June 4, 2001. It missed that date by approximately two years. The District Court was correct in its determination that no genuine issues of material fact exist and its interpretation that MOR and Ms. Younkin are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b617 The District Court\u2019s Order is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b215-6\">JUSTICES COTTER.
