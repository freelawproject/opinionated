We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err by allowing the Guardian ad Litem (Guardian) to submit recommendations which exceeded her authority as initially established by the District Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err by not allowing testimony and cross examination of the Guardian at the August 20, 2002, hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in modifying the stipulated final parenting plan?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-14\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">\u00b66 A decree dissolving the marriage of LaRue and Arne was entered May 14, 2001. It incorporated a stipulated parenting plan for the parties\u2019 two children. Under this plan, both parties were to relocate from Missoula to North Carolina. The parties were to equally share parenting of the children by following an alternating week schedule. Numerous proceedings followed over the next year and a half. Those proceedings will be mentioned here to the extent relevant to the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-16\">\u00b67 In May and July, 2001, Arne made motions to the court to hold LaRue in contempt, alleging she interfered with his time with the children. After a July, 2001, hearing on Arne\u2019s contempt motions, the court <em>sua sponte </em>appointed a guardian ad litem.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-17\">\u00b68 On September 10, 2001, the Guardian submitted a report to the court which recommended that Arne be the primary residential parent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>of the children at the location of his choice and that the parties no longer equally share parenting time with the children. Eight days later, Ame filed a notice of his intent to move to Utah and a proposed revised parenting plan. LaRue then filed objections to the Guardian\u2019s report and to Arne\u2019s notice of intent to move and proposed new parenting plan. In addition, she also requested the court appoint a child psychologist to perform an investigation and assessment instead of the Guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b69 The court held hearings on October 29,30 and November 8,2001. The court then orally vacated the stipulated parenting plan, named Arne as the primary caregiver, and allowed him to relocate. Arne then moved to Utah with the children. The court also required the Guardian to submit a status report during the Christmas holidays, 2001. The Guardian submitted two more reports. LaRue then entered a subpeona duces tecum for the Guardian. She also made a motion to enforce the original stipulated plan. At a hearing on February 5, 2002, the court orally denied LaRue\u2019s motion to enforce the stipulated plan. However, the court allowed LaRue to depose the Guardian which she did at length in March. The Guardian submitted her final report to the court and the parties in early August, 2002. On August 20, 2002, the court held a final hearing. In October of 2002, the court issued findings of fact, conclusions of law and an order which made Arne the primary caregiver. LaRue now appeals. Further facts are discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b610 The standard of review for a district court\u2019s findings related to modification of a parenting plan is whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Oehlke, </em>2002 MT 79, \u00b6 9, 309 Mont. 254, \u00b6 9, 46 P.3d 49, \u00b6 9. When findings are not clearly erroneous, we reverse when an abuse of discretion by the district court is clearly demonstrated. <em>Oehlke, </em>\u00b6 9. Abuse of discretion occurs only when the district court acted arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>In re Marriage of Robison, </em>2002 MT 207, \u00b6 15, 311 Mont. 246, \u00b6 15, 53 P.3d 1279, \u00b6 15. We review questions of law tie <em>novo. Robison, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AbH\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err by allowing the Guardian to submit recommendations which exceeded her authority as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>initially established by the District Court?</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b612 LaRue argues the Guardian was appointed under \u00a7 40-4-205, MCA, rather than \u00a7 40-4-215, MCA, so the Guardian was not given the authority to conduct an investigation and assessment. She therefore argues the Guardian did not have authority to recommend a change in the stipulated final parenting plan. She asserts the Guardian was not appointed to be an attorney for the children and was not professionally qualified to perform a parenting investigation or assessment as she has no professional training in child development. LaRue also asserts the Guardian did not find someone to act as a guardian ad litem in North Carolina as directed by the court. Asserting the Guardian exceeded her authority by providing a self-initiated investigation, LaRue argues the District Court erred in relying on her recommendations for its decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b613 Arne counters that the District Court granted broad authority to the Guardian. He argues the Guardian\u2019s actions in conducting an investigation, parenting assessment, and the recommendations she submitted to modify the stipulated final parenting plan were within her authority. The Guardian, who submitted a brief on appeal, generally agrees with Arne.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\u00b614  We hold the District Court did not err in allowing the Guardian to submit her recommendations because the Guardian did not exceed the authority she was granted by the court. The Guardian was appointed at the hearing on the contempt motions. In light of the evidence of the disruptive communications between the parties, the District Court on its own initiative appointed a guardian ad litem \u201cto make sure that the rights of the child (sic) are protected.\u201d When Arne\u2019s attorney pointed out the parties intended to move to North Carolina, the court stated: \u201cWell, if there are problems here in Montana, there is going to'be a guardian ad litem in Montana, and there will probably be one in North Carolina. We will start where there are problems. There\u2019re (sic) problems here; a guardian ad litem here.\u201d These statements indicate the court intended the Guardian to address current parenting problems in order to protect the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\u00b615 The court then issued a four page order appointing the Guardian. The order appears to use a standardized form for such appointments, modified to include two additional paragraphs emphasized in bold at the beginning to address the move to North Carolina. Under the standardized language regarding the Guardian\u2019s duties, the form reads: \u201cThe Guardian Ad Litem, in addition to attendance at all proceedings, shall meet with the parties, their counsel, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>child(ren); may contact psychologist/counselors, family members, friends, neighbors, or school personnel, and shall conduct such other investigation as would assist the court in its determination of the best interests of the child(ren).\u201d This language, in addition to other standardized language in the order, indicates that the court intended to give the Guardian broad authority to address the best interests of the children in any way she deemed necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b616  Although the order does not cite either \u00a7 40-4-205, MCA, or \u00a7 40-4-215, MCA, it clearly indicates the court intended the Guardian to fulfill both the general statutory duties of a guardian ad litem and to carry out its requests regarding the move to North Carolina. Further, both \u00a7 40-4-205, MCA, and \u00a7 40-4-215, MCA, give a guardian authority to conduct an investigation. Under \u00a7 40-4-205(1) and (2)(a), MCA, a guardian may \u201cconduct investigations\u201d regarding the \u201cchild\u2019s support, parenting, and parental contact\u201d that the guardian \u201cconsiders necessary.\u201d Under \u00a7 40-4-215, MCA, a guardian may conduct an investigation into \u201cparenting arrangements\u201d if someone other than the guardian, including the court, considers it necessary. Therefore, there was no need for the court to order a specific type of investigation under \u00a7 40-4-215, MCA, because the guardian already had authority under \u00a7 40-4-205(1) and (2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b617  In this case, the Guardian investigated and concluded that the discord was so great between the parties that a 50/50 co-parenting arrangement would not be in the best interests of the children and also that Arne would be able to provide a more predictable, stable routine for the children. Our review of the record indicates that the findings regarding the discord between the parties and regarding the relative stability of Arne\u2019s and LaRue\u2019s lifestyles, as adopted by the District Court, are not clearly erroneous. Therefore, the Guardian did not exceed her authority when she recommended that the stipulated parenting plan not be followed because her investigation revealed that the stipulation was not in the best interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b618 The District Court did not err in accepting the Guardian\u2019s report even though she was not an expert in a child development field. We have held there is no general requirement a guardian ad litem be an expert. <em>In re Custody of Krause, </em>2001 MT 37, \u00b6\u00b6 11-14, 304 Mont. 202, \u00b6\u00b6 11-14, 19 P.3d 811, \u00b6\u00b6 11-14. The only mandatory requirement in all cases is that a guardian not have a conflict of interest with the best interests of the children. <em>Krause, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-14. LaRue does not claim the Guardian has interests adverse to the children. Therefore, it was not err for the court to deny LaRue\u2019s request for another investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b619 Did the District Court err by not allowing testimony and cross examination of the Guardian at the August 20, 2002, hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b620 At the final hearing, the District Court raised the issue of whether there was an ethical conflict for an attorney serving as a guardian ad litem to testify and be subject to cross examination because attorneys are not normally allowed to testify under the Rides of Professional Conduct. The court stated it was raising the issue because it had come up in another case the previous week and the court wanted to avoid error in this case. The court sought input from both counsel and from the Guardian. Both counsel favored testimony based on past experience and the rights of the parties. The Guardian thought the answer depended on whether a guardian was serving more as an attorney or as an investigator for the court regarding the best interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b621 The court then decided that the Guardian would not testify or be subject to cross examination at that hearing in order to err on the side of caution. The court allowed the parties to submit briefing on the issue and allowed LaRue to submit objections to the Guardian\u2019s final report as an alternative to cross examination. LaRue and the Guardian submitted briefs. Arne did not. The District Court did not again address this issue after receiving the briefing and did not make findings or conclusions on the positions stated by LaRue and the Guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\u00b622 LaRue argues on appeal that the District Court erred by failing to allow the Guardian to testify and be subject to cross examination. She asserts that under \u00a7 40-4-205(2)(d), MCA, a guardian is to appear and participate in all proceedings. She also points out that under \u00a7 40-4-215, MCA, an investigator is subject' to being called to testify and subject to cross examination. LaRue argues there is no exception for the instance where the guardian happens to be an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">\u00b623 Based on <em>Krause, </em>\u00b6 19, LaRue asserts she has a constitutional liberty interest in the custody of her children and that it is a denial of due process to simultaneously give a guardian authority to investigate and report to the court and then prevent their testimony based \u00f3n Rule 3.7, M.R.Prof.Cond. She argues cross examination is also necessary to ensure the best interests of the children are protected. She cites <em>In re Marriage of Rolfe </em>(1985), 216 Mont. 39, 699 P.2d 79, and In <em>re Custody of J.M.D. </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 468, 857 P.2d 708, for the proposition that an attorney and guardian ad litem cannot have the same role. LaRue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>also notes the Rules of Professional Conduct are not to be used for one party to gain a tactical advantage. <em>Schuff v. A.T. Klemens &amp; Son, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 61, 303 Mont. 274, \u00b6 61, 16 P.3d 1002, \u00b6 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b624 Procedurally, LaRue points out the Guardian in this case was allowed to act as both an attorney and a witness during previous court hearings. LaRue also notes the Guardian\u2019s reports and recommendations were submitted into evidence. LaRue argues that even though she was allowed to cross examine the Guardian at a previous hearing, the Guardian had since submitted additional reports with new information that LaRue had not had an opportunity to address. She argues she was also not allowed to question why the Guardian chose not to include information she believed was pertinent. Finally, she notes the Guardian was again allowed to call and examine witnesses at the August 20, 2002, hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u00b625 Arne asserts the court appointed the Guardian under \u00a7 40-4-205, MCA, and therefore, the cross examination provisions of \u00a7 40-4-215, MCA, do not apply. He also argues that because LaRue deposed the Guardian and, because she was allowed to examine or cross examine the Guardian at previous hearings, any error is harmless. Further, Arne points out that at the August 20 hearing, LaRue admitted she did not believe the Guardian had withheld any information. Finally, Arne argues because LaRue was able to obtain all the background documentation from the Guardian during her deposition and was also able to examine or depose all the people the Guardian interviewed, the guardian ad litem disclosure requirements of <em>Krause, </em>\u00b6 28, have been met. He asserts LaRue was not prejudiced by her inability to examine the Guardian one more time.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b626 The Guardian points out there are currently no standards or guidelines for guardians ad litem in Montana. She notes there are model guidelines available and that most states have held guardians ad litem are to protect what they believe to be the best interest of the child even if the child client disagrees. Further, the Guardian generally agrees with Arne in that even if she should have been available for cross examination, it was harmless error because LaRue had numerous opportunities to question her, including an extensive deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\u00b627 Arne and the Guardian also argue LaRue did not preserve the due process argument for appeal. However, LaRue\u2019s brief to the District Court does preserve this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">\u00b628  The District Court erred in disallowing the testimony and cross examination of the Guardian at the final hearing. However, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>hold this error does not require reversal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b629 The relevant portions of \u00a7 40-4-205, MCA, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">(1) The court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of a minor dependent child with respect to the child\u2019s support, parenting, and parental contact. The guardian ad litem may be an attorney....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">(2) The guardian ad litem has the following general duties:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">(a) to conduct investigations that the guardian ad litem considers necessary to ascertain the facts related to the child\u2019s support, parenting, and parental contact;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">(b) to interview or observe the child who is the subject of the proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">(c) to make written reports to the court concerning the child\u2019s support, parenting, and parental contact;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">(d) to appear and participate in all proceedings to the degree necessary to adequately represent the child and make recommendations to the court concerning the child\u2019s support, parenting, and parental contact; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-11\">(e) to perform other duties as directed by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-12\">(3) The guardian ad litem has access to court, medical, psychological, law enforcement, social services, and school records pertaining to the child and the child\u2019s siblings and parents or caretakers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">This language was significantly amended in 1995 when \u201cguardian ad litem\u201d was inserted for \u201cattorney,\u201d the provision that \u201cthe guardian ad litem may be an attorney\u201d was added, and subsections (2) and (3) regarding the duties and access of guardians ad litem were added. However, the Commissioners\u2019 Note to \u00a7 40-4-205, MCA, indicates the section may still be used to specifically appoint an attorney to provide legal representation. The note says: \u201cThis section authorizes the court to appoint an attorney to represent a minor or dependent child ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AfU\">\u00b630 In contrast, \u00a7 40-4-215, MCA, provides that a guardian ad litem may perform investigations. Subsection (4) states: \u201cAny party to the proceeding may call the investigator and any person the investigator has consulted for cross-examination. A party may not waive the right of cross-examination prior to the hearing.\u201d Therefore, the provisions of \u00a7 40-4-205, MCA, and \u00a7 40-4-215, MCA, set up the conflict recognized by the judge in this case, in that an attorney may be appointed as guardian ad litem and then be required to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-14\">\u00b631 As the parties point out, we have not previously addressed this issue. However, we have held that an attorney appointed by the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>to represent a child is not also the guardian ad litem. <em>Rolfe, </em>216 Mont. at 52, 699 P.2d at 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b632 In addition, \u00a7 40-4-205, MCA, states the guardian ad litem \u201cmay\u201d be an attorney. This indicates lay persons may act as guardians. Therefore, the statute contemplates a guardian ad litem has a unique role to protect the interests of the child. This role is different from the traditional advocacy role played by attorneys. We hold that when a court appoints a guardian ad litem under \u00a7 40-4-205, MCA, unless the court specifically indicates it intends the guardian to act as an attorney representing the child, the guardian is not to act as an attorney. Instead, the guardian is required to fulfill the statutory role to objectively aid the court in its decisions regarding the best interests of the child. Section 40-4-215, MCA, applies to \u00a7 40-4-205, MCA, in that a guardian ad litem must testify and be subject to cross examination if they give evidence concerning an investigation. Consequently, the District Court erred in failing to require the Guardian to testify in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">\u00b633 In spite of this error, no reversal is required here. Rule 61, M.R.Civ.P., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\">No error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in anything done or omitted by the court or by any of the parties is ground for granting a new trial or for setting aside a verdict or for vacating, modifying or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice. The court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">We have held under Rule 61, \u201cfor error to be the basis for a new trial, it must be so significant as to materially affect the substantial rights of the complaining party.\u201d <em>Montana Dept. of Transp. v. Simonson, </em>2004 MT 60, \u00b6 14, 320 Mont. 249, \u00b6 14, 87 P.3d 416, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">\u00b634 As LaRue points out, the right to parent her children is a significant interest. <em>Krause, </em>\u00b6 19. In addressing testimony involving disputed custody issues, we have held that allowing one parent to testify by telephone was reversible error where the other parent objected because the objecting parent was entitled to a meaningful opportunity to confront the witness and cross-examine effectively so the judge could make credibility determinations. <em>Bonamarte v. Bonamarte </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 170, 178, 866 P.2d 1132, 1137. In addition, <em>In re Moyer </em>(1977), 173 Mont. 208, 211, 567 P.2d 47, 49, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>stated: \u201cIt is true that a judge violates due process requirements if he bases his child custody order on statements in a welfare department report without requiring the authors of the report to testify at a hearing and be subject to cross-examination.\u201d These cases establish that parents be given a meaningful opportunity to examine witnesses in custody cases so the trier of fact can assess factual disputes and weigh credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b635 In this case, however, the court\u2019s error was not so significant as to materially prejudice LaRue. She was given numerous and meaningful opportunities to examine the Guardian during the year and a half long proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b636 First, although the Guardian submitted five reports, the first and by far the longest report is the most significant because it contains the Guardian\u2019s recommendation that Arne be the primary residential parent. As noted above, this first report makes the recommendation to change custody from joint parenting to one parent acting as the primary caretaker. To challenge this recommendation, LaRue cross examined the Guardian at the hearing during which this report was first considered by the court. During this hearing, LaRue was able to both question factual information presented in the report and was able to challenge the Guardian\u2019s credibility. At the conclusion of this three day hearing, the court decided to vacate the joint parenting agreement and decided that Arne would be the primary caregiver. Therefore, LaRue was able to cross examine the Guardian with relation to the facts, her opinions, and her credibility before the court made its key decision in this case. Further, the Guardian\u2019s subsequent four reports, including the final report, mainly indicate to the court the Guardian did not find any information that would change her recommendations, despite further investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b637 Second, as is provided for by \u00a7 40-4-215(4), MCA, LaRue had the opportunity to call as witnesses the people who the Guardian interviewed in making her recommendations. Many of these people did testify and LaRue was able to challenge how the Guardian\u2019s report represented their perspectives. Without exception, every person who was interviewed by the Guardian who also testified stated the Guardian\u2019s report properly presented their input. Therefore, LaRue was able to challenge in court both the Guardian\u2019s credibility in reporting to the court and the facts in the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u00b638 Third, LaRue deposed the Guardian at length. This deposition was entered into evidence at the final hearing. Therefore, LaRue was able to challenge the Guardian\u2019s credibility through this deposition in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>addition to her examinations of the Guardian at previous hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"Apq\">\u00b639  Finally, although LaRue asserts the Guardian was bias because she did not contact all the people LaRue wanted her to, the Guardian did interview numerous people referred by LaRue. LaRue also had the ability to call any witnesses she desired. The record makes clear that LaRue was given ample and meaningful opportunity to present her disagreements with the facts in the Guardian\u2019s report. She was also given ample and meaningful opportunity to question the Guardian\u2019s factual assertions and credibility. Under the unique facts of this case, we hold the District Court\u2019s error in this case does not require reversal because LaRue\u2019s rights were not materially prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b640 Did the District Court err in modifying the stipulated final parenting plan?</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b641 LaRue argues the District Court did not meet the prerequisites to modify the stipulated final parenting plan under \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, because it did not find there was a change in circumstances and because it failed to properly assess the best interests of the children. She argues that a change in circumstances that justifies a modification must significantly affect the child, and a voluntary choice to relocate by an adult will not suffice. LaRue also asserts the court did not properly assess the best interests of the children when it relied on the Guardian\u2019s recommendations. LaRue also points out facts that favor her being the residential parent in favor of her position. Conversely, Arne argues from facts relied on by the court. The Guardian generally agrees with Arne on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">\u00b642 We hold the District Court properly modified the parenting plan. Section 40-4-219, MCA, governs when a court may amend a parenting plan. This section reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-8\">(1) The court may in its discretion amend a prior parenting plan if it finds, upon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior plan or that were unknown to the court at the time of entry of the prior plan, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child and that the amendment is necessary to serve the best interest of the child. In determining the child\u2019s best interest under this section, the court may, in addition to the criteria in 40-4-212, also consider whether:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-9\">(d) one parent has willfully and consistently:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>(i) refused to allow the child to have any contact with the other parent; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-4\">(ii) attempted to frustrate or deny contact with the child by the other parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-5\">(3) The court shall presume a parent is not acting in the child\u2019s best interest if the parent does any of the acts specified in subsection (l)(d) or (8).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b643 We have held that although it is preferable for a district court to incorporate the statutory \u201cchange [of] circumstances\u201d and \u201cbest interest\u201d language into its findings and conclusions, it is not error when a court fails to do so if all the requirements of the statute are implicit in the court\u2019s findings. <em>In re Custody of Arneson-Nelson, </em>2001 MT 242, \u00b6 30, 307 Mont. 60, \u00b6 30, 36 P.3d 874, \u00b6 30; <em>In re Marriage of Burk, </em>2002 MT 173, \u00b6 11, 310 Mont. 498, \u00b6 11, 51 P.3d 1149, \u00b6 11; Rule 61, M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\u00b644 In this case, the court did not use the change of circumstances language. However, the court stated: \u201cI\u2019m denying the motion to implement the stipulated parenting plan. I believe it\u2019s impossible to perform as drafted and agreed upon by the parties and that\u2019s not due to their lack of effort.... It\u2019s due to their highly complicated method of communication that can\u2019t yield meaningful agreement without the involvement of a sophisticated mediator.\u201d In a later order, the court found that \u201c[t]he level of conflict between the parties had increased to the level that they were only able to resolve issues concerning visitation through ... mediation ....\u201d Implicit in these findings is the reality that substantial change occurred in the circumstances and this change significantly affected the children because the parties were unable to follow the stipulated plans. Therefore, the change in circumstances requirement of \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA, was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\u00b645 Regarding the best interests of the children, the District Court found that \u201cLaRue was continually frustrating Arne\u2019s scheduled parenting time\u201d and that although the parties worked with a third party \u201ctoward a parenting schedule ... LaRue also refused to comply with the agreements made ....\u201d Again, while the court did not use the statutory language, implicit in these findings is the court\u2019s conclusion that LaRue\u2019s conduct was not in the best interests of the children under \u00a7 40-4-219(3), MCA, and \u00a7 40-4-219(l)(d)(ii), MCA, because she frustrated Arne\u2019s contact with the children. Therefore, amendment of the parenting plan was in the children\u2019s best interests under \u00a7 40-4-219, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>\u00b646  Finally, we disagree with LaRue that the court erred by relying on the Guardian\u2019s recommendations because her report was allegedly not in the children\u2019s best interests. Specifically, the Guardian noted both parties would have to work and both parties would need to hire child care. Therefore, this factor was not held against LaRue. Further, the Guardian\u2019s recommendation was not primarily based on where the parties would live, North Carolina or Utah. Rather, she recommended, and the court agreed, that wherever the parties lived, co-parenting was not an option due to the discord between them. She then recommended, and the court agreed, that Arne would be able to provide more stability and predictability for the children. As noted above, the underlying findings upon which these conclusions are based are not clearly erroneous. Therefore, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in modifying the parenting plan because a change of circumstances occurred such that amendment was necessary to serve the best interests of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b647 Because the District Court properly considered the Guardian\u2019s investigation and recommendations and issued an order in the best interests of the children, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b208-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
