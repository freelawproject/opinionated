We affirm in part and reverse in part and remand to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\u00b62 We rephrase the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in ordering Eaton to pay restitution as part of his suspended sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in ordering Eaton to pay restitution from his \u201cnet income,\u201d which includes his social security benefits?</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b300-13\">\u00b65 On September 4, 1997, Eaton was appointed by District Court Judge Thomas Olson to act as a receiver in a lawsuit involving the Sunset Memorial Gardens of Bozeman (the Cemetery). As such, Eaton was charged with the fiduciary responsibility to act in the Cemetery\u2019s best interest. However, the District Court began to have suspicions regarding Eaton\u2019s actions as receiver in June 2001. On June 26, 2001, James Harris (Harris), Secretary for the Cemetery\u2019s Owners Committee, wrote a letter to the District Court complaining that Eaton refused to disclose information regarding the Cemetery\u2019s financial situation. Harris also expressed concerns that the Cemetery\u2019s bank had failed to pay checks written on the Cemetery\u2019s account. Then, on August 9, 2001, Tom Baker (Baker), Dennis Carlson (Carlson), and Harris, members of the Cemetery\u2019s Owners Committee, reiterated to the District Court their concerns regarding Eaton\u2019s handling of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Cemetery\u2019s property. Further, on August 21, 2001, Carlson informed the Court that he had obtained documents showing questionable financial transactions on the Cemetery\u2019s account. In a letter to the Court, he stated that it appeared that Eaton had withdrawn approximately $1,300.00 dollars from the Cemetery\u2019s account, depositing these funds into an account for the Beth Shalom Greater Yellowstone Jewish Community (Temple), for which Eaton was Treasurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b66 Prior to the Cemetery\u2019s Owners Committee expressing concerns about Eaton\u2019s management of Cemetery funds, the District Court, on July 30, 2001, had ordered Eaton to prepare an accounting in regard to the possible sale of the Cemetery, and set a hearing on the matter for September 10, 2001. At this point, Eaton\u2019s financial house of cards began to crumble. At the hearing, the District Court questioned Eaton regarding the concerns expressed by the Cemetery\u2019s Owners Committee. Eaton responded by stating any questionable transfer of monies from the Cemetery to the Temple were mere mistakes which he had fixed. However, on September 12, the District Court ordered the accounting firm of Veltkamp, Stannebein, and Bateson, P.C., to audit Eaton\u2019s receivership of the Cemetery. Joe Bateson (Bateson) of that firm examined bank statements, accounting records produced by Eaton, accounting records produced by Baker, various deeds and title reports, and copies of various receipts related to Cemetery operations. In addition, Bateson conducted personal interviews with Eaton, members of the Cemetery\u2019s Owners Committee and its bank, as well as the Riverside Country Club, to which Eaton belonged. In a report to the District Court, Bateson concluded that between September 1997 and September 2001, checks and other transfers were made from the Cemetery\u2019s account to Eaton, or on his behalf, in the amount of $24,498.00. These transactions included deposits into Eaton\u2019s personal bank account, payment of Eaton\u2019s personal bills, including his Riverside Country Club dues and charges, and deposits into Eaton\u2019s personal investment account with Charles Schwab.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b67 Pending Bateson\u2019s report, the District Court conducted a status hearing on November 26,2001, in which the court suspended Eaton as a receiver of the Cemetery\u2019s property. The District Court removed Eaton as receiver for the Cemetery on January 15, 2002, after the court received and reviewed Bateson\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b68 Meanwhile, as the Cemetery\u2019s Owners Committee was growing suspicious of Eaton\u2019s actions, so were the officers of the Temple, where Eaton acted as Treasurer. On or about August 23, 2001, Jennifer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Bordy (Bordy), Temple Director, and Bob Rasmus (Rasmus), Temple President, filed a complaint with the Bozeman Police Department alleging that Eaton had stolen from the Temple. Rasmus told Detective Gappmayer that he learned that checks written on the Temple\u2019s account had been dishonored for insufficient funds, that there was an unpaid account opened by Eaton on behalf of the Temple at Staples supply store, and that there were two bank accounts with Western Security Bank in the Temple\u2019s name, which the Temple officers (other than Eaton) never knew existed. Because of Rasmus\u2019s findings, the Temple retained Certified Public Accountant Randy Newberg (Newberg) to audit its accounts. Newberg discovered that without the Temple\u2019s approval, Eaton, on numerous occasions, had kept cash from Temple deposits, cashed and deposited Temple funds into his own personal account, and used Temple funds to pay personal bills, including credit cards, a car loan, telephone expenses, and Riverside Country Club dues and charges. Newberg noted that there were many unexplained ATM withdrawals and transfers between the Temple and Cemetery, with only one connection, that being Eaton.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b69 On March 29, 2002, the Gallatin County Attorney charged Eaton with two counts of felony theft, common scheme, in violation of \u00a7 45-7-301, MCA; one count of perjury, in violation of \u00a7 45-7-201, MCA; and one count of tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, in violation of \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA. Count I, theft, alleged that from September 1997, through August 2001, Eaton stole money totaling $24,498.00 from the Cemetery. Count II, theft, alleged that from April 1997 through August 2001, Eaton stole money from the Temple totaling $84,556.64.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b610 On December 3, 2002, Eaton pled guilty to two counts of felony theft, common scheme, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA, pursuant to a plea agreement. The District Court dismissed the other charges. Following a sentencing hearing, the District Court sentenced Eaton to two consecutive ten-year terms, for a total of twenty years, with fifteen years suspended, at the Montana State Prison. Further, the District Court ordered Eaton to pay restitution and fees totaling $114,520.32. At the sentencing hearing, the District Court ordered Eaton to make payments equal to 20 percent of his net income per month, from any source, including money received from his social security benefits. Eaton did not object to the District Court\u2019s order entered on January 21, 2003. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b611 We pause to clarify once again the appropriate standard of review for a challenge to a criminal sentence, an issue we addressed at length in <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, 295 Mont. 288, 983 P.2d 937. We review a District Court\u2019s criminal sentence for legality only. <em>Montoya, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16; <em>State v. Heath, </em>2004 MT 126, \u00b6 13, 321 Mont. 280, \u00b6 13, 90 P.3d 426, \u00b6 13. Recently, our cases have cited to an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing criminal sentences in addition to the legality standard, <em>see State v. Kime, </em>2002 MT 38, \u00b6 6, 308 Mont. 341, \u00b6 6, 43 P.3d 290, \u00b6 6 (citing <em>State v. Horton, </em>2001 MT 100, \u00b6 17, 305 Mont. 242, \u00b6 17, 25 P.3d 886, \u00b6 17), despite our holding in <em>Montoya </em>to the contrary: \u201cThis Court reviews a criminal sentence only for legality (i.e., whether the sentence is within the parameters provided by statute). To the extent that... other decisions of this Court suggest that we also review criminal sentences for an abuse of discretion, they are overruled.\u201d <em>Montoya, </em>\u00b6 15. Thus, our review is confined to legality. <em>Montoya, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b612 Before addressing the issues Eaton raises on appeal, we first address the State\u2019s procedural argument that Eaton effectively waived his right to appeal the District Court\u2019s imposition of restitution by \u201cacquiescing\u201d in that condition. The State argues that, because of Eaton\u2019s failure to object at the sentencing hearing to the District Court\u2019s order requiring him to pay full restitution as a condition of his suspended sentence, he failed to preserve the issue for appeal. The State cites \u00a7 46-20-104, MCA, which provides that, generally, a criminal defendant must make a contemporaneous objection in order to preserve an issue on appeal. Further, the State argues that our holdings in both <em>State v. McLeod, </em>2002 MT 348, 313 Mont. 358, 61 P.3d 126, and <em>State v. Micklon, </em>2003 MT 45, 314 Mont. 291, 65 P.3d 559, require this conclusion. However, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u00b613 Unlike the defendants in <em>McLeod </em>and <em>Micklon, </em>Eaton did not \u201cacquiesce\u201d or \u201cactively participate\u201d in the imposition of the sentencing conditions which he now challenges on appeal. First, Eaton is not challenging inaccuracies contained in his presentence investigation report (PSI). <em>See McLeod, </em>\u00b6 15 (defendant waived his right to challenge incorrect information contained in his PSI report where he had ample time to bring the inaccuracies to the district court\u2019s attention and failed to do so). Second, although Eaton offered an apology to the District Court at his sentencing hearing for his failure to make any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>restitution payments, made statements regarding his assets, including the listing of his home for satisfaction of his sentence, and indicated his wish to make restitution, these statements did not equate with the \u201cactive acquiescence\u201d we found had occurred in <em>Micklon. See Micklon, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 10 (defendant waived his right to appeal the district court\u2019s order imposing interest on his installment restitution payments when he requested the court allow him to make installment payments in satisfaction of his restitution requirements and agreed to pay interest thereon in response to the district court\u2019s questions). Here, Eaton made no such special request to the District Court as did the defendant in <em>Micklon. </em>In contrast, Eaton\u2019s statement was merely one of remorse. This does not constitute \u201cactive acquiescence\u201d upon which we decided <em>Micklon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">\u00b614  While this Court on numerous occasions has held that a defendant must raise an objection in a timely manner or risk waiver of the issue on appeal, <em>State v. Brister, </em>2002 MT 13, \u00b6 15, 308 Mont. 154, \u00b6 15, 41 P.3d 314, \u00b6 15, we have also established an important narrow exception, which we found inapplicable in <em>McLeod </em>or <em>Micklon, </em>but which is applicable here. <em>In State v. Lenihan </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 338, 348, 602 P.2d 997, 1000, we held where a sentence was imposed in a criminal case, and the defendant appeals on the basis that the sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates, \u201c[i]t appears to be the better rule to allow an appellate court [jurisdiction] to review ... even if no objection is made at the time of sentencing.\u201d <em>Brister, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, \u00b6 23, 309 Mont. 1, \u00b6 23, 43 P.3d 318, \u00b6 23. This Court recognizes the often uncert\u00e1in position that a defendant faces during a sentencing hearing. A defendant who objects to a condition imposed during the sentencing hearing bears the risk that the judge could forgo a more lenient sentence. <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000. Thus, \u201ca defendant often times must remain silent even in the face of invalid conditions,\u201d to guard against this possibility. <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000. Eaton\u2019s position is no different. Thus, we conclude that Eaton did not waive the issues he raises on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">\u00b615 Did the District Court err in ordering Eaton to pay restitution as part of his suspended sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\u00b616 Eaton contends that the District Court was without statutory authority to impose restitution as a condition of the suspended portion of his sentence under the 1999 amendments to \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA, for the thefts he committed after October 1, 1999. He argues that subsection (2) of \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA (1999), \u201cmandate[s] restitution, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>addition to other penalties, only in cases where a deferred sentence is imposed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">\u00b617  In making his argument, Eaton raises the same issue that we recently addressed in <em>Heath. </em>We held in <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 36, that a codification error was made in the 1999 legislative amendments to \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA, \u201cwhich was not intended to make any change in the substance or effect [to \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA (1997)],\u201d imposing mandatory restitution when either the district court imposed a deferred or suspended sentence. Thus, based on Our holding in <em>Heath, </em>the District Court did not exceed statutory authority in ordering Eaton to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">\u00b618 Did the District Court err in ordering Eaton to pay restitution from his \u201cnet income,\u201d which is defined as including his social security benefits?</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\u00b619 Eaton argues that the District Court abused its discretion when it ordered him to make restitution payments equal to the amount of 20 percent of his net income, including income from his social security benefits. He contends that this condition violates 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a). While the State argues that the inclusion of Eaton\u2019s social security benefits in his net income for the purpose of calculating the amount of monthly restitution payments is not an \u201cexecution,\u201d \u201clevy,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d \u201cgarnishment\u201d or \u201cformal legal process\u201d in violation of \u00a7 407(a), we agree with Eaton that the District Court\u2019s order improperly burdens his social security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">\u00b620 Based on the evidence introduced at sentencing, including the testimony of accountants Bateson and Newberg, the District Court ordered Eaton to pay $114,520.32 in restitution. The court ordered Eaton to make payments of 20 percent of his net income and indicated that net income includes income from any source including social security or retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">\u00b621 However, the District Court\u2019s order conflicted with \u00a7 407(a), which provides that \u201cnone of the moneys paid or payable ... under [the Social Security Act] shall be subject to \u2018execution,\u2019 \u2018levy,\u2019 \u2018attachment,\u2019 \u2018garnishment,\u2019 or other \u2018legal process.\u2019 \u201d <em>See also Bennett v. Arkansas </em>(1988), 485 U.S. 395, 396, 108 S.Ct. 1204, 1205, 99 L.Ed.2d. 455, 458 (holding that \u201cthe express language of \u00a7 407(a) and the clear intent of Congress that social security benefits not be attachable\u201d); <em>Philpott v. Essex County Welfare Bd. </em>(1973), 409 U.S. 413, 417, 93 S.Ct. 590, 592, 34 L.Ed.2d 608, 611-12 (holding that \u00a7 407(a) \u201cimposes a broad bar against the use of any legal process to reach all social security benefits\u201d). In <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Services v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number><em>Guardianship </em>(2003), 537 U.S. 371, 385, 123 S.Ct. 1017, 1025, 154 L.Ed.2d. 972, 974-75, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cexecution,\u201d \u201clevy,\u201d \u201cattachment,\u201d \u201cgarnishment,\u201d or \u201cother legal process\u201d \u201care terms of art referencing to formal procedures by which one person gains a degree of control over property otherwise subject to the control of another, and generally involves some form of judicial authorization.\u201d <em>See also </em>The Social Security Administration\u2019s Program Operations Manual System, POMS GN 02410.001 (2002) (available at http://policy.ssa.gov/poms.nsPaboutpoms) (defining \u201clegal process\u201d as used in \u00a7 407(a) as \u201cthe means by which a court compels compliance with its demands, generally, it is a court order\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">\u00b622  Here, the order is an improper attempt to subject Eaton\u2019s social security benefits to \u201cother legal process.\u201d The State concedes that a direct attempt to levy upon social security benefits would violate \u00a7 407(a), but argues that Eaton can raise this defense at the time it would seek a levy. However, it is appropriate to eliminate the offending condition from the judgment in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">\u00b623 Thus, the judgment\u2019s inclusion of Eaton\u2019s social security income conflicts with the provisions of \u00a7 407(a), and we reverse the inclusion thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b624 We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for entry of an amended judgment consistent herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b306-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and WARNER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
