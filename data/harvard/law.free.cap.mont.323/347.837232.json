We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">\u00b62 The following issue is presented on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in dismissing Pe\u00f1a\u2019s petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>postconviction relief which alleged that the District Court lacked statutory authority, and thus, subject matter jurisdiction, to sentence Pe\u00f1a to more than five years to the Department of Corrections (DOC)?</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b64 Pe\u00f1a was seventeen years old when, on October 31,1998, he was arrested and charged with deliberate homicide (felony murder) in violation of \u00a7 45-5-102, MCA; robbery in violation of \u00a7 45-5-401(l)(b), MCA; and aggravated burglary in violation of \u00a7 45-6-204, MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On Halloween night, Pe\u00f1a and two other males broke into a home in Billings hoping to find drugs and money. The three men wore Halloween masks and had two handguns among them. They knocked on the door, and, when a female resident of the house opened the door to the apparent trick-or-treaters and explained she had no candy, one of them responded, \u201cWrong answer!\u201d The three men then forced their way into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b65 Inside, the men demanded drugs and money. The woman told them she had money in one of the bedrooms and led the three to that room. Upon arriving, two of the men, including Pe\u00f1a, began to search the room, while the third forced the woman to her knees and demanded oral sex. One of the two men searching the house found a baggie with hallucinogenic mushrooms and a small jar containing other illicit drugs. The woman began to perform oral sex on the third man who was holding a gun to her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u00b66 When a vehicle was heard pulling into the driveway, two of the three males, including Pe\u00f1a, broke out a window and crawled out of the house while the third continued to demand oral sex. However, when the homeowner was heard entering the house, the assailant also crawled out of the broken window. Before running away, he yelled \u201cDie, Motherfucker!\u201d and shot and killed the homeowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">\u00b67 Responding officers arrested Pe\u00f1a, found the hallucinogenic mushrooms on him, and located Halloween masks, clothing, and one gun in the vicinity of the crime. Witnesses later identified Pe\u00f1a as one of three men running in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">\u00b68 On November 4, 1998, the Yellowstone County Attorney\u2019s Office obtained leave to file an Information in District Court. On November 5,1998, the State arraigned Pe\u00f1a in District Court, although Pe\u00f1a was seventeen at the time. Pe\u00f1a objected to the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>over his case without a removal hearing from youth court. Two weeks later, on November 20,1998, Pe\u00f1a pled guilty to deliberate homicide (felony murder) and aggravated burglary. The State later dismissed the robbery charge. Pe\u00f1a admitted that he had participated in a burglary and that, after he had left the residence, one of the other participants shot and killed an individual. Under a plea agreement, the State agreed to recommend a sentence of sixty years, with no weapons enhancement and no parole restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b69 On April 2, 1999, the District Court sentenced Pe\u00f1a to the Montana State Prison as an adult offender for a total of forty-five years: thirty years for the deliberate homicide, and fifteen years for the aggravated burglary, to run consecutively. Pe\u00f1a did not appeal his judgment of conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b610 On April 6, 1999, four days after Pe\u00f1a was sentenced in District Court, this Court decided <em>State v. Butler, </em>1999 MT 70, 294 Mont. 17, 977 P.2d 1000, in which we held that due process requires a hearing before leave to file an Information in District Court can be granted in cases involving a juvenile. On October 25, 1999, Pe\u00f1a filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for postconviction relief alleging that, pursuant to <em>Butler, </em>his due process rights had been violated because the District Court failed to hold a hearing prior to the transfer of his case from Youth Court to District Court. The Yellowstone County Attorney\u2019s Office conceded that Pe\u00f1a was entitled to a removal hearing as a matter of due process, and the District Court set the matter for a hearing on September 5, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">\u00b611 On September 13, 2000, the District Court issued findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order granting leave for the State to file the Information against Pe\u00f1a directly in District Court. However, pursuant to a stipulation between Pe\u00f1a and the State, Pe\u00f1a re-entered his guilty pleas and the same sentence was imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u00b612 On October 16,2002, Pe\u00f1a filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for postconviction relief in District Court. The District Court appointed the Montana Appellate Defender\u2019s Office to represent Pe\u00f1a and ordered the State to respond. On March 5, 2003, through postconviction relief counsel, Pe\u00f1a filed an amended petition for postconviction relief. In his amended petition, Pe\u00f1a argued that his sentence was illegal because, pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-206(6), MCA, of the Youth Court Act, youths must be sentenced to the DOC, and, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201(l)(e), MCA, the maximum sentence to which an individual could be sentenced to the DOC is five years. Pe\u00f1a argued that, pursuant to these two statutes, the District Court lacked the statutory authority to sentence him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>more than five years to the DOC. Therefore, Pe\u00f1a requested that the District Court amend his sentence to a five-year commitment to the DOC for each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b613 On July 14, 2003, the District Court issued an order denying Pe\u00f1a\u2019s amended petition for postconviction relief on grounds that \u00a7 41-5-206(6), MCA, and \u00a7 46-18-201(l)(e), MCA, did not constitute a limitation to the court\u2019s ability to impose Pe\u00f1a\u2019s forty-five-year sentence to the Montana State Prison. Pe\u00f1a now appeals the denial of his amended petition. This Court heard oral argument on the matter on March 10, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u00b614 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Root, </em>2003 MT 28, \u00b6 7, 314 Mont. 186, \u00b6 7, 64 P.3d 1035, \u00b6 7 (citing <em>State v. Wright, </em>2001 MT 282, \u00b6 9, 307 Mont. 349, \u00b6 9, 42 P.3d 753, \u00b6 9).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">\u00b615 <em>Did the District Court err in dismissing Pe\u00f1a\u2019s petition for postconviction relief which alleged that the District Court lacked statutory authority, and thus, subject matter jurisdiction, to sentence Pe\u00f1a to more than five years to the DOC?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\u00b616 Pe\u00f1a argues that, pursuant to subpart (e) of \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA, the sentencing statute, the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to sentence him to more than five years to the DOC. The State argues that Pe\u00f1a\u2019s petition is barred by the one-year filing period for postconviction relief set forth in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA. That statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-10\">46-21-102. When petition may be filed. (1) Except as provided in subsection (2), a petition for the relief referred to in 46-21-101 may be filed at anytime within 1 year of the date that the conviction becomes final. A conviction becomes final for purposes of this chapter when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-11\">(a) the time for appeal to the Montana supreme court expires;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-12\">(b) if an appeal is taken to the Montana supreme court, the time for petitioning the United States supreme court for review expires; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-13\">(c) if review is sought in the United States supreme court, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>the date that that court issues its final order in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The State reasons that, under \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, because Pe\u00f1a did not appeal his judgment of September 13, 2000, the conviction became final sixty days thereafter, on November 12, 2000. Pe\u00f1a then had one year from that date, or until November 12,2001, to file his petition for postconviction relief. The State contends that since Pe\u00f1a filed his petition on October 16,2002, over eleven months beyond the deadline, it was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\u00b617 Pe\u00f1a responds that, even though he filed his petition beyond the filing deadline established by \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, his claim is not time-barred because he is challenging the sentencing court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, which can be raised at any time. Pe\u00f1a\u2019s jurisdiction argument begins by reference to \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-206 and 46-18-201, MCA, which, Pe\u00f1a explains, control his case as a seventeen-year-old youth.</p>\n<p id=\"AAm\">\u00b618 Section 41-5-206(6), MCA, of the Youth Court Act, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">41-5-206. Filing in district court prior to formal proceedings in youth court. (1) The county attorney may, in the county attorney\u2019s discretion, file with the district court a motion for leave to file an information in the district court if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">(\u0430) the youth charged was 12 years of age or older at the time of the conduct alleged to be unlawful and the unlawful act would if it had been committed by an adult constitute:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">(ii) deliberate homicide as defined in 45-5-102;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">(v) burglary or aggravated burglary as defined in 45-6-204;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">(\u0431) If a youth is found guilty in district court of any of the offenses enumerated in subsection (1) and is sentenced to the state prison, the commitment must be to the department of corrections ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">The offenses listed in subsection (1) of \u00a7 41-5-206, MCA, include deliberate homicide and aggravated burglary, the two felonies with which Pe\u00f1a, as a minor, was charged. Section 46-18-201(l)(e), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-12\">46-18-201. Sentences that may be imposed. (1) Whenever a person has been found guilty of an offense upon a verdict or a plea of guilty, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-13\">(e) impose a county jail or state prison sentence as provided in Title 45, for the offense or commit the defendant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>department of corrections for a period not to exceed 5 years for placement in an appropriate correctional facility or program ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Pe\u00f1a contends that the plain language of both \u00a7 41-5-206(6), MCA, and \u00a7 46-18-201(l)(e), MCA, when read together, controls the length of sentence which the District Court could impose. Specifically, Pe\u00f1a states that because he was a minor whose case had been removed from Youth Court to District Court, \u00a7 41-5-206(6), MCA, mandated that he be sentenced to the DOC and, in accordance with \u00a7 46-18-201(l)(e), MCA, such a sentence could not exceed five years. Pe\u00f1a argues therefrom that the District Court lacked statutory authority to impose his forty-five-year sentence, which he equates to a lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, Pe\u00f1a argues that since subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of the proceedings, his petition was not barred by the time bar in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b619 The time bar was not raised by the State in the District Court. The District Court denied Pe\u00f1a\u2019s amended petition for postconviction relief on the merits of Pe\u00f1a\u2019s statutory argument, concluding that the court was at liberty to sentence him as a seventeen-year-old youth in the manner it did. The court reasoned that Pe\u00f1a was actually sentenced to the Montana State Prison, and that the reference in the sentence to the Department of Corrections was simply a necessary transfer of the youth\u2019s custody to that agency until he reached the age of majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">\u00b620 Taking up the timeliness issue, we determine whether Pe\u00f1a\u2019s challenge to his sentence constitutes a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d claim, whether it is subject to the time limitation of \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, and whether the State waived the timeliness issue by not raising it in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">\n<em>Subject Matter Jurisdiction vs. Illegal Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">\u00b621 District courts in Montana are granted jurisdiction by the Constitution and by state statute. Article VII, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">Section 4. District court jurisdiction. (1) The district court has original jurisdiction in <em>all criminal cases amounting to felony </em>and ... such additional jurisdiction as may be delegated by the laws of the state of Montana. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">This Court has previously considered the meaning of the term \u201cjurisdiction\u201d as it relates to district courts. In <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. District Court </em>(1966), 147 Mont. 263, 410 P.2d 933, we defined \u201cjurisdiction\u201d as the \u201cpower\u201d or \u201ccapacity\u201d of a district court to hear a particular action as well as render a judgment therein:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201cJurisdiction is the power to hear and determine the particular action or proceeding as well as to make such orders and render such judgment therein as the law authorizes in the class of actions or proceedings to which it belongs.\u201d [Quoting <em>State ex. rel. Lay v. District Court </em>(1948), 122 Mont. 61, 70-71, 198 P.2d 761, 766.]... \u201cJurisdiction as applied to courts is the power or capacity <em>given by law </em>to a court to entertain, hear and determine the particular case or matter.\u201d [Quoting <em>State ex rel. Bennett v. Bonner, Governor </em>(1950), 123 Mont. 414, 425, 214 P.2d 747, 753.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGH\"><em>Johnson, </em>147 Mont. at 267, 410 P.2d at 935. <em>In Hagan v. State </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 31, 873 P.2d 1385, we addressed subject matter \u201cjurisdictional\u201d claims in the context of a sentencing court\u2019s ability to accept a guilty plea and impose sentence. We defined jurisdictional claims, in that context, as those defined by <em>United States v. Cortez </em>(9th Cir. 1992), 973 F.2d 764. <em>Hagan, </em>265 Mont. at 36, 873 P.2d at 1388. \u201cJurisdictional\u201d claims, <em>Cortez </em>held, are \u201cthose cases in which the district court could determine that the government lacked the power to bring the indictment at the time of accepting the guilty plea from the face of the indictment or from the record.\u201d <em>Cortez, </em>973 F.2d at 767 (citing <em>United States v. Broce </em>(1989), 488 U.S. 563, 109 S.Ct. 757, 102 L.Ed.2d 927).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b622  From these principles, we conclude that \u201cjurisdictional\u201d claims are those which challenge a court\u2019s \u201cpower\u201d or \u201ccapacity\u201d to entertain the subject matter of the proceeding and render a determination therein. Thus, although Pe\u00f1a argues that the sentencing court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to sentence him to the DOC for more than five years by virtue of \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-206(6) and 46-18-201(1), MCA, Pe\u00f1a\u2019s argument is not properly characterized as a jurisdictional inquiry. Whether a district court commits a statutory error in imposing a sentence must not be confused with the question of whether the court had the \u201cpower\u201d or \u201ccapacity\u201d to impose the sentence in the first instance. An error in sentencing does not divest a district court of subject matter jurisdiction over the case before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b623 Here, the sentencing court possessed subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Article VII, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution (\u201cthe district court has original jurisdiction in all criminal cases amounting to a felony ...\u201d), \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-102 and 45-6-204, MCA, which defined, respectively, deliberate homicide and aggravated burglary as felonies, with which Pe\u00f1a was charged, and \u00a7 41-5-206, MCA, which authorized the transfer of Pe\u00f1a\u2019s case to adult court.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b624 Therefore, Pe\u00f1a\u2019s assertion that the District Court lacked subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>matter jurisdiction to impose the sentence he received is more accurately characterized as a claim that his sentence was illegal as exceeding statutory authority. A criminal sentence is \u201clegal\u201d if the sentence is \u201cwithin the parameters provided by statute.\u201d <em>State v. McLeod, </em>2002 MT 348, \u00b6 12, 313 Mont. 358, \u00b6 12, 61 P.3d 126, \u00b6 12; <em>State v. Lafley, </em>1998 MT 21, \u00b6 26, 287 Mont. 276, \u00b6 26, 954 P.2d 1112, \u00b6 26; <em>State v. Goulet </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 308, 312, 921 P.2d 1245, 1247; <em>State v. Nelson </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 11, 18, 906 P.2d 663, 667. \u201c[A] district court\u2019s authority to impose sentences in criminal cases is defined and constrained by statute.\u201d <em>State v. Yorek, </em>2002 MT 74, \u00b6 15, 309 Mont. 238, \u00b6 15, 45 P.3d 872, \u00b6 15 (citing <em>State v. Nelson, </em>1998 MT 227, \u00b6 24, 291 Mont. 15, \u00b6 24, 966 P.2d 133, \u00b6 24). Indeed, \u201ca district court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory <em>authority.\u201d Nelson, </em>\u00b6 24 (citing <em>State v. Hatfield </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 340, 346, 846 P.2d 1025, 1029; <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 34, 37, 926 P.2d 712, 714).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b625 Pefia\u2019s claim that he received an illegal sentence does not challenge the sentencing court\u2019s ability to \u201centertain, hear and determine the particular case or matter,\u201d and, therefore, it is a nonjurisdictional claim for purposes of the postconviction statutes. In light of this conclusion, it is necessary to clarify our holding in <em>State v. Moorman </em>(1997), 279 Mont. 330, 928 P.2d 145, which held that the question of whether a district court possesses the authority to impose a sentence is a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d issue. In <em>Moorman, </em>where the defendant challenged his dangerous offender designation, we concluded that the sentencing court lacked \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d to impose the particular sentence and that \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, the issue preclusion provision of the postconviction statutes, did not apply in such cases. <em>Moorman, </em>279 Mont. at 336, 928 P.2d at 149. However, the question in that case was <em>not </em>whether the court possessed the \u201cpower\u201d or \u201ccapacity\u201d to entertain, hear and determine a matter, but rather whether the particular sentence imposed by the sentencing court was statutorily permissible, and therefore, to the extent that our holding in <em>Moorman </em>characterized and resolved the sentencing issue before it as \u201cjurisdictional,\u201d that holding was incorrect, and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\n<em>Application of the One-year Postconviction Time Bar</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b626  Section 46-21-102, MCA, provides that \u201ca petition <em>for the relief referred to in 46-21-101 </em>may be filed at anytime within 1 year of the date that the conviction becomes final.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 46-21-101, MCA, incorporated by reference within \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>delineates the claims which may be brought by way of a postconviction proceeding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">46-21-101.

We have explained that the time limit is waived pursuant to this exception in order to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice, which exists if a defendant provides the court with newly-discovered evidence that proves the defendant is actually innocent. <em>State v. Redcrow, </em>1999 MT 95, \u00b6 33, 294 Mont. 252, \u00b6 33, 980 P.2d 622, \u00b6 33. We have also interpreted the exception to allow waiver of the time limit for a petition alleging the defendant is \u201clegally innocent.\u201d <em>See State v. Pope, </em>2003 MT 330, \u00b6\u00b6 68-69, 318 Mont. 383, \u00b6\u00b6 68-69, 80 P.3d 1232, \u00b6\u00b6 68-69. \u201cWe have held that waiver of the time bar is only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>justified by a \u2018clear miscarriage of justice, one so obvious that the judgment is rendered a complete nullity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Redcrow, </em>\u00b6 34 (citing <em>Petition of Gray </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 1, 908 P.2d 1352).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b628  The exception to the statutory time bar does not apply in this case. Pe\u00f1a has not asserted that newly-discovered evidence proves he is innocent. <em>See Sanchez v. State, </em>2004 MT 9, \u00b6 12, 319 Mont. 226, \u00b6 12, 86 P.3d 1, \u00b6 12; <em>State v. Rosales, </em>2000 MT 89, \u00b6 7, 299 Mont. 226, \u00b6 7, 999 P.2d 313, \u00b6 7; \u00a7 46-21-102(2), MCA. Pe\u00f1a makes no claim that he is actually or legally innocent of the deliberate homicide or aggravated burglary. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>Rosales, </em>\u00b6 7. Therefore, no miscarriage of justice has occurred. <em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 <em>13; Abe, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b629  Thus, Pe\u00f1a\u2019s challenge to the sentencing court\u2019s jurisdiction is time-barred. Though Pe\u00f1a\u2019s claim is actually nonjurisdictional in nature, that determination does not affect the application of the postconviction time bar. According to the postconviction statutes, both jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional claims must be filed within the time period prescribed by \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\n<em>Postconviction Relief is a \u201cSpecial Proceeding,\u201d and the Time Bar Therein is \u201cJurisdictional\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\u00b630 Pe\u00f1a argues that because the State failed to make the argument in District Court that his claim was time-barred under \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, the State has waived this issue on appeal. The State concedes that the time bar was not raised in the District Court, but contends that the time bar is jurisdictional, and therefore, can be raised at any time in the proceeding. To resolve this issue, we first must determine the nature of the postconviction remedy, and of the one-year time limitation set forth therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">\u00b631 Subpart (1) of \u00a7 27-1-102, MCA, states that judicial remedies are divided into two classes: \u201cactions\u201d and \u201cspecial proceedings.\u201d Subpart (2) of the same section defines \u201caction\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-9\">an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice by which one party prosecutes another for the enforcement or protection of a right, the redress or prevention of a wrong, or the punishment of a public offense. Every other remedy is a special proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3u\">Section 27-1-102(2), MCA. Thus, a \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d is every other remedy which is <em>not </em>an \u201caction.\u201d An \u201caction\u201d is further divided into the two subcategories of \u201ccivil action\u201d and \u201ccriminal action\u201d in \u00a7 27-1-103, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\">27-1-103. Civil and criminal actions. (1) Actions are of two kinds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>(a) civil; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">(b) criminal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">(2) A civil action is prosecuted by one party against another for the enforcement or protection of a right or the redress or prevention of a wrong. Titles 45 and 46 define and provide for the prosecution of a criminal action. When the violation of a right admits of both a civil and crimin al remedy, the right to prosecute the one is not merged in the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Pursuant to these provisions, this Court has held that various statutory remedies, including driver\u2019s license reinstatement proceedings, guardianship proceedings and informal probate proceedings, are not \u201cactions,\u201d but rather \u201cspecial proceedings.\u201d <em>See Neal v. State, </em>2003 MT 53, \u00b6 19, 314 Mont. 357, \u00b6 19, 66 P.3d 280, \u00b6 19; <em>Matter of Klos </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 197, 201, 943 P.2d 1277, 1279; <em>Deer Lodge County v. Kohrs, </em>1874 WL 3294, *3 (Mont. Terr.).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u00b632 Further, the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a civil action is initiated by the filing of a complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-8\">Rule 2. One form of action. There shall be one form of action to be known as \u201cCivil Action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">Rule 3. Commencement of action. A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Section 46-21-102, MCA, in describing how a postconviction relief proceeding is initiated, states in relevant part: \u201c[A] <em>petition </em>for the relief referred to in \u00a7 46-21-101 may be filed at any time within 1 year of the date that the conviction becomes final....\u201d Section 46-21-102(1), MCA (emphasis added). Thus, the procedure for a postconviction proceeding, including the initiation of the proceeding and the procedural time frame which follows, is different from that set forth for a civil \u201caction.\u201d In <em>Neal, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-11\">In contrast to the provisions defining a single form of action governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure, including initiation by complaint and the procedural time frame which follows, [the defendant\u2019s] challenge to the suspension of his license was maintained by the filing of a <em>petition </em>which invoked a specific statutory procedure and time frame distinct from that provided by the Rules of Civil Procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-12\"><em>Neal, </em>\u00b616 (emphasis added). Section 46-21-201, MCA, provides that the Rules of Civil Procedure apply in postconviction relief proceedings only \u201cto the extent that they are applicable and are not inconsistent with\u201d the postconviction relief statutes. Section 46-21-201(l)(c), MCA. We have held, generally, that the Rules of Civil Procedure are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>interjected \u201cinto other statutory schemes which provide different procedural requirements.\u201d <em>In Re Estate of Spencer, </em>2002 MT 304, \u00b6 13, 313 Mont. 40, \u00b6 13, 59 P.3d 1160, \u00b6 13; <em>see also Ellenburg v. Chase, </em>2004 MT 66, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 315, \u00b6 12, 87 P.3d 473, \u00b6 12 (\u201c[t]he Rules of Civil Procedure apply to postconviction petitions only if they are consistent with the specific provisions of the postconviction statutes\u201d). With regard to postconviction petitions, we have recently stated that \u201c[u]nlike civil complaints, the postconviction statutes are demanding in their pleading requirements.\u201d <em>Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b633 <em>In State v. Placzkiewicz, </em>2001 MT 254, 307 Mont. 189, 36 P.3d 934, we specifically held that the time limitation in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, controls over other tolling provisions, even though postconviction proceedings are civil in nature:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">With respect to postconviction proceedings, the Legislature has set forth a specific statute of limitations at \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA. ... We hold that the specific statute of limitations for postconviction proceedings provided in Title 46, Chapter 21, <em>controls </em>over other statutes of limitations and the tolling provisions relating to those.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aap\"><em>Placzkiewicz, </em>\u00b6 19 (emphasis added). Thus, the postconviction time limitations are not subject to other generally applicable tolling provisions, but, rather, are governed by their own procedural requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b634 Consequently then, postconviction relief is a \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d governed by the statutes set forth in Title 46, Chapter 21, and is not a civil action governed by the Redes of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The view that a statutory postconviction remedy is a \"special proceeding\u201d comports with the holdings of other states. <em>See Nebraska v. Bronson </em>(Neb. 2003), 672 N.W.2d 244, 249 (special proceedings are \u201cevery special statutory remedy which is not in itself an action\u201d); <em>Williams v. Iowa </em>(Iowa 1985), 378 N.W.2d 894, 896 (\u201cpostconviction relief actions are treated as special proceedings at law\u201d); and <em>Ohio v. La Mar, </em>2000 Ohio App. LEXIS 1211 (the civil rules do not apply to \"special proceedings\u201d). As the Supreme Court of Ohio has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">State collateral review is not itself a constitutional right. ... Further, a postconviction proceeding is not an appeal of a criminal conviction but, rather, a collateral civil attack on the judgment.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Therefore, a petitioner receives no more rights than those granted by statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><em>State v. Calhoun </em>(Ohio 1999), 714 N.E.2d 905, 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b635  Likewise, postconviction relief is not a constitutional right under Montana law, but rather a statutory right. Because a postconviction petitioner cannot claim more rights, and, likewise, the courts cannot provide more rights, than granted by statute, the statutory rules which circumscribe the postconviction process are jurisdictional in nature. Thus, the time bar in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, is jurisdictional because it constitutes the time frame during which a district court has the \u201cpower\u201d or \u201ccapacity\u201d to \u201centertain, hear and determine\u201d petitions for postconviction relief. <em>See Johnson, </em>147 Mont. at 267, 410 P.2d at 935. We have repeatedly so held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">This time limitation is a jurisdictional limit on litigation. ... A failure to file within the allotted time defeats a court\u2019s jurisdiction to hear a postconviction claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\"><em>Sanchez, </em>\u00b6 9 (citing <em>Maier v. State, </em>2003 MT 144, \u00b6 20, 316 Mont. 181, \u00b6 20, 69 P.3d 1194 \u00b6 20; <em>State v. Carson, </em>2002 MT 234, \u00b6 13, 311 Mont. 485, \u00b6 13, 56 P.3d 844, \u00b6 13). Consequently, because the time bar is jurisdictional, it cannot be waived by the State by failing to raise the issue in the District Court. We conclude, therefore, that the State did not waive the time bar issue even though it has raised the issue for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">\u00b636 The State also argues that Pe\u00f1a\u2019s claim is procedurally barred by \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, the issue preclusion provision of the postconviction statutes, because Pe\u00f1a could have challenged the legality of his sentence on direct appeal from the original judgment but did not. Section 46-21-105(2), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">(2) When a petitioner has been afforded the opportunity for a direct appeal of the petitioner\u2019s conviction, grounds for relief that were or could reasonably have been raised on direct appeal may not be raised, considered, or decided in a proceeding brought under this chapter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">\u201cWe have long recognized the importance of applying procedural bars regularly and consistently.\u201d Redcrow, \u00b6 34. This Court applies \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA, as a procedural bar \u201cin order to prevent the abuse of postconviction relief by criminal defendants who would substitute those proceedings for direct appeal and in order to preserve the integrity of the trial and direct appeal.\u201d <em>Watson v. State, </em>2002 MT 329, \u00b6 11, 313 Mont. 209, \u00b6 11, 61 P.3d 759, \u00b6 11 (citing <em>State v.

Pe\u00f1a\u2019s claim that the District Court erred in imposing a forty-five-year sentence is not a \u201cjurisdictional\u201d claim, but, in any event, because jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional claims alike are subject to the time limitation in \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, Pe\u00f1a\u2019s claim is time-barred. As a \u201cspecial proceeding,\u201d a postconviction proceeding is not generally governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure, nor the tolling statutes applicable to civil actions. Because \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, circumscribes the time frame during which a sentencing court has the \u201cpower\u201d or \u201ccapacity\u201d to hear petitions for postconviction relief, that provision is \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d Thus, the State did not waive the argument that \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, constituted a time bar to Pe\u00f1a\u2019s claim by failing to raise it in the District Court, because jurisdictional claims may be raised at any time during the proceedings. We conclude, therefore, that the District Court did not err in denying Pe\u00f1a\u2019s petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b639 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b374-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, REGNIER, COTTER and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-10\"> All statutes referred to herein are from the 1997 version of the Montana Code Annotated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\"> Although Title 27, Chapter 2, the statute of limitations chapter, instructs that the term \u201c\u2018action\u2019... is to be construed, whenever it is necessary to do so, as including a special proceeding of a civil nature,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a7 27-2-101, MCA, it is clearly not \u201cnecessary to do so\u201d here, because the statutes governing postconviction relief contain specific time provisions relating only to this special proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b374-8\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"AOD\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">\u00b640 Although I concur in the result, I dissent as to the Court\u2019s conclusion that the time bar of \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, is jurisdictional in nature. Section 46-21-102, MCA, is, I believe, a statute of limitations. We recognized such in <em>Morrison v. Mahoney, </em>2002 MT 21, \u00b6 11, 308 Mont. 196, \u00b6 11, 41 P.3d 320, \u00b6 11, and <em>State v. Placzkiewicz, </em>2001 MT 254, \u00b6 11, 307 Mont. 189, \u00b6 11, 36 P.3d 934, \u00b6 11, where we characterized this statute as a \u201cstatute of limitations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">\u00b641 If, as the Court concludes, the statute is jurisdictional, then it would be absolute in its application since it is axiomatic that subject matter jurisdiction can never be waived. <em>See In re Marriage of Miller </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 424, 427, 856 P.2d 1378, 1380. Unlike a jurisdictional bar, this statute is subject to exceptions and to waiver. There is a statutory exception for a \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d claim. Section 46-21-102(2), MCA. We have interpreted this exception as encompassing petitions which allege that the defendant is \u201clegally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>innocent.\u201d <em>See State v. Pope, </em>2003 MT 330, 318 Mont. 383, 80 P.3d 1232. We have also held that waiver of the time bar is justified by a \u201cclear miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Redcrow, </em>1999 MT 95, \u00b6 34, 294 Mont. 252, \u00b6 34, 980 P.2d 622, \u00b6 34. Other than correctly pointing out that neither exception applies here because Pe\u00f1a does not make a claim that he is actually or legally innocent, the Court fails to discuss the inconsistency of holding that a statutory bar which is subject to exceptions or to waiver is, nonetheless, \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d As noted above, jurisdiction is absolute and cannot be waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b642 Section 46-21-102, MCA, does not mention \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d I would interpret this statute as the federal courts have interpreted the one-year period for filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus-that is, the one-year period is not a jurisdictional bar, but rather, a statute of limitations. <em>See, e.g., Calderon v. U. S. Dist. Court </em>(9th Cir. 1997), 128 F.3d 1283, 1288-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b643 As a statute of limitations, \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, is subject to waiver. Thus, when the State did not raise the statutory bar as a defense in the District Court, it waived the issue and is now precluded from raising the issue on appeal. Rule 8(c), M.R.Civ.P.; and <em>Marias Healthcare Servs. v. Turenne, </em>2001 MT 127, \u00b6 9, 305 Mont. 419, \u00b6 9, 28 P.3d 491, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u00b644 However, even assuming that the State waived the time bar of \u00a7 46-21-102, MCA, Pe\u00f1a\u2019s claim is still procedurally barred by \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, since he could have challenged the legality of his sentence on direct appeal from the original judgment but did not. Accordingly, I concur in the result reached by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
