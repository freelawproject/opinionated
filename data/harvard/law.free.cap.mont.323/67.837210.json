Lyons appeals from a denial of her appeal to the District Court on her motion to suppress. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">\u00b63 May this Court consult the recording of the evidentiary hearing in the Municipal Court regarding Lyons\u2019s BAC test results?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err in upholding the Municipal Court\u2019s finding that the Intoxilyzer 5000 was properly administered?</p>\n<p id=\"b92-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">\u00b65 On August 30, 2002, in the wee hours of the morning, Missoula Police Department Officer Bob Bouchee transported Jessica R. Lyons from the scene of a car accident to a Missoula booking station. There, after a female detention officer administered a pat down, Bouchee took Lyons into the booking room and turned on a videotape recorder to record her booking. Bouchee sought to give Lyons a blood alcohol content (BAC) test through the use of an Intoxilyzer 5000 breathalyzer. Regulations require that the subject of an Intoxilyzer 5000 test not ingest any food or drink for fifteen minutes prior to the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">\u00b66 While in the booking room, but before the test was administered, Lyons asked if she could use the restroom. Thereafter, Bouchee accompanied Lyons to the restroom, which was directly across the hall from the booking room. Based on Bouchee\u2019s later testimony, and the counter on the videotape, the restroom break took less than two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>minutes. The restroom only contains a toilet and a drinking fountain. Lyons closed the restroom door and Bouchee stood directly outside. He testified that the drinking fountain is rather \u2018loud\u201d and that if Lyons used it he would have heard it being turned on. After Lyons exited the restroom she and Bouchee moved back to the booking room where, less than fifteen minutes later, Lyons took a BAC test and registered a 0.121. The legal limit in Montana at the time was 0.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b67 Lyons was subsequently charged and convicted by a jury of driving with an alcohol concentration of 0.10 or more, \u00a7 61-8-406, MCA (2002). At an evidentiary hearing before trial, Lyons moved to suppress the introduction of the BAC test results, claiming that Bouchee had not complied with the requisite regulations. Specifically, Lyons claimed that since she was not under the eye of Bouchee throughout the fifteen minutes prior to the test\u2019s administration, the Intoxilyzer 5000 was improperly used. Lyons did not, however, claim that she actually ingested anything while out of Bouchee\u2019s sight.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b68 Following her conviction, Lyons appealed the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of her motion to suppress to the District Court. The District Court affirmed the denial, and now Lyons appeals the District Court\u2019s judgment to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b69 We review evidentiary rulings to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Teters, </em>2004 MT 137, \u00b6 17, 321 Mont. 379, \u00b6 17, 91 P.3d 559, \u00b6 17. The determination of whether evidence is relevant and admissible is left to the trial judge and will not be overturned absent a showing of abuse of discretion. <em>Teters, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">\u00b610 <em>May this Court consult the recording of the evidentiary hearing in the Municipal Court regarding Lyons\u2019s BAC test results?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">\u00b611 Lyons correctly contends that the District Court did not review the electronic recording of the Municipal Court\u2019s evidentiary hearing, nor a transcript of the recording. The District Court stated it did not know of any such recording or transcript and stated that in affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of Lyons\u2019s motion to suppress it did not rely on the recording but instead on the videotape of Lyons\u2019s booking.</p>\n<p id=\"AUU\">\u00b612  The District Court did discuss Officer Bouchee\u2019s testimony, however, and that testimony, of course, is not on the booking videotape. Therefore, instead of directly relying on the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>presented at the evidentiary hearing, it appears that the District Court must have relied on the Municipal Court\u2019s written evidentiary ruling, or the parties\u2019 briefs presented to the District Court. Since the District Court did not directly consider the evidence, Lyons argues that this Court is precluded from considering it as well. Lyons is wrong in this contention. Under this state\u2019s rules regarding appeals to district court, \u00a7 3-6-110(2), MCA, and appeals to this Court, Rule 9(a), M.R.App.P., the electronic recording of a courtroom hearing is properly a part of the record. Furthermore, this Court properly received the electronic recording, along with the rest of the record, from the District Court. Therefore, irrespective of whether the District Court made use of it, the electronic recording of the Municipal Court\u2019s evidentiary hearing, including Officer Bouchee\u2019s testimony, is properly part of the record available for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court err in upholding the Municipal Court\u2019s finding that the Intoxilyzer 5000 was properly administered?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b614 Rule 23.4.212(7), ARM, states: \u201cBreath samples of deep lung air shall be analyzed using only the breath analysis instrumentation approved under this rule. Breath analyses will be performed according to an operational checklist for the breath analysis instrument being used.\u201d The Intoxilyzer 5000 has been accordingly approved for administering BAC tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b615 As we have said in the past, every defendant deserves the protection of Montana\u2019s administrative rules. <em>State v. Fenton, </em>1998 MT 99, \u00b6 16, 288 Mont. 415, \u00b6 16, 958 P.2d 68, \u00b6 16. Contrary to Lyons\u2019s assertions, however, the current version of the \u201coperational checklist\u201d does not require that the subject be \u201cobserved\u201d for a minimum of fifteen minutes. Lyons correctly notes that in <em>Fenton </em>we did state that the checklist of the Intoxilyzer 5000 requires the subject be \u201cobserved\u201d for the fifteen minutes prior to the test. <em>Fenton, </em>\u00b6 15. However, that statement was based on the checklist in use at that time. Since then the checklist has changed. At the time of Lyons\u2019s offense, the checklist (and therefore Rule 23.4.212(7), ARM) mandated that the test administrator ensure (1) there was \u201cno oral ingestion of any material\u201d in the fifteen minutes prior to testing, (2) the subject was instructed to deliver a proper sample, (3) the subject was \u201cobserved during <em>sample delivery,\u201d </em>and (4) that nothing occurred that could affect the results. (Emphasis added.) There was no requirement that the administrator keep his eyes on the subject at all times. \u201cObservation\u201d (whether that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>word requires a line of sight or not) was only required during the actual testing, not during the prior fifteen minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b616 Lyons places reliance on a Washington State case interpreting an equivalent BAC testing requirement. <em>Walk v. State, Dept. of Licensing </em>(Wash. Ct. App. 1999), 976 P.2d 185 (interpreting Wash. Admin. Code \u00a7 448-13-040). <em>Walk </em>is not helpful to Lyons\u2019s case for two reasons. First, unlike Rule 23.4.212(7), ARM, and its referenced operational checklist, Washington Administrative Code \u00a7 448-13-040, as interpreted by the court in <em>Walk </em>required the test administrator to \u201cobserve\u201d the subject for the full fifteen minutes prior to the test. <em>Walk, </em>976 P.2d at 187-88. Second, the court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cobserve\u201d did not require the administrator to have his eyes on the subject at all times. <em>Walk, </em>976 P.2d at 186 (\u201cWe conclude that WAC 448-13-040 does not require that the officer actually administering the BAC test <em>personally </em>observe the suspect during the required 15-minute observation period.\u201d (emphasis added)). Even if Montana law required the BAC test administrator to \u201cobserve\u201d the subject for fifteen minutes prior to the test\u2019s administration, under this interpretation of \u201cobserve\u201d the law would not require him to have the subject in his fine of sight for the entire period.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">\u00b617  In this case, Officer Bouchee did not have the subject in his line of sight for the entire fifteen minutes. Even so, the officer did follow the Intoxilyzer 5000's operational checklist. Bouchee testified that he was sure Lyons did not ingest any materials during the requisite fifteen minutes. Lyons was under personal observation for over thirteen of those fifteen minutes, and while she was using the restroom Bouchee stood outside the restroom\u2019s door and did not hear use of the restroom\u2019s drinking fountain. In addition, Lyons did not have anything on her person that she could have ingested because an officer had patted her down when she arrived at the booking station. Furthermore, Lyons has never contended that she <em>did </em>ingest anything in the restroom. The record supports the Municipal Court\u2019s finding that there was no oral ingestion of any material and that Officer Bouchee adhered to the operational checklist.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b618  We conclude that the Municipal Court did not abuse its discretion in its decision to deny Lyons\u2019s motion to suppress the results of her BAC test. Therefore, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b95-7\">JUSTICES REGNIER, WARNER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
