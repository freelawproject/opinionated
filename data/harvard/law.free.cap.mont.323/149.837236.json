We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in determining that placement of</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">David\u2019s name on vehicle titles was a revocable qualified gift that was properly revoked?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in determining that the transfer of real property to David was a revocable qualified gift that was properly revoked?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err in concluding there was no reasonable cause to remove the Guardian?</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">\u00b66 Mrs. Gilroy was born in 1918 and is 86 years old. She married Bruce Gilroy (Mr. Gilroy), with whom she had four children. Mr. and Mrs. Gilroy, who resided in Kalispell, Montana, jointly owned four vehicles,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a 1980 Budd mobile home, and their residence at 406 Hawthorne Avenue in Kalispell. In the fall of 1999, Mr. and Mrs. Gilroy decided to add their son David\u2019s name to the titles of the mobile home and vehicles for the purpose of controlling the ultimate distribution of their personal property upon their deaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">\u00b67 The titles to the four vehicles were issued with a Kalispell address and were in the sole possession and control of Mr. and Mrs. Gilroy. By contrast, the title to the 1980 Budd mobile home was issued with a Poison address and was in the sole possession and control of David, who purchased the mobile home after he obtained a $4,000 loan from Mr. and Mrs. Gilroy. The sum had not yet been repaid at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">\u00b68 Prior to Mr. Gilroy\u2019s death in May 2000 there was no indication that either Mr. or Mrs. Gilroy was incapable of managing their personal or financial affairs. However, after Mr. Gilroy\u2019s death, Mrs. Gilroy became sole owner of their residence in Kalispell, and on July 21, 2000, transferred this property by warranty deed with right of survivorship to herself and David. David did not contribute to the purchase or maintenance of the residence and has not assumed any of the residence\u2019s expenses. The purpose of the transfer was to avoid probate by facilitating a property transfer upon Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>while allowing Mrs. Gilroy to maintain sole control over the residence until such event.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b69 On August 31, 2000, Mrs. Gilroy was admitted to Heritage Place, an extended care facility in Kalispell, Montana, to recuperate from a fall resulting in a broken hip. While at Heritage Place, Mrs. Gilroy was evaluated by Dr. Christopher Gill, Dr. Patrick J. Burns and clinical psychologist Dr. Edward H. Trontel. All three doctors concluded that Mrs. Gilroy suffered from Alzheimer\u2019s disease and was not capable of managing her own personal or financial affairs. In addition, they determined it was in Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s best interest to continue placement in the Alzheimer\u2019s unit at Heritage Place.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b610 Trudy Eckley (Trudy), the daughter of Mrs. Gilroy, filed a petition on February 14, 2001, seeking a determination that Mrs. Gilroy was no longer able to manage her personal and financial affairs as a result of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Because David had appropriated substantial property and monies from Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s estate, and due to disagreements among the children concerning the care of Mrs. Gilroy, Adult Protective Services recommended that an independent person be appointed as Guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b611 On April 26, 2001, all four children of Mrs. Gilroy and her appointed Guardian Ad Litem stipulated that appointment of Eisentraut as Guardian would be in Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s best interests. The following day, the District Court appointed Eisentraut as Guardian for Mrs. Gilroy and her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u00b612 Following Eisentraut\u2019s appointment, he sought to locate and consolidate Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s assets because he determined that Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s estate was running short of funds with which to defray the costs of her care. On October 3, 2001, Eisentraut filed a petition seeking the return of funds from Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s bank account,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the return of certain firearms,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the transfer of the interest in Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s residence and the titles to the vehicles to her estate. David, who refused to relinquish control over the property, filed a motion on November 14, 2001, to remove Eisentraut as the Guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\u00b613 On February 20, 2003, the District Court denied the motion to remove Eisentraut as Guardian. It further ordered David to execute the necessary documents for return of the four vehicles and residence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>to the estate. It directed that David retain possession of certain firearms with exception of one which was designated for his brother, Art Gilroy. The order also determined that David would continue to possess the mobile home and that Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s name be removed from its title subject to the condition that he repay the $4,000 debt to Mrs. Gilroy.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b614 In addition, the District Court ordered Trudy to compile and provide an inventory of Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s personal property, including furnishings and jewelry, to be managed for the benefit of Mrs. Gilroy.</p>\n<p id=\"AMi\">\u00b615 On March 17, 2003, David filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b616 This Court will not disturb a district court\u2019s findings of fact unless its findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Baltrusch v. Baltrusch, </em>2003 MT 357, \u00b6 23, 319 Mont. 23, \u00b6 23, 83 P.3d 256, \u00b6 23. A court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or our review of the record convinces us that a mistake has been committed. <em>In Re Estate of Orr, </em>2002 MT 325, \u00b6 12, 313 Mont. 179, \u00b6 12, 60 P.3d 962, \u00b6 12. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Baltrusch, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\u00b6 17 <em>Did the District Court err in determining that placement of David\u2019s name on the vehicles\u2019 titles was a revocable qualified gift that was properly revoked?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">\u00b618 David argues that the District Court erred in determining that placement of David\u2019s name on the titles to the vehicles was a qualified gift that could be revoked by Mrs. Gilroy or her Guardian. David specifically asserts that after Mr. Gilroy\u2019s death in May 2000, Mr. Gilroy\u2019s interest in the vehicles passed equally to both Mrs. Gilroy and David. David claims that once a donor dies, the gift is complete, and therefore his interest in the vehicles vested upon the death of Mr. Gilroy.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">\u00b619 The Guardian contends that the evidence shows David\u2019s name was placed on the titles to the vehicles as an estate planning mechanism and that even if the transfer was a valid gift, it was to take effect only upon the deaths of both Mr. and Mrs. Gilroy. The Guardian notes that David did not purchase or make a financial contribution to the vehicles, which supports his argument that the transfer was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>qualified and therefore not an irrevocable gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b620 Section 70-3-201, MCA, provides that \u201ca gift in view of death is one which is made in contemplation, fear, or peril of death with intent that it shall take effect only in case of the death of the giver.\u201d Furthermore, \u201ca gift in view of death may be revoked by the giver at any time.\u201d Section 70-3-203, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\u00b621 During his trial testimony, David admitted he had no expectation of using or possessing the vehicles while his parents were alive. His testimony thus revealed that the vehicle title transfers were not intended to create a present possessory interest and were made conditional upon the death of both Mr. and Mrs. Gilroy. In addition, Trudy\u2019s testimony corroborated David\u2019s statements that he had agreed to transfer the property back and had never claimed a present, gifted interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b622  Because the evidence established that addition of David\u2019s name to the titles of the four vehicles was for purposes of controlling their ultimate distribution upon the deaths of both Mr. and Mrs. Gilroy, and that the vehicles were to remain for the use and benefit of the Gilroys for so long as they desired, the transfer was a qualified transfer which was revocable by Mrs. Gilroy or her Guardian after Mr. Gilroy\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b623  The distribution of property to another may validly be accomplished by designation upon its title, however, pursuant to \u00a7 70-3-203, MCA, such transfers, when made in view of death, are qualified and may be revoked by the giver at any time. Here, the transfers were made conditional on the deaths of both Mr. and Mrs. Gilroy which allowed for revocation thereof prior to the occurrence of the second death. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that placement of David\u2019s name on the vehicles\u2019 titles was a revocable qualified gift that was later revoked by Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s Guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">\u00b624 <em>Did the District Court err in determining that the transfer of real property to David was a revocable qualified gift that was properly revoked?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">\u00b625 David contends that Mrs. Gilroy, intending to avoid probate, granted him a present interest in her home at 406 Hawthorne Avenue in Kalispell, Montana, by executing and recording a warranty deed with right of survivorship in both her and David\u2019s name. David asserts that under \u00a7 70-1-509, MCA, a grant duly executed is presumed to have been delivered at its date and that the recording of such deed strengthens this presumption, which may only be overcome by clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>and convincing evidence. <em>Gross v. Gross </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 480, 482, 781 P.2d 284, 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b626 The Guardian responds that <em>Gross </em>is not applicable because the Court in <em>Gross </em>was dealing only with subsequent, uncorroborated testimony on behalf of the grantor in regard to the grantor\u2019s intent, whereas, in the case at hand, the evidence of intent was present within the period immediately preceding the signing of the deed and was fully corroborated by other witnesses. We agree that <em>Gross </em>is so distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b627 On direct examination, David admitted that, prior to the transfer of the property to him, he had agreed to transfer the property back to Mrs. Gilroy upon her request in the event she wanted to sell the home. David\u2019s testimony was corroborated by two other witnesses. Shirley Schliep, David\u2019s girlfriend, and a clerk at the Clerk and Recorder\u2019s Office, Rebecca Eslick, each testified that they heard David tell Mrs. Gilroy that he would deed the house back to Mrs. Gilroy on her request.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b628 In Montana, delivery occurs by either \u201cwords, acts, or both.\u201d <em>Hauseman v. Koski </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 498, 502, 857 P.2d 715, 717. \u201cThe law does not require actual handing over of the document so long as it is handled in a way that unequivocally shows the intention of the settlor.\u201d <em>Koski, </em>259 Mont. at 502, 857 P.2d at 717. Here, Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s intention that David would transfer the house back to her upon request was expressed and confirmed by David prior to the signing of the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\u00b629  Consequently, the same analysis under \u00a7 70-3-203, MCA, that we applied in regard to the vehicles is applicable here. Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s purpose in deeding an interest in the property to David was to control the distribution upon her death. Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that placement of David\u2019s name on the real property by way of a deed was a qualified and revocable gift that was later revoked by Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s Guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">\u00b630 <em>Did the District Court err in concluding there was no reasonable cause to remove the Guardian?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">\u00b631 David argues there was reasonable cause to remove Eisentraut as the Guardian due to his mismanagement of Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s estate and because he did not act in Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s best interests. David specifically alleged that Eisentraut failed to account for Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s assets, did not promptly assist in the return of Mr. Gilroy\u2019s rings from Trudy, allowed Trudy\u2019s son to live in Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s home without paying rent, and allowed Trudy to take possession of Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s property without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>her knowledge or permission. David further contends that Eisentraut should have removed Mrs. Gilroy from Heritage Place to a lesser restrictive facility and that because of his failure to do so, did not act in Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b632 Eisentraut questions David\u2019s intentions by arguing that the issue of his removal was not raised by David until after Eisentraut petitioned the District Court to require David to restore the estate assets of Mrs. Gilroy which were in his possession. Eisentraut contends he entered a family \u201cwar zone\u201d without any direct interest in any disposition at the recommendation of Adult Protective Services, but that, in any event, he has acted in Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b633 Pursuant to \u00a7 72-5-325, MCA, a district court, after a hearing regarding a ward\u2019s welfare, may remove the guardian if it is in the best interests of the ward. Further, the district court may remove a conservator for good cause. Section 72-5-414, MCA. This Court has held that it will \u201cinterfere with the [guardian\u2019s] exercise of discretion only in a case of clear abuse.\u201d <em>In Re Custody of Krause, </em>2001 MT 37, \u00b6 12, 304 Mont. 202, \u00b6 12, 19 P.3d 811, \u00b6 12; <em>Matter of Guardianship of Nelson </em>(1983), 204 Mont. 90, 94, 663 P.2d 316, 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b634 After hearing, the District Court concluded that there was no credible evidence that Eisentraut had not acted in Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s best interest. All of the Gilroy children agreed that Mrs. Gilroy be placed in assisted living. Subsequently, Eisentraut participated in a care plan meeting with the Heritage Place employees and interviewed Mrs. Gilroy, her children and Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s physicians and concluded it would be in Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s best interests to remain in the Alzheimer\u2019s unit at Heritage Place. Furthermore, the evidence shows that Eisentraut thoroughly investigated and accounted for Mrs. Gilroy\u2019s real and personal property for the purpose of sustaining her ongoing care and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u00b635  We conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings were supported by substantial credible evidence and the District Court did not err in concluding the evidence was insufficient to warrant removal of Eisentraut as Guardian to Mrs. Gilroy and her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\u00b636 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b168-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES REGNIER, LEAPHART and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-13\"> The four vehicles included a 1971 Plymouth, 1979 Lincoln, 1984 Paro motor home, and a 1984 Ford Truck.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-9\"> The funds in the bank account are not at issue; David subsequently returned the funds to Eisentraut before trial and is not contesting the return.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b164-10\"> The firearms are not at issue on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
