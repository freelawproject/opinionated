We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-16\">\u00b62 Grindheim raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b532-17\">\u00b63 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Grindheim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>motion for directed verdict on the issue of penetration?</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">\u00b64 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by requiring Grindheim to choose between a continuance to prepare for a State witness or losing the opportunity for his expert to testify?</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\u00b65 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Grindheim\u2019s request to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense of endangering the welfare of children?</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">\u00b66 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in excusing a juror after the case had been submitted to the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err in imposing sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">\u00b68 On August 24, 2001, E.S., who was 12 years old, traveled to Lewistown, Montana, and spent the evening at the home of Josh Poser (Poser) where her cousin Phil Fry (Fry) was also staying. Courtney Trafton (Trafton), who was likewise spending the night at Poser\u2019s home, brought blankets and a sleeping bag for E.S. to use as bedding. When Trafton and Fry went to bed, E.S. laid down on a couch in the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">\u00b69 Meanwhile, Grindheim, Sam Knox (Knox), and Rocky Stonehocker (Stonehocker), all from Denton, Montana, also decided to spend the evening at Poser\u2019s home because Grindheim had been living and paying rent there that summer and was in the process of moving out. Grindheim was 20 years old. That evening, all three drank alcohol and visited friends in the Lewistown area.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">\u00b610 At one o\u2019clock in the morning, Grindheim, Knox, and Stonehocker stopped by Poser\u2019s home. They were carrying beer and drinking, and left again shortly thereafter. Around four o\u2019clock in the morning, the three men came back to Poser\u2019s house and were intoxicated. Knox went to bed on the living room floor and Stonehocker decided to sleep in the yard. Grindheim told E.S. he had a \u201cclaim\u201d on the couch because he used to live there. Grindheim and E.S. ended up sharing the couch, each lying on opposite sides of the couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">\u00b611 E.S. testified that over the next 30 minutes, Grindheim continually asked her to come under the covers, but that she had replied, \u201cNo.\u201d E.S. explained that Grindheim then grabbed her hand and tried to lure her under the covers without success, and that he began asking her to give him a \u201cblow job.\u201d E.S. testified that at this point, Grindheim\u2019s pants were off and that she saw his erect penis. E.S. stated that she told Grindheim she did not want to do it, but that Grindheim continued to force her head down on his penis to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>oral sex. E.S. testified that as she turned her head, her cheek and then her mouth went on Grindheim\u2019s penis, which she stated was in her mouth about one-half of a second. E.S. pulled her head up, but Grindheim pushed it back down again, wherein E.S.\u2019s mouth was on his penis a second time for less than one-half of a second. E.S. then pushed Grindheim away, ran into the bathroom, locked the door and stayed there for approximately one-half hour. When E.S. came out of the bathroom, Grindheim was no longer in the house, having gone out to the yard to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u00b612 On the morning of August 25, 2001, E.S. left Poser\u2019s house and went to her aunt\u2019s home in Lewistown, where she saw her parents that afternoon. E.S. did not speak of the incident with Grindheim because she felt scared and did not want anyone to know. The following day, E.S. returned home to Denton and E.S.\u2019s older sister, S.S., told their mother that she heard Grindheim state at a bachelor party they both attended in Lewistown the night before that E.S. gave \u201cgood head.\u201d E.S.\u2019s mother contacted Officer Rick Vaughn (Vaughn) at the Fergus County Sheriffs Department, and insisted that E.S. speak to him about the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b613 Subsequently, Dave Sanders (Sanders), a captain with the Lewistown Police Department, advised Vaughn that he would handle the matter and thereafter asked Grindheim to come to the Fergus County Complex to discuss the incident. After Sanders read Grindheim his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Grindheim signed a waiver form and Sanders conducted a videotaped interview of Grindheim, wherein he explained that his penis was in E.S.\u2019s mouth twice, for about thirty seconds each time.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">\u00b614 On September 5, 2001, Grindheim was charged with sexual intercourse without consent, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA. An Omnibus Hearing was held on February 4,2002, and a trial by jury commenced on June 10, 2002. On Wednesday, June 12, 2002, the jury found Grindheim guilty. The District Court sentenced Grindheim on September 6, 2002, deferring imposition of sentence for six years, subject to a six-month incarceration in the county jail and other conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\u00b615 On September 10, 2002, Grindheim filed a notice of appeal. On September 16,2002, the District Court granted Grindheim\u2019s motion for stay of execution of his sentence pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">\u00b616 We review evidence in a criminal trial in a light most favorable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>the prosecution to determine whether the trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Martin, </em>2001 MT 83, \u00b6 17, 305 Mont. 123, \u00b6 17, 23 P.3d 216, \u00b6 17. Furthermore, we will review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for directed verdict in a criminal case for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. McMahon, </em>2003 MT 363, \u00b6 11, 319 Mont. 77, \u00b6 11, 81 P.3d 508, \u00b6 11. If sufficient evidence exists for the trier of fact to find the elements of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt, no abuse of discretion results. <em>State v. Landis, </em>2002 MT 45, \u00b6 23, 308 Mont. 354, \u00b6 23, 43 P.3d 298, \u00b6 23. Moreover, an abuse of discretion occurs when a district court acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason. <em>Bailey v. Beartooth Communs. Co., </em>2004 MT 128, \u00b6 10, 321 Mont. 305, \u00b6 10, 92 P.3d 1, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\u00b617  This Court reviews jury instructions in criminal cases to \u201cdetermine whether such instructions, as a whole, fully and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law\u201d and whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Bowman, </em>2004 MT 119, \u00b6 49, 321 Mont. 176, \u00b6 49, 89 P.3d 986, \u00b6 49 (citing <em>State v. German, </em>2001 MT 156, \u00b6 10, 306 Mont. 92, \u00b6 10, 30 P.3d 360, \u00b6 10). The district courts have broad discretion in formulating jury instructions. <em>German, </em>\u00b6 10. This Court will not reverse the trial court unless the jury instructions prejudicially affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. McCaslin, </em>2004 MT 212, \u00b6 27, 322 Mont. 350, \u00b6 27, 96 P.3d 722, \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"APf\">\u00b618  The trial court has discretion to remove a juror and seat an alternate juror whenever the facts show the juror\u2019s ability to perform his duties is impaired. <em>State v. Pease </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 455, 469, 724 P.2d 153, 162-63. The reviewing court will not disturb the ruling unless the defendant shows bias or prejudice. <em>Pease, </em>222 Mont. at 470-71, 724 P.2d at 163.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">\u00b6 19 This Court reviews the imposition of a sentence in a criminal case solely for legality, determining whether the sentence is within the parameters of the sentencing statutes. <em>State v. J.C., </em>2004 MT 75, \u00b6 36, 320 Mont. 411, \u00b6 36, 87 P.3d 501, \u00b6 36. In reviewing a district court\u2019s findings of fact as to the amount of restitution, our standard of review is whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Setters, </em>2001 MT 101, \u00b6 16, 305 Mont. 253, \u00b6 16, 25 P.3d 893, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">\u00b620 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Grindheim\u2019s motion for directed verdict on the issue of penetration?</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>\u00b621 Grindheim contends that the District Court erred when it denied his motion for directed verdict because that State introduced insufficient evidence of penetration. Grindheim explains that \u201csexual intercourse\u201d requires proof of penetration under \u00a7 45-2-101(67)(a), MCA,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that E.S.\u2019s testimony regarding this element was ambiguous. To illustrate the ambiguity, Grindheim points to E.S.\u2019s testimony whereby she explained that her mouth was \u201con\u201d Grindheim\u2019s penis but that she also, in response to a leading question, testified Grindheim\u2019s penis was \u201cin\u201d her mouth. Grindheim additionally notes that there was no testimony that E.S.\u2019s mouth was open at any time during the encounter.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\u00b622 The State responds by first noting that \u00a7 45-2-101(67)(b), MCA, provides that, for purposes of the act of sexual intercourse, \u201cany penetration, however slight, is sufficient.\u201d Additionally, the State argues there was no ambiguity as to whether there was penetration because, in addition to E.S.\u2019s testimony that Grindheim\u2019s penis was \u201con\u201d and \u201cin\u201d her mouth twice briefly, Grindheim admitted in his statement to Sanders that his penis was in E.S.\u2019s mouth twice, each time for about thirty seconds, and evidence was presented that Grindheim stated to S.S. that E.S. \u201cdid some mean head.\u201d In light of this evidence, the State contends that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Grindheim\u2019s motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"A7r\">\u00b623  This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for directed verdict in a criminal case for an abuse of discretion. <em>McMahon, </em>\u00b6 11. Here, the District Court denied Grindheim\u2019s motion for a directed verdict based on the evidence offered by the State, concluding there was no ambiguity in E.S.\u2019s testimony and further, that her testimony was supported by Grindheim\u2019s videotaped confession, wherein he acknowledged that his penis was in E.S.\u2019s mouth twice for approximately thirty seconds each time. Additionally, noting that \u00a7 45-2-101(67)(b), MCA, defines penetration as consisting of \u201cany penetration, however slight,\u201d the District Court determined the evidence presented was sufficient to satisfy the statutory requirements for penetration. When viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude that sufficient evidence existed for the jury to find penetration occurred and that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Grindheim\u2019s motion for directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00b624 In his Reply Brief, Grindheim responds to the State\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>by claiming that his confession was not sufficient, by itself, to support the conviction if the State had not first offered sufficient evidence to prove the elements of the crime. As authority, Grindheim points to cases from foreign jurisdictions which support his contention that a confession, by itself, is insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction. However, we have held that, pursuant to \u00a7 26-1-301, MCA, the testimony of one witness is sufficient for the proof of any fact. <em>See Porter v. State, </em>2002 MT 319, \u00b6 22, 313 Mont. 149, \u00b6 22, 60 P.3d 951, \u00b6 22. Therefore, because we concur with the District Court that E.S.\u2019s testimony was sufficient to sustain a finding of penetration, it is unnecessary to address Grindheim\u2019s argument that his confession, standing alone, was insufficient to support the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">\u00b625 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by requiring Grindheim to choose between a continuance to prepare for a State witness or losing the opportunity for his expert to testify?</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">\u00b626 On February 23, 2002, one month after issuance of the Omnibus Order but four months before trial, the State sent Grindheim\u2019s counsel a copy of a statement given by Valerie Turk (Turk) to the Fergus County Sheriffs Department in which she stated that she had overheard Grindheim, in a bragging fashion, say that E.S. had oral sex with him. In addition, the State attached a cover letter to the statement informing Grindheim\u2019s counsel that Turk was a \u201cpotential witness\u201d at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\u00b627 On June 5,2002, five days before trial, the State filed a motion to add Turk to the witness list because her name had not been listed on the Omnibus Order. The following day, Grindheim\u2019s counsel filed an objection to the State\u2019s motion to amend the witness list, and the matter was discussed during a pre-trial hearing that same day. On the \u2022 first day of trial, the State submitted a supplemental affidavit to the District Court concerning its addition of Turk as a witness. Grindheim\u2019s counsel responded that the addition would be prejudicial and that he would ask for a continuance if the witness was allowed to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">\u00b628 On the morning of June 11, 2002, the issue was discussed in Chambers, wherein the District Court asked Mr. Oaas, Grindheim\u2019s counsel, if a one-day continuance to prepare for Turk\u2019s testimony would be sufficient. Mr. Oaas responded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">A day is probably enough for me to do what I need to do. I mean, I can\u2019t really say that I would need more time .... I certainly know a lot of people at places where she worked and knew her, so if I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>need to find the kind of witnesses that I would have lined up ahead of time, I can\u2019t say that a day would be unfair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Thus, the District Court stated that if the State called Turk as the witness and the defense objected, it would grant the defense a one-day continuance. The District Court concluded that a one-day continuance would be sufficient to cure any prejudice because \u201cMs. Turk\u2019s statement was made known ... [it] wasn\u2019t a surprise. The fact that she is a witness to this matter was not a surprise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u00b629 Later, the State announced that it was calling Turk as a witness. However, on that day, Grindheim\u2019s out-of-state expert witness, Dr. Ofshe, was also scheduled to testify, and further, had to depart that evening. This prompted Grindheim\u2019s counsel to ask the District Court to allow Dr. Ofshe to testify out of order <em>before </em>the granting of the one-day continuance. The State objected, arguing that allowing the defense to call Dr. Ofshe, who was to provide expert testimony regarding the inadequacies of the police interrogation surrounding Grindheim\u2019s confession, before the State offered evidence about the confession itself, would cause jury confusion. The District Court agreed and denied the request. Defense counsel, arguing he was faced with a \u201cHobson\u2019s Choice,\u201d placed his objection on the record, and proceeded without taking the one-day continuance. The District Court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa7\">In terms of clarifying the record regarding the testimony of Ms. Turk, I want the record to be clear and reflect that in Chambers, the Court discussed with counsel this very matter, and the Court made it clear that if [Grindheim] was arguing that there was prejudice to his potential preparation for Ms. Turk\u2019s testimony, that the Court would entertain an objection and would then grant a continuance so as to cure that potential prejudice ... [t]his was scheduled for a three-day trial, and it was clear that there would have been an opportunity on the third day of this trial to have the expert testify. Therefore the Court finds that there was not prejudice to [Grindheim]....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u00b630 Grindheim argues that the District Court improperly required him to choose between either accepting a one-day continuance to prepare for the cross-examination of Turk, or having his expert witness testify and foregoing the one-day continuance. Grindheim asserts the District Court abused its discretion by allowing the State to include Turk as a witness without proper notice, and then by refusing to allow Dr. Ofshe to testify out of order to resolve the conflict between Dr. Ofshe\u2019s travel schedule and the timing of the promised continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>\u00b631 The State argues that the District Court properly found that neither Turk, nor the content of her testimony, was a surprise to the defense. Further, the State notes that Grindheim does not contest the District Court\u2019s finding that calling Dr. Ofshe out of order would have caused jury confusion. Thus, the State contends that neither allowing Turk to testify, nor refusing to allow Dr. Ofshe to be called out or order, was an abuse of discretion, especially given the District Court\u2019s requirement that the witnesses were to be available on all three scheduled days of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">\u00b632 \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s ruling allowing the testimony of a witness to determine whether the district court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Bailey, </em>2004 MT 87, \u00b6 11, 320 Mont. 501, \u00b6 11, 87 P.3d 1032, \u00b6 11 (citing State <em>v. Hayworth, </em>1998 MT 158, \u00b6 36, 289 Mont. 433, \u00b6 36, 964 P.2d 1, \u00b6 36). The Defendant in <em>Bailey </em>was charged with sexual assault upon his two stepdaughters and argued on appeal that the district court abused its discretion when it granted the prosecution\u2019s motion to add an expert to its witness list four days before trial. <em>Bailey, </em>\u00b6 21. On March 6,2000, the State informed the Defendant it would be calling the victims\u2019 counselor and physicians as expert witnesses at trial. <em>Bailey, </em>\u00b6 20. However, on June 20, 2002, four days before trial, the State moved to add a physician, giving the Defendant four days to interview the physician and prepare for cross-examination. <em>Bailey, </em>\u00b6 20. The Defendant asserted that the lack of notice regarding the physician was an \u201cunfair surprise\u201d and prejudiced him because he did not have adequate time to prepare for cross-examination, <em>Bailey, </em>\u00b6 11, and on appeal argued that the district court had abused its discretion in allowing the physician to testify without sufficient pretrial notice. <em>Bailey, </em>\u00b6 15. We concluded that because the Defendant knew that the State planned to call another physician who intended to testify to findings similar to the physician who was noticed four days before trial, and further, because the Defendant had four days to prepare for cross-examination, \u201cthe Defendant failed to establish the district court abused its discretion or that Defendant was thereby prejudiced.\u201d <em>Bailey, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">\u00b633 The situation here is virtually identical. Grindheim was put on notice approximately four months before trial that Turk may be called as a potential witness. As discussed further herein, Grindheim\u2019s counsel was also aware that Turk\u2019s testimony was identical to the testimony to be offered by a listed witness, S.S. Grindheim had five days before trial, following the State\u2019s formal notice, to prepare for Turk\u2019s cross-examination. In addition to these five days, the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Court offered to grant Grindheim a one-day continuance to further accommodate his preparation needs. The continuance, which was then declined by Grindheim\u2019s counsel, was offered as an accommodation for the State\u2019s tardy listing of a witness, but about whom Grindheim was already aware. Moreover, the District Court concluded there was no good cause to depart from the order of the trial<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because jury confusion could result from Dr. Ofshe testifying out of order and further, he could instead testify on the third day of trial, since both parties were required to have their witnesses available during all three scheduled days of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">\u00b634 In light of these facts and our holding in <em>Bailey, </em>we conclude that the District Court neither abused its discretion by allowing the State to add Turk as a witness, nor by denying Grindheim\u2019s request to call Dr. Ofshe out of order. Grindheim had actual prior notice of Turk, Turk\u2019s testimony was cumulative, and Grindheim had five days after formal notice to prepare for cross-examination. The one-day continuance was merely an additional accommodation, the loss of which did not prejudice the defense when it elected to proceed so that Dr. Ofshe could testify on the second day of trial. The District Court\u2019s finding that allowing Dr. Ofshe to testify out of order would cause jury confusion is not contested by Grindheim, and the District Court therefore properly denied that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\u00b635 Even if we were to conclude that the District Court abused its discretion, the error would not require reversal because it was harmless. Turk\u2019s testimony was cumulative, and had the effect of corroborating S.S.\u2019s testimony. Turk had overheard Grindheim tell S.S. that \u201cyour sister gives mean head\u201d at the party they all had attended, making her testimony about Grindheim\u2019s statement virtually identical to S.S.\u2019s. Grindheim\u2019s counsel admitted that Turk\u2019s testimony was not \u201cessential to the State\u2019s case [because]... she is simply a corroborating witness to something that S.S. is going to testify to ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">\u00b636 According to <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735, a \u201ctrial error is not presumptively prejudicial and is subject to review under the harmless error statute, \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA,\u201d which provides that a cause may not be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court against the convicted person unless the record shows that the error was prejudicial. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. The test for prejudicial error is \u201cwhether there is a reasonable possibility that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>the inadmissible evidence might have contributed to a conviction\u201d pursuant to the cumulative evidence standard, <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 42, which requires that the State direct the court to admissible evidence \u201cthat proved the same facts as the tainted evidence.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 44. The admission of Turk\u2019s testimony was cumulative because she was simply testifying about Grindheim\u2019s statement to S.S., about which S.S. also testified at trial. Therefore, no prejudice resulted from the testimony, and any error in allowing the testimony was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">\u00b637 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by denying Grindheim\u2019s request to instruct the jury on a lesser included offense of endangering the welfare of children?</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u00b638 Although Grindheim challenges the District Court\u2019s denial of his request for an instruction, he also challenges this Court\u2019s jurisprudence on this issue by claiming the test for lesser included offenses, as set forth in <em>State v. Beavers, </em>1999 MT 260, 296 Mont. 340, 987 P.2d 371, entirely abrogates the lesser-included offense doctrine in Montana. Grindheim argues that because all criminal statutes have different elements, it is impossible, under <em>Beavers, </em>for there to be a lesser-included offense. Grindheim argues the District Court, in applying the law, improperly focused on the \u201celements\u201d of the offense rather than comparing the \u201cfacts\u201d of each offense under \u00a7 46-1-202(9)(a), MCA, which provides that an \u201cincluded offense ... is established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged.\u201d Grindheim argues that, by comparing the elements, and not the facts, the District Court erred as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u00b639 The State argues that under \u00a7 46-l-202(9)(a), MCA, the statute defining lesser-included offenses, Grindheim must establish that the crime of endangering the welfare of children requires the same or less than all the elements required to establish the crime of sexual intercourse without consent. The State explains that the offense of \u201cendangering the welfare of children,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 45-5-622(2)(b)(ii), MCA requires proof of additional elements not included within the offense of sexual intercourse without consent, including that the defendant be at least eighteen years of age, and assisting or encouraging a child under the age of sixteen<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to engage in sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>conduct. The State asserts that because the elements of these offenses are different, endangering the welfare of children cannot be deemed a lesser-included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u00b640 As the State notes, this Court has previously considered the argument made by Grindheim herein and has concluded \u201cthat the term \u2018facts,\u2019 refers to the statutory elements of the offenses, not the individual facts of the case.\u201d <em>State v. Beavers, </em>\u00b6 30. We decline to reconsider that ruling. Thus, because the elements of endangering the welfare of children and sexual intercourse without consent are different, the former cannot be a lesser included offense because that offense requires proof of the aforementioned additional elements. Thus, the District Court did not err as a matter of law in analyzing the elements of the offenses. Additionally, because we conclude that the elements of the offenses at issue clearly differ, we decline to take up Grindheim\u2019s broad assertion that our holding in <em>Beavers </em>essentially eliminates lesser-included offenses in all instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b641  Even were we to accept Grindheim\u2019s assertion that the offense of endangerment of children was a lesser-included offense, the evidence in this trial would not have supported Grindheim\u2019s conviction of that offense, but rather, would instead have supported Grindheim\u2019s acquittal. Grindheim\u2019s evidence and theory was that some \u201cunknown person\u201d unzipped his sleeping bag and began \u201cmessing around\u201d with him in a sexual manner. After he realized what was going on, he asserted that he jumped off the couch, took his sleeping bag, and went out to sleep in the yard. Thus, Grindheim\u2019s evidence and theory does not offer proof of \u201cassisting, promoting or encouraging\u201d a child to engage in sexual conduct pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-622(2)(b)(ii), MCA. Therefore, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Grindheim\u2019s requested lesser-included offense instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"AGk\">\u00b642 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in excusing a juror after the case had been submitted to the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b643 Following submission of the case to the jury Juror Ann McMaster (McMaster) asked to meet with the District Court. McMaster told the District Court and the parties that she could not perform the duty of a juror, stating \u201cI can\u2019t do this. I shouldn\u2019t be here ... I don\u2019t-I have never done this before, and I am never going to do it again. I can\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t want any part of it.\u201d The District Court thereafter discharged McMaster and replaced her with an alternate juror, and Grindheim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>objected on the grounds of timeliness-that the law did not permit a juror\u2019s substitution after the case was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b644 Grindheim contends that McMaster, even though she became emotional during closing arguments, nonetheless indicated to the District Court that she could finish her job and did not want to be excused if it would cause a mistrial, and thus, the District Court erred in discharging her. Section 46-16-118, MCA, provides that \u201calternate jurors ... shall replace jurors who, prior to the time the jury arrives at its verdict become unable or disqualified to perform their duties.\u201d Grindheim claims that McMaster, by her own words, did not fit either of these categories and therefore the District Court abused its discretion in discharging her.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b645 The State responds by citing McMaster\u2019s testimony that she did not want to take part in the deliberations, that she was \u201cnot a strong emotional person\u201d and was \u201cfalling apart.\u201d Additionally, the State argues that McMaster was properly discharged under \u00a7 46-16-118(3), MCA, which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201calternate jurors, in the order in which they are called, shall replace jurors who, <em>prior to the time the jury arrives at its verdict, </em>become unable or disqualified to perform their duties.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">\u00b646 As the State correctly notes, the argument made by Grindheim on appeal is different than the basis for his objection in the District Court. There, he argued that the statute would not permit a substitution after the case was submitted to the jury-not that the juror\u2019s reasons were insufficient for her discharge. A party cannot change theories on appeal. <em>Unified Indus., Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, \u00b6 15, 961 P.2d 100, \u00b6 15. Therefore, we will not consider Grindheim\u2019s argument that there was insufficient reason to substitute McMaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u00b647  We have stated that, under \u00a7 46-16-118(3), MCA, \u201csubstitution of an alternate for an original juror who becomes ... unable to perform [jury] duties, is permitted at any time prior to the reaching of a verdict.\u201d <em>Pease, </em>222 Mont. at 470, 724 P.2d at 162. Thus, we conclude that McMaster was timely substituted, and the District Court did not abuse its discretion in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">\u00b648 Did the District Court err in imposing sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">\u00b649 Grindheim claims his sentence must be vacated and remanded for re-sentencing because the District Court erred by requiring that, after serving his six-month jail term, he complete 2,000 hours of community service andpayfines and restitution totaling approximately $6,496.60. Grindheim claims that the combination of these conditions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>unreasonable, impossible to perform, and act inappropriately as punishment instead of rehabilitation. Grindheim specifically argues that the 2,000 hours of community sendee is <em>per se </em>unreasonable because the alleged crime occurred against a single victim and not against the community itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">\u00b650 The State responds that Grindheim\u2019s sentence is legal because it falls within the statutory parameters of the offense and further asserts that the 2,000 hour community service order is proper under \u00a7 46-18-201(4)(j), MCA, which specifically provides that community service is a reasonable restriction that the sentencing court may impose when deferring imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">\u00b651 This Court has clearly held that a sentencing order must be reasonably related to the obj ectives of rehabilitation and the protection of the victim and society. <em>State v. Kroll, </em>2004 MT 203, \u00b6 29, 322 Mont. 294, \u00b6 29, 95 P.3d 717, \u00b6 29. For the order to be reasonably related to these objectives, there must be some connection or relationship between the underlying offense and the sentencing limitation imposed. <em>Kroll, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">\u00b652 In its Sentencing Order, the District Court found that the crime had resulted in a \u201ctear in this rural area\u2019s social fabric from [Grindheim\u2019s] misjudgment ... [i]n short, society has suffered harm here as well.\u201d The District Court concluded it was important that Grindheim demonstrate goodwill to the members of the community who had supported him by writing favorable letters to the court and therefore ordered Grindheim to perform continual service at a single facility. It also instructed Grindheim that \u201cthe community service officer\u201d would determine \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwithin whom\u201d Grindheim was to complete his community service.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\u00b653 Additionally, the District Court found that, while punishment was appropriate, rehabilitation was \u201chighly appropriate\u201d since Grindheim was a first time offender and enjoyed a reputation for \u201chard work, exceptional community diligence, and a general integrity of morals and standards.\u201d Because of these factors, the District Court decided it was more appropriate to impose county jail time and community service hours than incarceration in the state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u00b654  Pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201(l)(a)(ii), MCA, \u201ca sentencing judge may defer imposition of sentence ... not exceeding six years for a felony if a financial obligation is imposed as a condition of sentence.\u201d Section \u00a7 46-18-201(4), MCA, directs that a judge \u201cwhen deferring imposition of sentence ... may impose upon the offender any reasonable restrictions or conditions during the period of the deferred imposition.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>A list of restrictions defined as being \u201creasonable\u201d under \u00a7 46-18-201(4), MCA, include factors such as incarceration in a detention center, conditions for probation, payment of fines and costs, and community service. Because the imposition of the conditions and community service are within the parameters of the sentencing statute and are reasonably related to the circumstances of the offense, we conclude the District Court did not err in imposing sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">\u00b655 Grindheim also argues that the District Court\u2019s restitution order improperly required him to pay for \u201cundefined amounts\u201d of E.S.\u2019s future counseling costs, which runs afoul of this Court\u2019s holding in <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, 309 Mont. 1, 43 P.3d 318. In <em>Muhammad, </em>we vacated a sentencing order because the condition imposed by the trial court was not reasonably related to the goals of rehabilitation and was broader than necessary to protect the victim. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 28. However, <em>Muhammad </em>does not prohibit the imposition of costs reasonably incurred by a victim as a result of a crime. On this point, we held in <em>State v. Benoit, </em>2002 MT 166, 310 Mont. 449, 51 P.3d 495, that \u201cthe losses sustained from [the defendant\u2019s] admitted acts [] are recoverable, even though the actual losses may be uncertain.\u201d <em>Benoit, </em>\u00b6 29. We concluded that losses are recoverable when calculated by use of \u201creasonable methods based on the best evidence available under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Benoit, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"AVJ\">\u00b656  E.S.\u2019s therapist, Maggie Moffat, testified that E.S. may need counseling up into her mid-twenties. However, the District Court ordered Grindheim to pay future counseling costs only for the six-year period of his deferment. Because the District Court heard extensive testimony regarding E.S.\u2019s long-term counseling needs and Grindheim did not offer evidence that contradicted the testimony, we conclude that the restitution calculations were reasonable and that the District Court did not err in imposing restitution for E.S.\u2019s future counseling needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u00b657 Finally, Grindheim argues that the District Court\u2019s requirements regarding payment of restitution are inconsistent. However, Grindheim fails to set forth exactly how such payments are inconsistent. We have held that we will decline to address an issue when the appellant fails to cite supporting authority. <em>State v. Ellenburg, </em>2000 MT 232, \u00b6 49, 301 Mont. 289, \u00b6 49, 8 P.3d 801, \u00b6 49.
